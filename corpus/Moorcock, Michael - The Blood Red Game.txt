the blood red game by michael moorcock prologue renark was a wanderer in the galaxy for two years but he was not lonely renark could never be lonely for the galaxy was his omnipresent friend and he was aware of its movements even the peculiar control exercised on it by forces which he could not sense was as comforting as its presence he moved about in it and contained awareness of every atom of it in his long thinboned skull he wandered purposely through the teeming galaxy for two swift years and then when ready journeyed out towards the rim one the three of them met at last in a terrible town called migaa on the harsh bright edge of a wilderness both town and planet were called migaa and it was the last chance planet for the galaxys fugitives renark disembarked from his cruiser uncomfortable under the glare of the diamondbright sun he threaded his way through the great looming shapes of a hundred other ships his mind searching the town ahead for his two friends his skilled brain probed the shapes of streets and buildings people and objects until at last he had located them half a mile away on the other side of the town he strode briskly from the spaceport and there were no customs officers to stop him here he kept his friends forms firmly fixed in his mind as he hurried in their direction they were agitated and he guessed they might be in trouble people stared at him as he passed a very tall very gaunt man with deepset black eyes in a long skull a brooding face in repose but they didnt stare at his face they thought him remarkable mainly because he wore no apparent weapon almost all the men and women who came to migaa came hurriedly but they also came armed only renark walked purposefully along the metalpaved streets through the glinting steel buildings the others moved aimlessly wearing dark lenses to ward off the glare of the desert reflected in the steel and chrome of the buildings he noted little transport on the streets and what there was moved lazily he thought the town had an exhausted air yet at the same time it possessed an atmosphere of expectancy it was a peculiar mood and it smothered migaa he noted also a shared quality in the faces of the men and women a set expression which tried vainly to disguise the hope lurking in their eyes they seemed afraid of hoping yet evidently could do nothing else migaa or what migaa offered was their last chance it was renarks too but for other less selfish reasons when he reached the building where he sensed his two friends were it wasnt the tavern hed expected this was called the drift inn like hundreds of other taverns throughout the galaxy but this ones name had a special significance he walked in to find tumult a fight was going on he recognised several who could be either thieves or spacehands judging by the white metalstudded plastileather overalls they wore they were thick brutal shouting men and they were attacking two others not of their kind renark recognised the pah paul talfryn and young asquiol of pompeii their backs against the far wall of the noisy overcrowded public room for a moment he felt the urge to leave them to it confident that they would survive but then he decided to help them he wanted them to be as fit as possible for the forthcoming journey as he moved forward a spacehand using the whole of his metalstudded body as a weapon launched himself at renark the spacehand had obviously learned his fighting techniques aboard ship or on a lowgravity planet migaa wasnt a lowgrav world and the mans method of charging in an attempt to buffet renark against the far wall didnt work renark skipped aside and the hand blundered past renark kicked against the base of the mans spine with a pointed boot the spacehand collapsed backwards and renark kicked nun sharply in the head knocking him out swiftly renark pushed towards his friends talfryn looked almost panicstricken as he warded off the blows of his attackers but asquiol flamboyant grinning and vicious was enjoying himself a set of knucklespikes gleamed on his right fist and there was blood on them one of asquiols opponents blundered back into renark clutching at a bleeding eyesocket were wasting time renark shouted as the others saw him he moved into the crowd pulling the tumbling spacemen aside with his large ugly hands together talfryn and asquiol punched their way towards him a growling giant swung a pocketmace at asquiol who ducked crouched then shot out his spikecovered fist deep into the spacehands belly the giant shrieked and the mace dropped from his hand as he fell to his knees the trio burst from the tavern and ran up a narrow side street until they saw the spacehands abandon the chase shouting catcalls from behind them they turned into an alley running between the backs of the buildings their boots ringing on the metal which way to the salvation inn renark said thanks for breaking that up asquiol grinned i thought you guide sensers could tell where anything was its this way not far renark didnt bother to use his space sensing ability the image of what he had done to the spacehand was still sharp in his mind he didnt like violence asquiol led them back on to a main way as they walked talfryn turned to renark his expression embarrassed sorry about that he said those hands were looking for trouble they picked on asquiol because of his clothes we had to fight we managed to avoid a dozen others but couldnt get out of this one the whole damned towns the same tense nervous impatient im afraid i encouraged them asquiol said really one cant have ones dress insulted by such a vulgar breed he collapsed his knucklespikes and put them away lonely and timebegrimed for all his youth asquiol dressed with careful flamboyance he wore a highcollared quilted jacket of orange nyfur and tight slacks of purple stuff which fitted over his pointed fibreglass boots his face was pale and tapering his black hair cut short in a fringe over his forehead he carried a slender antineutron beamer an outlawed weapon asquiol had once been a prince independent overlord of pompeii before the galactic lords enforced their powers and brought the planet into the union renark remembered that asquiol had lost his title and estates for protecting him and he was grateful he noticed that the younger man had lapsed into a brooding mood it was his usual reaction and because of it many people thought him unbalanced though renark knew that asquiol was the very opposite his was a fine delicate balance which only his will maintained talfryn leanfaced like his two friends sensitive and bearded was an unlicensed explorer and therefore a criminal he was dressed conservatively sleeveless jerkin of unstained hide blue shirt and black trousers he carried a heavy powergun he looked curiously at renark but since he said nothing renark remained silent then he smiled his thin grim lips quirked upwards and he straightened his back turning his long head and looking hard at talfryn talfryn seemed disturbed by the look and felt obliged to speak so he said when do we leave im impatient to get started renark did not respond for a moment and just kept looking talfryn said i cant wait im not sure yet renark said as they reached the tall manywindowed structure of the salvation inn on the edge of town talfryn said to renark you told us we were wasting time back there how much time have we roughly maximum thirtysix hours the guide senser replied asquiol looked up startled out of his mood he seemed troubled is that all thats all probably less i can feel it coming closer to this continuum all the time but its difficult to keep a fix on it always it takes most of my energy they entered the wide highroofed public hall of the salvation inn asquiol looked around him seeking someone in the crowd but was disappointed the huge windows which stretched up one high wall lighted several tiered galleries and looked out on to the bright black and white carbon desert of the planet they pushed through the crowd of men and women of many types there were richly clad men ragged men men who drank heavily and men who sipped at a single drink vociferous men and quiet men here as in the rest of the town there was an air of tired tense expectancy an atmosphere which had lasted this era for thirtyseven years all the residents glanced often at the big scanner screens suspended in the middle of the hall the screens would come to life only on particular occasions when what they awaited entered the area of space on which they were always focused when that happened if it happened there would be a rush for the spaceport and migaa would be deserted again some people had been waiting in migaa for over thirty years others had died before their chance came the three climbed a narrow winding stair until they reached a gallery occupied by a table and three chairs they sat down i had this reserved asquiol said as he craned his neck to look down into the public hall renark looked at him quizzically im having the ship checked and rechecked he said its got to be ready very soon the snifter could materialise well before the maximum thirtysix hours i mentioned though it shouldnt be here for another twelve hours judging by the rate its been moving towards us since i contacted it twenty days ago renark paused staring out across the terrible desert screwing his eyes against the glare which penetrated even the polaroid windows weve got to be ready he said i cant tell how long it will remain in this continuum theres also the possibility that it will go through the continuum at speed and we wont have a chance to get there before it travels on so we could have come to migaa for nothing talfryn shrugged well my tunes my own mine isnt renark said but he didnt expand on that remark he was the only man in the entire galaxy capable of knowing when the shifter system would materialise others who came to migaa took the chance that the bizarre continuumtravelling system would appear in the spacetime during their own life but it was a gamble this was the only reason migaa existed built on the nearest halfway habitable planet to where the shifter would materialise so the outlawed and the damned the searching and the hunted came to migaa when there was nowhere else to go and they waited renark knew he did not need to wait for he was a guide senser with a peculiar instinct developed to the level of a science he could locate given only the vaguest direction and description anything in the galaxy whether it was a planet or a lost penny needing no maps or coordinates he could lead a person anywhere they wanted to go he was a human directionfinder and because of this he knew the shifter was coming closer for he had trained himself to see past his own space and out into other dimensions lying beyond where there seemed to be hazy ghosts of planets and suns almost but not quite like his own he had trained himself to see them to prove a theory concerning the nature of the weird shifter system which had been known to materialise just suddenly appear in space and then vanish again without trace only five times since mankind had reached the rim little else was generally known about it the few explorers and scientists who had managed to reach the shifter before it vanished again had not returned it was impossible to say how long it would stay at any one time the mystery system seemed to have a wildly erratic orbit and renarks theory that it moved on a course different from the rest of the universe a kind of sideways movement had been postulated years before when as warden of the rim worlds he had been given the responsibility of sensing it as he sensed the world and suns within his own continuum the time of the shifters stay varied between a few hours and a few days it was never certain when it would appear or disappear the desperate men who came to migaa were optimists hoping against hope that they would have the luck to be there when the shifter arrived though the shifter received its title from renarks own theory it had several other names ghost system was a popular one and certain religiousminded people ascribed some more dramatic significance to the system declaiming that it had been cast from the universe for some sin its inhabitants had committed these fanatics also had a name for the system the sundered worlds and so a whole framework of myth had developed around the system but very few dared investigate it for fear of being stranded for the most part only criminals were willing to take the risk renark stared down at the seething public hall the galactic unions government machinery was near perfect its institutions difficult to abuse this meant they could allow a greater degree of personal freedom for their citizens but because the government worked so well criminals were hard put to escape the unions laws migaa was their only hope from migaa they had the chance of escaping right out of the universe unless the galactic police the geepees made one of their sudden swoops on the town for the most part the geepees were content to leave well alone but sometimes they hunted a criminal when he possessed some particular item or piece of information which they wanted then if he eluded them long enough they would come to migaa looking for him renark knew the geelords sought him that lord mordan captain in chief of the galactic police had his men scouring the galaxy for him he wondered how long it would be before mordan thought of migaa asquiol put his head in his hands and stared at renark isnt it time we had your reasons for this trip renark he turned his head and searched among the crowd below what made you quit your position as rim warden why wouldnt you tell the geelords what you learned from that strange spaceship which landed on golund three years ago and why the passion to visit the shifter i dont want to answer yet renark told him in fairness i should but if i did it would give rise to further questions i cant possibly answer yet all i can tell you right now is what youve guessed ive been waiting three years to get to the shifter ever since i learned something of great importance from the crew of that spaceship on golund what they told me indirectly caused me to resign as warden as for the answers i dont have i hope the shifter will give me them were your friends renark talryn said and were willing to go with you for that reason alone but if you dont find the answers you want out there will you answer the original questions therell be nothing to lose if i do renark agreed but if you decide you dont want to come then say so now its dangerous we know that much we might perish before we even reach the shifter and once there we may never be able to return both men moved uncomfortably but said nothing renark continued i owe you both debts of friendship you paul helped me in my research on variable time flows and were responsible for finally crystallizing my theory asquiol saved me from the attentions of that police patrol on pompeii sheltered me for six months and when the geelords found out was forced under the terms of his agreement to give up his birthright you have both made big sacrifices on my behalf im curious enough anyway to explore the ghost system smiled talfryn and asquiol has nothing to keep him here unless its his newfound attraction for willow kovacs willow owned the salvation inn she was reputed to be beautiful asquiol appeared displeased but he only shrugged and smiled faintly youre right talfryn if tactless but dont worry ill still go when the time comes good said renark a woman came up the narrow stair leading to the gallery she moved in full knowledge of her slim beauty and her lips were curved in a soft smile she was wearing the spoils of her conquests her emeraldcoloured dress was covered with jewels mined on a thousand planets they flashed brightly challenging the very brilliance of the desert her hands heavy with rings held a tray of hot food as she reached the table asquiol looked up at her and took the tray making sure he touched her hands as he did so thanks she said and hello you must be the famous warden renark exwarden he said and youre the young woman who has so disturbed our proud friend here she didnt reply to that eat well gentlemen she said then returned down the staircase well meet later asquiol she called over her shoulder as she made her way across the crowded floor of the great tavern renark felt slightly troubled by this new intrusion he hadnt been prepared for it although his loyalty to both his friends was great he wanted asquiol on the trip much more than he wanted talfryn asquiol was young reckless inclined to vindictive acts of cruelty at times he was arrogant and selfish and yet he had a core of integrated strength which was hard to equate with his outward appearance but a woman a woman could either complement that strength or destroy it and renark wasnt sure about willow kovacs philosophically and for the moment renark accepted the situation and turned his mind to the problem in hand i think we should give the ship another check he suggested when they had eaten shall we go out to the pads now talfryn agreed but asquiol said ill stay here ill either join you out there or see you when you return how long will you be ive no idea renark said rising but stay here so that we can contact you if necessary asquiol nodded dont worry i wasnt thinking of leaving the inn renark restrained an urge to tell asquiol to be wary but the guide senser respected his friend it was up to the prince of pompeii to conduct his own affairs without advice renark and talfryn walked down the stairs pushed their way through the throng and made for the door outside there was a buzz of excited conversation the two men caught some of it as they walked along the metalpaved streets it seems theres a rumour that the geepees are on their way in talfryn said worriedly renarks face was grim lets hope they dont get here before the shifter talfryn glanced at him are they after you theyve been after me for three years oh its not for any crime but the geelords came to the conclusion that i might know something of use to them and have been trying to get hold of me and do you know something of use to them i know something renark nodded but its in their interest and mine that they dont find out about it thats part of your secret tart of the secret renark agreed dont worry if we reach the shifter ill let you know it for better or worse he let his mind reach out into the void beyond the rim it was out there coming closer he could sense it his mind trembled he felt physically sick it was so wrong wrong implacably the impossible system was shifting in would it stay long enough for them to get to it and could they reach it if only he knew a little more about it it was a big gamble he was taking and there was just a shin chance of it paying off only he knew what was at stake that knowledge was a burden he had had to strengthen himself to bear most men could not have done so as he walked along glancing at the wretches who had so hopefully come to migaa he wondered if it was worth the attempt after all but he shrugged to himself you had to accept that it was worth it he told himself there were none there who might have been properly described as extraterrestrials one of the discoveries man had made when settling the galaxy was that he represented the only highlydeveloped intelligent lifeform there were other types of animal life but earth throughout the galaxy had been the only planet to bear a beast that could reason and invent this was an accepted thing amongst most people but philosophers still wondered and marvelled and there were many theories to explain the fact two years previously renark had suddenly resigned from his position as warden of the rim worlds it had been an important position and his resignation had given rise to speculation and gossip the visit of an alien spaceship supposedly an intergalactic craft had not been admitted by the galactic lords when pressed for information they had replied ambiguously only renark had seen the aliens spent much time with them he had given no explanation to the geelords and even now they still sought him out trying to persuade him to take over a job which he had done responsibly and imaginatively spacesensers were rare rarer even than other psitalents and a guide senser of renarks stature was that much rarer there were only a few gs men in the entire galaxy and their talents were in demand for the most part they acted as pilots and guides on difficult runs through hyperspace keeping as it were an anchor to the mainland and giving ships exact directions how where and when to enter normal space they were also employed on mapping the galaxy and any changes which occurred in it they were invaluable to a complicated galaxytravelling civilisation so the geelords had begged renark to remain warden of the rim even if he would not tell them who the visitors to golund had been but he had refused and two years had been spent in collecting a special knowledge of what little information was known about the shifter in the end they had resorted to sending the geepees after him but with the help of talfryn and asquiol he had so far evaded them he prayed they wouldnt come to migaa before the shifter materialised renark had fitted his ship with the best equipment and instruments available this equipment in his eyes included the dynamic if erratic asquiol and the easygoing paul talfryn both had helped him in the past because they admired him he in turn responded to the sense of loyalty for them that he felt and knew he could work best with these two men several hundred ships were clustered in the spaceport many had been there for years but all of them were kept in constant readiness for the time when the shifter might be sighted certain ships had been there for a century or more their original owners having died disappointed and frustrated never having achieved their goal renarks great spacer was a converted police cruiser which he had bought cheaply and illegally rebuilt and reequipped it could be ready for takeoff in half a minute it was also heavily armed it was against the law to own a police ship and also to own an armed private vessel the union owned and leased all commercial craft the spacer required no crew it was fully automatic and had room for thirty passengers already since landing renark had been pestered by people offering huge sums to guarantee them passage to the shifter but he had refused renark had little sympathy for most of those who gathered in migaa they would have received more mercy from the enlightened legal code of which the union was justly proud than from renark of the rim although migaa itself was thick with criminals of all kinds there were few in relation to the huge human population of the galaxy for nearly two centuries the galaxy had been completely at peace although the price of peace had in the past been a rigid and authoritarian rule which had in the last century thawed into the liberal government which now had been elected to serve the galaxy renark had no hatred for the union which pestered him he had served it loyally until he had acquired that certain knowledge which he had withheld from the galactic lords they had asked many times for the information he possessed but he had refused and he was cautious also never to let his whereabouts be known he glanced up into the blazing white sky as if expecting to see a geese patrol falling down upon them slowly the two men walked across the pad towards the cruiser mechanics were at work on renarks ship they had long since completed their initial check and found the ship completely spaceworthy but renark had not been satisfied now they checked again renark and talfryn entered the elevator and it took them into the centre of the ship to the control cabin talfryn looked admiringly around the wellequipped cabin he had the scientists eye that could appreciate the ingenuity the skill the energy the pure passion which had gone into its construction once a year before renark had said in a talkative moment take note of these instruments talfryn they represent mans salvation they represent the power of the mind to supersede the limitations of its environment the power of every individual man to control for the first time his own destiny renark hadnt been referring to his own particular instruments and talfryn knew that now talfryn thought the mystique attached to science had made it at once a monster and a salvation people believed it capable of anything because they had no idea any more what it was and they tended to think the worst of it more men like renark were needed men who could not take the simple workings of a turbine for granted yet at the same time could take the whole realm of science for granted just then another thought occurred to talfryn a thought more immediately applicable to their present situation he said how do we know that our drive or any of our other instruments will work in the shifter renark he paused looking around him at the tall heaped banks of instruments if as you think might be possible different laws of space and time apply then we may find ourselves completely stranded in the shifters area of space cut adrift without control over the ship i admit we dont know whether our instruments will work out there renark agreed but im prepared to risk the fact that we may share certain laws with the shifter maybe ill be able to tell when its closer but my judgment wont be infallible as a space senser renark needed no equipment to heighten his powers but he did need to concentrate and he therefore used an energycharger a machine which replaced natural nervous and mental energy as it was expended and could if used wisely give a man an extra boost if he needed it especially it was equipment normally only issued to hospitals now as talfryn studied the recordings which had been made of the shifter and became increasingly puzzled renark got into a comfortably padded chair and attached electrodes to his forehead his chest and other parts of his body he held a stylus and a plastic writing block on the small ledge in front of him calmly he switched on the machine two renark concentrated he could feel the presence of the galaxy spreading inwards from his own point in space layer upon layer of it time upon time he was aware of the galaxy as a whole and at the same time felt the presence of each individual atom in its structure each atom each planet each star nova and nebula thorough space where matter was of minimum density little cores of denser matter moved spaceships faintly beyond the limits of his own galaxy he sensed the lesser density of intergalactic space and beyond that he picked up faraway impressions of other galaxies there was nothing unpleasant happening out there something he already knew about something he was pledged to alter then he adjusted his mind so that instead of sensing the components of the galaxy he sensed it as a whole he widened his reception to take in a small area beyond the galaxy and immediately the entire structure of time and space as he knew it was flawed there was something there that was alien something that did not fit it was as if a body had moved through that small area and had torn a hole in the very fabric of the universe his mind and body trembled as he sought to adjust as previously to his new unnatural factor it was a binary star with eleven planets equidistantly encircling it it did not exist not in relation to the universe renark knew he could make no close assessment of its components as yet it was wrong renark controlled his mind against the thought and concentrated on judging the systems progress it was in relation to itself travelling through space in the same manner as ordinary stars and planets travelled but it also travelled through a series of dimensions of which renark had no experience whatsoever and its course its orbits through the dimensions was bringing it closer to renarks own continuum he opened his eyes gasping quickly he jotted down an equation closed his eyes and readjusted his mind it continued towards them it shifted through myriad alien dimensions moving through a whole series of continua progressing imperturbably onwards in an orbit as constant as the orbits of its planets about its stars soon now it would be passing through renarks continua but how long would it stay there renark could not tell without knowing a little of the universes which lay beyond his own and of these he had much to find out his future plans depended on it in less than twenty minutes renark was finished he looked over talfryns shoulder at the records shes coming closer he said between twelve to fifteen hours and shell be here thats if my calculations are right i think they are as far as i can tell shes travelling at a regular rate i cant explain why the periods spent in this continuum have varied so much though if her speed is as constant as it seems to be well youve narrowed it anyway talfryns body seemed to tense yes renark moved about the control room reading gauges and youre certain it wont miss this spacetime altogether thats possible but unlikely renark stared at a bank of gauges for a moment and then he moved towards a chrome and velvet chair which had a whole bank of levers and switches in front of it a laserscreen above it this was the gunnery control panel again he began to move uneasily about the great cabin again he volunteered a suggestion we dont know all the directions in which our own universe moves he said it may also for all we know have a sideways movement through the dimensions at an angle different from the shifter this would explain to some extent any inconsistency in the length of time the system stays in our spacetime continuum talfryn shook his head ive never been able to grasp any of those theories about the system i dont even understand your ability to sense its approach i know that with training space sensers can locate planets and even smaller bodies in normal spacetime but i wasnt aware that they could sense things outside beyond in different dimensions wherever it is normally they cant renark said but many who have probed the perimeter of space outside the galaxy have mentioned that they have sensed something else something not in keeping with any recognised natural laws others have had the illusion of sensing suns and worlds within the galaxy where suns and worlds just cant be this has given rise to the theory of the multiverse the multidimensional universe containing dozens of different universes separated from each other by unknown dimensions he paused how could he explain in calm logical words the sense of apartness of alienness he had received how could he describe that shock that experience which contradicted all he accepted with every sense he possessed something that struck at the id the ego the emotions everything he opened his mouth trying to find words but the words did not exist the nearest way of expressing what he felt was to give vent to a shout of horror agony triumph he didnt feel inclined to try so he shut his mouth and continued to pace the cabin running his ugly hand over the firing arm of the big antineutron gun which had never been used it was a savage weapon and he hoped there would never be need to use it nuclear weapons of any sort made him uncomfortable his strange sixth sense was as aware of the disruption of atoms as it was of their presence in natural state it was an experience close to agony to sense the disruptive blast of atomic weapons the antineutron cannon beaming particles of antimatter was an even more terrible experience for him once as a child he had been close to the area of a multimegaton bomb explosion and his whole mind had blanked out under the strain of the experience it had taken doctors a year to pull him back to sanity now he was stronger better coordinated but it was still not pleasant to be in a space flight also he loathed violence considering it was the easy way out and like many easy ways out not a way out at all but only continuation of a vicious circle so whenever possible he avoided it however he was prepared in this case to use it if it meant using it against anything in the shifter which attempted to stop him in his avowed objective renark had geared himself to drive towards one aim and one only already he was driving towards it and nothing nobody would stop him he was dedicated he was fanatical but he was going to get results if that was possible if it wasnt possible then hed die trying to make it possible soon now very soon the shifter would enter their area of space he was going there the shifter offered the only chance in the universe of supplying him with the information he needed he glanced back at talfryn who was still studying the records any clearer he asked talfryn shook his head and grinned i can just understand how the shifter orbits through dimensions hitherto unknown to us in the same way as we orbit through time and space but the implications are too big for me im bewildered im no physicist neither am i renark pointed out if i were i might not be so affected by the shifter for instance theres something peculiar about any system comprised of a gtype binary star and eleven planets all equidistant from it something almost artificial if it is artificial how did it happen maybe its the other way about talfryn suggested vaguely maybe the planets all being the same distance away from the parent suns has something to do with the peculiar nature of the system if they area natural freak could this have caused the shifters orbit renark nodded he thought for a moment before he said if you take for granted that time is cyclic in accordance with the other known laws of the universe although as you well know my own experiments seem to prove that there is more than one particular time flow operating in our own universe if you take that for granted however we can describe the rest by means of circles he walked to the chair where he had left his stylus and pad picked them up and moved over the chart table the shifter orbits this way he drew a circle whereas we progress this way he drew a halfcircle cutting horizontally through the first circle imagine that we have a finite number of spacetime continua each with some mutually shared laws he drew a number of other halfcircles below and above the first theyre all like us travelling this way there is no contact between us but we exist side by side without being aware of each others presence all revolving in different sets of dimensions talfryn nodded imagine that the normal continua as we understand the word normal are orbiting horizontally as it were then imagine that the shifter is orbiting vertically therefore instead of going its way without ever touching other alternate universes its course takes it through them but wouldnt it take millions of years to complete a cycle like that not necessarily we know it doesnt because we cant use temporal and spatial values and apply them to something as different as the shifter it has rules of its own which seem erratic to us but are probably as ordered in relation to itself as ours are to us youve got to take quite a bit for granted talfryn sighed our scientists have been doing extensive research into the multiverse theory theyre pretty convinced life and the universe said talfryn seating himself in a chair are getting too complicated renark laughed shortly one things clear talfryn there are going to be a lot of mysteries solved and a lot of new ones started when we reach the shifter no one has ever returned from it he glanced up suddenly a light was blinking on the control panel thats the intercom he said might be asquiol or one of the engineers could you deal with it paul talfryn walked over and picked up the instrument he flipped a switch but no picture appeared on the screen he listened briefly and then turned back to regard renark asquiols here and hes brought that girl with him what renark for a moment lost his equilibrium why thats the other thing thats why they came here so fast the geepees have arrived theyre looking for you renark pursed his lips he should have been ready for a police raid but he had been so busy explaining the shifter to talfryn that he hadnt been on the look out for them asquiol and willow kovacs stepped out of the elevator asquiol said nervously sorry about this renark but these are my terms renark shrugged terms he leant over the control panel adjusting dials whats happening out there the geepees are scouring migaa asking if youre there i got out as fast as i could theyd be likely to recognise me and connect me with you good youre willing to have willow along on the trip youve told her the risks yes renark sighed i thought this might happen knowing you but i want you with us and even if shes included in your conditions im willing to concede to them renark forced away his irritation there was no room for petty emotions in his plans only he knew what hung on his reaching the shifter and discovering its nature and its cause matters of personalities could not be considered action not argument was required of him now he had to pray that the geepees wouldnt discover him before the shifter materialised theyd have to sit tight and wait it out with any luck the geepees wouldnt make a search of the ships on the pads until after they had scoured the town renark beamed a message to the engineers telling them to clear away their equipment and leave the ship in readiness for takeoff then he sat in his chair and waited an hour passed willow seemed uncomfortable sitting there in her immaculate sheath dress listening to the men talking and going over the equations renark had made the records of the shifter theories which had been put forward renark said rumour has it that this planet has a large human colony i think we should head for that number eight by my reckoning you can see ive marked it he glanced at willow who appeared pensive not used to being ignored evidently she moved nervously on her seat looking about her disinterestedly normally there seemed to be nothing that could break her usual selfcontained attitude an attitude that had been necessary in a town like migaa but here for the first time she was in the company of men even more selfcontained than she was and it obviously disquieted her at last asquiol saw her discomfort and said half apologetically anything troubling you she smiled without amusement obviously piqued a womans place is in the galley she said where is it if she had intended to throw asquiol off balance she had not succeeded you might as well he said i guess ill be quite busy from now on i expect well want something to eat soon he pointed to a door then bent again over the charts shrugging she left the control room willow had always been curious about the ghost system living as she had in its shadow all her life but she had never seen it for some reason it had allowed her to dominate all the many men in her life for they had seemed to have a hunger which she could not satisfy though they had sought in her that satisfaction and had therefore put themselves in her power thinking she had a secret she did not in fact possess now she was going to the shifter on asquiols instigation she was glad these men all three offered her something she was unused to a strength of character perhaps that she had never found in all the others who had come to migaa renark talfryn and particularly asquiol offered her calm controlled strength a peculiar mixture of detachment and passion she busied herself preparing the food finding a wellstocked larder for renark enjoyed food talfryn looked up from the charts glanced at the scanner screen he swore and moved towards the controls somethings gone wrong with the laser ill try and dont touch those controls renarks brain seemed to swell within his skull excitement pulsing through him his body pounding he paused for a second frowned controlled himself and then said calmly its coming talfryn he sent his mind out probing he felt the sudden presence of the alien system grow as it merged into his own spacetime a whole system plunging towards them out of the hazy twilight of the universe rupturing time and space on its rogue orbit elation flooded through him as he ran towards the laser screen the other two stood close behind him he watched as visible lines of energy swept across the area of space where his calculations indicated the shifter would appear space seemed to peel back on itself as great blossoming splashes of colour poured through as if from the broken sides of a vat merging with the darkness of space and making it iridescent so that sections shone like brass and others like silver gold or rubies the whole thing changing changing constantly erupting flickering vanishing reappearing then faintly at first as if through rolling multicoloured clouds the shifter itself began to materialise growing clearer and clearer coming into sharper focus and then it was hanging there as solid as anything else in the universe the clouds which had heralded its approach fading away a new system had joined the galaxy but for how long renark wondered would the eleven planets hang equidistant around the blazing blue binary star he rushed back to the control panel pressed a single stud activating the ships automatic circuits the ship lifted it shrieked away from the spaceport away from the geepee vessels and within minutes was in deep space straining towards the shifter moving to a singleminded prearranged pattern renark acted like a zombie his eyes fixed on the weird system ahead his body one with the streaking ship which leapt the space between the edge of the galaxy and the mystery worlds willow came out startled saw the screen and began to tremble asquiol looked at her but she glanced away and hurried back to the galley renark seated himself in the control chair his arms outstretched over the complicated control board checking every slight tendency for the ship to veer away from the shifter at this distance the planets seemed apart from their ordered positions around the suns to be no different from any other system in the galaxy yet they glowed like carefully set diamonds around the sapphire suns the ship sped closer and renark could observe the rotation of the planets around the twin star they seemed to be moving very slowly yet the closer they came the faster the planets seemed to move the other two had taken their places the ships drive buried in the core of the ship could be heard now humming with the strain renark shouted talfryn keep all communication equipment on receive asquiol dont use those guns at random wait until i order you to if its necessary he turned in his seat for a moment stared at asquiol and dont on any account use the antineutron cannon asquiol grimaced talfryn flipped switches willow reappeared bewildered by the suddenness of events she was frustrated wanting something to do the men worked with concentration and efficiency to their prearranged plan again asquiol was oblivious of her presence the planets came closer there was something peculiar about several of them particularly one at nadirsoutheast of the binary as the shifter got larger on the screen the communications panel began to squeal and moan were picking up its static anyway talfryn commented they must be panicking on migaa asquiol grinned the quicker we move the less chance weve got of getting caught up with the mob when they come out theyll be fighting the geepees right now renark said they wont even let a fleet of battlewagons stop them reaching the shifter after waiting so long thatll delay both sides for a while asquiol said lets hope the delay will be a long one renark stared at his screen whats ahead of us to starboard talfryn looks like a small fleet of some sort talfryn moved dials youre right spaceships of a kind i dont recognise wed better head for the nearest planet and try to escape them the way theyre coming up they dont look friendly the twin star was very close and bright now blacking out the planets on renarks laser screen asquiol broke the energy seals on the guns with the key renark handed him about ten of the weird ships came jolting closer the metal of their hulls giving off a peculiar yellowish glint they pulsed through space and there was something menacing in their approach then they veered away describing a long curve and began to circle the area through which renarks cruiser would have to pass then with a jerk which seemed to tug at their nerves and muscles and threaten to turn their bodies inside out they entered alien space they were in the shifters territory now that was why the other ships had come no further but awaited them their senses blanked momentarily they felt dizzy sick renark feeling his senses going sent out a desperate tendril of mental energy anchoring himself to the shifter ahead also he felt the presence of the darting alien ships the metal of their construction was unfamiliar to him then suddenly his whole mind seemed to explode as the fabric of space was ripped apart he gasped with the agony forced his eyes open he looked at the screen and the planets no longer whirling so rapidly around the binary were moving at a more leisurely pace an inhuman growl rumbled through the control room talfryn worked the receiver trying to pick up a picture but couldnt the growl came again but the language was unrecognisable the leading vessel of the yellow fleet moved it seemed to turn over on itself described a couple of somersaults and then sent a coiling blast of energy before the humans ship renark blocked his mind and tensed his body screens he yelled but asquiol had already raised them the ship shuddered and the screens proved effective against the alien weapons but only just asquiol aimed the energyladen guns on the leading ship the antineutron cannon would dispose of them quickly enough he said wistfully and probably the system as well talfryn added as asquiols rapid shots bit into the alien ship and it exploded to form almost immediately nothing more than a ball of ragged metal now the other ships came on in formation but asquiol bent over his guns and grimly pressed his fingers down on all studs the ship took the enemy retaliation but shuddered horribly his own fire damaged two which then spiralled away from their comrades then the whole fleet sailed up in the strange somersaulting motion and fired together we cant take this attack talfryn screamed asquiols eyes were intent on the enemy craft he sent another great blast of energy slamming through space as the force of the joint attack hit the cruiser the ship shook shuddered groaned and came to a dead stop lazily it began to spiral through space while more of the alien ships came flooding up from the nearest planet asquiol did what he could to stop them but with the ship out of control it was difficult to aim renark was fighting the controls we took it he shouted but its thrown our circuits crazy talfryn get down there and see what you can do with the master coordinator talfryn scuttled from his seat and entered the elevator dragging a space suit with him asquiol eyes narrowed aimed his guns carefully cursing he cut down several more but these ships didnt seem to care whether they were destroyed or not momentarily asquiol wondered if they had living crews aboard something was wrong with the quality of the void it did not have its normal sharpness rivers of colour very faint seemed to run through and shapes seemed to move just beyond the limit of his vision it was tantalising it was maddening willow pale and tense clung to a bulkhead her eyes fixed on the big laser screen space was alive with boiling energy it swirled and coiled and lashed through the disturbed vacuum to her it was as if the binary had suddenly gone nova for she could not see through the multicoloured patterns of force which obscured everything but the yellow darting shapes of the enemy ships slowly the patterns faded but the alien vessels came on renark realised that the hideous nature of the void was not created by the force released in the battle it was something else something much more ominous asquiol kept up a rapid continuous fire the screens took the brunt of the energy but suddenly the ship was agonisingly hot renark spoke into his mike talfryn are you down there now talfryns worried voice groaned back to him im doing what i can with any luck i should have fixed up most of the masters in five minutes do it sooner renark ordered or youll be dead what were these aliens why were they so savagely attacking a ship when they hadnt even bothered to discover whether it was friend or enemy they came on with implacable ferocity asquiols lean face ran with sweat willow was on the floor now her eyes wide still fixed on the screens get into a suit willow he shouted get into a suit she staggered up and walked unsteadily towards the locker from which she had seen talfryn take a suit slowly she opened it hissing with pain as the metal burned her hand struggled to release a suit and clamber into it its fabric automatically adjusting to the shape of her body renark pulled on heavy gauntlets the controls were now too hot for him to manipulate with bare hands again and again the alien craft somersaulted and sent charges of energy towards the ship asquiol felt his skin blister as he returned the fire and had the satisfaction of seeing another three alien ships collapse into scrap then renark felt the ship responding again to the controls talfryn had fixed the master coordinator he sent the ship veering away from the alien vessels talfryn came rushing from the elevator tearing off his helmet he flung himself into his seat christ he shouted more of them another fleet larger than the one that had already attacked them was coursing in to join the fight as it got nearer talfryn noticed that the ships were not of the same design as the first fleet in fact not one of these ships was of identical design the weirdly assorted fleet fanned out to engage not their ship but the enemy fleet pale rays landed out and twined around the enemy craft which vanished by god theyre on our side asquiol cried joyously as renark eased his ship away from the area of the fight suddenly a clear voice came over the speakers it began giving directions talfryn moved the dials i cant find the source he said the voice speaking their own language although a slightly archaic version began to repeat the directions in exactly the same tone as before velocity trajectory and so forth the ship was beginning to cool the people inside relaxed somewhat dont bother finding the source renark said it sounds like a recording anyway an automatic instruction to visitors well do as it says following the directions they found themselves shooting towards an ochre planet small ominous the ships which had aided them now surrounded them a motley assortment but fast enough to stay with renarks speedy cruiser when they were on course a new voice broke into the taped instruction recital welcome to entropium we saw that you were in trouble and sent help forgive us for not doing so earlier but you were then beyond our boundaries you put up a pretty good fight thanks asquiol said softly but we could have done with that help sooner except in rare instances asquiol was not a grateful young man that was out of the question the voice said lightly but youre all right now barring accidents they sped down into the glowing red shroud of the planet barring accidents again and again they went through the same action unable to do anything trapped into it as if they were on a piece of film being run many times through a projector every time they appeared to reach the planets surface they found themselves heading through the red mist again then they were in the mist and motionless the voice speaking amusedly dont worry this will probably last a short while exhausted as he was renark had to use his special space sense to get some kind of grip on the situation but it was virtually impossible one moment he felt the presence of the red planet the next it was gone and there was nothing in its place several times they repeated their action of dropping down towards the surface until quite suddenly they were flashing through the fog and emerged into daylight pinkish daylight observing the jagged face of a sombrecoloured planet which in its wild texture was like a surrealist landscape painted by an insane and degenerate artist willow lay on the floor in her space suit her eyes closed and even the men fought to control their minds and emotions as they jarred and shuddered at the sight of the alien planet it was unlike any other they had ever seen unlike any planet in the galaxy they knew why it wasnt simply the quality of the light the texture of the surface it was something that made them uncomfortable in their bones and their brain it seemed unsafe insecure as if about to collapse beneath them to break up like a rotten melon follow the scarlet vessel said the voice on the intercom then asquiol willow and talfryn had vanished and only renark was in the ship moving down once again into the red fog of the planet where were they desperately he quested around him with his mind but the madness of disordered space and time was all about him a whirlpool of wrongness talfryn reappeared renark said where were you what happened then willow reappeared and asquiol reappeared and suddenly they were back over the surface of the planet again follow that scarlet vessel the voice instructed this time they noted a sardonic quality asquiol smiled sensing that out there was a fellow spirit as malicious as himself willow had been seriously affected by the phenomenon particularly when she had found herself momentarily alone in the ship how many ships had there been in those few moments the scarlet vessel was at the point of the phalanx of slim round squat or square spaceships surrounding them it broke away from the main fleet and headed across the planet in a southwesterly direction renark turned his own ship after it the scarlet vessel slowed and renark adjusted his speed there was a break and for a few seconds the ship travelled backwards then lurched and was moving forwards again after the scarlet ship ahead of them now they could make out the towers of a city the whole situation was taking on the aspect of a confused nightmare whether it was illusion or some physical distortion of reality renark simply couldnt tell even the outline of the city ahead did not remain constant but wavered and changed perhaps renark guessed these hallucinations or whatever they were were the effect of adjusting to the different laws which applied to the shifter system their senses had been thrown out of gear by the change and were having to adapt he hoped for the sake of his mission that he could adapt entropium said the voice on the laser the scarlet craft arched upwards until it was vertical over the planet and began to shudder downwards on an invisible repulsion field renark followed its example cautiously he nursed the ship towards the ground still not sure that the planet would not suddenly disappear from around them and they would be once again in the thick of battle with the alien ships the experiences of the past halfhour had shattered his nerves almost sapped his confidence they landed on a milesquare field which was bare but for a collection of small buildings at its far end what now willow said we disembark we got here comparatively safely and we were aided theyd be unlikely to go to all the trouble they did if they wished us harm also im curious to find but about the people of entropium renark pushed his big frame into a space suit and the others followed his example what happened back there talfryn said a trifle shakily i should imagine we experienced some sort of spacetime slip we know nothing of this system to speak of we must be prepared for anything and everything we cant even be certain that actions we make here will have the results and implications they would have in normal spacetime we could for instance walk forward and discover that we were one step backwards could jump and find ourselves buried in rock be careful though i doubt if anything as drastic as that will happen here particularly since human beings seem to inhabit the world and have built a city here but we must go warily three the scarlet spacecraft was the only other ship on what was obviously a landing field they wondered where the rest of the fleet had gone as they cautiously disembarked they saw that the crew of the scarlet ship were doing the same some of the figures were human and for the first time they were seeing alien and obviously intelligent life forms renark checked his wrist gauge looks as if we dont need suits he said but its just as well to be careful he was tense as he walked across the charred ground towards the other group he studied the aliens mingled with the human beings there were two sextupeds with four arms each and completely square heads containing a row of tiny eyes and beneath them a small mouth several hopping creatures similar to kangaroos but obviously reptilian a longlegged creature who towered over the others with a body proportionately smaller a round body supporting long swinging arm tentacles and a round head the leader of the six human beings was young smiling fair and dressed in a style which had been out of fashion in the galaxy for two hundred years a loose blue shirt baggy trousers tucked into green gaiters and with mauve pumps on his feet over the shirt was a pleated coat fanning out from his waist and dropping to his calves his weapons included an unfamiliar pistol and a rifle slung over his shoulder he swaggered move high you load he said in a peculiar accent how strong goes galaxy same its changed replied renark recognising in the youths archaic slang a patois once used by the old cmg the criminal musicians guild which two hundred years before had been composed of men outlawed because they refused to play the specific kinds of music deemed healthy by the music censors but two hundred years ago the shifter had been unheard of and migaa not settled renark was curious he could understand that two centuries hadnt passed as far as the young man was concerned the flow of time being different here yet there was something wrong youre after me arent you the young man said i blew the long note around twotwenty ww three you this is now four hundred and fiftynine years after world war three on earth renark said we use a new reckoning though how did you get here mankind had only just reached the rim when you were around accident com we were on the run chased by geepy ships ran straight here found strange mixture man i inform you and everyone from future youre the farthest into the future ive met kol manage is my name lets go go where entropium he pointed at the city come on its a long blow the city could be seen about two miles away scarring the skyline with a peculiar assortment of massive structures some horribly ugly but at least its outline now seemed firm and definite havent you got ground transport talfryn asked sometimes com not today we scrap it all too square why was that it palled you know we build something different sometime renark fumed inwardly this casual attitude was aggravating when he needed clear definite answers to the questions concerning him there was little time to lose now they were here he wanted to get started on his investigations yet the careless attitude of the entropites threatened to slow him down even though they didnt deliberately try to curtail him who runs the planet he asked kol manage as the group began to straggle towards the city we all do i guess youd call ragner olesson boss thats where were going now he wants to see you he likes to see all newcomers cant we get there faster im in a hurry well stop hurrying man youve come to the end of the track ease up theres nowhere to hurry to what do you mean renarks tense mouth was grim what do you think you didnt like it there youll have to like it here simple and kol manage refused to answer any further questions they reached the suburbs of the city and were watched incuriously by some of the inhabitants human and unhuman the population and the buildings comprised a disordered rabble which renark found distasteful they walked through dirty streets which didnt seem to lead anywhere and it was nearly dark before they got to a square skyscraper alive with light in its many windows the peculiar apathetic atmosphere of the city was as strong here as anywhere but renark hoped that at least some answers to his questions would be forthcoming the atmosphere he noted was similar to migaas only ten times worse the youths companions dispersed but manage led renark and the others into the skyscraper and up a couple of nights of grubby stairs they came to a door and manage pushed it open the four people stayed uncertainly in the entrance to the big chamber which was an untidy combination of control room and living quarters manage walked across it two men looked up coolly at his approach both were middleaged one was rugged and handsome renark glanced in distaste at the place computers and other equipment lined one wall of the room the floor was littered with carpets of clashing designs papers clothing and various objects a couple of rifles a flower vase cups files and books tables chairs and couches were placed here and there in apparent disorder the two men sat on a long couch near the largest computer a door behind them opened onto another room enter said the handsome man casually to the four we watched you come in you made the quickest start ive ever seen the rest shouldnt be here for a little while yet theyre probably having trouble with a police patrol renark said entering with a degree of caution im ragner olesson said the big man he looked hard at renark obviously seeing something unfamiliar in the guide sensers stern expression perhaps erroneously sensing a rival to his leadership renark said the exwarden these are my friends he didnt introduce them well mister renark all you need to know is this dont try to change things here we like it as it is you can do what you want in entropium anything you want at all but dont interfere with us renark frowned feeling himself growing increasingly angry this wasnt the reception hed expected and casualness and disorder of the kind he saw was annoying in his present frame of mind his whole being was geared to one thing one object he said are you the boss of entropium if you like but i dont push anyone around as long as they keep to themselves any ideas theyve got of taking over or changing things radically get it now listen said renark im looking for information thats all maybe you can help me the man laughed then sneered he got up and swaggered closer to renark seeming a trifle agitated however as if renarks statement was unprecedented what kind of information mister weve got plenty of space to move around here so go and look for it somewhere else i dont like being disturbed if you try to make troubles you can get off the planet he smiled sardonically or get killed your choice controlling himself renark said calmly so whats expected of us now look you do what you like so long as you dont bother anyone right now youre bothering me arent you interested in why were here you helped us fight off the fleet that attacked us why did you do that youre here like everyone else who comes because you dont like it where you came from right we sent our fleet to help you because the more of us there are and the more ships weve got the less chance the thron it was their ships that attacked you have of invading us simple im here said renark impatiently to discover the nature of this system what makes it work im not a criminal on the run and im not just a casual explorer the very future of humanity may well hang on what i discover or fail to discover here is that clear olessons companion got up he was an intelligent looking man with a tired face his whole attitude was one of weariness and boredom im klein i used to be a scientist of sorts you wont find out anything about the shifter my friend theres no line of enquiry you can follow that leads anywhere every fact you uncover is a contradiction of anything youve learned previously renarks voice was savage im going to force the truth out of this system mister klein his companions moved uncomfortably and asquiols slender right hand rested on the butt of his antineutron beamer they were well aware that they were outnumbered here they didnt feel renarks anxiety and were therefore less ready to alienate their hosts but klein smiled slightly showing no annoyance there have been many whove tried and all failed the concept is too alien for us to grasp dont you understand it isnt a question of your capacity for reasoning or anything else why not just accept the fact that youre safe from the cares of the universe the multiverse find yourself a niche and settle down you can be quite comfortable here nobody expects anything of you there must be some questions you can answer to give me a clue a starting point harry olesson said impatiently forget these bums will you let them do what they like so long as they stop worrying us let them make their investigations they wont get anywhere im easy klein said to renark ignoring his companion but theres not much i can tell you what do you want to know for a start tell me something about the shifter as you know it from living on it klein shrugged and sighed we pick up all kinds of intelligent life forms as we travel usually fugitives sometimes explorers theyve settled on planets if you can call it settled that suit them best once on a planet only a fool leaves it why because if the planets are wild then space outside is wilder a trip outside the atmosphere sends anyone quite mad why do you think nobody leaves the planets only the thron are insane enough already to do it youve seen it at its best when its been calmer thats why we had to wait so long before sending out help not many people dare to risk travelling in space most of the time its usually worse near the perimeter too you were lucky to get help at all whats wrong with it nobody knows but most of the time space out there is filled with chaos things appear and disappear time becomes meaningless the mind breaks but it wasnt too bad most of the time while we were coming here sure the thron had something to do with that i guess they seem to know a bit more about controlling whatever it is then if thats so there must be some means of discovering the real nature of the shifter no i reckon the thron have just been lucky klein stared with curiosity at renark what exactly do you want to know and why thats my business youve got a bigger reason than mere curiosity you said so you tell me and maybe ill decide to go on if not i dont want to bother i want to see what youre leading up to you can tell us now renark surely urged talfryn the ex warden sighed all right about two years ago i made contact with the crew of an intergalactic spaceship though it had come from another galaxy it wasnt so very different from ours and the crew was human this in itself was astonishing they had not knowledge of our history just as we had none about theirs they landed on gouland a backwater planet under my jurisdiction i went out to meet them we learned one anothers language and we talked one of the things they told me was that in their galaxy human beings were the only intelligent lifeform just like ours klein nodded and i suspect just like any other galaxy in our particular universe tell me klein where do the aliens weve seen come from different spacetimecontinua every stc seems to have only one dominant intelligent life form i cant explain it it must mean something thats what i suspected anyway a phenomenon natural to every stc universe but what isnt happening i hope in every stc is what is happening in our particular universe happening talfryn spoke the visitors from the other galaxy came to warn us their news was so terrible that i had to keep it to myself to have released it would have been to start galaxywide panic what the hell is happening even olesson became interested the end of the universe renark said what talfryn gasped the end of the universe so far as humanitys concerned at any rate and the geelords dont know asquiol said you didnt tell them why because i was counting on the shifter to offer a clue that might save us not just the end of a galaxy klein said softly but an entire universe our universe how do you know renark the visitors gave me proof my own spacesensing ability did the rest im convinced the universe has ceased to expand thats a problem olesson said oh yes because not only has it ceased expanding it is now contracting all matter is falling back to its source all the galaxies are rapidly drawing together and at a far greater speed than they expanded and the speed increases as all matter is drawn back to the hub of our universe soon all the galaxies will exist as a single mote of matter in the vastness of space then even that mote may vanish leaving vacuum so far this inward movement is restricted to the galaxies but soon when they all come together it will involve the stars the planets everything this is theory klein spoke softly fact said renark my visitors experiments are conclusive they have tested the theory in their laboratories and found that when the matter has contracted as much as it can and it forms a pellet of astounding density it just disappears they believe that when it reaches the final stage it enters other dimensions as a photon possibly in some greater universe the one encompassing the multiverse itself perhaps so it disappears like the shifter thats right i still dont know why you came here klein said because its safe we are safe arent we i came here said renark more calmly now in the hope of discovering a means of travelling into another universe you think because the shifter travels through the multiverse that you can find out how it works and build some kind of machine that will do the same is that it klein seemed interested even enthusiastic thats it if i can discover the shifters secret i may be able to return to our universe as a guide senser i could probably find it and warn them of whats happening and offer them a means of escaping into a universe which isnt undergoing this change olesson put in whatever happens were all right eh renark nodded yes but that doesnt appeal much to me the others didnt reply although horrified they also seemed relieved renark sensed this youre still with me he said to his friends weve nothing to lose talfryn said uncomfortably nothing agreed asquiol the equipment beside them squealed olesson moved ponderously towards it tuned in the receiver got sound and a picture yes the face on the screen said more visitors ragnar a big load from migaa are coming in now the usual routine said olesson shutting off the receiver four renark and his companions watched the screens as the shoals of craft from migaa entered the shifters area of space then the thron ships came slashing upwards from their planet like sharks there was an insane inexplicable anger in their ferocity from other directions a large motley force of entropium warships helped the migaan craft dispose of the outnumbered thron vessels the fight was much shorter than renarks theyre just in time commented olesson watching the screen the systems due to begin transition again pretty soon better wave your universe goodbye renark you wont be seeing it again for some time if at all he grinned callously ignoring the big man renark turned to his friends well have to split up there must be people here who arent just criminals people whove made some attempt to explore or analyse the system they can help us move about the city ask questions there was a peculiar note in kleins voice go to see mary the maze renark i cant guarantee shell help but shell serve as a warning to you she was an anthropologist i hear she explored as much of the shifter as she was able but go and see where her curiosity got her renark where is she im not sure but everyone knows her on northside youll find her soon enough if you ask okay i will he said to the others you take other parts of the city dont ignore any piece of information speculation or rumour it could all be useful weve got to work fast but fast sneered olesson as they left walking out of the untidy building they saw the bright arrows of fire searing down on the landingfield two miles away they split up renark had chosen the worst possible time to look for anyone as he went from hotel to hotel from bar to bar on the north side of entropium the men and women from migaa began to pour exuberantly in they got drunk quickly and the whole city came alive and excited not only human beings celebrated the new shipments arrival aliens of many kinds joined in with their own forms of merrymaking once a creature like a giant cross between a slug and a caterpillar addressed him in highpitched terran but he ignored it and moved on searching asking questions getting incoherent or facetious replies and then the nightmare really began quite suddenly renark felt nausea flood through him felt his vision blur and sent out a mindprobe which took in the whole of the system and part of the galaxy beyond it his mind just refused to accept some of the information it received he couldnt take it in the galaxy seemed distant and yet retained the same point in space in relation to the shifter then the whole planet seemed suddenly engulfed by a weird greyish mist the darkness gave way to it for an instant renark thought he saw the buildings of the city begin to fade again he felt weightless and had to cling to the side of a house the house seemed solid enough but its components moved beneath his hands and his own body seemed diffused lacking its normal density as his mind swirled he returned it to the comforting reality of the galaxy as he habitually did in tunes of stress but the galaxy was no longer real it seemed ghostly he was losing touch with it he very nearly panicked but controlled himself desperately then he understood what was happening they were leaving the galaxy leaving the universe renark loved that he was prepared to die for he had an unreasoning sense of betrayal as if the galaxy were leaving him rather than the reverse he breathed heavily he felt like a drowning man and sought for something to grab physically and mentally but there was nothing nothing constant nothing that did not change as he sensed or saw it the grey city seemed to tilt at an angle and he even felt himself sliding he staggered on down the crazily angled couch ripped from some ship and evidently used as a bed by the mad woman mary he said to the muttering wreck mary she stared at him and the look in her eyes repelled him adam ah no come in castor but leave pollux outside or is it ruben kave hero of space come to visit me her mouth broadened the lips curving upwards she made a vague graceful gesture with her hand do sit down she said there was nowhere to sit he remained standing disturbed nonplussed im renark he said i want information its important can you help me help the voice was at first detached her fingers moved constantly over the keyboard help her face twisted then she screamed help he took a step forward the hands moved more swiftly agitatedly over the board help she began to emit a kind of soft scream mary he said urgently he could not touch the smooth shoulders he leant over the drooling woman its all right they say youve explored the shifter is that true true whats true whats false what was it like mary what did this to you a groan masculine and desperate came from the woman she stood up and walked unsteadily towards the couch lay down on it gripping the sides whats the shifter mary what is it his face felt tight as tight as his rigidly controlled emotions chaos she mumbled madness supersanity warmth oh warmth but i couldnt take it no human being could theres no anchor nothing to recognise nothing to cling to its a whirlpool of possibilities crowding around you tossing you inall directions tearing at you im falling im flying im expanding im contracting im singing im dumb my bodys gone i cant reach it her eyes stared suddenly she looked at him with some sort of intelligence renark you said your name was yes he was steeling himself to do something he didnt want to do i saw you once perhaps there here there she dropped her head back and lay on the couch mumbling he sensed the chaos of the shifter brawling about in the back of his mind he thought he knew how it could have turned her mad felt some sympathy with what she was talking about he turned all his attention to her using his sensing ability to sort her out into her composite atoms concentrated on her sensory nerves and her brain structure in an effort to get some clue to the effect which the shifter had had on her but there was little physically wrong although it was obvious that the quantity of adrenalin flooding her system was abnormally high and that this perhaps was the reason for her almost constant movement but her mind wasnt open to renark he was not a telepath and was almost glad at that moment that he couldnt see into her wrenchedapart mind neither was he telekinetic but nonetheless he hated even this form of intrusion as he studied her muscle responses her nervous system in an effort to find some clue how to pull her together long enough to get some answers to his questions he felt her move asquiol she said isnt that a name something to do with you arent you dead how could she possibly know of asquiol yes asquiols the name of my friend but im alive he half cursed the introduction of this new element of mystery in an already difficult situation what about asquiol but there was no response from the mad woman who had now resumed her vacant staring at the ceiling he tried another tack mary where did you go what did you discover the ragged planet she muttered i go there went there last the lattice planet stay away now he wanted to shake the information out of her but he had to coax why he said more gently why mary doesnt travel with the shifter not all of it some of it exist in other dimensions travelling independently the hole is there the dwellers lurk in the hole they know everything they mean no harm but they are dangerous they know the truth and the truth is too much what truth i forget i couldnt hold it they told it to me it wasnt fair she stared at him again and once more intelligence was in her eyes dont believe in justice renark dont for an instant take its existence for granted it doesnt exist you learn that in the gaps you can make it but it breaks down in the real universe you find that in the gaps gaps what are they he wondered at the peculiar accent she put on the word the ragged planets gaps she sighed and fidgeted on the couch thats where i finally forgot where every theory every scrap of information gathered on the other planets was meaningless and i forgot but it did me no good i was curious im not now but i want rest peace and i cant have it it goes on they know though they know and their hate has kept them sane who are they mary the thron the horrible thron and the shaarn know too but they are weak they couldnt help me the beasts dont let them push you into the untime the unspace their weapons are cruel they do not kill thank you mary renark said at a loss to help her i will go to thron she rose from the couch screaming i said not spiral magenta irribird night not sight of droan not oh no she began sobbing and renark left the room he walked down the corridor brooding dissatisfied with the little he had learned but with a definite plan of action now he must go to thron and discover the truth of marys statement whatever happened the thron would be of more help assuming they could be encouraged to help than the decadent inhabitants of entropium who refused to know anything though he could half sympathise with anyone who didnt wonder or question the boiling chaos of the shifter as it moved through the dimensions of the multiverse was enough to disturb anyone he walked out of the hotel and found to his relief that the planet seemed to have quietened down and was presumably in normal space again but in an alien universe ah he walked swiftly towards the building he allowed his mind to put out tendrils and was relieved when he sensed beyond the insane perimeter of the shifter the solid ordered planets and suns of a wide spiral galaxy like his own in general components although here and there he came across organic and chemical formations which he did not recognise when he got back to the control room in the skyscraper klein said half the new migaaload are dead as usual they panicked and caused trouble while we were in transit so we cleaned them up the rest are settling down or running back to the launching pads how did you get on with mary she said that the thron knew about the shifters nature or thats what i believe she said asquiol and willow both pale walked in he nodded to them were the thron the race who initially attacked us he asked klein far away he heard ships blasting off klein cursed they were warned thats another lot on their way to death what do you mean every time there are newcomers who try to use the shifter as a transport from their own universe to another we warn them that once theyre here theyre stuck but they try maybe one or two make it i dont know but i think not something stops you leaving the shifter once youre here its impossible to get off willow said worriedly renark glanced at willow it was funny he thought how crisis took different people in different ways willow sounded as if she was going to break down asquiol evidently hadnt noticed it he was curious to see how talfryn would look and act when he came back klein was talking thats right honey its harder to get out than in you dont exist entirely in the spacetime matrix of the universe which the shifter is currently in we kind of overflow into other dimensions so when you try to leave you hit the dimensions at a slight angle and whoof you break apart some of you goes one way some of you goes another no you cant get out renark you have more problems asquiol said fiddling with his gloves and more coming from what ive learned renark said tiredly what did you find out not much of anything definite the eleven planets are called a variety of names by a variety of human and nonhuman people there are a million theories about the shifters nature mainly based on folklore and superstition they say the thron were here first and might be native to the system this could explain some of their resentment of alien ships entering anything else theres some race called colloquially the jellysmellies who are supposed to know the history of the multiverse theres a planet called ragged ruth which is supposed to be the epitome of hell in this hellish system that seems to confirm what mary told me he nodded talfryn came in his body was loose worn out he sat down on the couch renark paused for a moment there are questions which weve got to answer and we cant take our time getting those answers why does the shifter follow this orbit how does it do it if we can discover the principle there may be a chance of adapting it to build ships to evacuate our galaxy the logic if thats the word is abhorrent to us but it must be mastered are all the universes contracting at the same time i wonder he asked this last question almost hesitantly bringing it into the open for the first time if so there is virtually no chance of evacuation on the other hand what we discover may enable us to klein laughed to stop a universe in its natural course of decay or reorganisation no renark yes klein if that has to be done what the hell are we all talking about talfryn said tiredly from the couch were only three men against the natural universe not to mention the unnatural universe this terrible place he shook his head frankly the little information ive picked up makes me feel helpless useless ineffectual in the face of whats happening i feel ready to give up not to fight against something that is judging by all the facts an immense and inescapable movement of the forces of nature which must logically result in the end of the human race of all organic life both in our universe and in others the human race has had its day we might as well face it if you can answer that renark id be grateful suddenly renark didnt want talfryn with him any more i doubt if i could give you an answer which would satisfy you he said sadly youre fatalistic and a fatalist if youll forgive me is also a misanthropist the quality which humanity has unlike any other form of life in our universe is its power to control nature it is the mark of homo sapiens that he has for millennia refused to let his environment control him to any real extent he has adapted to it adapted it conquered it this imminent disaster facing the race is on a larger scale but the rule still applies in this case we may be forced to leave our environment and start to work adapting to and controlling a new one if man can do that he will have proved forever his right and his reason for existence talfryn taken aback by the force of renarks reply couldnt answer he shook his head again and remained broodingly silent renark had sensed the mans weakness like a mechanic senses that a piece of equipment driven beyond its inherent endurance is due to fail so he said then youd better stay here talfryn nodded ive failed you renark but honestly its too big far too big some of us can be optimistic for just so long but facts must be faced facts can be altered renark said turning away youre giving up asquiol blinked why im a creature of circumstance said talfryn with a bitter halfsmile he got up and left the room asquiol turned to renark why has he done that is there something i dont know about lets hope so renark said quietly he watched his friend who disturbed and disorientated turned to look for a long moment at willow her eyes began to fill with tears i couldnt face it she said not any more not after what we just went through youve stopped loving me is that it oh no asquiol ill always love you you you could stay here with me asquiol looked sharply at renark we go to thron he said if you wish to come look after yourself willow said asquiol i may return who knows and he walked away from her he and renark left the room left the building and the city and made for the pads for their black ship bound for horror and perhaps death he was a fool said willow calmly to klein there are many who refuse their responsibilities fooling themselves they search for a higher ideal he was a fool what are responsibilities said klein laconically he knows responsibility my dear is another word for selfsurvival she looked at klein uncomprehendingly i wish he had stayed she said five renark flung over the ships masterswitch bringing the whole complicated vessel to life he could not be satisfied with thoughts and theories now he wanted decisive and constant action dynamic action which would bring him to a source that would answer the questions crowding his mind as he charted his course to thron he remembered something and turned to asquiol sitting moodily in the gunnery seat staring at his instruments did you ever know of mary the maze before you came here he asked silently asquiol shook his head renark shrugged he felt badly for his friend but couldnt afford to let his personal emotions influence his chosen course of action from what he had gathered fewer laws than ever applied in the interplanetary space of the shifter than on the planets themselves therefore he was going to have difficulty in simply navigating the comparatively small area of space between them and thron he said without turning once in space i must not be disturbed and am relying on you to perform all necessary functions other than the actual piloting of the spaceship i have to anchor my mind to thron and must steer the ship through altering dimensions as well as space and time therefor in the event of attack you must be ready must meet it as best you can but i will not be able to afford to know do you understand lets get started for gods sake he said impatiently and dont be too ready with those antineutron cannon he said as he pressed the takeoff button the ship throbbed spacewards and then they hit horror chaos it had no business to exist it defied every instinctively accepted law that renark knew turmoil it was fantastically beautiful but as far as he was concerned it had to be ignored mastered or destroyed because it was wrong evil unlawful agony the ship coursed through the myriad multidimensional currents that swirled and whirled and howled about it that rent the sanity of the two brave men who battered at it cursed it and in controlling themselves managed somehow to stave off the worst effects terror they had no business to exist here they knew it but they refused to compromise they made the disorder of the tiny universe bend to their courage to their strength and the wills creating a pocket of order in the screaming wrongness of unchained creation temptation they had nothing but their pitiful knowledge that they were human beings intelligent reasoning beings capable of transcending the limits which the universe had striven to set upon them they refused they fought they used their minds as they had never used them found reserves of reason where none had previously been and at last because they were forced to they used every resource of the human mind which had lain dormant since man had created human nature as an excuse to let his animal nature order his life now they rejected this and renark steered the ship through the malevolent currents of the unnatural area of space and howled his challenge to it and the three words i am human became his mental warcry as he used his skill to control the metal vessel plunging on the random spatial and temporal currents and forcing its way through blazing horror towards the angry world of thron all about him renark was aware of other dimensions which seemed to lie in wait for his ship to trap it to stop it from ever reaching its goal but he avoided them and concentrated all his powers on keeping a course for thron four hours the two men fought against insanity fought the craziness that had turned mary the maze into an idiot then at last thron appeared on the laser weak trembling but exuberant renark coasted the spaceship into throns atmosphere and although the brooding planet offered new dangers of a more tangible kind it was with relief and hope that he arrived there they could not speak to one another just then but both were conscious of the welding companionship which had come about during their journey they had been fused together these two men by mutually shared horror and victory breathing deeply renark dropped the ship down and began a cautious reconnaissance of the planet apart from one domed city at the northern pole it appeared deserted there were cities certainly but uninhabited they picked up no signals their scanners observed no obvious signs of life where were the ferocious thron surely not all at the small city on the northern pole the hell with it renark said lets go right in and see what happens ive staked everything so far on one throw and havent as yet lost by it are you willing i thought i was supposed to be reckless asquiol smiled good we can land in that big square we saw in the largest city renark nodded agreement adjusted the controls of the ship and flew in over the big city he brought it flaming down on the hard rocky substance of the city square they landed to find only silence shall we disembark asquiol asked yes theres a locker over there beside you open it will you asquiol swung the door back and raised his eyebrows there was a small armoury of handguns in the locker renark had never been known to carry or use any weapon designed to kill give me the antineutron beamer you see there renark said asquiol didnt question renark but took the bolstered gun from the place and handed it over renark looked at it strangely desperate measures he said softly i have little sympathy at the moment with the thron although they may have justifiable reasons for their seemingly unreasoning belligerence but our mission transcends my moral code much as i hate to admit such a thing possible and our lives are as far as the human race is concerned important lets go said asquiol renark sighed they suited up and took the elevator to the airlock although bizarre and obviously created by alien intelligence renark and asquiol could work out the function of most of the buildings and machines they observed as they padded through the deserted streets of the apparently deserted city but they couldnt explain why the city was deserted where the inhabitants had gone obviously they had not been gone for any length of time for there were no signs of erosion or encroaching nature with his mind renark quested around searching the buildings for life but he could only sense peculiar disturbances in the temporal and spatial layers spreading out beyond the shifter continuum life hovered out there like a ghost sometimes apparently close sometimes further away it was weird they toured the city and were just returning to the square where the ship reared when something happened god i feel sick asquiol said screwing up his eyes renark felt the same he had momentary double vision he saw faint shadows flickering at the edge of the structures about them shadows of the same shape size and appearance as the more solid buildings and machines these shadows seemed to merge with the material structures and all at once the city was alive inhabited the place was suddenly full of doglike sixlegged beings using four legs for motion and two as hands the thron shocked they pulled their pistols from their holsters and backed towards the ship as the thron saw the humans in their midst all was consternation thron soldiers levelled weirdly curled tubes at the two men levelled them and fired the humans were flung to the ground as their suitscreens absorbed or repelled the worst of the charges shoot back or weve had it renark yelled they raised themselves on their bellies and fired their own dreadful weapons beams of dancing antimatter went spreading towards the thron troops met them made contact and seethed into their bodies those bodies imploded crushing inwards and turning to minuscule specks of shattered matter before vanishing entirely the backlash shivered against the humans protective suits and the beams waltzed on fading slightly as they progressed entered one group after another destroying wherever they touched whether organic or inanimate matter until their power faded only a few thron were left in the immediate area they dont seem ready to talk asquiol said sardonically over the suit radio what now renark back to the ship for the meantime inside the control cabin their communications equipment was making all sorts of noises asquiol attempted to tune it in and eventually succeeded in getting a regular series of highfrequency signals which he could not quite interpret as being coded signals or actual speech he brought the pitch down lower and realised with astonishment that he was listening to stilted terran renark was busy keeping the scanners trained on the thron who were coming out into the open around the square again but he listened beware the thron beware the thron beware the thron whether it was a warning or a threat he couldnt tell asquiol said careful to adjust his outgoing signal to the frequency involved who are you i am receiving you we are enemies of the thron we are the shaarn whose ancestors consigned the thron to this existence but they have machines which you are not equipped against forces which will hurl you out of this system altogether and into limbo take off immediately and head for the northern pole we saw you pass over us but have not until now been able to discover your means of communication and the form it takes we apologise how can we trust them asquiol asked the frying pan or the fire it makes no difference renark replied im lifting off tell them were coming asquiol relayed the message you must hurry the shaarn spokesman said for we are small and have few defensive devices against the thron you must reach our city before they do since we will have but a short time to spare to let you in and close our barrier again have it ready were coming said asquiol the ship soared upwards again levelled off and headed at high speed for the polar region they made it in under a minute they saw the dome flicker and fade entered its confines as it closed over them again and came down gently on a small landing field within the city it was more a town with few buildings taller than three stories encompassing a small area compared with the expanse of the thron cities overhead they observed the thron ships come rushing over the polar city and were half blinded by the bolts of energy which sprayed the forcedome above them they stayed where they were and waited to be contacted eventually the communications equipment spoke i am pleased that we were successful there is no point in waiting until the throns have expended their rage the forceshield will hold off their most ferocious attacks we are sending out a vehicle for your assistance please take it to the city when you are ready to do so a few moments later a small aircarriage opentopped and made of thin golden metal floated up to the ship and hovered by its airlock well lets see if these shaarn are friendly or not said renark they descended to the airlock passed through it and entered the little airboat which turned on its axis and returned to the city at a more leisurely speed renark felt fairly confident from what mary the maze had said that these people would be friendly they entered the city proper and the airboat cruised downwards landing gently outside the entrance to a small unornamented unpretentious building two figures came out they were doglike having six appendages asquiol gasped and instinctively reached for his pistol in an unthinking response then he saw that these creatures so like the thron were unarmed and he calmed himself the shaarn like the thron were extremely pleasing to the human eye perhaps because they looked so alike to friendly dogs the two figures with peaceful gestures beckoned renark and asquiol to leave the airboat they did so they passed through a series of simply furnished rooms containing no recognisable equipment and out into a courtyard which like the city was covered with an iridescent forcedome here was a laser transceiver not unlike their own one of the shaarn went up to it and spoke into the transmitter it took them several moments to tune into the humans suit wavelengths and for an instant before they adjusted their own controls they were blasted with the highpitched noises they had heard before then the shaarn spokesman said we regret sincerely that our welcome could not have extended to the whole planet but as you will have realised we control little of it i am naro nuis and this is my wife zeni ouis you are renark jon and asquiol of pompeii i believe thats so but how did you know renark replied we were forced and you must forgive us to intrude on your minds in order to discover the means to build the communications equipment we are telepaths i am afraid then why the need for the laser we had no idea how you would take telepathic interference in your minds and it is against our code to intrude except in the direst emergencies i should have thought thats just what we were in asquiol said somewhat rudely i see said renark well as far as i am concerned telepathic communication would be preferable we have telepaths among our own race so be it naro nuis said you have obviously some important reason for braving the dangers of thron said a voice in renarks skull but we avoided investigating it perhaps we can help thank you renark said firstly i am curious to learn why the throns are so belligerent secondly whether it is true that your race was the first to come to this system much hangs on what i learn from you he told the shaarn how his race faced annihilation the alien appeared to deliberate at length he pathed would you object if we intruded still further on your minds for a while by means of a telepathic link by this method you will see something of the history of the shaarn and will discover how this system originally took this somewhat unusual orbit through the multidimensional universe what do you say renark asquiols voice came over the suitphone i think the suggestion is excellent they were led into a semidarkened room where food and drink were served to them they felt relaxed for the first time in ages this place is simply to aid your receptivity to what we are about to do and what is that we are going to reconstruct for you the history of the war between the shaarn and the thron the history began many millennia ago when our ancestors were completing their explorations of our own spacetime galaxy at naro nuis request they blanked their minds and the history began six they were the golden children of the galaxy the shaarn the searchers the wanderers the enquirers they were the magnificent bringers of gifts bestowers of wisdom dealers of justice in their great startravelling ships they brought the concept of mercy and law to the planets of their galaxy and formed order out of chaos cut justice from the stuff of chance the shaarn hurled their ships inwards to the hub outwards towards the rim proud wise and merciful selfconfident and selfcritical they spread their sons to inhabit planets in many different systems the laughing darlings of an ancient culture they poured outwards always searching the shaarn ships sang and hurtled through the bewildering regions of hyperspace avoiding war recognising privacy but bringing their wisdom and knowledge to anyone requesting it they had come also to accept that all intelligent races took the same form as themselves the mighty shaarn were cynics and idealists innocent and ancient and their ships coursed further towards the worlds of the rim the starship vondel captained by roas rui burst into normal space half a lightyear from a binary star the shaarn called yito around yito circled eleven worlds each following a wider orbit than the next eleven mysteries which roas rui and his crew of scientists and sorcerers regarded with excitement and curiosity eleven balls of chemicals and vegetation organic and inorganic life would they find intelligence new concepts new knowledge roas rui hoped that they would the shaarn in their early days of spacetravel had known fear when encountering foreign cultures but those times were gone in their power and their confidence they were unable to conceive of a race greater than their own a technology more highly developed on some worlds near the rim they had come across traces of a starroving people but the traces were incredibly ancient and pointed to a longdead race their ancestors perhaps who had travelled the stars and then degenerated thus it was not with fear that roas rui regarded the fourth world nearest yito when his ship its reactor idling went into orbit around it roas rui reared himself effortlessly on to his four bind limbs in order to see better the purpleclouded world which now filled the viewingscreen his shaggy doglike head craned towards the screen and his mouth curved downwards in an expression of pure pleasure he turned his head and showed his long slim teeth to emphasise his delight its a huge planet medwov dei he released to his lieutenant who stood by the screen control board manoeuvring dials in order to bring the world into closed perspective medwov dei thought without moving his head the gravity is almost identical to that of shaarn rui thought noui nas was right in his hunch again he always picks the planet which most closely approximates shaarn in gravity and atmosphere hes one of the best sorcerers we have in the division medwov made a clicking sound with his mouth to indicate agreement he was very big the largest member of the crew and every inch of five feet high he was dedicated to the exploratory division even more than the other members with regard to his work he was a fanatic probably due to the fact that because of his immense size he had little success with the female shaarn at least he personally blamed his height but it was well known that as a young cadet he had once killed a domestic beast in anger naturally this had led to his nearostracism and had precluded his ever rising above the rank of lieutenant medwov inhaled wetly and continued to work at the control panel deliberately blocking his mind to any but the most urgent thoughts which might emanate from his commander almost childishly roas rui laughed the highpitched whine of the shaarn his excitement mounted as he directed his two pilots to prepare for descent on to the planets surface prepare defence screens he sent out the traditional commands as a matter of course some of his orders were obeyed by the control operators before he even thought of them switch to gravityresisters machines moaned delicately throughout the huge bulk of the starship descend to two thousand feet the vondel plunged through the atmosphere of the new planet and hovered two thousand feet above its surface now the screens showed a vast landscape of forest land comprised predominantly of waving indigo fronds which stretched like a sea in all directions broken occasionally by clumps of taller vegetation coloured in varying shades of blue it was beautiful roas ruis long body shook with emotion as he beheld it to the shaarn all new planets were beautiful begin testing he said the computers began their intricate job of classifying all the components of the planet at the same time the sorcerers began to put themselves swiftly into trancestate seeking to discover intelligent life of any kind whether natural or supernatural and also its attitude or potential attitude to the exploratory division the findings of computers and sorcerers were relayed instantly to roas rui himself now in semitrance both parts of his brain received the information and assembled it into an everincreasing detailed picture of the newly discovered planet woui nas i have found a mind bewildered uncertain passive more minds as before new mind high intelligence anger controlled urge to destroy very strong directed at rulers or representatives new mind low iq misery bewildered passive new something bad very bad evil here but am finding resistance to probes pause power evil great resistance to probes am formed to fight or retreat require orders pause repeat require orders roas rui beamed a message to the controllers to continue recording the data and concentrated all his attention on making a full link with woui nas who had pathed the urgent request i am with you now woui nas can you bring me in unprecedented reaction captain please absorb roas rui could sense the frightened amazement of woui nas as he submerged himself in the others mind and allowed the old sorcerer to guide him outwards towards the source of the emanations almost instantaneously he felt the aura of disgusting malevolence coupled with an intelligence more powerful than his own roas rui was one of the most intelligent members of his race his capacity for absorbing and relating knowledge was tremendous but he had found more than his match in the mind which now sensed the presence of his own roas rui under the direction of woui nas probed further into the mind which he had contacted he probed while his senses shrieked with danger and urged him to retreat suddenly his brain throbbed as a thought came savagely from the contacted entity get out we intend to destroy you intruders there was no attempt to ask questions of the explorers no tinge of curiosity an order and a statement roas rui and woui nas retreated from the malevolence and separated minds what now woui nas asked from his cabin a quarter of a mile away from the control room where roas rui sat shaking incredible the captain said quite unprecedented as you remarked there is a force here to equal the shaarn even to better it but the evil i must admit that as we neared the planet i sensed it woui nas informed the captain but it was difficult then to define it these entities are capable of blocking off our most powerful probes our ancestors would have been far more careful when making a new planetfall ross rui said grimly we are becoming too complacent brother sorcerer were woui nas remarked dryly perhaps this is the kind of shock our people need possibly roas rui agreed but now we are in danger of turning our immediate peril into a philosophical problem since this contact is unprecedented and since the regulations state categorically that we should obey any culture which demands that we leave its environs i would suggest to you that a group makes contact immediately with headquarters on shaarn and asks for instructions and meanwhile woui nas enquired i do not wish to be destroyed and neither i think do any other members of the ships complement he beamed a quick order to his pilots we are returning to shaarn this is an emergency he knew that his pilots would need no further orders swiftly the vondel climbed into deep space and merged into hyperspace so the initial contact between the shaarn and the thron was made another millennia of ignorance of each others existence the exploratory team which had come to a throndominated world brought the two mighty cultures into contact at last it was inevitable and the war between shaarn and thron was also inevitable it was not a war like most wars it did not hinge on economics it only partially hinged on conflicting ideologies it was simply that the thron refused to tolerate the presence in the galaxy of another intelligent race physically like themselves and almost as powerful they intended to destroy the shaarn to obliterate completely all traces of their civilisation the thron had not concentrated so much on the building of starships but it did not take them long to build ships which almost equalled those of the shaarn thron controlled an empire comprising twentysix systems the thron themselves were comparatively few in number but they had total dominance over their subject planets the federation of shaarn comprised some fifty systems and three hundred planets upon which intelligent races like themselves existed when shaarn informed them of the impending war one hundred and sixtytwo of those planets elected to join with the shaarn the rest claimed neutrality the war progressed it was vicious and dreadful and a month after it had begun the first planet was destroyed by the thron a neutral planet and all life was destroyed with the planet realising the danger was great but unable to consider an alternative to continuing the struggle the shaarn directed their scientists to devise a means of stopping the war so that no more destruction of life should take place the scientists devised a means of removing the thron from the galaxy even from the very universe a means if it worked as they hoped of forever exiling that malevolent and evil people they discovered the continuumwarp device which they believed would be capable of hurling the eleven thron homeworlds out of their continuum and into another this would efficiently halt the throns insensate aims of ruling the galaxy soa squadron of ships each armed with the device reached the thron home system of yito and directed their beams on to the planets and their sun at first they succeeded only in shifting the planets through space altering the position around the binary resulting in the equidistant position they now occupied the thron retaliated and the shaarn hurled the thron warships effectively into another spacetime continuum returning their attention to the system they blasted it with warp rays time after time and quite suddenly it was gone vanished from the shaarns spacetime into another the war was over but as it happened the shaarn had not been entirely successful in their plan since the system kept right on travelling through the dimensions eventually establishing an orbit which it still followed not only this but most of the shaarn ships were caught up in the vortex they had created and were drawn by means of the force they had themselves released after the shifter they attempted desperately to return to their own spacetime but for some reason it was now blocked not only to them but to the shifter itself the system could never pass through the shaarns spacetime again the thron demoralised and bewildered did not offer a threat of immediate counterattack for they were busily consolidating on their fortress world abandoning their slaves to any fate that came the shaarn were able to land their ships establishing a small wellprotected city at the northern pole of a planet they called glanii here they remained for ages vainly attempting to devise a means of returning to their own system later the thron too came to glanii where they could be nearer their hated enemies the thron eventually learned what had happened to them and also began work on the problem they invented a machine which could fling them and all their artifacts through the multidimensional spacetime streams to their home continuum and exact vengeance on the shaarn so far they had not been unsuccessful this explained why renark and asquiol had found the planet apparently deserted of thron who at the time of their arrival had been attempting another jump through the dimensions the war between the thron and the representatives of the shaarn had become stalemate both races concentrating most of their energies on attempts to return to their home continuum so it had been for millennia with the thron resenting further encroachments on their sundered territory attempting to destroy any newcomers who came like vultures opportunistically to the snifter system and that to the date of renarks coming was briefly the history of the sundered worlds renark was in a calmer frame of mind when the experience was over at last he was no longer working in the dark he had definite conclusive facts to relate to his questions and was confident that the shaarn would supply him with further useful information naro nuis telepathed discreetly i hope the history was of some use to you renark jon of great use but i gather you are unable to supply me with any detailed information of the dimensionwarping device unfortunately that is so from what we can gather the continuawarp operating as it did by means of certain laws discovered in the shaarn continuum will not work in the same way from outside the continuum i believe this was deliberately done by our scientists in order that the thron would never be able to return im surprised that by this time you havent joined forces with the thron since you seem to have a common aim not so in fact this is our main point of contention these days the thron are determined to regain our original universe whereas that is the last thing we want we will be pleased to halt the progress of the shifter in any continuum but our own and this would destroy for ever their chance to continue the war the alien sighed a surprisingly human sound it may be that the shifting mechanism is an irreversible process in that case our efforts are hopeless but we do not think so renark was bitterly disappointed if the beings who engendered the shift no longer understood how it operated this was logically the end of the trail but he would not admit to himself that there was nothing more he could do that was unthinkable he rose to his feet his mind working intensely busily forming the recent knowledge into the kind of pattern best suited to his present needs well there was time yet he had to be optimistic there was no turning back he refused to accept any factors other than those he could use objectively somewhere in this system they left the chamber and made for the ship on the way renark noticed signs of animated work in a large lowslung building with openhangartype doors it struck him as out of tune with the millennialong deadlock of which he had just learned he remarked on this to naro nuis the alien immediately responded with interest that is the result of a long period of research we are now building equipment with which we hope to halt the shifter system renark stared in amazement what after the story of gloom you have just told us i told you our experiments continued naro nuis replied puzzled soon we will begin ferrying the equipment into space to take it as near to the suns as possible and yet you still claim to have no knowledge of the shift principle renarks excitement was mounting at the thought that the creature had been lying that is so naro nuis told him we have despaired of ever discovering the principle behind the phenomenon but with any luck we think we might bring it to a stop even though we dont understand it he added this is the culmination of a very long series of experiments very long if we succeed we shall not need to know since the phenomenon will have vanished renarks sudden hope dissipated and what are your chances of succeeding naro nuis paused before answering the expedition is fraught with dangers our long absence from space has lost us some of our skills in interplanetary flight what of the thron do they know of your plans they have some inkling of course they will try to stop us there will be a great battle renark continued the walk to his ship when do you plan to lift this equipment off in half a revolution of the planet he stopped abruptly then i must ask one favour what is that delay your experiment give me time to find out what i must know we cannot there was no arguing with the shaarn his tone was uncompromising naro nuis explained how can we be sure that you will have even a chance of success in your endeavour every moment we delay means that our chances of stopping the shifter and holding off the thron are lessened but the future of my entire race depends upon me does it have you not taken it upon yourself presumptuously to save your fellows perhaps the process you described is natural perhaps the members of your race will accept that they are to perish along with their universe as for us there is no need to delay and we must act quickly the thron when they are not attempting to jump through the dimensions patrol the planet in their ships as soon as we begin ferrying the equipment there will be a battle we will have to work speedily and hold off the thron at the same time i see renark said bitterly later asquiol said but what if you did stop the shifter supposing you stopped it in a universe like the one we have just left you would be destroyed along with the rest that is true but the chances of that happening are not very great we must risk it then you will not wait no naro nuis said again regretfully your hopes of success are slim ours are better you must understand our position we have been trying to stop the shifter for thousands of years would you call a halt to your progress on behalf of a race you never heard of which according to only two of its members was in some kind of danger i might renark said not after thousands of years said asquiol not that long naro nuiss thoughts came gently you are welcome to stay with us if you wish thanks renark said harshly but we dont have much time i think your efforts will be wasted the shaarn pathed but since you are so anxious to find help you might go to the world of the ekiversh ekiversh the ekiversh are intelligent metazoa who have a fullydeveloped racememory they gave us some help in building the machine with which we intend to stop the shifter they have lived so long that their knowledge is very great they are goodnatured friendly and because of their structure and type live on the only planet in the system which is not in some way torn by strife the thron could learn something from the ekiversh but in their arrogance they would not deign to do so we have not often visited them for whenever we leave our city the wrath of the thron is turned upon us but we have made telepathic communication when certain favourable laws have applied for short periods in the system can you point out their planet on my chart with pleasure naro nuis accompanied them aboard their ship looking around him with pleasure and curiosity a bizarre craft he said not by our standards renark produced the chart and the alien bent over it studying the figures marked there at last he pointed there thanks said renark lets get started shall we asquiol drummed his fingers the thron will be awaiting you when you leave here naro nuis said are you sure you want to risk it what else could we do renark was close to anger the alien turned away from him asquiol shouted at naro nuis havent you any idea what you will do if you stop the shifter you could strand us here with no means of saving our people no means of going back even if we did find the information we need you cant begin your experiments yet we must renark put his hand on asquiols arm we must get to ekiversh as soon as possible and see what we can learn before the shaarn succeed in stopping the shifter in orbit then i had better leave naro nuis said sadly with mixed emotions renark said goodbye to the alien thanking him for his help but aware that this pleasant people were about to conduct an experiment which if it was successful would shatter his own hopes of learning enough from the shifter to be able to return to his own universe and save humanity renark sat in the control seat tensed asquiol fidgeted in his own seat by the gunnery panel suddenly the forcedome over the city flickered flashed bright orange and boiled backwards leaving a gap renarks finger smashed down on the firing switch the ship trembled screamed and lifted then they were through the gap in the screen whining up through the clouds towards the madness of the shifters space thron ships spotted them instantly and came flashing in their direction asquiol didnt wait for renarks order this time as they sped into deep space he fired the thron ships flickered away from the cold searing stream of antineutrons which asquiol in his desperation had dared again to employ and which their instruments told them meant instant disruption even so some vessels were caught for an instant in the periphery of the deadly flow and must have suffered for it antineutrons possessing no electrical charge could not be stopped by any energy screen asquiol could almost see the thron licking their wounds he had hoped that this first exchange would frighten the attackers badly enough to give renark time to make a clean getaway but the thron had the advantage of being able to manoeuvre in shifter space renark gritted his teeth as he piled on power and plunged into the billowy twistiness which this region presented to his mind it was almost like piloting a boat through mad stormtossed seas but they were seas that intruded into the mind the thron came after them and asquiol saw them somersault preparatory to firing he hesitated reluctant to use his weapon a second time then great slams of force hit them the ship skidded and bucked dont pussyfoot asquiol renark roared uncharacteristically let them have it asquiol clung to the firming arm of the antineutron gun blindly he turned up the density to maximum and sprayed space phantasmal green flares snowed on the screen before him where he scored hits renark closed his eyes and concentrated hard on the piloting the collapse of atomic structures on a large scale was not a pleasant experience for a space senser after that the surviving thron ships withdrew there was silence in the cabin of renarks ship for some time a few hours later renark made a quick mental exploration he found what hed expected the shaarn had begun the first stages of the experiment there was evidence of fierce fighting near the thron planet and somewhere sunward a sizeable installation was being set up he probed further at present the shaarn were unmolested but not for long a large fleet was assembled an hours journey away and would soon no doubt do much to impede the progress of the shaarns labours in spite of the friendliness shown him by his hosts renark began to regret the thron warships destroyed by asquiol soon renark felt he would be gaining a complete picture of the workings of the multiverse there were other things he wished to know and he had a feeling that if he lived he would know them soon once again they were experiencing the chaotic and bewildering currents of outer space but this time there was little emotional reaction for their selfconfidence was strong but renark still had to fight to keep the ship on course in the stormy lawless and random flowings of time and space skimming the ship over them like a stone over water through myriad sterechronia through a thousand million twists of the spatial flow to come finally to ekiversh seven immediately they landed on the peaceful oxygen planet tiny polite threads of thought touched their minds asked questions responding to the delicacy of the impressions renark and asquiol made it clear that they wished to contact the ekiversh as the shaarn had suggested they remained in the spaceship pleased to see the light green chlorophyllbearing plants which were not unlike earths at last there appeared outside the ship what at first appeared to be a heaving mass of semitransparent jelly disgusted renark was repelled by the sight and asquiol said the jellysmellies remember i told you they were some sort of legend on entropium metazoa ugh a voice in asquiols head said humbly we are deeply sorry that our physical appearance should not appeal perhaps this will be a better form then the whole mass reared up and slowly transformed itself into the shape of a giant man a giant man comprised of hundreds of gelatinous metazoa renark could not decide which form was least unattractive but he blocked the idea out of his mind and said instead we have come to converse with you on matters of philosophy and practical importance to us and our race may we leave our ship it would be good to breathe real air again but the metazoan giant replied regretfully it would be unwise for though we absorb oxygen as you do the waste gases we exhale are unpleasing to your sense of smell the jellysmellies renark said to asquiol that explains their name we were informed that you are equipped with racememory that in effect you are immortal renark thought tentatively at the glutinous giant that is so our great experience as you may know was to have witnessed in the early days of our race the dance of a galaxy forgive me but i dont understand the implications of that renark said could you perhaps explain what you mean it was believed said metazoa that those whom we call the doomed folk had passed away in a distant galaxy in our original universe and that galaxy which had known great strife was quiet again in readiness for the great turn which would be the beginning of a new cycle in its long life we and other watchers in nearby galaxies saw it shift like a smoky monster saw it curl and writhe and its suns and planets pour in ordered patterns around the hub and out around the rim reforming their ranks in preparation the dance of the stars was a sight to destroy all but the noblest of watchers for the weaving patterns depicted the two truths which bear the third so that while the galaxy reformed itself to begin a fresh cycle through its particular time and space it also cleansed its sister galaxies of petty spirits and those who thought ignoble thoughts for millions of years the dance of the galaxy progressed ordered creation a sight so pleasing to intelligent beings it gave us much in the way of sensory experiences and also enabled us to develop our philosophy please do not ask us to explain it further for the sight of a galaxy dancing can be defined in no terms possessed by either of us when at last the dance was over the hub began to spin setting the pattern for the new cycle and slowly from the hub outwards to the rim the suns and planets began to turn again in a course that would be unchanged for eons so it began and so after time had passed did its denizens begin to hammer out its marvellous history they came at length to our galaxy and because they were impatient of the philosophical conclusions we had drawn about the nature of the multiverse set about destroying our ancient race a few of us fled here since we abhor violence or knowledge of violence you witnessed a galaxy reorder itself by its own volition renark sensed at last that his most important question was close to being answered not we feel by its own volition our logic has led us inescapably to believe that there is a greater force at work one which created the multiverse for its own purposes this is not a metaphysical conclusion we are materialists but the facts are such that they point to the existence of beings who are in the true sense supernatural and the multiverse what of that does it consist of an infinite number of layers or the multiverse is finite vast as it is it has limitations and beyond those limitations exist other realities perhaps renark was silent all his life he had accepted the concept of infinity but even his rapidly developing mind could not quite contain the new concept hovering at the edge of his consciousness we believe said the metazoa gently that life as we know it is in an undeveloped crude state that you and we represent perhaps the first stage in the creation of entities designed at length to transcend the limitations of the multiverse it has been our function all of us to have created some sort of order out of original chaos there is no such thing even now as cause and effect there is still only cause and coincidence coincidence and effect there is no such thing and this of course is obvious to any intelligence there is no such thing as free will there is only limited choice we are limited not only by our environment but by our psychological condition by our physical needs everywhere we turn we are limited the ekiversh believe that though this is true we can conceive of a condition in which this is not so and perhaps in time conceive that condition i agree renark nodded it is possible to overcome all restrictions if the will is strong enough that may be so you have certainly come through more than any other entity and it has been your spirit which has been the only thing to keep your mind and body coordinated for so long but if you wish to continue your quest for as far as you can go in a finite universe you have the worst experience to come what do you mean you must go to the lattice planet there you will meet the dwellers in the abyss of reality perhaps you have heard of the place as the hole yes renark had heard the name he remembered where mary had told him about it what exactly is this planet it does not move through the multiverse in the same way as the rest of the planets in this system yet in a sense it exists in all of them pieces of it move in different dimensions all shifting independently sometimes the planet may be fairly complete on random occasions at other times the planet is full of gaps where parts of it have ceased to exist according to the dimensional laws operating in whichever continua the shifter is in it is believed that there exists somewhere in this planet a gateway through to a mythical race called the originators since you have nowhere else to go we would suggest that you risk a visit to this planet and attempt to find the gateway if it exists yes we shall try said renark softly then another thought came to him why isnt this planet ekiversh subject to the same chaotic conditions existing elsewhere he asked that is because before we fled our home universe we prepared for the conditions which we expected to meet and we used our skill and knowledge to create a very special organism the glutinous giant seemed to heave its shining body before the next thought came we call it a conservator the conservator is simply an object but an object of a peculiar kind which can only exist under a certain set of laws in order to maintain its own existence it conserves these laws for a distance around it these laws of course are those under which we exist and under which you for the most part exist also with a conservator in your ship you will not experience your earlier difficulties in traversing interplanetary space and also you will be less likely to lose your way on the lattice planet which incidentally you know of as roth or ragged ruth i am grateful renark said the conservator will be of great assistance then another thought occurred to him you are aware of my reason for coming here because the universe where i belong is contracting could not a number of these conservators be built in order to stop the course which my universe is taking impossible your universe is not contravening any natural laws the laws which apply to it are bringing about this change you must discover why this is happening for everything has a purpose and discover what part your race is to play in this reorganisation very well said renark humbly several of the metazoa detached themselves from the main body and disappeared in the direction of a line of hills travelling rapidly we go to fetch a conservator the pseudogiant told him renark used the wait to explore his own state of mind strangely without any great strain he could now accept the enormity of the realisation which had been dawning in him ever since he first came to the shifter and he knew now unquestioningly that his whole journey his trials and endeavours had had from the beginning a definite purpose there was logic in the multiverse the ekiversh had convinced him and that purpose he thought with dawning clarity transcended his original one transcended it and yet was part of it but there was much more he felt to undergo before this new need in him would be consummated for now he was to undergo the worst part of the journey to the planet that had sent mary the maze insane ruth ragged ruth the lattice planet the metazoa returned bearing a small globe of a dull ochre colouring this they placed on the ground near the airlock of the spaceship we shall leave you now the metazoa telepathed but let us wish you knowledge you renark and asquiol are the messengers for the multiverse you must represent us all if you succeed in reaching the originators presuming they exist you go further towards reality than any other intelligent beings apart from the dwellers of the hole have done before asquiol got into a suit and went outside to collect the conservator renark watched him his gaze unblinking his thoughts distant as he returned and placed the globe on the chart desk beside renark automatically renark prepared himself for takeoff thanked the metazoa and pressed the drive control then they were plunging upwards cutting a pathway of law through the tumbling insanity of interplanetary space but this time there was no need to fight it the conservator acted just as the ekiversh had predicted setting up a field all about itself where its own laws operated relieved they had time to talk asquiol had been taken aback by all the events and information he had received he said renark im still bewildered why exactly are we going to roth renarks mood was detached his voice sounding far away even to his own ears to save the human race i am realising now that the means of salvation are of a subtler kind than i previously suspected that is all but surely we have lost sight of the original purpose for this mission more we are living in a fantasy world this talk of reality is nonsense renark was not prepared to argue only to explain the time has come for the dismantling of fantasies that is already happening to our universe now that we have this one chance of survival we must finally rid ourselves of fantasies and seize that chance for centuries our race has built on false assumptions if you build a fantasy based on a false assumption and continue to build on such a fantasy your whole existence becomes a lie which you implant in others who are too lazy or too busy to question its truth in this manner you threaten the very existence of reality because by refusing to obey its laws those laws engulf and destroy you the human race has for too long been manufacturing convenient fantasies and calling them laws for ages this was so take war for instance politicians assume that something is true assume that strife is inevitable and by building on such false assumptions lo and behold they create further wars which they have ostensibly sought to prevent we have until now accepted too many fantasies as being truths too many truths as fantasies and we have one last chance to discover the real nature of our existence i am prepared to take it and i asquiol spoke softly but with conviction he paused and then added with a faint halfsmile though you must forgive me if i still do not fully comprehend your argument youll understand it soon enough if things go right renark smiled broadly roth now loomed huge on the laser screens with a deliberate lack of reverence asquiol commented it looks like a great maggoty cheese doesnt it in the places seeming like glowing sores they could see right through the planet in other places there were gaps which jarred the eyes numbed the mind although they could see vaguely the circular outline the planet was gashed as though some monstrous worm had chewed at it like a caterpillar on a leaf refusing to let the sight overawe him though it threatened to renark brought his skill as a guide senser to bear deliberately yet warily he probed the mass of the weird planet where the gaps were he sensed occasionally the existence of parts of the planet which should by all the laws he knew be in the same spacetime but they were not they existed outside in many other levels of the multiverse he continued to probe and at last found what he was searching for sentient life a warmth filled him momentarily had he found the dwellers these beings appeared not wholly solid seemed to exist on all layers of the multiverse could it be possible he wondered did these beings exist on all planes and thus experience the full knowledge of reality unlike the denizens who only saw their own particular universe and only experienced a fraction of the multiverse though he could conceive the possibility his mind could not imagine what these beings might be like or what they saw perhaps he would find out he understood now why mary the maze played insanely with her lifeless keyboard in a tavern on entropium another thought came to him and he felt about with his mind and learned with a sinking regret that the shaarn had succeeded in beating back the thron he could not tell definitely but it seemed that the shifters motion through the multiversal levels was slowing down hastily he relocated the dwellers there were not many and they were on a part of the planet he felt he could find a part not having its whole existence in the area now occupied by the shifter but probably visible to the human eye with the aid of the conservator he felt fairly certain of finding the mysterious hole speed was important but so was caution he did not wish to suffer an ironical end perishing now that he was so close to his goal he brought the ship down over a gap in order to test the conservators powers they were extremely strong as he came closer the planet seemed to form itself under him as the missing piece shifted into place like a section of a jigsaw puzzle it worked now renark lifted the ship away again and saw the piece fade back wrenched into its previous continuum he could not afford to land his ship on such a dangerous location so he moved on and came down slowly on a surface which he hoped would remain in this continuum until he was ready to return if he did return he told himself the ominous activity near the binary was increasing perhaps already the shifter had stopped asquiol was silent he clutched the conservator to him as he followed renark put of the ships airlock the planet seemed a formless mass of swirling gases and they received a distinct sense of weightlessness for a moment as they placed their feet on its unnatural surface dominated by the dreamlike insecurity of the planet striking first patches of weightlessness and later patches where their feet seemed entrenched in dragging mud they moved warily on renark in the lead though it was dark the planet seemed to possess its own luminous aura so that they could see a fair distance around them but there were places where somehow their vision could not penetrate yet they could see beyond these places even when they walked on rocky ground it seemed impermanent as they moved the area immediately around them would sometimes alter as the conservator exerted its strange power but as if to compensate for this new gaps continued to form elsewhere straggling to keep his objective clear renark felt ahead with his mind awed by the remarkable fluxions taking place constantly the planet was perpetually shifting it was impossible to tell which part of it would be in existence even for a few moments at a time sundered matter as chaotic as the unformed stuff of the multiverse at the dawn of creation wrenched spread and flung itself about as if in agony but remorselessly renark pushed onward filled with a sense of purpose which dominated his whole being stumbling on drunk by their visions of chaos they did not lose their objective for a moment sometimes near sometimes distant the hole became their lodestar beckoning them with a promise of truth or destruction eight at last after more than a weary day they stood above the hole and as rock unformed itself and became gas renark said hollowly they are in there this is where well find them but i do not know what they are though their tiredness made them inactive renark felt that he had never been more conscious more receptive to what he saw but his reception was passive he could only look at the shifting shining dark and myriadcoloured hole as it throbbed with power and energy they stared down at it filled with knowledge and emotion after several hours silence asquiol spoke what now he said this is the gateway of which we learned on thron and ekiversh said renark i can do nothing now but descend into it in the hope of achieving our aim now the human race seemed remote a fantasy unreal and yet important more important than it had ever been before he moved towards the very brink of the hole and lowered himself into its pulsing embrace asquiol paused for a moment behind him and then followed they ceased to climb down for they were now floating going neither up nor down nor in any definite direction but yet floating somewhere the conservator had ceased to work unless it still worked and in some way these laws applied more rigorously to it than any it had previously conserved again they were on solid ground on a small island in an ocean they stepped forward and knew they were in the heart of a blazing sun stepped back and were in the middle of a bleak mountain range from the tops of the mountains an entity looked down and welcomed them they moved towards it and were suddenly in an artificial chamber which seemed at first to have dead black walls then they realised they were looking out into a void emptiness to their left a being appeared it seemed to be constantly fading and reappearing like a badlytuned laser set renark thought desperately looking for something to cling to he felt cut off entirely from anything he knew the being began to speak it was not terran he spoke he conversed in a combination of sonic and thoughtwaves which struck responses in renarks mind and body he realised that these entities may have once been like himself but had lost the power of direct speech when they gained the power to dwell on all levels of the multiverse he found he could communicate with the entity by modulating his own speech and thinking as far as possible in pictures you wish help yes you from renark deliberated the meaning of this but did not take long to realise what the entity was trying to say already he had half realised the significance logic based on the evidence he had seen and heard in the rest of the shifter was leading renark towards an inescapable conclusion yes he said you must wait for what picture of a vast universe multiplaned turning about a central point until renark realised what the picture meant it could only mean one thing he had only been shown it briefly yet he understood clearly he had been shown the centre of the universe the original place through which all the universal radii passed from which all things had come there were no alternate universes at the centre when the shifter passed through the centre what but what if the shaarn succeeded in stopping the systems progress before it reached the hub he had to dismiss the idea if the shifter stopped too soon there would be no need for further speculation no need for anything what will happen there he asked truth you must wait here until then go he had to wait in limbo until the shifter reached the hub and then they must journey towards no into the sun he transmitted a horrified picture of himself and asquiol burning the being said no and disappeared again when it reappeared renark said why you are expected the being faded then vanished since time did not exist here they couldnt tell how long they had waited there were none of the usual bodily indications that time was passing quite simply they were in limbo every so often the being or one like it would reappear sometimes he would impart information regarding the shifters slow progress sometimes he would just be there once a number of his kind appeared but vanished immediately then finally the dweller appeared and a picture of the shifter entering the area of the multiversal centre manifested itself in renarks mind with relief and a bounding sense of anticipation he prepared to experience truth soon whether he lived or died remained sane or went insane he would know he and asquiol would be the first of their race to know and this they both realised was all that mattered then they went outwards they went towards the flaring agonisingly brilliant suns they felt they had no physical form as they had known it and yet could sense the stuff of their bodies clinging about them they poured their massless bodies into the fiery heat the heart of the star and eventually came to the place of the originators not their natural habitat but a compromise between renarks and theirs they saw without using their eyes the originators they could hear the originators communicating but there was no sound all was colour light and formlessness yet everything had a quality of bright existence true reality you are here said the originators musingly as one we have been awaiting you and grown somewhat impatient your rate of development was not what we had hoped on behalf of his race in the knowledge of what the originators meant renark said i am sorry you were always a race to progress only when danger threatened do we still exist renark asked yes for how long asquiol spoke for the first time the originators did not answer his question directly instead they said you wish us to make changes we expected this that is why we speeded up the metamorphosis of your universe you understand that although your universe is contracting it will still exist as individual galaxies suns and planets matter of most kinds in different formations but the human race what of that we should have let it die intelligent organic life cannot undergo the strains of the change if you had not come to us we should have let it die regretfully but our judgment was correct we let you know of the coming catastrophe and you used all your resources of will and judgment to come here as we hoped you would there was a pause and then the originators continued like all other races in the multiverse yours is capable of existing on all levels not just one but because of these links you have with the rest of the levels you would have perished being not fully natural to just one level none of the intelligent forms could survive such a catastrophe we were responsible for placing them all in their present environment each plane of the multiverse serves as a separate seeding bed for a multitude of races one of which may survive and succeed us your plane serves in your terms as a womb you are our children our hope but if you fail to overcome the special limitations we set upon you you like us shall die but you shall die stillborn then what is to become of us we made the changes in your universe in order to accelerate your rate of development so that representatives of your race would find a way to us to the greatest extent you have succeeded but you must return rapidly and inform your race of their need to develop more rapidly more dynamically we shall afford you the means this time of evacuating your universe but we are growing old and you of all the intelligent races in the multiverse are needed to take our place you cannot do that until you are ready either you succeed in achieving your birthright or like us perish in chaos and agony you have proved to us that we were justified in selecting you but you can overcome the boundaries we set around you but hurry we beg you hurry what will happen if we succeed you will experience a stage of metamorphosis soon you will no longer need a universe of the kind you know now things are coming to an end you have the choice of life more than life or death renark accepted this it was all he could do and us what is our function now to perform what you set out to do there was a long long pause wombwarmth filled the two men and tune stopped for them as the originators exuded sympathy and understanding but glowing like hard reality beneath this renark sensed his own oblivion his own death something lay there in the future something ominous was in store for him you are right renark said the originators i cant be right or wrong i have no idea what my fate is but you sense perhaps our foreknowledge of your termination as a physical entity perhaps your end as a conscious entity it is hard to tell your spirit is a great one renark a mighty spirit that is too great for the flesh that chains it it must be allowed to spread to permeate the multiverse so be it renark said slowly asquiol could neither understand nor believe what the originators were saying his form golden flashing red bounced and flared before renark as he said are you to die renark no no renarks voice roared like a tower of flame he addressed his friend when i am gone you must lead our race you must direct them towards their destiny or perish with them do you understand i accept what you say but without understanding this experience is driving us to madness the cool tones of the originators swept inwards like flowing ice to catch their attention and silence them not yet not yet you must both retain something of your old forms and your old convictions your part is not played out yet now that you understand the nature of the multiverse it will not be difficult to supply you with material means for escaping your shrinking universe we will give you knowledge of a machine to produce a warp effect and enable your people to travel to another safer universe where they will undergo further tests our plans have not fully worked themselves out yet there are others of your race involved and you must meet and react and harden one another before you can fulfill the destiny we offer you you asquiol will be entrusted with this part of the mission renark is the strongest asquiol said quietly therefore renarks spirit must be sacrificed as a gift to the rest of you this is necessary how shall we accomplish this exodus to a new universe renark asked hollowly we will help we shall instil in your fellow creatures a trust in the word of you both it will necessarily be a temporary thing once you have left your universe our workings must be of a subtler sort and only the efforts of certain individuals will save you we shall be on our own asquiol questioned virtually yes what shall we find in this new universe we do not know for it is likely that your jump will be a random one into any of the other multiversal planes we cannot guarantee you a friendly reception there are forces opposed to our purpose meaner intellects who strive to prevent the evolution of our being our being asquiols shape flickered and reformed yours ours everyones we the originators call ourselves intelligent optimists since we see a purpose of sorts to existence but there are pessimists in the universe they prey upon us seek to destroy us since they themselves have given up hope of ever breaking the bonds which chain them to the halfreal state in which they exist they have their unknowing supporters among your own segment of the total race i understand with those two words they became whole men they saw at last the real universe the myriadplaned universe comprising many many dimensions so that there was no empty space at all but a crowded rich existence through which they had previously moved unknowing with an effort of his titanic will renark said urgently one thing what is your purpose what is our ultimate purpose to exist was the simple reply you cannot have as yet real knowledge of what that means existence is the beginning and the end whatever significance you choose to put upon it is irrelevant if we were to die before you were ready to take our place then all our creation would die the multiverse would die chaos would flood over everything and a formless mindless fluctuating shroud would mark our passing we do not want that said asquiol and renark together neither do we that is why you are here now the information you will need their minds it seemed were taken by a gentle hand and sent along a certain course of logic until at length they had complete understanding of the principle involved in building dimensiontravelling spaceships in what was for them normal spacetime it would have been virtually impossible to have formulated the principle in all its aspects but now dwelling in the whole multiverse the logic seemed simple they were confident that they could impart the information to their own race are you satisfied the originators asked perfectly renark said we must hurry now and return to our own universe the exodus must begin as soon as possible farewell renark it is unlikely that when we meet again you will remember us farewell asquiol when we meet again let us hope that you have succeeded in this matter let us hope so asquiol said gravely then their beings were spreading backwards and streaming through the multiverse towards the ship which still lay on roth nine the traveller stopped at the sagging filling station the last human artifact before the long grey road began again a huge shapeless haversack bulged on his stooping back but he walked along effortlessly smiling in the depths of his lean black face his hair and beard wild about him kaal yinsen whistled to himself and took the road north it was several centuries since the earth had been populated by more than the few thousand people living here now and this was the way he liked it kaal yinsen had never had a dream in his life and when this one came it came with force the road faded the whole surface of the planet reared up whirled and bellowed suddenly he knew he must head south again this he did and was joined on the way by hundreds of families going in the same direction bossan glinqvist lord of orion sat in an office which was part of an isolated metal city hanging in space close to the heart of the galaxy he picked up the file on drenner macneer and began to leaf through it not sure that his duties as moderator in the council of galactic lords were sufficiently satisfying to make him live a third of his adult life in so unnatural an environment macneers case was a difficult one requiring all glinqvists concentration and intelligence to judge the man had instigated a breachofcode suit against the council accusing it of failing to represent the interests of a minority group of traders who because of a change in a tariff agreement between laming and balesorn in the clive system had lost their initiative to survive by labour and were currently living off the citizens grant on a remote outworld it was a serious matter glinqvist looked up frowning and experienced a powerful hallucination soon afterwards he was giving orders for the city to be set in motion an unprecedented order and directed toward the kassim system these were but two examples of what was happening to every intelligent denizen of the galaxy every human being adult or child was filled with the same compulsion to journey towards certain central planets where they gathered and waited patiently on earth the few inhabitants of the planet felt that the very ground would give beneath the weight of so many newcomers normally they would have been resentful of the appearance of outsiders on the recently healed globe but now with them they waited and at last they were rewarded they saw its vague outlines in the sky on laser screens all over the planet they watched it land on a tendril of fire a spaceship a police cruiser it was scarred and battered it looked old and scarcely spaceworthy there was silence everywhere as they watched the airlock open and two figures emerge millions of pairs of eyes winced and failed to focus properly upon the figures they strained to see all the figures but it was impossible the men who came out of the ship were like ghostly chameleons their hazy bodies shifting with colour and energy and light the watchers seemed to see many images overlaid on the two they recognised as men images which seemed to stretch out into other dimensions beyond their powers to see or to imagine these visitors were like angels their set faces glowed with knowledge the matter of their bodies was iridescent thenwords when they began to speak throbbed in tempo with the pulse of the planet so that it was as if they heard an earthquake speak or an ocean or a volcano or even the sun itself giving voice yet they understood that these messengers were human but humans so altered that it was almost impossible to regard them as such they listened in awe to the words and in part at least they understood what they must do renark and asquiol delivered the ultimate message they told of the threat inherent in the contracting universe they told how this had come about and why and then they told how the destruction of the race could be avoided they spoke clearly in careful terms looking out at their listeners from the depths of their faraway minds no longer existing wholly in any one plane of the multiverse they needed to concentrate in order to keep this single level in complete focus the myriad dimensions of the multiverse coursed in everchanging beauty as they spoke but this experience they could not as yet convey for it was beyond speech and the stuff of their bodies changed with the multiverse in scintillating harmony so that the watchers could not always see them as men but nonetheless they listened they listened and learned that the multiverse contained many levels and that their universe was but one level a fragment of the great whole that it was finite yet beyond the power of their minds to comprehend they learned that this structure had been created by beings called the originators they learned that the originators sensing they would die had created the multiverse as a seeding ground for a race to take their place they learned that they the embryonic children of the originators were to be given their last chance to take over they were given a choice understand and overcome the pseudoreal boundaries of time and space as they understood them therefore claiming their birthright or perish then renark and asquiol left the planet earth passing on to another and then another to impart their news wherever they passed they left behind them awed silence and each human being that heard them was left with a feeling of completeness such as he knew he had been searching for all his life then the two multifaceted messengers called technicians and scientists and philosophers to them and told these men what they must do soon after the vehicles which had been fitted with the intercontinuatravelling device swarmed in the depths of space beyond the rim ready to carry the human race into another universe at the head of the tremendous spacecaravan the small battered police cruiser lay in it renark and asquiol took their final leave of one another outside the cruiser a small spacecar awaited renark the two beings the new men looked at one anothers shifting forms stared about them to absorb the pulsating sight of the total multiverse clasped hands but said nothing it was preordained that this must happen sorrowfully asquiol watched his friend board the spacecar and vanish back towards the hub of the galaxy now he had to make ready the giant fleet the galactic lords had sworn him full powers of leadership until such a time as he would no longer be needed the efficient administration which had run the galaxy for many years was admirably suited to organising the vast fleet and they took asquiols orders and translated them into action at precisely hours general time each ship will engage its it drive asquiols lonely voice echoed across the void through which the fleet drifted somewhere out of sight of asquiol or the human race a small figure halted its spacecar climbed into a suit clambered from the car and hung in space as it drifted away now they could observe the galaxies rushing down upon one another they came together and joined in one blazing symphony of light as the human race plunged through the dimensions to the safety of another universe where another intelligent lifeform waited to receive it perhaps in friendship perhaps in resentment then the contraction was swifter sudden and renark remained behind why the race would never know and even renark was uncertain of his reasons he only knew there had to be a sacrifice was it the ancient creed of his savage ancestors translated into the terms of the originators or did his action have some greater meaning there would be no answer there could be none faster and faster the universe contracted until all of it existed in an area that seemed little larger than renarks hand still it shrank as renark watched it now as if from a distance then it vanished from his sight though he could still sense it was still aware of its rapidly decreasing size he knew that there was a point to which a thing can be reduced before it ceases to exist and finally that point was reached now there was a gap a real flaw in the fabric of the multiverse itself his universe the galaxy the earth were no longer there possibly absorbed into a larger universe beyond even renarks marvellous senses perhaps in this greater universe his universe existed as a photon somewhere only renark was left his shifting shimmering body moving in a void the stuff of it beginning to dissipate and disappear god he said as everything vanished his voice echoed and ached through the deserted gulf and renark lived that moment forever ten in his deep sorrow asquiol was resolved to carry on renarks work and bring to finality the originators plans for the human race the fleet was dropping dropping dropping through layer after layer of the multiverse in a barely controlled escape dive soon he must give the order to slow down and halt on one level he had no idea which to choose though he was aware of the multiverse his vision unlike renarks could not extend beyond its previous limits he had no inkling of what to expect in the universe in which they would finally stop in the great multiverse they were merely a scattering of seeds seeds that must survive many elements if they were to grow finite yet containing the stuff of infinity the multiverse wheeled in its gigantic movement through space to those who could observe it from beyond its boundaries the originators it appeared as a solid construction dense and huge yet within it there were many things many intelligences who did not realise that they dwelt in the multiverse since each layer was separated from another by dimensions dimensions that were like leaves between the layers here and there the mighty structure was flawed by fragments which moved through the dimensions through the leaves passing many universes by a vacuum existing where one small part had vanished but on the whole the universes remained unknown to one another they did not realise that they were part of a composite structure of fantastic complexity they did not realise their purpose or the purpose for which the multiverse had been created only the chosen knew and of them only a few understood so fleeing from their new nonexistent galaxy the human race began its great exodus into a new spacetimecontinuum pierced the walls of the dimensionbarrier and came at last into a new universe by this action man had also entered a new period of his history but asquiol of pompeii was no longer a man he had become many men and was therefore complete now there was no better leader for the human fleet no better mentor to guide it for asquiol was the new man existing in a multitude of dimensions his vision extended beyond the limitations of his fellows and saw all that men could one day become if they could make the effort asquiol of pompeii captain of destiny destroyer of boundaries becalmed in detachment opened his eyes from a sad reverie and observed the fleet he led his screen showed him the vast caravan of vessels there were spaceliners and battleships launches and factoryships ships of all kinds and for all purposes containing all the machinery of a complex society on the move there were ships of many designs some ornate some plain containing one part in common the it drive asquiol deliberately ceased to wonder why renark had elected to stay behind in the dying universe but he still wished it had not happened he missed the confidence which had come to him from renarks presence from renarks will and spirit but renark and his will were in the past now asquiol had to find strength only from within himself or perish and if he perished ceased to be what he was then the danger of the race itself perishing would be heightened considerably therefore he reasoned his survival and the survival of the race were linked twentyfour hours of relative time had not passed since the fleet left the home universe he decided that the next universe irrespective of what it was should be the one to remain in quickly he gave the order deactivate it drive at hours was in a sense that which separated one layer from another when all the layers were experienced as a whole there was no wasted vacuum no dark nothingness here was everything at once all possibilities all experience he was suddenly forced to pull himself back from this individual experience the special alarm over his laserscreen was shrilling urgently a face appeared on the screen it was pouched and puffy heavily jewelled like that of a bloodhound lord mordan asquiol said to the galactic lord who was captaininchief of police asquiol even now asquiols power was virtually absolute mordan couldnt bring himself to call him prince for the galactic council had not had time to restore the now meaningless title mordan spoke heavily our guide sensers and mind sensers have come up with important information we have located and contacted an intelligent species who appear to have noticed our entry into this spacetime they are evidently a startravelling race how have they reacted to our entry we arent sure the sensers are finding it difficult to adjust to their minds naturally it will take time to understand a nonhuman species let me know if you have any further news mordan had been screwing up his eyes while looking at asquiols image there appeared to be several images in fact each containing a different combination of colours overlapping one another it was as if asquiol looked out at mordan through a series of tinted opaque masks covering his body and interleaving on either side the image that mordan took to be the original lay slightly to one side of the multiple image and for him in better focus than the rest he evidently could not equate this image with what he remembered the cynical moody vital young man whom he had divested of title and power years before now he saw a lean saturnine man the face that of a fallen archangel stern with the weight of leadership the eyes sharp yet staring into a distance containing little that mordan felt he could observe with his usual feeling of relief mordan switched out and relayed asquiols message to the senser team as he waited for further news asquiol didnt exert his mind by trying to contact the new species directly that would come later he decided to allow the sensers time to assemble as much general data as possible before he turned his full attention to the problem he kept in mind the originators warning that certain intelligences were quite likely to receive the human race with insensate hostility but he hoped the universe they were in contained life that would welcome them and allow them to settle where they could if the intelligences were hostile the fleet was equipped to fight and in the last resort run he had already ordered the lifting of the ban on the antineutron cannon and this devastating armament was virtually invincible as far as he knew there was no known screen that could withstand it the fleet was already alerted for battle there was nothing to do at the moment but wait and see he returned his thoughts to problems of a different nature landing on and settling new planets within this galaxy would only be a minor problem compared with the task of taking over from the originators he thought of his race as a chicken in an egg within the shell it was alive but aware of nothing beyond the shell but with the act of breaking through the barrier of dimensions separating its universe from others it had broken from its enclosing and stifling shell to some awareness of the multiverse and the exact nature of things but a hatched chicken thought asquiol may believe the breaking of the shell to be the ultimate action of its life until the shell shattered and the whole world was visible in all its complexity then it discovered the farmyard and the countryside with all their many dangers it discovered that it was only a chick and must learn and act to survive if it was to grow to adulthood and what asquiol considered ironically was the eventual fate of the average chicken he wondered how many other races had got this far in the ages of the multiverses existence only one would survive and now it had to be the human race for if it did not attain its birthright before the originators died then none would take its place the multiverse would disintegrate back into the chaotic forces from which the originators had formed it death and the stuff of death would engulf the cosmos the tides of chance would roll over all existing things and the multiverse bereft of guidance and control would collapse all intelligence as the originators and their creations understood it would perish it was this knowledge that enabled him to keep his objective in the forefront the race must not perish it must survive and progress must achieve the marvellous birthright that was its promised destiny the race must replace the originators while there was still a little time was there sufficient time asquiol didnt know he had no way of knowing when the originators would die he had in this case to attempt to pack centuries of evolution into the shortest possible period whether immediate danger averted the race would allow him to continue with his mission he did not know now that the weird influence of the originators had been removed mankind could throw away its birthright and consequently the life of all ordered creation by one illjudged or fearinspired decision even now there were elements in the fleet who questioned his leadership questioned his vision and his motives it was easy to understand this questioning suspicious impulse which was at once mans salvation and doom without it he ceased to reason with it he often ceased to act to use the impulse objectively was the answer asquiol knew but how without the usual warning mordans face appeared on the laser he stared into emptiness since he preferred not to have to see asquiols disturbing image these intelligences are obviously preparing to attack us he said urgently so the worst had happened in which case the threat must be met what preparations are you making asquiol said in a level voice i have alerted our battle force and all essential craft are now protected by energy screens administration ships farm ships factory ships these i intend to reassemble at the centre of our formation since they are necessary for survival around these i will put all residential ships the third section comprises all fighting craft including privately owned vessels with worthwhile armament the operation is working fairly smoothly though there area few recalcitrants im having difficulty with we are forming to totally enclose your ship so that you are properly protected asquiol drew a deep breath and said slowly thank you lord mordan that sounds most efficient to mordan his voice seemed to produce like his image intrinsic faraway echoes that carried past mordan and beyond him how do you intend to deal with these recalcitrants i have conferred with the other members of the galactic council and we have come to a decision subject to your approval that decision is we will have to use more direct powers of action make emergency laws only to be declared null and void after the danger has passed the example of history should deter you from such a decision powers of dictatorship which you give me and yourselves once assumed are liable to last beyond the circumstances for which they were devised we have not employed coercion force or anything like it for several centuries asquiol there is no time for debate asquiol made up his mind immediately survival for the moment was of primary importance very well take on these powers force the recalcitrants to obey our orders but be sure not to abuse the powers or we will find ourselves weakened rather than strengthened this we know thank you asquiol watched his mood brooding and disquieted as the fleet redeployed into a great oval shape with his own battered ship in the centre the nut in an inordinately thick shell eleven adam roffrey was a psychopath a rebel without a cause a hater of state and organisation adam roffrey morosely watched the ships reforming about him but remained where he was refusing to answer the signal on his screen his large head made larger by the thick black beard and hair covering it had a dogged insolent set he was refusing to budge and he knew he was within his rights the flexible laws of the galaxy had been bent by him many times for the rights of the citizen were varied and complex he could not be forced to take part in a war without his permission the authorities could not even contact him therefore he sat tight ignoring the urgent signal when lord mordans bloodhound face appeared unauthorised on the laserscreen roffrey disguised his shock and smiled sardonically he said lightly as he always said things whatever the gravity of the statement its a lost cause lord mordan we cant hope to win we must be fantastically outnumbered asquiols forcing the race to commit suicide are we voting no said mordan were not for the duration of the emergency all citizens rights are liable to be waived if necessary you have no choice but to comply with the decision of asquiol and the galactic council asquiol knows whats best he doesnt know whats best for me im the only lost cause ive ever backed and thats the way its staying lord mordan regarded the blackbeardedgiant grinning out of the laser screen and he frowned nobody leaves the fleet roffrey for one thing its too dangerous and for another weve got to keep it tight and organised if were to survive he said the last words to a blank screen he whirled round in his control chair and shouted to a passing captain alert the perimeter guard a ship may try to leave stop it how lord mordan force if there is no other alternative said mordan shocking the captain who had never received such an order in his whole career adam roffrey had been antisocial all his life his living had been made on the fringes of the law he wasnt going to give in to the demands of society now the chips were down for the fleet that was his guess and he had no reason for sticking around he objected to the discipline required to fight complicated spacebattles he objected to the odds against the human race winning the battles he objected to the fact that he was being personally involved personal involvement was not in his line so he broke the energy seals on his antineutron cannon and prepared to blast out as he moved away from the rest of the fleet several geepee gunboats alerted by mordan flitted towards him from nadirnorthwest he rubbed his hairy chin scratched his hairy forehead and reached out a hairy hand to his drive control at full power he retreated away from the oncoming ships away from the fleet into the unknown space of the unknown universe he was prepared to take such chances to avoid curtailment of his personal liberty but his ship a peculiar vessel at first sight an impossible old hulk a space launch got up to look like a merchantman and fitted like a battlewagon could not hope to outdistance the geepee craft in the long run already they were beginning to catch up humming to himself he debated his best course of action there was one sure method of evading immediate danger as well as the alien threat already visible as a huge fleet of spherical vessels seen on his screens approached the fleet from the depths of space but to take that way out although he had considered it much earlier in another context could be highly dangerous the odds were that if he committed himself to it he would never see another human being again the necessity to make a decision was increasing his ship like all those in the great cosmic caravan was fitted with the it drive enabling him to travel through the dimensions he had already taken the trouble to learn all he could about multidimensional space and certain things existing in it he knew suddenly where he was going the idea had been in the back of his mind for years now he would be forced to go the geepee ships were getting closer their warning blaring on his communicator he pressed a button of his chartviewer keeping a wary eye on the oncoming ships though the geepees were nearer the two embattled fleets were far behind he saw faint splashes of coloured light on his screen he was tense and was surprised to note that he had a feeling half of relief half of guilt that he had missed the battle he wasnt a coward but now he had something to do a quick glance at the slide of equations on the viewer and his hand was reaching for the crudely constructed controls of the it drive he pulled a lever adjusted the controls and quite suddenly the geepee ships seemed to fade away and fading into the place where they had been was a backdrop of great blazing suns that made his eyes ache once again he experienced the unique sensation of falling through the layers of the multiverse rapidly as he operated the it drive the suns faded to be replaced by cold vacuum which was replaced by an agitation of gases heaving about in an unformed state scarlet and grey he was phasing quickly through the layers through universe after universe with only a slight feeling of nausea in his stomach and a fierce determination to reach his destination the geepee ships hadnt followed him they had probably decided that their first priority was to aid the human fleet he travelled through space as well as time and the separating dimensions and he was heading back in the direction where in his home universe the edge of the galaxy had been he had all the bearings he needed and as he moved on one level he moved through others at reckless speed he knew where he was going but whether he would make it was a question he couldnt answer asquiol of pompeii watched the battle on his screens with a feeling akin to helplessness mordan was conducting the war needing only basic orders from him am i doing as much as i could he wondered am i not accepting too complacently what i have discovered it was easy for him to dominate the fleet for his mind had become at once flexible and strong and his physical presence overawed his fellows there was a part of him too which was not at ease as if he were a jigsaw complete but for the last piece and the section that would complete him was just tantalisingly out of reach somewhere in the multiverse he felt the piece existed perhaps another intelligence that he could share his thoughts and experiences with he was almost certain it was out there yet what it was and how he would find it he did not know without it his picture of himself was incomplete he felt that he functioned but could not progress had the originators deliberately done this to him or had they made a mistake at first he had thought it was the loss of renark which gave him the sense of incompleteness but renarks loss was still there inside him kept out of mind as much as possible no this was another lack a lack of what though he bent closer to observe the battle the fleets formation was lost as yet another wave of attackers pounced out of space with weapons cutting lances of bright energy they were not impervious to antineutron cannon but the two forces were fairly matched as far as technology went there were more of the aliens and they had the double advantage of being in home territory and defending it this was what primarily worried asquiol but he could do nothing decisive at the moment he would have to wait again while mordan sweated to withstand and retaliate against this fresh attack asquiol let his mind and being drop through the layers of the multiverse and contact the alien commanders if they would not accept peace terms he strove to arrange a truce to his surprise this suggestion seemed acceptable to them there was an alternative to open war one which they would be delighted to negotiate that was the game they said play the game with us winner takes all after he had got some inkling of the games nature asquiol deliberately momentarily there were pros and cons finally he agreed and was soon watching the enemy ships retreating away into the void with some trepidation he informed mordan of his decision and awaited its outcome this new development in their struggle with the aliens disturbed lord mordan war he could understand this at first he could not all psychologists psychiatrists physiologists and kindred professionals had been ordered to the huge factory ship which engineers were already converting from now on according to asquiol the battle was to be fought from this single ship and it had no armaments asquiol was unapproachable as he conferred with the alien commanders in his own peculiar way every so often he would break off to issue strange orders something about a game yet what kind of game wondered lord mordan required experts in psychology as its players what was the complicated electronic equipment that technicians were installing in the great converted hold of the factory ship this is our only chance of winning asquiol had told him a slim one but if we learn how to play it properly we have a chance mordan sighed at least the truce had allowed them time to regroup and assess damage the damage had been great twothirds of the fleet had been destroyed farm ships and factory ships were working at full capacity to supply the fleet with necessities but tight rationing had been introduced the race was subsisting on survival rations the initial joy of escape was replaced by gloomy desperation adam roffrey could see his destination he slammed the it activator to the of position and coasted towards the looming system ahead it hung in empty space the outlines of its planets hazy following a random progression around a magnificent binary sun the legendary system rose larger on his laser screen the unnatural collection of worlds came closer the epic story of renark and asquiol on their quest to the sundered worlds was common lore among the human race these days but the story or at least part of it had had a special significance for roffrey renark and asquiol had left two members of their party behind willow kovacs and paul talfryn roffrey knew their names but dominant in his skull was another namea womans the woman he had come to find if he did not find her this time he told himself then he would have to accept that she was dead then he would have to accept his own death also such was the intensity of his obsession as he neared the sundered worlds he regarded them with curiosity they had changed the planets were spaced normally not equidistantly as he had thought and as far as he could tell the system had stopped shifting now he remembered part of the story which was fast becoming a myth among those who had fled their own galaxy a doglike race called the shaarn had attempted to stop the systems course through the dimensions evidently theyd succeeded his maps aided him to find entropium and he cruised into the shifters area warily for he knew enough to expect two kinds of danger the thron and the lawless nature of the shifter itself yet wary as he was it was impossible to observe either chaos or enemy as he swept down over entropium scanning the planet for the only city that had ever been built there he didnt find the city either he found instead a place where a city had been now it was jagged rubble he landed his ship on a scattered wasteland of twisted steel and smashed concrete scanning the surrounding ruins he saw shadowy shapes scuttling through the dark craters and between the shattered buildings his experience told him nothing about the cause of this catastrophe at length sick at heart he climbed into space armour strapped an antineutron pistol to his side descended to the airlock and placed his booted feet on the planets surface a bolt of energy flashed from a crater and spread itself over his forcescreen he staggered back to lean against one of his ships landing fins lugging the pistol from its holster he did not fire immediately for like everyone else he had a certain fear of the destructive effects of the an gun he saw an alien figure a dazzling white skin like melted plastic covering a squat skeleton long legs and short arms but no head that he could see appear over the edge of the crater a long metal tube cradled in its arms and pointing at him he fired the things wailing shriek resounded in his helmet it absorbed the buzzing stream of antineutrons collapsed melted and vanished over here roffrey turned to see a human figure all rags and filth waving to him he ran towards it ina crater which had been turned into a crude fortress by the piles of wreckage surrounding its perimeter roffrey found a handful of wretches the remnants of the human population of entropium the man who had waved had a fleshless head and huge eyes dirty scabcovered skin was drawn tight over his skull he fingered his emaciated body and eyed roffrey warily he said were starving here have you got any supplies what happened roffrey said feeling sick there was desolation everywhere these human beings had evidently banded together for protection against similar bands of aliens evidently also only the fittest survived the ragged man pointed at the rubble behind him this we dont know it just hit us why didnt you leave here no ships most of them were destroyed roffrey grimaced and said keep me covered while i return to my ship ill be back a short time later he came stumbling back over the rubble with a box in his hands his boots slipping and sliding on the uneven ground they clustered around him greedily as he handed out vitapacks something terrible had happened to the planet perhaps to the whole system he had to know what and why nowa woman separated herself from the group squatting over their food the man with the fleshless head followed her she said to roffrey you must be from the home galaxy how did you get here did they find how the shifter worked you mean renark and asquiol roffrey looked hard at the woman but he didnt know her he noted that she had obviously been beautiful probably still was under the filth and rags they got through they discovered more than they bargained for here but they got through our whole universe doesnt exist any more but the race or the part which left is still going maybe its wiped out by now i dont know the man with the fleshless head put his arm around the woman they looked like a pair of animated skeletons and the mans action enhanced the bizarre effect he didnt want you then and he wont now he said to her roffrey saw tension between them but couldnt understand why she said shut up paul are renark and asquiol safe roffrey shook his head renarks dead asquiols okay hes leading the fleet the geelord gave him complete leadership during the emergency they work under him now local boy makes good said the male skeleton roffrey felt he could name both of them now he pointed at the man are you paul talfryn talfryn nodded he cocked his head towards the woman she dropped her eyes this is willow kovacs my wife we sort of got married asquiols mentioned us eh i suppose he sent you back for us no willow kovacs shuddered roffrey reflected that she didnt appear to like talfryn very much there was a kind of apathetic hatred in her eyes probably she regarded talfryn merely as a protector even if that but it was no business of his what happened to the rest of the human population roffrey said concentrating on his own affairs and trying to ignore the sickening feeling of disgust at the sight of such degeneration were they all killed did you see anything when you came through the ruins talfryn asked little scuttling animal shapes maybe roffrey had seen them they had been repulsive though he didnt know why talfryn said all those little creatures were intelligent once for some reason the shifter stopped shifting there was a long period of absolute madness before she seemed to settle down again this happened that happened when the trouble started the actual forms of human beings and aliens changed devolving into these somebody said it was metabolic pressures combined with timeslips induced by the stop but i didnt understand it im no scientist an astrogeographer unlicensed you know he seemed to sink into an attitude of detachment and then looked up suddenly the city just crumbled it was horrifying a lot of people went mad i suppose asquiol told you ive never met asquiol roffrey broke in all my information is secondhand i came particularly to find another person a woman she helped renark with information mary the maze a mad woman know her talfryn pointed upwards to the streaked sky dead said roffrey gone talfryn said when the city started breaking apart she took one of the only ships and just spun off into space she probably killed herself she was like a zombie and quite crazy it was as if some outside pressure moved her i heard she wanted to get to roth that was a crazy thing to want to do in itself she took one of the best ships damn her a nice one mark seven hauser she was heading for roth isnt that the really strange planet as i said she was crazy to go there if she did get there you think thered be a chance of her still being alive if she made it maybe asquiol and renark obviously survived thanks for the information roffrey turned away hey the skeleton suddenly became animated youre not leaving us here take us with you take us back to the fleet for gods sake roffrey said im not going back to the fleet im going to roth then take us with you anywheres better than here willows voice was shrill and urgent roffrey paused deliberating then he said okay as they neared the ship something small and scaly scuttled across their path it was like nothing roffrey had seen before and he felt he never wanted to see it again entropium when it flourished had contained the seeds of corruption and now corruption was dominant a physical manifestation of a mental disease it was an unhealthy place with intelligent species scrabbling and fighting like animals to survive it was rotten with the sickness that came from a state of mind as much as anything he was glad to reach the ship as willow and talfryn climbed into the airlock he glanced back at the ruins his face was rather grim he helped them aboard and closed the lock now he turned his thoughts to mary the maze twelve roffrey debated his next move sitting hunched at the controls while he checked the astrochart before him it didnt tally with the shifter as it now was but it would do he could recognise descriptions of planets even though they had changed their location willow and talfryn were cleaning up they were both beginning to look better the ship itself was hardly tidy it was not even very clean and there was a smell of the workshop about it of oil burnt rubber dirty plastic and old leather roffrey liked it that way he scowled then he didnt like company im getting soft he told himself now he was going to roth he began to feel nervous at what he might find there talfryn said were ready he activated the ships normal drive and lifted off he was tempted to burn the city to rubble as he passed but he didnt he got into space with a feeling of relief heading in a series of flickering hops used for short journeys towards roth now hanging the farthest away from the parent binary as if deliberately set apart from the rest of the system roth more than any other planet in the shifter defied the very logic of the cosmos and existed contrary to all laws roth nicknamed ragged ruth he remembered still contained the impossible gaps there two men had become supersane but mary poor mary who had helped them she had found only madness there had she gone back to try and lay the ghost that was her insanity or had her motives been induced by madness perhaps he would find out the planet was big now the screens showed nothing but the monstrous globe with its speckled aura its shifting lightmist its black blotches and worst of all the gaps the gaps which were not so much seen as unseen something should be there but human eyes couldnt see it roffrey flung the ship down through roths erratically tugging gravisphere swinging down towards the unwelcoming surface which throbbed below like a sea of molten lava changing and shifting like the seas of hell there seemed to be no consistent gravity his instruments kept registering different findings he fought to keep the descent as smooth as possible concentrating on the operation while willow and talfryn gasped and muttered horrified by the vision he frowned wondering what was familiar about the disturbing world then he remembered that the one time he had seen renark and asquiol they had possessed a similar quality impossible to pin down but as if their bodies had existed on different levels only just invisible to the human eye yet this place was ominous the mens images had been beautiful ominous the word seethed around in his brain then for one brief second he passed through a warmth a pleasure a delight so exquisite yet so shortlived that it was as if he had lived and died in a moment he couldnt understand it he had no time to try as the ship rocked in response to the weirdly unbalanced tug of roths gravity he navigated with desperate skill gliding low over the flamemist boiling on the surface trying without success to peer into the gaps all his instruments operating on full power but few giving him any sensible readings and lasers scanning the unstable surface had mary tried perhaps like renark to find the originators had something driven her back to the world that had turned her mad then he spotted a ship on his screens a ship surrounded by achingly disturbing lightmist it was the mark seven hauser marys ship and his energraph told him that the drive was active that meant it had only recently landed or else was about to take off he had to land fast he made planetfall in a hurry cursing the sudden grip of gravity for which he only just succeeded in compensating as he brought his ship close to the other vessel his gauntleted fingers stabbed at buttons and he got into immediate contact with the hauser on a tight laser beam anyone aboard there was no reply both willow and talfryn were peering at the screen now bending over his shoulder this ship seems to have arrived only recently he said it meant nothing to them and he realised that it meant little to him either he was pinning his hopes on too thin a circumstance he operated the laser scanning as best he could the surrounding territory strange images jumped upon the screen fading as rapidly as they approached harsh craggy crazy roth with its sickness of rock and the horror of the misty intangible unnatural gaps that men could survive here was astounding yet evidently they could asquiol and mary had been living evidence but it was easy to see how they went mad hard to understand how they kept sane it was a gaping raw boiling dreadful world emanating it seemed stark malevolence and baleful anger in its constant and turbulent motion mary could easily have disappeared into one of the gaps or perished in some nameless way his lips tightened as he left the screen and opened the spacesuit locker if i need help ill call you in my suitphone he said as he picked up his discarded helmet if you need them suits are here he went to the airlocks elevator ill keep my suitphone receiver on if you see anything any trace of mary let me know have the scanners working fulltime youre a fool to go out there talfryn said heavily youre a nonparticipant in this roffrey said savagely as he clamped his faceplate dont interfere if its obvious that im dead youve got the ship to do what you like with ive got to see whats in the hauser now he was in the outer lock now he was lowering his body from the ship into a pool of yellow liquid that suddenly changed to shiny rock as he stepped on to it something slid and itched beneath his feet his lips were dry the skin of his face seemed cracked and brittle his eyes kept focusing and unfocusing but the most disturbing thing of all was the silence all his instincts told him that the ghastly changes taking place on the surface should make noise but they didnt this heightened the dreamlike quality of his motion over the shifting surface ina moment his own ship could no longer be seen and he reached the hauser noting that the lock was wide open both locks were open when he got inside gas of some kind swirled through the ship he went into the cabin and found traces of the pilot having been there recently there were some figures scribbled on a pad beside the chartviewer the equations were incomprehensible but they were in marys writing a quick search through the ship told him nothing more hastily he pulled himself through the cabin door and down the airlock shaft until he was again on the surface he peered with difficulty through the shifting flamemist it was thoroughly unnerving but he forced himself through it blindly searching for a mad woman who could have gone anywhere then two figures emerged out of the mist and just as suddenly merged back into it he was sure he recognised one of them he called after them they didnt reply he began to follow but lost sight of them then a piercing shout blasted into his suitphone asquiol oh asquiol he whirled around it was the voice of willow kovacs was asquiol looking for him had the fleet been defeated if so why had the two men ignored his shout asquiol come back its me willow but roffrey wanted to find mary the maze he wasnt interested in asquiol he began to run plunging through hallucinations through shapes that formed silently around him as if to engulf him through turquoise tunnels up mauve mountains in places gravity was low and he bounded along in others it became almost impossible to drag his bulk now he entered another low gravity patch and bounded with bonejarring suddenness into a heavy one painfully he lifted his booted feet barely able to support his heavy body then a voice perhaps through his suitphone perhaps not he recognised the voice his heart leapt its warm warm warm where now here but let me go back let me it was marys voice for a moment he didnt respond to the shock his mouth was dry his features petrified his body was frozen as he strained to hear the voice again mary where are you it was as if he were experiencing an awful dream where menace threatened but he was unable to escape where every step seemed to take every ounce of energy and every scrap of time he possessed again he croaked mary but it was not for some minutes that heard the reply keep moving dont stop dont stop he didnt know whether the words were addressed to him or not but he thought it best to obey then he began to sway and fall down but he kept moving then it was as if the whole planet were above him and he was like atlas slowly crumpling beneath its weight he screamed then willows voice blasted through asquiol asquiol what was happening it was all too confusing he couldnt grasp he felt faint he looked up and saw several small figures scurrying across the planet he held with his hands then he was growing growing growing again he screamed a hollow echoing roar in his ears his heart beat a frantic rhythm against his rib cage until his ears became filled with the noise he panted and struggled crawling up over the curved surface of the planet hanging on to it as if by his fingernails he was a great giant larger than the tiny planet but at the same time he was a flea crawling through syrup and cotton wool he laughed then in his madness he laughed and stopped abruptly grasping for the threads of sanity and pulling them together he was standing in a light gravity patch and things suddenly looked as normal as they could on roth he glanced through a patch in the mist and saw mary standing there he ran towards her mary asquiol the woman was willow kovacs in a suit marys old suit he made as if to strike her down but the look of disappointment on her face stopped him he pushed past her changed his mind came back willow marys here i know suddenly he realised the possible truth my god of course times so twisted and warped we could be seeing anything thats happened at any time in the past or the future another figure came stumbling out of the lightmist it was talfryn i couldnt contact you from the ship theres a woman there she its an illusion man get back to the ship you come with me its no illusion she entered the ship herself lead the way back roffrey said willow remained where she was refusing to budge at length they had to lift her squirming and carry her back it was only three yards away the woman wore a space suit she was lying on the floor of the cabin roffrey bent over her lifting the faceplate mary he said softly mary thank god the eyes opened the big soft eyes that had once held intelligence for a short time intelligence was there a look of incredible awareness then it faded and she formed her lips to say something but they twisted downwards into an idiot grin and she subsided into a blankeyed daze he got up wearily his body bowed he made a gesture with his left hand willow help her out of the suit well get her into a bunk willow looked at him with hatred asquiols out there you stopped me talfryn said even if he was he wouldnt want you you keep pining for him wishing youd followed him earlier now its too late its no good willow youve lost him for ever once he sees me hell take me back he loved me roffrey said impatiently to talfryn youd better help me then talfryn nodded they began getting her out of the suit willow said roffrey as they worked asquiol wasnt there not now you saw something that probably happened years ago the other man was renark and renarks dead you understand i saw him he heard me call him maybe i dont know dont worry willow were going back to the fleet if we can if it still exists youll see him then talfryn wrenched off a piece of spacearmour from marys body with a savage movement his teeth were clenched but he said nothing youre going back to the fleet but you said willow was disconcerted roffrey noted a peculiar look a mixture of eagerness and introspection mary needs treatment the only place shell get it is back there so thats where im going that should suit you it does she said yes it does he went over to the ports and closed their shutters so they couldnt see roths surface it felt a little safer talfryn said suddenly i get it willow youve made it plain i wont be bothering you from now on youd better not she turned on roffrey and that goes for you too for any man im asquiols woman as youll see when we get back to the fleet dont worry he grinned youre not my type she pushed back her lank hair piqued thanks she said roffrey smiled at mary who sat drooling and crooning in her bunk he winked at her youre my type mary he said genially thats cruel willow said sharply thats my wife roffrey smiled and then willow saw at least a trace of what the smiling eyes and grin hid she turned away lets get going said roffrey briskly now that he had made up his mind he wanted to waste no time returning to the fleet he couldnt guess how long mary had been on roth maybe only a few minutes of real time maybe a hundred years of roths time he did not allow himself to dwell on this just as he refused to consider the extent of her mental derangement the psychiatrists in the fleet might soon be supplying him with all the information they possibly could he was prepared to wait and see he went over to her she shrank away from him muttering and crooning her big eyes wider than ever very gently he made her lie down in the bunk and strapped her into it with safety harness it pained him that she didnt recognise him but he was still smiling and humming a little tune to himself as he climbed into the pilots seat heaved back a lever adjusted a couple of dials flipped a series of switches and soon the drone of the drive was drowning his own humming then in a flicker they were off into deep space and heading away from the sundered worlds into the depths of matterless void it was such an easy liftoff roffrey felt that it was almost as if a friendly hand had given them a push from behind it was with a sense of inevitability that he began the descent through the dimension layers heading back to the spacetime in which hed left the fleet of mankind meanwhile mens brains were jarred and jumbled as they strove to master the game minds broke nerves snapped but while scarcely understanding what it was about lord mordan forced his team to continue convinced that humanitys chance of survival depended on winning whistling sounds were the first impressions roffrey received as he phased the ship out of the shifters spacetime and into the next level space around them suddenly became bright with stars the notquitefamiliar whirl of a spiral galaxy searing outwards in a wild sprawl of suns but the whistle was replaced by a dreadful moaning which pervaded the ship and made speech impossible roffrey was intent on the new instruments the little experience he had of the continuumtravelling device had shown him that the ship could easily slip back through the spacetime layers and become totally lost the instruments hadnt been designed for wide travelling of this kind and roffrey knew it but each separate universe in the multiverse had its particular coordinates and the instruments crude as they were could differentiate between them over the main laser screen roffrey had a chart which would enable him to recognise the universe into which the human race had fled but the journey could be dangerous perhaps impossible and then the noise increased to become painful no longer a monotone but a pulsating nerveracking whine roffrey phased into the next layer the galaxy ahead was a seething inferno of unformed matter hazy bright full of archetypal colour reds whites blacks yellows pouring about in slow disorder this was a universe in a state of either birth or dissolution there was nearsilence as roffrey phased out of this continuum and into the next his whistling which he had been doing all the while was light and cheerful then he heard marys groans and he stopped now they were in the centre of a galaxy massed stars lay in all directions he stared at them in wonder noticing how with every phase the matter filling the space around them seemed to change its position as well as its nature then the stars were gone and he was passing through a turbulent mass of dark gas which seemed to form into horrible halfrecognisable shapes which sickened him so that he could no longer look but had to concentrate on his instruments what he read there depressed and shocked him he was off course he chewed at his moustache debating what to do he didnt mention it to the others the coordinates corresponded to those on the chart above the screen as far as the ships instruments were concerned they were in the spacetime occupied by asquiol and the fleet i yet it was totally different from what he remembered gas swirled in it and he could not see the stars of the galaxy had the fleet been completely wiped out there was no other explanation then he cursed as the black gas suddenly became alive a roaring and monstrous beast manytendrilled dark blue flameeyed malevolent willow and talfryn gasped behind him as they saw it loom on the screen mary began shrieking the sounds filled the cabin the ship was heading straight towards the monster but how could something like this exist in the nearvacuum of space roffrey didnt have time for theories he broke the energy seals of his antineutron cannon as an acrid smell filled the cabin and the beast rapidly changed from deep blue to startling yellow the guns swung on the beast and roffrey stabbed the firing buttons then backed the ship away savagely the ship shuddered as the guns sent a deadly stream of antineutrons towards the monster meanwhile the beast seemed impossibly to be absorbing the beams and new heads had grown on its shoulders disgusting halfhuman faces gibbering and yelling and they could hear the cries roffrey felt and tasted bile in his throat talfryn was now bending over him staring at the screen what is it he shouted above marys screams how the hell should i know roffrey said viciously he righted the ships backward velocity stabbed the cannon buttons again he heaved his big body round in the control seat and said make yourself useful talfryn see if the coordinates on that chart tally absolutely with those on this screen the monster lurched through the dark mist towards the little launch its heads drooling and grinning there wasnt time to wonder what it was how it existed roffrey aimed at its main head he began to depress the firing button then it had gone there were a few wisps of gas in the dark sharp space of the galaxy roffrey immediately recognised they were in the right galaxy but now a new danger threatened replacing the monster was a squadron of fast spherical vessels those he had glimpsed just before leaving the fleet were they the victors cleaning up the last of the race they were passing on the zenithsouth flank of roffreys battered launch he trailed the ship round on a tight swing so that he was now directly facing the oncoming alien ships the launch was responding well but the cabin shook and rattled as he stood his vessel on a column of boiling black fire and glided away from the round ships having shot a tremendous burst towards them something was disturbing him he found it hard to concentrate properly talfryn was obviously having the same trouble a quick look behind him showed marys gaping mouth as she screamed and screamed talfryn clung instinctively to the handgrip and shouted the coordinates tally perfectly thats news roffrey said lightly willow had joined mary and was attempting to comfort her mary was rigid staring ahead of her with fixed glazed eyes it was as if she could see something that was invisible to the others her screams rang on a horrible ululation in the confined cabin willow peered through the bad light at the two men halfsilhouetted up ahead the one in the control seat the other standing over him their dark clothes picked out against the spluttering brightness of the screens and instruments their faces in shadow their hands white on the controls the lighting was very dim as all powersources were drained to provide the ship with maximum power she looked out of the nearest port space was blank suddenly colourless she looked back at the men and her vision was engulfed by a horrible disharmony of colour and noise sense impressions of all kinds obscene primeval terrible throwing her mind into disorder so that she found it almost impossible to differentiate between her five senses then when she had completely lost her ability to tell whether she was smelling or hearing a colour her head was filled with a single impression that combined as one thing to her sense smell sight touch sound and taste were all there but the combination produced a unified sense that all were blood red she thought she was dead roffrey shouted and the sound hung alone for a moment before he saw it merge into the blood red disharmony he felt madness approach and then recede approach and recede like a horrible tide for with each sweep it came a little closer his body vibrated with the tension sending out clouds of blood red trailers through the cabin which he saw no he heard it as the note of a muted trumpet it horrified him for now something else was creeping through something coming up from his oldest memories something of which he hadnt even been aware he was immersed in selfloathing selfpity suddenly knowing what a debased thing he was but there was something he didnt know what aiding him in spite of his confusion aiding him to cling to his personal being to sweat out the tumble of disordered impressions and terrible thoughts and to hit back he hit back mary was still quivering in willows arms taut tense no longer screaming the waves began to peter out willow struck too struck back at whatever it was that was doing this to them the waves faded and slowly their senses were restored to normal suddenly marys body relaxed she had passed out talfryn was slumped on the floor and roffrey was hunched in the control seat growling he peered through the rapidly fading pulsations and saw with satisfaction that the antineutrons had done their job though he hadnt been able to direct them properly nor had he been fully conscious of directing them some of the ships were making off others were warped lumps of metal spinning aimlessly in the void he began whistling to himself as he adjusted the controls the whistling died as he said you all right back there willow said what do you think superman mary and paul have passed out mary took it worse than any of us she seemed to bear the brunt of it what was it do you think i dont know maybe well get our answers soon why ive sighted our fleet thank god said willow and she began to tremble she dared not anticipate her reunion with asquiol roffrey headed for the fleet going back as fast as hed left thirteen the fleet had been badly depleted since he left it it was still big a sprawling collection of ships stretching mile upon mile in all directions and resembling nothing so much as a vast scrapyard guarded by the cruising geepee battlewagons like whales guarding a motley school of fish in the centre of the fleet a little distance from asquiols battered cruiser was a huge factory ship with the letters g emblazoned on its side this puzzled roffrey then the geepee patrol contacted him to his astonishment he had the pleasure of being received almost cordially they began to guide him into a position fairly close to the factory ship with the g on its side while roffrey was getting his ship into line a man in the loose unmilitary garb which was identical save for rank insignia with all other geepee uniforms appeared on the laser screen his stern bloodhound face puzzled the large band on his left sleeve also bore a letter g hello lord mordan roffrey said with cheerful defiance willow wondered at the vitality and control which roffrey must possess in order to seem suddenly so relaxed and untroubled lord mordan smiled ironically good morning so you decided to return and help us after all where have you been ive been on a mercy trip rescuing survivors from the shifter roffrey said virtuously i dont believe you mordan said candidly but i dont care youve just done something nobody thought was possible as soon as we assemble our data ill be getting in touch with you again we need all the help we can get in this business even yours were up against it roffrey were damn near finished he broke off as if to pull himself together now if you are carrying extra passengers youd better register them with the appropriate authorities he switched out what did all that mean said talfryn i dont know roffrey said but we may find out soon mordan obviously knows something the fleets evidently suffered from attacks such as we experienced yet there seems to be more order now the battle or whatever it is seems to have taken a different course willow kovacs cradled mary roffreys head in her arm and gently wiped a trickle of saliva from the mad womans mouth her heart was beating swiftly and her stomach seemed contracted her arms and legs weak she was very frightened now at the prospect of reunion with asquiol surely he had remained faithful to her roffrey locked the ships controls and came aft staring down at the two women with a light smile on his sensuous bearded mouth he began stripping off his suit and the overalls beneath revealing a plain quilted jacket of maroon plastileather and grubby white trousers tucked into soft leather kneeboots hows mary i dont know willow said shes obviously not sane yet theres a different quality about her insanity something i cant pin down a doctor maybe will help roffrey said he patted willows shoulder contact the admin ship will you talfryn send out a general call till you can get it okay talfryn said worst of all roffrey thought as he stared down at his wife had been the allpervading red blood red it had been unmistakable as blood red why had it affected him so badly what had it done to mary he scratched the back of his neck he hadnt slept since he left the fleet he was full of stimulants but he felt the need for some natural sleep maybe later when talfryn had contacted the registration ship which had as its job the classification of all members of the fleet so that it would be easier to administer the survivors if they at last made planetfall they were told that an official would be sent over in a short while roffrey said we need a psychiatrist of some sort quickly can you help try a hospital ship though its unlikely youll be lucky he tried a hospital ship the doctor in charge wasnt helpful no im afraid you wont get a psychiatrist for your wife if you need medical treatment well put her on our list were overworked its impossible to deal with all the casualties but youve got to help her roffrey bellowed the doctor didnt argue he just switched out roffrey bewildered by this swung round in his chair willow and talfryn were discussing the earlier conflict with the alien ships they must be hard pushed roffrey cursed but im going to get help for mary even if it means going right to the top but what about those hallucinations we had back there talfryn said what caused them its my guess we were experiencing the force of one of their weapons roffrey replied maybe what happened to us on roth made us more susceptible to hallucination a weapon yes it could be the communicator buzzed talfryn went to it registration said a jaunty voice mind if i come aboard he was a pale and perky midget with genial eyes and a very neat appearance his gig clamped against roffreys airlock and he came bustling through with a case of papers under his arm you would be captain adam roffrey he lisped staring up at the blackbearded giant roffrey stared down at him half in wonder i would be good and you embarked with the rest of the human race roughly two weeks ago relative time that is i dont know how long it was in your time since it is not always possible to leave and return from one dimension to another and keep the time flow the same kindly remember that ill try said roffrey wondering if there was a question there and these three are miss willow kovacs formerly of migaa the midget scribbled in his notebook looking prim at the mention of the planet migaa it had possessed something of a reputation in the home galaxy willow gave the rest of her data talfryn gave his and the other lady the little official asked my wife doctor mary roffrey born on earth nee ishenko anthropologist disappeared from golund on the rim in galactic general time reappeared from shifter system a short while ago the geepees will have all her details prior to her disappearance i gave them to the police when she disappeared as usual they did nothing the midget frowned then darted a look at mary state of health insane said roffrey quietly curable or otherwise curable said roffrey and the word was cold savage the tiny official completed his notes thanked them all and was about to leave when roffrey said just a minute could you fill me in on whats happened to the fleet since i left as long as we keep it brief id be pleased to remember im a busy little man he giggled just before we got here we had a tussle with some alien ships experienced hallucinations and so on do you know what that was no wonder the lady is insane for untrained people to withstand the pressure its amazing wait till i tell my colleagues youre heroes you survived a wild round bully for us what happened well im only a petty official they dont come much pettier than me but from what ive gathered you had a wild round that is he explained quickly anyone straying beyond the confines of the fleet is attacked by the aliens and has to playa wild round as we call it one that isnt scheduled to be played by the gamblers were not really supposed to do that but what is this game im not sure really ordinary people dont play the game only the gamblers in the game ship thats the one with the big g on it it isnt the sort of game id like to play we call it the blood red game because of the habit they have of confusing our sense so that everything seems to be the colour of blood psychologists and the like play it and they are called gamblers how often is it played all the time really no wonder im a bundle of nerves we all are citizens rights have been waived food supplies reduced were having a pause just at the moment but it wont last long probably theyre recovering from your little victory whod know details about this game asquiol of course but its almost impossible to see him the nearest people ever get is to his airlock and then only rarely you might try lord mordan though hes not too approachable either mr high and mighty hes worse than asquiol in some ways mordan seems interested enough to tell us already roffrey nodded but ive got to speak to asquiol on another matter so i might as well try to combine them thanks a pleasure the midget enthused when he had gone roffrey went to the communicator and tried to contact asquiols ship he had to get by nearly a dozen officials before he made contact adam roffrey here just in from the shifter can i come to your ship he received a curt acceptance there had been no picture will you take me with you willow asked hell be surprised ive been waiting a long long time for this he predicted we might meet again and he was right of course roffrey agreed he looked at talfryn he was a friend of yours too want to come talfryn shook his head ill stay here and try to find out a bit more about whats going on here he took a long almost theatrical look at willow and then turned away see you roffrey said just as you like he went to the medical chest and took out a hypodermic and a bottle of sedative filled the hypo and pumped the stuff into marys arm then he and willow left his launch and by means of personal power units made their way to asquiols ship the airlock was open ready for them and it closed behind them as the entered the inner lock however did not open instead they saw the light of an internal viewer blink on as they waited and they heard a brooding voice a polite faraway voice that seemed to carry peculiar echoes which their ears could not quite catch asquiol speaking how may i help you willow masked in her space suit remained silent im adam roffrey just in from the shifter system with three passengers yes asquiols acknowledgement bore no trace of interest one of them is my wife you know her as mary the maze she helped renark in the shifter roffrey paused she sent you to roth i am grateful to her though we didnt meet ive tried to contact a psychiatrist in the fleet i havent succeeded roffrey kept his voice level i dont know where they all are but my wifes condition is desperate can you help they are all playing the game i am sorry grateful as i am to your wife the first priority is to the race we cannot release a psychiatrist roffrey was shocked he had expected some response at least not even to give me advice how to help her no you must do what you can for her yourself perhaps a medical man will be able to give you certain kinds of help roffrey turned disgustedly back towards the outer lock he stopped as asquiols voice came again i suggest you contact lord mordan as soon as you can the voice cut off willow spoke she felt as if she had died and the word was the last she would ever utter asquiol at length they returned to roffreys ship mary was sleeping peacefully under the sedative but talfryn had disappeared they did not bother to wonder where he had gone they sat by marys bunk both of them depressed their thoughts turned inward hes changed willow said flatly roffrey grunted he doesnt sound human any longer she said theres no way of appealing to him he doesnt seem to care about the approval of the rest of us his loyalty to these mysterious creatures he contacted seems greater than his loyalty to his friends or the rest of mankind for that matter roffrey stared down at mary he doesnt care about anything except this mission he has everything is being sacrificed and subordinated to that one aim i dont even know how valid it is if i did i might be able to argue or even agree with him perhaps paul could talk to him i got scared i meant to tell him who i was i might be able to later save it ill see what mordan wants with me first roffrey moved over to his control panel and operated the screen lord mordan mordan here the geelords face appeared on the screen he seemed disconcerted when he saw roffrey i was just going to contact you you and talfryn have been enlisted as gamblers subject to preliminary tests what the hell mordan im not interested tell talfryn about it ive got a sick wife to think about talfryns already here mordans face was serious this is important though it may not look like it to you theres a war to the death on and were up against it im directly responsible to asquiol for enlisting any men i think will help us win youve given us a great deal of trouble already im empowered to kill anyone liable to disrupt our security come over to the game ship and come fast if you refuse well bring you over forcibly clear roffrey switched out without answering defiantly he waited by marys bed she was beginning to show signs of improving physically but how her mind would be when she came out of the drugged sleep he didnt know later two geepees demanded entry their launch was clamped fast against his they threatened to hole his ship and enter that way if they had to he opened the airlocks and let them in what can one extra hand do he said one of them replied any man who can hold off an enemy attack virtually singlehanded is needed in the game ship thats all we know but i didnt roffrey stopped himself he was losing his grip the geepee said with false impatience you may not have realised it captain roffrey but you did something a while ago that was impossible you held out under the combined attack mental and physical of ten enemy ships most people couldnt have taken an attack from even one the other geepee drawled that means something look at it this way were damn near beaten now we took a hell of a lambasting during the initial alien attacks were the last survivors of the human race and weve got to stay together work for the common good thats the only way youll look after your wife in the long run dont you see that roffrey was still not convinced he was a stubborn man there was an atavistic impulse in him which had always kept him away from the herd and outside the law relying entirely on his own initiative and wits but he was also an intelligent man so he nodded slightly and said very well ill speak to lord mordan anyway then he turned to willow willow if mary shows any sign of getting worse let me know of course adam youll stay with her make sure shes all right she looked into his face naturally but when shes under a sedative theres something else ive got to do yes i understand he shrugged at the geepees who turned and led him through the airlock fourteen the game ship was bigger than a large battlewagon even more functionallooking a little barer of comforts yet it did not seem prepared for battle there was an atmosphere of hushed silence aboard and their boots clanged loudly along the corridor which led to lord mordans cabin a sign on the door read deputy game master lord mordan strictly private the letters were heavy black on the white door the geepee accompanying roffrey knocked on the door enter they went through into a cabin cluttered with instruments there were some roffrey recognised an encephalograph an optigraphprojector machines for measuring the power of the brain equipment for testing visualising capacity for measuring iq potential and so on talfryn was sitting in a comfortable chair on the other side of mordans desk both men had their hands clenched before them talfryns in his lap mordans stretched out across the empty desk sit down roffrey said lord mordan he made no reference to roffreys defiance of orders he seemed perfectly controlled perhaps overcontrolled thought roffrey for a moment he sympathised wasnt that his own condition he sat down as the geepee guard left okay he said curtly get on with it ive been explaining to talfryn how important you both are to this project mordan said crisply are you prepared to go along with us on the first stage of our tests yes he was almost responding to the decisive mood good weve got to find out exactly what qualities you possessed which made defeat of that alien fleet possible there is a chance of course that you were lucky or that being unprepared for the senseimpression attack on you and having no understanding of its origin you were psychologically better prepared to meet the attack well know the answers later let me recap on recent events first mordan spoke rapidly as you know we entered this universe several weeks ago and encountered its inhabitants shortly after entry these people are nonhuman as might be expected and regard us as invaders thats fair enough since we should think the same in their position but they made no attempt to assess our potential strength to parley or order us away they attacked we have no idea even what they look like these aliens you saw how quickly they had mobilised an attack on our fleet well before we had a chance to talk and tell them why we are here what happened after the first battle the one i saw there were several others we lost a lot of ships of all kinds finally asquiol contacted them by his own methods and intimated that we were quite prepared to settle on planets unsuitable for them and live in friendly cooperation with them but they wouldnt accept this however they came up with an alternative to open warfare he sighed and waved his hand to indicate the massed equipment we did not reckon with the predominant society existing here it is based on a code of behaviour which we find in parts very difficult to grasp in our terms it means that the status of a particular individual or group is decided by its ability to playa warlike game which has been played in this galaxy for centuries we call it the blood red game since one of their prime weapons is the ability to addle our senseimpressions so that we get a total sensory experience of the colour red you already know this i believe roffrey agreed but what apart from confusing us is it meant to do and how does it work we believe that the aliens have come to rely when disputes break out among themselves on more subtle weapons than energycannon or anything similar if we wished we might continue to use our familiar weapons to fight them as we did at first but we should have only a slight chance of winning their weapons make you better than dead in their view they turn you insane if you were dead youd be out of the way but since youre alive but useless as a fighter you drain our resources and slow us down in many ways but thats only part of it there are rigid complicated rules which we are having to learn as we go along what are the stakes roffrey asked if we win so many rounds of the game without relying on our ordinary armaments the aliens will concede us the right to rule as absolute monarchs their galaxy big stakes captain roffrey we lose our lives they lose their power they must be confident of winning not according to asquiol the fact that they are winning at the moment is obvious but their love of playing this game is so ingrained that they welcome any new variety you see both sides have got to do more than simply play the game they have the added difficulty of not understanding the opponents capabilities susceptibilities psychology and so forth in that were even in other things such as experience of playing the game they have the advantage where do we come into this were hoping that you are the aces we need in order to win your ship was the only human ship which has ever succeeded in beating the fantastic odds somehow you have something we need to beat the aliens and you dont know what it is right do we possess it jointly or does only one of us possess this protective shieldattack quality whatever it is were going to find that out captain roffrey thats why were testing you both although you were actually at the controls of your ship talfryn i understand was beside you talfryn spoke slowly what we have to seek i gather is a moral advantage over the aliens it is not a question of numbers but prestige if we win we gain sufficient status for them to accept our dominance if we lose what if we lose well be beyond caring our supplies are so short we cant risk phasing into a new universe at this late stage lord mordan turned his attention back to roffrey do you see that captain your wife is only one of a few victims of insanity in the fleet at the moment but if we dont win the game well all be mad or dead roffrey understood the logic but he was still suspicious of it lets get these tests over with he said then maybe well know where were going ill make up my mind afterwards mordan tightened his lips nodding a trifle as you like he said he spoke towards his desk ask the testing team to come here three men entered mordans cluttered cabin mordan stood up to introduce them this is professor selinsky he said the tallest of the group detached himself and walked over to roffrey and talfryn he stretched out his fat hand and smiled warmly glad youre here he said it looks as if you and your friend may be able to help us out of our present difficulties he shook hands with them and said these are my assistants doctor zung a small gloomy man of mongolian appearance and doctor mann a young blondheaded man who looked like an adventurefiction hero ive heard of you professor said talfryn you used to hold the chair of physiology at earth thats right selinsky nodded then he said well give you an ordinary test with the electroencephalograph first then well put you to sleep and see if we can get at the subconscious youre prepared to accept all our tests i presume he looked at mordan who made no reply roffrey said yes as long as it doesnt involve brainwashing selinsky said sternly this is the fifth century you know not the fifth century prewar i thought asquiol and lord mordans motto had become needs must when the devil drives roffrey said as he sat in the seat which doctor zung had prepared for him but the reference made no impression on mordan who had probably never heard it roffrey was given to obscure quotations it was all part of his atavistic outlook mary had once accused him of being deliberately obscurist in his references of reading old books merely in order to pick up unfamiliar quotations to fling at people he despised or disliked he had agreed part of her attraction he had added was that she at least knew what he was talking about a small glassalloy helmet was now being fitted over his scalp he hated such devices he hated it all as soon as this is over he promised himself ill show them what independence really means such thoughts and emotions gave the scientists some interesting if hardly usable findings professor selinsky appeared calm as he checked over the material so far gained from the sleeping men all this will require careful analysis of course he said then he shrugged his shoulders what have you found out mordan said frankly i cant find any clue at first sight as to what theyve got that men were using havent already got theyre both intelligent roffrey quite superlatively so but theres only a grain of something out of the ordinary naturally this quality would be subtle we expected that but roffrey isnt the only psychopath in the human race and he isnt the only one with a high iq he sighed but their memories for sensoryexperiences are very good doctor mann said eagerly in any event they will help swell the gambling strength a poor second said zung disgustedly as he uncoupled electrodes and neatly placed his personal equipment in its cases ill agree that we need all the gamblers we can recruit but these men were going to give us the answer to the problem of defeating the aliens thats what we hoped didnt we professor selinsky said this project is wearing us all down zung theres not a scrap of reason for your defeatest tone nor yours mann we have a lot of work to do before we can analyse our findings meanwhile he turned to mordan who had been sitting in his chair with a look of studied indifference on his seamed bloodhounds face i suggest we put these men on our regular strength no need to waste them while we study their results let them be trained youre sure theyll work all right with the rest mordan said getting up why shouldnt they selinsky pointed his thumb towards the door you know what the atmosphere in theres like with ohara and everything none of them are what you would call normal our gamblers are all neurotics these days by definition normal people couldnt stand the strain normal people couldnt hit back we count on unusual physiological and psychological patterns to play the game i trust talfryn mordan said hes much more susceptible to persuasion but roffreys a born troublemaker i know ive dealt with him more than once give him something important to handle in that case selinsky swung the arm of the optigraph away from roffreys chair the man stirred but didnt wake hes the kind who needs to be kept active who needs to feel that every action he makes is personally inspired there never was such a thing said mordan walking over and staring down at his old enemy then dont tell him selinsky smiled faintly its egocentricity of that order which has pushed humanity up the scale renark and asquiol were the same they may sometimes have the wrong information but they get better results than we do of a kind mordan agreed reluctantly its the kind we need right now selinsky told him as he and his assistants bustled out of the cabin well send a couple of attendants to take care of them youll need the whole damn police force to take care of roffrey once he starts getting stubborn mordan said fatalistically he liked roffrey but he knew roffrey didnt like him hed come to the somewhat comforting conclusion that roffrey didnt really like anyone apart from his wife it was a great pity that hed found her mordan reflected selinsky and his assistants pored over their findings mann although a good and clever scientist was beginning to tire of the routine work as they paused for coffee he said to selinsky something occurred to me professor which may mean nothing but its worth throwing out for discussion i think selinsky who disapproved of manns weakness for theorising while on the job said impatiently what is well in the history we got from records both talfryn and roffrey were on that planet they call roth in the sundered worlds the lattice planet parts of it exist in different continua rather like asquiol is supposed to do could this planet have exerted some kind of influence on them or perhaps if they stood the test of staying sane on roth it turned roffreys wife mad remember they are therefore better fitted for fighting the aliens selinsky drained his coffee cup and ran a finger across his wet lips there may be something there he said look ill tell you what work something out properly in your spare time and show me your ideas in a report spare time mann said explosively though he was pleased at selinskys encouragement a rare thing in itself well you cant sleep all of those six hours said zung quietly grinning to himself as he went back to his work willow kovacs felt more resigned now roffrey had been away too long for there to be much chance of his coming back soon she calmly filled the hypo and gave mary another sedative but she didnt after all take one herself in this calmer frame of mind her thoughts had again turned to asquiol she must contact him she felt at least she would have a clearer idea of how to act after she had seen him whatever happened she experienced some difficulty in getting roffreys communications equipment to work but finally she contacted mordan the geelords sagging face appeared on the screen he was hunched over his desk apparently doing nothing he looked incredibly tired willow decided he must be keeping himself awake with stimulants he gave her a nod of recognition and said miss kovacs if youre worried about roffrey and talfryn theres no need they have been recruited as gamblers and will no doubt be getting in touch with you during a rest period thanks she said but there was something else how important is it miss kovacs you understand that im very i wish to contact asquiol directly thats impossible now and anyway you wouldnt find it desirable if you realised what he looks like what do you want to say to him i cant deal through someone else its a purely personal matter personal i remember you had some emotional relationship we were very close on migaa and on the shifter worlds im sure he would want to see me she didnt sound as if she particularly believed her own words next time i report to him ill pass your message on thats all i can do im afraid mordan stared curiously at her but said nothing more will he contact me if he gets your message if he wants to thats exactly what he will do ill tell him what youve said i promise the screen shimmered and was empty again willow turned it off and walked slowly back to where mary was sleeping whats going to happen to you in all this she said there was in willow a large capacity for sympathy with those in distress even now with troubles of her own which she hadnt counted on before shed reached the fleet she could turn her attention to mary but what had at first been a detached emotion of sympathy such as she could feel towards anyone in an unpleasant predicament was fast running into a less healthy feeling she was beginning to sense a kinship with mary they were both very lonely women the one lacking any contact with her fellows trapped inside her disturbed and jumbled mind veering between nearsanity and complete madness the other with a growing conviction that in her moment of need she had been deserted not only by asquiol but by talfryn and roffrey too she sat by the screen waiting for asquiol to contact her she sat stiffly the cabin was silent as silent as the space through which the fleet moved she shared with the rest of humanity a demoralised disillusioned sense of loss of unknowing of confusion and as in the rest of them these feelings were crystallising into fear only the certain knowledge that loss of control at this time would bring certain destruction of mind or body allowed them to keep going kept active by drugs sent to sleep by sedatives driven by the uncompromising will of asquiol and his tool mordan the gamblers prepared for another round of the game fifteen they were seated in threes each group before a large screen which mirrored the scene on the huge screen over their heads the large chamber was dark illuminated solely by light from instruments and screens below the small screens were even smaller ones in two rows of six mordan who had brought talfryn and roffrey into the chamber explained in a soft voice what purpose they served roffrey looked about him three sections of the circular chamber were occupied with the screens and seated before them each bad its trio of operators pale thin men and women for the most part living off nervous energy and drugs they had glassalloy caps similar to those he had worn while taking the tests no one looked up as he entered the screen above us is as you can see merely a wideangle viewer which enables us to scan the space immediately around the fleet mordan was saying each group of operators gamblers we call them is delegated a certain area of this space to watch for signs of alien expedition so far as we can gather it is part of their code to come close within firing range to our fleet before beginning the round apart from that we are given no warning that a fresh round is about to commence thats why we keep constant watch presumably among themselves the aliens have subtler ways of beginning but this seems to be their compromise when an alien expedition comes into sight the team sighting it alerts the rest and they all concentrate on that area the smaller rows of screens record the effect which we beam towards the aliens they record hallucinatory impulses and these are broken down into sections governed by the different senses brainwaves of varying frequencies emotionalimpulses such as fear anger and so on which we are capable of simulating we have of course projectors magnifiers and broadcasting equipment which is capable of responding to the commands of the gamblers but primarily in the last resort everything depends on the imagination quick reactions intelligence and ability to simulate emotions thoughts and so on which each individual gambler possesses i see roffrey nodded in spite of himself he was interested what happens then just as many of our emotions and impulses are unfamiliar and incommunicable to the aliens the same applies to us presumably half the impressions and mental impulses we have flung at us do not have the effect the aliens desire or would get in their own kind but we have the same difficulty these men have been playing the game long enough to recognise whether the effects they send are effective or not and can guard against those effects which are most dangerous to us winning the game at this stage anyway depends largely upon the extent to which we can assimilate and analyse what works and what doesnt work this also of course applies to the aliens you for instance had the hallucination of a monster beast which shocked not only your instincts triggering fear panic and so on but shocked your logical qualities since you knew that it was impossible for such a beast to exist in the vacuum of space roffrey and talfryn agreed this sort of effect is what the aliens are relying on although in the general run of things these days they have learned to be much more subtle working directly on the subconscious as they did to a large extent on you after the beastimage didnt get the result they wanted therefore our psychologists and other researchers are gathering together every scrap of information which each round gives us trying to get a clear picture of what effects will have the most devastating results on the aliens subconscious here as i mentioned we are fairly well matched our minds are as alien to them as theirs are to us the prime object in playing the blood red game therefore is to find the exact impulse necessary to destroy the qualities which we term selfrespect strength of character intrinsic confidence and so on mordan exhaled heavily the number of losses weve had can be assessed when i tell you that weve got two hundred men and women alone who are curled up into foetal balls in the wards of our hospital ships talfryn shuddered it sounds revolting forget that mordan said curtly youll lose all sense of moral values after youve been playing the game for a short time the aliens are helping us to do what philosophers and mystics have been preaching for centuries remember it know thyself eh he shook his head staring grimly around the chamber where the greyfaced gamblers watched the screens concentratedly youll get to know yourself here all right and im sure you wont like what you learn easier on the brooder the introvert roffrey said how deep can one man go in probing his innermost impulses before he pulls back out of selfprotection if nothing else mordan said sharply not far in comparison to what the aliens can do to you but youll find out youre giving an attractive picture roffrey said damn you roffrey ill talk to you after your first round this may now i come to think of it do you an awful lot of good they were joined by a third individual he had obviously been a gambler for some time they were beginning to recognise the type he was tall thin and nervous fiodor ohara he said not bothering to shake hands they introduced themselves in the same curt manner you will be in my charge until you become familiar with the game ohara said you will obey every order i give you try not to resist me the sooner you are trained the sooner you will be able to play the game without any direction i believe you are what they call an individualist roffrey well you will have to conform here until you have mastered the game then your individualism will doubtless be of great use since we depend on such qualities most of the people here are trained in some branch of psychology but there area few like yourselves laymen who have a sufficiently high iq to be receptive almost instinctively to the needs of the game i wish you luck you will find it a great strain to keep your ego free and functional that is really all you have to learn to do as a beginner you will carry out defensive strategy as it were until you are adept enough to begin attacking the enemy remember both of you physical strength and daring mean absolutely nothing in this war and you lose not your life but your sanity at first anyway roffrey scratched the back of his neck tor gods sake lets get started he said impatiently dont fret mordan said as he left them youll soon know when another round begins ohara took them to a row of empty seats there were three seats the usual screen and the miniature screens beneath it immediately in front of them were small sets of controls which were evidently used to operate the senseprojectors and other equipment we have a short vocabulary which we shall use later for communication while the game is in progress ohara said settling the skullcap on his head switch sound for instance means that if at a certain moment you are concentrating on taste sensations i have decided that sounds would be more efficient against the enemy if i say switchtaste it means that you send tasteimpressions that is simple you understand they showed their assent then they settled themselves to await their first and perhaps last round of the blood red game the morality of what they were doing invading this universe and attempting to wrest dominance of it from the native race had bothered asquiol little rights he had said to mordan when the geelord had relayed the doubts of some of the members of the fleet what rights have they what rights have we because they exist here doesnt mean that they have any special right to exist here let them or us establish our rights let us see who wins the game asquiol had more on his mind than a squabble over property dangerous as that squabble could be for the race this was mans last chance of attaining his birthright something which asquiol had almost attained in his ability to perceive simultaneously the entire universe to take over from the originators somehow he had to teach his race to tap its own potential here those gamblers who might survive would be of use the race had to begin on the next stage of its evolution yet the transition would have to be so relatively sudden that it would be virtually revolution and there was the personal matter of his incompleteness the torturing frustration of knowing that the missing piece that would make him whole was so close he could sense it as to be almost within his grasp but what was it dwelling in thought asquiol was grave even he could not predict the eventual outcome if they won the game more able to encompass the scope of events than the rest of the race in some ways he was as much in a temporal vacuum as they were quite unable to relate past experience with present or the present with whatever the future was likely to be he existed in all the many dimensions of the multiverse yet he was bound by the single multiversal dimension of time almost as much as anyone else he had cast off chains of space but was tied as perhaps all denizens of the multiverse would always be by the steadypaced imperturbable prowl of time which brooked no halt which condoned no tampering with its movement whether to slow it or to speed it time the changer could not be changed space perhaps the material environment could be conquered time never it held the secret of the first cause a secret not known even to the originators who had built the great finite multiverse as a seeding bed a womb for their successors but should the human race survive the birth pangs and succeed the originators asquiol felt that it would not present a key to the secret perhaps in many generations each generation measured as a stage in mans evolution it would be found but would the solution to the puzzle be welcomed not by his race but maybe its greatgrandchildren would be capable of accepting and retaining such knowledge for once they replaced the originators they would have the task of creating their successors and so it would continue perhaps ad infinitum to what greater purpose he stopped this reverie abruptly in this respect he was a pragmatist he could not concern himself with such pointless speculation there was a lull in the game the coming of roffreys ship and its defeat of the aliens had evidently nonplussed them for a while but roffrey so far had not experienced the real struggle which was between minds trained minds capable of performing the most savage outrage there could be destroying the id the ego the very qualities that set man above other beasts for a moment he wondered about talfryn but stopped the train of thoughts since it led to another question troubling him asquiol allowed his concentration to cease for a moment as he enjoyed the rich nourishment that experience of dwelling on all planes of the multiverse gave him he thought i am like a child in a womb save that i know i am in the womb yet i am a child with a part missing i sense it what is it what will complete me it is as if the part would not only complete me but complete itself at the same time as was happening increasingly he was interrupted by a sharp signal from the communicator he leaned forward in his chair the strange shadows and curious halfseen images dancing about his as he moved the area of space between him and the communicator seemed to spray apart flow and move spasmodically like water disturbed by the intrusion of an alien body this happened whenever he moved although he himself was only aware of his passing his arm through many objects which exerted a very faint pressure upon his limbs he could not only see the multiverse he could also feel it smell it taste it yet this was little help in dealing with the aliens for he found it almost as difficult as the rest of his race to understand the actual psychology of the nonhuman attackers the communicator came to life yes he said again mordan had not turned on his own receiver so that whereas asquiol could see him he need not subject himself to the eyestraining sight of asquiols scintillating body a few messages mordan went through them quickly hospital ship op has disappeared we heard that the it field was becoming erratic they were repairing it when they just faded out of space any instructions i saw that happen theyre safe enough where they are no instructions if theyre lucky theyll be able to rejoin the fleet if they can adjust their field roffrey and talfryn the two men who succeeded in withstanding the br effect so successfully have been subjected to all professor selinskys tests and he is studying the results now in the meantime they are being taught how to play the game what else asquiol observed mordans worried expression there were two women on roffreys ship one of them was the mad woman mary roffrey the other calls herself willow kovacs i have already forwarded this information to you you remember yes is that all miss kovacs asked me to pass a message on to you she says that you were personally acquainted on migaa and later in the shifter she would like it if you could spare the time to get in touch with her the ship is on l metres for tight contact thank you asquiol switched out and sat back in his seat there was in him still some part of the strong emotion he had felt for willow but he had had to rid himself of it twice once when she had declined to follow him to roth once after he met the originators his impression of her was by now a little vague so much had happened he had had to dispense with many valuable emotions when he assumed control of the fleet this was out of no spirit of ambition or will to dominate it was simply that his position demanded maximum control of his mind therefore emotions had to be sacrificed where they could not directly contribute to what he was doing he had become in so far as ordinary human relationships were included a very lonely man his perception of the multiverse had more than compensated for the breaks in human contact he had been forced to make but he rather wished that he had not had to make those breaks normally he never acted on impulse yet now he found himself turning his communicator dial to the wavelength l metres when it was done he waited he felt almost nervous willow saw her screen leap into life and she quickly adjusted her own controls with the information indicated above the screen she acted hurriedly excitedly and then the sight she saw froze her for a moment after that her movements were slower as she stared fascinatedly at the screen asquiol she said in a faltering voice hello willow the man still bore the familiar facial characteristics of the asquiol who had once raged through the galaxy spreading chaos and laughter in his wake she remembered the insouciant moody youth she had loved but this this satan incarnates sitting in its chair like some fallen archangel this golden sight bore no relation to him as she remembered him asquiol im deeply sorry he said and smiled at her with a melancholy look for an archangel to wear her face reflected the peculiar dancing effect which the image on the screen produced she stepped back from it and stood with her shoulders drooping and now she had only the memory of love i should have taken my chance she said there was only one im afraid if id known i perhaps could have convinced you to come with us as it was i didnt want to endanger your life i understand she said tough for me eh he didnt reply instead he was glancing behind him ill have to switch out our opponents are starting another round of the game goodbye willow perhaps if we win you and i can have another talk but she was silent as the golden brilliant image faded from the screen sixteen ohara turned to his companions this is your trial he said get ready there was a faint humming sensation in the huge circular chamber ohara had adjusted his screen so that he could now see the alien ships swimming through space towards them only a few miles from the fleet they came to a stop and remained in relation to the fleet in a fixed position roffrey suddenly found himself thinking of his childhood his mother what he had thought of his father and how he had envied his brother why should he suddenly decide to hastily he pulled himself out of this reverie feeling slightly nauseated by a random thought that had begun to creep into his conscious mind this was akin to what hed experienced earlier but not so intense careful roffrey its beginning said ohara and it was only a mild beginning whatever the aliens had learned of the human subconscious they used however they had gained such a store of information roffrey would never know though the human psychiatrists had a similar store of weapons to turn back against their enemies every dark thought every unhealthy whim every loathsome desire that they had ever experienced was dredged up by the alien machines and shoved before their conscious minds the trick as ohara had said was to forget values of good and evil right and wrong and to accept these impressions for what they were desires and thoughts shared by everyone to some degree but roffrey found it hard going and this was not all the alien means of triggering these thoughts was spectacular and mind smashing in its incredibly clever intensity he found it difficult to define between what was sight or smell taste or sound and pervading it all in the aching background of everything was the swirling whirling chattering shrieking odorous clammy painful colour the blood red sense it was as if his mind had exploded as if it were gouging its contents awash with blood and the agony of naked thoughts unclothed by prejudice and selfdeception there was no comfort in this world he had suddenly entered no release no rest or hope of salvation the alien sensoryprojectors were forcing him further and further into his own mind jumbling what was there when it did not suit their purpose to show it to him as it really was all his conscious thoughts and senses were scrambled and jellied and altered all his subconscious feelings were halted before him and he was forced to look in the back of his mind was a small spark of sanity repeating over and over again keep sane keep sane hang on it doesnt matter its all right and at times he heard his own voice blended with dozens of others as he howled like a dog and cried like a child yet in spite of all this that was flung against him and the rest in spite of the loathing he began to feel for himself and his fellows there was still the spark which kept him sane it was at this spark that the aliens aimed their main concentration just as the more experienced gamblers in the human ranks aimed to destroy the little sparks of sanity alive in their opponents never in the history of the human race had such dreadful battles been fought this was more like a war between depraved demons than between material creatures it was all roffrey could do to keep that spark alive as he sweated and struggled against the columns of sound the vast booming waves of smells in the groaning movement of colour and as if in keeping with this battleground the blood red mingling of senses swam and ran and convulsed and heaved themselves through his racked being hurled themselves along his neural tracts hacked past his cortical cells mauled his synapses and shook body and brain into a formless useless jelly of garbled receptions blood red there was nothing now save the blood red shrilling of a pervading icy stinking taste and a washedout feeling of absolute selfloathing that crept in everywhere in every cranny and corner of his mind and person so that he wanted nothing more than to shake it aside to escape from it but it trapped him the blood red trap from which he could only escape by retreating back down the corridors of his experience to huddle comfortingly in the womb of the spark flared and sanity returned completely for a moment he saw the sweating concentrated faces of the other operators he saw talfryns face writhing and heard the man groaning saw oharas thin hand on his shoulder and grunted an acknowledgement he glanced at the tiny screen which was fluttering with dancing graphs and pulsating light then he was reaching for the small control panel before him and his bearded face bore a twisted halfsmile as he shouted cats and they crawl along your spines with their claws gripping your nerves tides of mud oozing drown creatures drown the words themselves were of little effect but they were not meant to be they were triggering off emotions and impressions in his own mind he was attacking now using the very emotions and impressions which the aliens had released and he had grasped some understanding of how they could react to these things for there had been in their attack several impressions which had meant nothing to him translated into his own terms these he flung back with a will and his own screens began to lap to the horrid rhythms of his savagely working mind first he sent the blood red impressions back since these were obviously a preliminary attack which formed the basis of the game he didnt understand why this should be but he was learning quickly and one of the things he had learned was that reason played little part while the game was on that instinct had to be turned into a fighting tool later the experts could analyse results but then he felt the hysteria leave him and there was silence in the chamber stop roffrey stop its over they won christ we havent got a hope now won i havent finished look several of the gamblers were sprawled on the floor mewling and drooling insanely others were curled into tight foetal balls attendants rushed in to tend to them weve lost seven that means the aliens won we got perhaps five not bad you nearly had your opponent roffrey but theyve pulled back now youll probably get another chance for a firsttimer you did exceptionally well talfryn was insensible when they turned their attention to him ohara appeared unconcerned hes lucky it looks as if hes only blacked out i think hes tough enough to take another round or two now hes got used to the game it was filthy roffrey said his whole body was tight with strain his nerves were bunched his head ached terribly his heart pumped wildly he even found it hard to focus on ohara seeing his trouble ohara took a hypodermic from a case in his pocket and gave roffrey an injection before he could protest roffrey began to feel better he still felt tired but his body started to relax and the headache was less intense so thats the blood red game he said after a moment thats it said ohara selinsky studied the papers mann had prepared for him you may well have something here he said it is possible that the shifter exerts a particular influence on the human mind that equips that mind for withstanding the attacks of the aliens he looked up and spoke to zung who was fiddling with some equipment in one corner of the room you say that roffrey stood up particularly well in his first round yes the little mongolian nodded and he resumed the attack without direction thats rare hes valuable enough without having any special characteristics selinsky agreed what do you think of my suggestions mann said almost impatiently wanting to get back to his own line of inquiry interesting selinsky said but still nothing very definite to go on i think we might ask to see roffrey and talfryn and find out what we can about their experiences in the shifter shall i ask them to come here zung suggested yes will you selinsky frowned as he studied manns notes from the turmoil that was her ruined brain mary was emerging half afraid for the knowledge of her insanity preyed always on her sane mind she was reassembling her reason suddenly there was no more confusion she lay there eyes seeing nothing at all no sights of disordered creation no threatening creatures no danger all she heard was the slight scuffling sound of somebody moving about near her very carefully she thought back it was hard to distil a sense of time out of the chaos of memory it had been as if she had spent most of her life in a whirlpool performing such meaningless actions as piloting a ship opening airlocks making equations on pads that flowed away from her and disappeared there had been periods when the turmoil of the whirlpool had abated sane periods where she had hovered on the brink of insanity but never quite succumbed there had been the first arrival at the shifter looking for the knowledge she had found on golund there had been a landing on entropium and then a chaotic journey among the planets through space that contained no laws only a turbulent inconsistency landing finding nothing keeping a hold on her sanity which kept threatening to crack and finally to roth where her mind had gone completely aware of warmth then away from roth in a manner she could never remember back to entropium a man who asked her questions jon renark and the horror of halfsanity finally smashed by the cataclysm that had turned entropium into rubble the dash for the hauser crashing on a peaceful planet ekiversh perhaps and resting resting then on to roth chaos warmth chaos why what had kept pulling her back to roth so that every time she returned her sanity had given out a little more a little more but the last time there had been something extra a turning point as if she had gone full circle on the road back to sanity she had met entities there things of formless light that had spoken to her no that was probably a hallucination with a healthy sigh she opened her eyes willow kovacs stood over her mary recognised the woman who had comforted her mary smiled wheres my husband she said quietly and composed her features feel better now willow said the smile she gave in reply was sorrowful but mary saw it was not her that willow pitied much is adam hes been recruited to play this game briefly willow explained all she knew he should be getting in touch soon mary nodded she felt rested at peace the horror of her madness was a faint memory which she pushed further and further back never again she thought that was it im all right now that was the last time she felt herself drifting into a deeper more natural sleep roffrey and talfryn entered selinskys lab roffrey huge and powerful his black beard seeming to bristle with vitality said more tests professor no captain we wish merely to question you on one or two points which have cropped up to tell you the truth neither of you appears to possess any strong trait which can account for your besting so many opponents we have discovered that the reason you were able to beat those ships with such apparent ease was that every one of their gamblers was beaten put out of action by some force so powerful that it crossed space without any sending equipment to aid it their receivers turned the emanations into a force which destroyed their minds completely but you possess no qualities of sufficient strength which could account for this it is as if you needed an amplifier of some kind can you explain that roffrey shook his head but talfryn was frowning and said nothing he appeared thoughtful what about mary he said slowly yes that may be it zung looked up from his notes no it isnt roffrey said grimly talfryn broke in shes the one your wife roffrey she was absolutely crazy on entropium she travelled between the shifters planets when space was wild and chaotic she must have had a tremendous reserve of control somewhere in her if she could stand what she did she could have picked up all kinds of strange impressions that worked on her brain she did in fact shes our amplifier well what about it roffrey turned round and looked at the three scientists standing there eagerly live vultures who had spotted a dying traveller selinsky sighed i think were right he said mary stared out at the hazy light of the fleet dropping through darkness towards the faroff stars gleaming like lights at the end of a long long tunnel adam roffrey she said aloud and wondered what she would feel when she saw him how did you get to the shifter willow asked from where she sat i ran away from adam i got tired of his restless life his constant hatred of civilisation and ordered society i even tired of his conversation and his jokes yet i loved him still do im an anthropologist by profession and took advantage of adams trips to the remote outworlds to keep my hand in one time we landed on golund the planet with signs of having been visited by a race from another galaxy i hunted around the planet but got no more than the scant information available so i left adam and went to the shifter when it materialised in our spacetime hoping to find some clues there i searched the shifter system i searched it and clung to my sanity by a thread but roth was the last straw roth finished me she turned back to look at willow smiling but now i feel saner than ive ever done and im thinking of settling down if i can becoming a good little wife to adam what do you think of that willow her eyes were serious i think youre nuts willow said tactlessly dont sell out for the easy life look at me its been hard though said mary staring at the floor tar too hard willow i know she said the communicator whistled mary went to it operated the control it was roffrey hello adam she said her throat felt constricted she put her hand to it thank god he said his weary face impassive she knew she still loved him that alone was comforting you got a doctor then he said no she said smiling dont ask me how just accept that im sane something happened the fight with the aliens something on roth maybe just willows nursing i dont know i feel a new woman his face softened as he relaxed he grinned at her i cant wait he said can you and willow come over to the game ship right away thats what i contacted you for before i knew certainly she said but why the people here think that all four of us as a sort of team managed to beat off the alien senseimpression attack they want to give you a few routine tests along with willow okay tine she said send over a launch to collect us and well be with you she thought she saw him frown just before he switched out much later selinsky screwed up his tired face and pushed his hand over it he shook his head briskly as if to clear it staring at the two women who under sedatives lay asleep in the testing chairs theres certainly something there he said rolling a small lighttube between his palms why couldnt we have tested all four of you together a stupid oversight he glanced at the chronometer on his right index finger ive no idea why but asquiol is to broadcast to the entire fleet in a little while about the game i think i hope the news is good we could do with some roffrey was ill at ease brooding paying scant attention to the scientist he stared down at mary and he suddenly felt weak ineffectual as if he no longer played a part in her life and could hardly control his own an unusual feeling connected perhaps with the shape that events seemed to be taking now she remembered as she slept physically her mind was alert she remembered landing on roth of stumbling over the surface of falling down an abyss that took her upwards of the strange warm things that had entered her brain she remembered all this because she could sense something similar quite close to her she reached out to try and contact it but failed only just failed she felt like a climber on a cliffface who was reaching for the hand of the climber just above the fingers stretching out carefully desperately but not quite touching there was somebody out there somebody like her but more like than she was that was the impression she got who or what was it was it a person such as she defined the word or something else adam no it wasnt adam she realised she had spoken his name aloud im here he said smiling down at her she felt his big hand grasping her firmly encouragingly adam theres something i dont know selinsky appeared beside her husband how are you feeling he asked fine physically but im puzzled she sat up in the chair dangling her legs trying to touch the floor what did you find out quite a bit he said and well be needing you are you willing to take a big risk and help us play the game mary wondered why her husband was so quiet seventeen this time asquiol realised he would have to visit the game ship personally for the time he had feared had come the aliens had virtually won the blood red game jewelled the multiverse spread around him awash with life rich with pulsating energy but it could not compensate for his mood of neardespair coupled with the empty ache within him the ache for the missing piece which seemed so close it threatened to control him he still could not trace the source but it was there something like him but not so developed was in touch with him almost the multiverse he began to put out feelers of his mind into the multiverse searching but then his conscience made him withdraw from this and concentrate once more on the immediate problem as had happened on past occasions he had been in communication with the alien leaders this time they had found it hard to disguise their jubilation for the game had taken firm shape they were winning even with the setback they had received from roffreys ship their score had mounted enormously asquiol still found it difficult to comprehend their method of scoring but he trusted them it was unthinkable for them to cheat his way of communicating with them was the way he and renark had learned from the originator it wasnt telepathy it relied on no exact human sense but involved the use of waves of energy which only one in complete awareness of the multiverse might sense and harness it did not involve words but used pictures and symbols it had been by analysis of some of these symbols which asquiol had passed on to them that the psychiatrists had managed to devise weapons for use against the aliens asquiol still had no idea of what the aliens called themselves and did not even have a clear impression of their physical appearance but their messages were easy enough to interpret and the fact remained that the human race had reached a crisis point only one more round of the game would decide the issue then if the human race refused to accept the decision and began open war again asquiol knew they were doomed for their fleet was too depleted to stand any chance at all news received recently did not alter this certainty a number of farmships had broken down others had been lost completely or been destroyed in their early physical encounters with the aliens less than two thousand ships of all kinds remained in the fleet a vast enough caravan by any ordinary standards but nearly a quarter of a million ships had originally left the home universe it was in a mood bordering on hopelessness that he stretched out a scintillating arm and put his communicator on to a general broadcast wavelength to inform the race of what he had learned it was rare for him to do this since direct contact with members of his race was becoming increasingly less attractive he began asquiol here please listen attentively to my message i have recently been in contact with our attackers and they have informed me that as far as they are concerned the game is virtually won that they are confident that they will be the victors this means that our position is very nearly hopeless we have at most enough supplies to last us for a month unless we make planetfall on some habitable world soon you will all be dead the only way in which we can survive is to win decisively the last round of the game the aliens already have a considerable advantage over us and feel that they can in the next round sufficiently increase this to ensure victory our gamblers are weary and we have no more recruits we have drained out talent as we have drained our resources our scientists are still working to devise a new way of beating the aliens but i must tell you that time is running very short those among you not directly involved in playing the blood red game had best make what plans you can bearing in mind what i have said to the gamblers and all those attached to the game ship i can only ask for greater effort knowing you have worked at full capacity for many days remember what we can win everything remember what we stand to lose everything asquiol sat back his message still unfinished and as he breathed in the exotic scents of the multiverse he saw the hull of his ship a stark outline against an overpoweringly beautiful background of space alive sensed again that peculiar feeling of kinship with another entity where was it in this universe or another then he continued i myself will not be directly affected by the outcome as many of you have guessed but this is not to say i am unaffected by my trust to lead the race to safety in the first instance and to something more in the second there are those among you who ask what became of my companion renark our original leader you wonder why he stayed behind in the contracting universe my answer is vague for neither of us got a clear idea from the originators why this had to be it is probably that the stuff of his great spirit was spread amongst us to give all of us extra vitality the vitality that we need it may also have been that he sensed his role finished and mine only to have begun perhaps that is an arrogant thing to say renark was a brave man and a visionary he was confident that mankind by its efforts could avoid destroy or survive all danger he was a believer in human will conquering all obstacles physical intellectual and metaphysical in this perhaps he was naive but without that idealism and naivete our race could not have survived however what saved us from one form of peril may not be able to save us from another different problems require different solutions will alone is not now sufficient to win the blood red game it must be remembered that the circumstances applying to us in our present predicament are much more complex than they were when renark and i went on our quest we must be totally ruthless now we must be strong and courageous but we must also be devious cautious and sacrifice any idealism which made us embark on this voyage sacrifice is for survival and the survival of a greater ideal asquiol wondered whether to continue but he decided he had said sufficient for the moment again he sat back allowing himself to experience full unity with the multiverse where are you he said halfaloud who are you the need was tangible in him disconcerting distracting his attention from the matter he must give all his mind to he had already been in contact with the game ship and now waited impatiently for the signal which would tell him a vessel was ready to take him there he rose and paced the cluttered cabin the light shivering and breaking apart into rays of shining blue gold and silver shadows quivered around him and at times there seemed to be several ghostly asquiols in the cabin at length the launch clamped against the side of his ship and he passed through his airlock and into the cramped cabin of the launch quickly it cruised over to the game ship and eased sideways into a receiving bay the great outer doors closed down swiftly and asquiol stepped out to be greeted by lord mordan perhaps he said with your aid asquiol but asquiol shook his iridescent head i have little special power he said i can only hope that my aid will help the gamblers to hang on a little longer there is something else selinsky wants to see you it appears that all four of those people who came in from the shifter have some kind of grouppower they were striding along the corridors their boots clanging on metal asquiol said ill speak to selinsky now he stopped as mordan paused beside a door this is selinskys lab is he in mordan turned a stud and entered selinsky looked up blinking as asquiol followed mordan in an honour he said halfcynically lord mordan tells me professor that you are on to some new development yes thats so the woman mary roffrey shes not only sane now shes what supersane something was done to her mind on roth the whole nature of it altered it is very different from anyone elses except perhaps mine asquiol felt excitement creeping through him is she then like me as you see me selinsky shook his head she seems perfectly normal until you analyse her brain structure shes what we need all right asquiol was beginning to see the pattern now was this woman the missing piece in his existence had the originators done something to her brain in order to form her into what she potentially was a weapon he could only guess selinsky said she wasnt a product of the alien attack at all she was a product of more than just a series of madnessinducing hallucinations on roth something or somebody had actually tampered with her brain its the most delicately balanced thing ive ever seen what do you mean asquiol asked one way utter madness the other way unguessable sanity selinsky frowned id hate to be in her position weve got her doing a quick training course with ohara at the moment but playing the game could ruin her mind for good tip the balance once and for all you mean shed be completely insane yes asquiol pondered we must use her he said finally too much is at stake her husband is against the idea but she seems to be taking it all right hes the troublemaker roffrey mordan interposed will he give trouble in this business he seems resigned selinsky said a strange mood for him playing the game seems to have wrought a change in him not surprising i must see her asquiol said with finality turning to leave the laboratory they began the long walk down the corridor to the game chamber now asquiol wanted to see mary roffrey wanted to see her desperately as he strode along his mind worked quickly ever since he and renark had gone to the shifter their paths had crossed indirectly he had never met her yet she had been the person to supply renark with a lot of important information without which they might never have reached the originators what was she some puppet of the originators which they were using to aid the race or was she something more than a puppet she must be the missing factor in his own existence yet obviously she had no direct contact with the multiverse she had the power to strike devastatingly back at the aliens and he had no comparable power there were things that linked them yet there were qualities that separated them also it was as if they both represented certain abilities which man was capable of possessing she had something he didnt have he had something she didnt have how similar were they this perhaps he would find out in a moment he went over in his mind the information he had marys mind had been primarily responsible for disorientating the aliens in a wild round of the game at that stage she had acted as a conductor for the rest all of them having been on roth they were probably that much more capable of fighting the aliens than anyone else in the fleet therefore they would use the other three as well as mary but uppermost in his mind was what selinsky had just told him marys mind could improve or snap irreparably under the stress of this last round he knew what he would have to do now but it was a heavy weight as he contemplated it the light around him seemed to fade become colder and less frenetic in its movement sadness such as he had never thought to experience again filled him and he fought it unsuccessfully he might in essence have to murder a woman and cut himself off from the power she possessed the power that was part of him as well as of her it was getting late too late for anything but immediate action the time of the last round was approaching they reached the door of the game chamber eighteen in the main chamber mary was seated between willow and listening to the mans briefing around them the other gamblers were readying themselves for the last round they looked ill at ease and weary many of them did not look up even when asquiol came in flinging the door of the chamber open and striding quickly across the great room the light flowed about the many facets of his body and streamed away behind him mary turned round and saw him you she said a look of puzzlement crossed asquiols face weve met he said i dont remember i saw you with renark several times on roth but we left roth ages ago i know but roth is a strange planet time is nonexistent there anyway it wasnt only that then how else did you recognise me ive sensed youve been here all the time even before we reached the fleet i think but obviously you do not exist as i do in the entire multiverse what could the link be i wonder then he smiled perhaps our mutual friends the originators could tell us probably its simpler than that mary replied the sense of empathy with asquiol was like nothing she had ever experienced before because we have seen them and gained from the contact we recognise it in each other very likely he nodded then suddenly noticed that willow was staring at him her eyes full of tears he took control of himself and said briskly well we had better get ready im going to be in control of this project you mary will work under my direction using as power as it were the other three roffrey talfryn and willow its quite simple a sort of gestalt link she looked at the others who had crossed the room from where selinsky and his team were working on a mechanism did you hear that adam had the look of a dumb beast in pain as he stared at her for a moment before dropping his eyes we heard it he said all of it she glanced at asquiol as if seeking his advice but he couldnt help her both of them were now in a similar position mary with roffrey and asquiol with willow the time was nearing mary felt when she would have to sever her ties with her husband the time had passed asquiol reflected when he and willow could have been united by the common bond which he and mary possessed as they looked at one another they seemed to convey this without need of speech ohara interrupted them get ready everyone remember we need an overwhelming win in the round that is to follow this round will be the last we have to play winning it must be decisive the five people asquiol and mary in the lead went towards the specially prepared panel selinsky and his team finished their work and stepped aside the five composed themselves to play both willow and adam roffrey had to force themselves to concentrate but both were motivated by a different fear willow feared that mary would become extrasane through her ordeal roffrey feared she would become insane while he hated the alternative which would break their relationship before it ever had a chance to resume asquiol was his rival now roffrey saw yet asquiol hardly knew it himself only talfryn was not afraid of the possible results either way he felt he stood to win so long as mary was effective in helping the gamblers win the game asquiol bent close to mary and whispered remember i am in the closest possible touch with you and you with me however near you feel you are coming to insanity dont panic ill keep you on the right course she smiled at him thanks the tension rose as they waited it was so delicate the first probe as delicate as a slicing scalpel ohara shouted dont wait for them attack attack in contact with mary now asquiol began to dredge up marys memories from the deepest recesses of her subconscious doing to her what only a totally evil man might do yet even as she slipped into the giddy sickening whirlpool of insanity it was obvious to her that asquiol was not evil there was no malice in him at all it was taking fantastic control for him to force himself to continue but he did continue he worked at her mind slashing at it tearing at it working it apart in order to remould it and he did it in the full knowledge that he might in the final analysis be committing a dreadful crime beside him the trio sweated feeding power to mary that was channelled by asquiol and directed by him at the alien attackers there they are mary you see them mary turned glazed eyes towards the screen yes she saw them it was suddenly like horrible darkness then rolling through her redhot needles forced themselves into the grey mass of her brain it was like being tightened like a banjo string together and tighter until she must surely snap she couldnt she couldnt she laughed it was a huge joke against her they were all laughing at her she sobbed and mewled and lashed back at the pouring stream of demons and hobgoblins that came prancing and tumbling down the long corridors of her mind they sniggered and simpered and fingered her brains and her body and pulled her nerves about enjoying their sport caressing the parts of her they captured she lashed back as the whole scene became pervaded with the blood red sense that had always been there she knew it she was familiar with it and she hated it more than anything else gone were emotions gone selfpity gone love gone yearning and jealousy and impotent sadness the trio linked and locked and lent their strength to mary everything that she felt they felt everything she saw and did they saw and did and at times also so close were the five blended they saw something of what asquiol saw and it lent them strength to pass on to mary on and on they went driving at the aliens hating them and sending back impression after impression from the multiple brain to the alien players of the game it was as if they had suddenly been attacked by an atomic cannon in a war that had previously been fought with swords they reeled beneath the weight of the attack they reeled they marvelled and in their strange way they admired but they fought back even harder playing after the initial shock coolly and efficiently roffrey broke contact at the sound of a voice outside it was ohara shouting were winning they were right somehow she has the key to the whole mastery of the game she does something with her mind that sends exactly the thing most loathsome to them back to them theres a twist there somewhere that no human experience could have made shes doing it roffrey stared at him for a moment as if in panic and then returned his attention to the game for a moment ohara watched him before he returned his own attention their gains were slowly mounting and marys inspiration seemed to be encouraging the rest of the gamblers to give their best this is our finest hour ohara said thickly our finest hour and as he passed her he saw marys twisted and distorted face with the sweat and saliva all over it wreathed in the same flickering images that surrounded asquiols intent face now she knew she was winning now she could see they were reeling back now she felt victory within her reach although the madness was frenzied and allconsuming there was behind it all the confidence that asquiols presence gave her and she kept sending though her mind and body ached with searing agony then quite suddenly she blacked out hearing a voice call from a long way off mary mary asquiol knowing that he had aided her to reach this state could hardly bear to continue but he had to he put a hand to her sweatwet hair and dragged the head back to stare into the vacant eyes mary you can send them away you can he began to communicate with her he forced her attention to the screens she threshed in her chair for a second she stared at him to his relief he saw sanity there asquiol she said what is it we were we can be the same mary now and then she was bellowing in his face her laughter seeming a physical weight battering around his head so that he wanted to fling up his hands to ward it off to run and escape to hide from what he had created but again he forced control on himself and pushed her face towards the screens roffrey paindrunk glared at him but did nothing finally she was roaring and tearing asquiol couldnt make contact with her one of her hands flailed out the nails slashing his face roffrey saw the blood come and was halfastonished he had forgotten that asquiol was in many ways as mortal as himself somehow it made the feelings in him worse asquiol fought to control this rage turn it against the aliens he battled to resume empathetic contact with mary she stirred her name formed and curled and buzzed through the darkness she reached out for it elsewhere many of the gamblers had already succumbed to the force of the alien impressions tidal waves of garbled senseimpressions were being flung against them and even the strongest were finding it hard to resist to keep the spark of sanity alive and to retaliate asquiol used the communicatingsense that allowed him to contact the aliens and converse with them he did this to mary he shoved impressions and pictures into her mind things taken from his own memory and so real did they become in such close empathy was he with the woman that he felt his own sanity slipping away but he was the controlling part of the team he had to keep aware he held on for as long as he could then straightened his back gasping those watching saw the light surrounding him skip erratically and dim suddenly then it became brighter like a flaring explosion and then the light appeared to make contact with mary the same thing appeared to happen to her body her image split and became many images asquiol asquiol asquiol hello mary what is it rebirth youre whole now is it over by no means where are we asquiol on the ship but its different i know look she saw through facet after facet her husband the girl and the other man they were staring at her in astonishment angled opaque images surrounded every space they did not occupy adam she said im sorry its all right mary im not good luck like i said roffrey was actually smiling a new image swam into focus ohara gesticulating i dont know whats happened to the woman and i dont care get your attention back to the game or its lost she turned and the horrifying impressions came back but it was as if they were pressed through a filter which took away their effect on her mind carefully she searched her being she felt asquiol beside her felt the warmth of his encouragement she lashed back with deliberate and savage fury searching out weaknesses using them splitting the alien minds to shreds asquiol guided her she could feel it talfryn willow and adam supplied power and extra impressions which she took and warped and sent out more of the gamblers were dropping out and attendants were kept busy clearing them from the chamber there were only five complete teams left but it was victory mary and asquiol could feel it as they worked together oblivious of everything else to defeat the aliens they felt at that moment as if they knew everything about their opponents to such an extent that they were even in danger of giving up out of sympathy they fought on riding a tide of conquest soon the entire alien complement was finished they retreated back and stared around them asquiol what happened asquiol and mary saw willow looking up at them they smiled at her and said this was the originators plan willow they obviously did not allow sufficiently for human weakness but they did not count on the strength of the human spirit perhaps please dont suffer willow you have done more today for humanity than you could ever have done for any single person they turned to regard the others you too roffrey and you talfryn without you it is unlikely that we could have defeated the alien intelligences everything has suddenly become a clear pattern there was perhaps a purpose for willow and talfryn when they stayed behind there was a purpose also for roffrey when he took it into his head to visit the shifter we nearly threw away our chance what exactly has happened lord mordan interrupted have you become one entity or what no asquiol spoke with a slight effort it is simply that existing on the multiversal level we are capable of linking minds to forma more powerful single unity that was how we finally defeated our opponents obviously this was part of the originators plan but they never do anything for us directly at best they merely put certain aids in our path if we can make use of them assuming we realise what they are so much to the good if we cant we suffer we were near complete defeat there if we had not got some hint of marys abilities when we did the plan would have come to nothing as it was we were lucky mary said i must have been watched by the originators right from the start even before i met you asquiol continued the originators make things especially difficult for people they think are material for the new multiversal race simply only the fittest survive lord mordan said obsequiously yet hastily but the aliens can we not discover what our peace terms are we must hurry the farmships of course asquiol nodded mary and i will return to my ship and contact them from there mary and asquiol moved towards the exit gave one last glance at the three others and left what the hell have you got to smile about roffrey talfryn said accusingly roffrey felt at peace maybe it was the mood induced by weariness but he didnt think so there was no more pain in him no more jealousy no more hatred he moved over to the big blank screen and stared up at it the place suddenly brightened as assistants switched on the central lights and began clearing up the mess the gamblers had left i give up talfryn shook his head perplexed thats the trouble willow said so many of us do dont we epilogue asquiol of pompeii took mary the maze back to his ship they felt more at ease there since the ship bore similarities to their own metabolic state here with asquiol acting again as a guide for mary they pooled their resources together and contemplated the radiant multiverse around them then they put out a tendril of multiversal thoughtmatter along the familiar layers seeking the alien minds then they were in contact when the alien leaders came to the ship mary gasped and said in normal speech god theyre beautiful they were beautiful with delicate bones and translucent skins great golden eyes and graceful movements yet there was a look of depravity about them of ultimate decadence like depraved wise children the originators warned me to beware of races they called pessimists asquiol said races who had despaired of ever attaining full awareness of the multiverse who had so completely lost the urge to transcend their limitations that the tiny core of being had over millennia been almost completely eroded doubtless these are of that kind by use of their unique method they once again conversed with the aliens and were astonished by the mood of total defeat unquestioning acceptance of the winners rights to dictate any terms they wished they had lost their urge to transcend physical confines and in so doing had lost pride real pride also absolute defeat lost spirit utter hopelessness concede all rights you wish to take this mood was sufficient to add almost the last pressure on the victors already weary minds a great pity welled up in them as they communicated their terms to the conquered accept terms any terms acceptable we have no status you have all status we are nothing but your tools to use so conditioned were the aliens to the code applying to the game they had played for centuries perhaps millennia that they could let this unknown opponent do as it liked they were conditioned to obeying the victor they could not question the victors right their shame was so intense that they threatened to die of it yet there was no trace of bitterness no trace of resentment or lingering pride asquiol and mary resolved to help them if they could the aliens left would they ever see them again as the spherical ship moved away they sent out a polite impression that congratulated them on their ingenuity and courage but it met with no response they were beaten no praise could alter that they gave them positions of planets suitable for human occupation they were totally unsuited for themselves anyway and then they fled they did not go to nurse grudges for they had none they did not plot retaliation for such a thing was inconceivable they went to hide to reappear only if their conquerors demanded it they were a strange people whose artificial code had obviously completely superseded natural instincts as the alien ship disappeared asquiol and mary broke their contact with the leaders id better inform mordan hell be delighted anyway asquiol operated the laser he told the geelord of his meeting ill start the fleet moving towards some habitable planets right away give me an hour lord mordan smiled tiredly we did it prince asquiol i must admit i was close to accepting defeat we all were asquiol smiled how are the other three theyve gone back to roffreys ship i think theyre okay roffrey and the girl seem quite happy strangely do you want me to keep tabs on them no asquiol shook his head and as he did so the light broke and reformed around it the images scattering and merging asquiol stared at mordans weary face for a moment the geelord shifted uncomfortably beneath the fixed stare i could do with some natural sleep he said at last but ive got to get the fleet moving first is there anything else nothing said asquiol and switched out there was a subdued mood of victory about the reformed fleet as he and mary watched it from one of the ports theres a lot more to do mary he said this is really only the beginning i once compared the human race to a chick smashing out of its shell the comparison still applies weve broken the shell weve survived our first period in the multiverse but will we survive the second and the third is there a huge cosmic farmer with an axe somewhere thinking of serving us up for dinner when were plump enough she smiled youre worn out so am i give yourself time to think properly its the reaction youre depressed that kind of emotion can harm a lot of the work we still have to do he looked at her in surprise he was still unused to having company that he could appreciate someone who could understand what he felt and saw where are we going he said we need to plan carefully the degraded condition of the fleet cant be allowed to continue once we make planetfall galactic law will have to be firmly reestablished men like lord mordan who have been more than useful in the past because of their pragmatic virtues which could not have been helped by possession of the kind of vision we need now will have to be taken out of positions of power weve become a grim race lately out of necessity if we let matters slide mary the race could easily degenerate back into something worse than its preexodus state if that happened our destiny might be out of reach for good there isnt much time the originators made that clear when renark and i first met them he sighed with me to help you she said the hard work will be easier i know its going to be harder but there are two of us now you noticed how adam and willow were beginning to respond back in the game ship there must be dozens like them in the fleet potentially capable of joining us soon perhaps in only a few generations there will be a race of people like us until there are enough to take the place of the originators not that many asquiol said most people are happy as they are who can blame them it will be an uphill climb thats the best way to climb hills she smiled and remember keep your impression of those aliens we saw firmly in your mind we have an example now of how we could degenerate perhaps it was fated that we should meet that race it will serve as a reminder and a warning and with a reminder like that we are not likely to fail around them as they sat in contemplation the multiverse flowed thick and solid so full and this could be the heritage of their race he laughed slightly theres a scene in henry the fourth where falstaff learns that prince hal his old drinking companion is now king he gathers his friends about him and tells them good times have come for he is fortunes steward and the king will honour them and allow them to behave as they like with impunity but instead king henry banishes falstaff for a buffoon and troublemaker falstaff realises then that instead of becoming better things are going to be worse i sometimes wonder if perhaps im not fortunes steward leading the whole race towards a promise i cant keep marys multifaceted face smiled encouragingly there are still the originators but even without them man has always had to act without being able to foresee the outcome of his actions ever since he began the long climb upward he is a stumbler he has to convince himself of the results he will achieve without ever knowing if he can do it but he quite often succeeds we have a long way to go asquiol before we shall ever be able to know for certain the outcome of our actions meanwhile we keep going were probably the most optimistic race in the multiverse they laughed together and the spirit of renark which had permeated through the race to give it a unified strength seemed to share their joy the multiverse agitated swirled and leapt and delighted them with its flourish of colour and variety all possibilities existed there all promise all hope
