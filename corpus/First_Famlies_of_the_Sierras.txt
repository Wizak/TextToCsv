first famlies of the sierras contents in the forks little billie piper the first woman in the forks sunday in the sierras washeewashee some unwritten history that boy sandys courtship that boy is ill a scene in the sierras the parsons pursuit of love grit an announcement a wedding in the sierras whats the matter now was the woman insane captain tommy blood how did it happen a flag of truce the question none could answer debatable ground another wedding at the forks the judge is lonesome after the deluge what then the widow in disgrace billie piper and deboon the gopher a natural death a funeral the caravan of death the end first famlies of the sierras chapter i in the forks now there was young deboon from boston who was a very learned man he was in fact one of those fearfully learned men he was a man who could talk in all tongues and think in none perhaps he had sometime been a waiter i am bound to say that the most dreadfully learned young men i have ever met are the waiters in the continental hotels besides that he was very handsome he was indeed almost as handsome as a french barber or a firstclass steward another thing that helped to defeat him in this hurried election was his love of animals and his dislike of hard work the handsome fellow stood for election this day with a bushytailed squirrel frisking on his shoulder and a pair of pinkeyed white mice peeping out like a handkerchief from the pocket of his red shirt then there was chipper charley smart enough and a man too who had read at least a dozen books but the forks didnt want him for an alcalde any more than it did deboon then there was limber tim and limber certainly could write his name for he was always leaning up against trees and houses and fences when he could find them and writing the day and date and making grotesque pictures with a great carpenters pencil which he carried in the capacious depths of his duck breeches pocket but when sandy proposed limber tim the camp silently but firmly shook its head and said not for joseph at last the new camp pitched upon a man who it seemed had been called the judge from the first perhaps he had been born with that name it would indeed have been hard to think of him under any other appellation whatever it had been easier to imagine that when he had first arrived on earth his parents met him at the door took his carpetbag called him judge and invited him in as is usually the case in the far far west this man was elected judge simply because he was fit for nothing else the boys didnt want a man above them who knew too much when chipper charley had been proposed an old man rose up turned his hat wrong side out with his fist twisted his beard around his left hand spirted a stream of tobacco juice down through an aisle of rugged men and half way across the earthen floor of the howling wilderness saloon and then proceeded to make a speech that killed the candidate dead on the spot this was the old mans speech that wont go down too much book larnin but the new judge or rather the old baldheaded dumpy dirtyfaced little fellow with the dirty shirt and dirty duck breeches was not a bad man at all the boys had too much hard sense to set up anything but a sort of wooden king to rule over them in this little isolated remote camp and colony of the sierras and they were perfectly content with their log too and never once called out to jupiter for king stork this old idiotic little judge with a round head round red face and round belly had no mind he had no memory he had tried everything in the world almost and always had failed he had come to never expect anything else when he rose up to make a speech of thanks to the boys for the unexpected honor and broke flat down after two or three allusions to the wonderful climate of californy he was perfectly serene perfectly content he had got used to breaking down and it didnt hurt him he used to say to his friends in confidence that he certainly would have made a great poet had he begun in his youth and perhaps he would for he was certainly fit for nothing else under the sun the forks was the wildest and the freshest bit of the blackwhite firset and snowcrowned sierras that ever the creator gave new from his hand to man one thousand men not a woman not a child down in that caсon of theirs so deep that the sun never reached them in the winter and but a little portion of the day in summer forests fir and pine in the caсon and out of the caсon up the hills and up the mountains black and dense till they broke against the colossal granite peaks far above and crowned in everlasting snow three little streams came tumbling down here from the snow peaks in different directions meeting with a precision which showed that they knew their ways perfectly through the woods and from this little union of waters the camp had taken the name of the forks they had no law no religion but for all that the men were not bad it is true they shot and stabbed each other in a rather reckless manner but then they did it in such a manly sort of a way that but little of the curse of cain was supposed to follow maybe it was because life was so desolate and dreary that these men threw it away so frequently and with such refreshing indifference in the misunderstandings at the forks for after all they led but wretched lives that vast freedom of theirs became a sort of desolation this was the new eden it was so new it was still damp you could smell the paint as it were man had just arrived he had not yet slept the rib had not yet been taken from his side he was alone behold these men went up and down the earth naming new things and possessing them strong strange men met there from the farthest parts of the world men were grandly honest there they invariably left gold in their goldpans from day to day open in the claim ounces pounds of it thousands of dollars to be had for the taking up locks and keys were unknown and when the miner went down to the forks on saturday night to settle his account he as a rule handed the merchant his purse and let him weigh whatever amount he demanded without question when the great californian novel which has been prophesied of and for which the literary world seems to be waiting comes to be written it will not be a bit popular and that is because every true californian no matter how depraved he may be somehow has somewhat of the hero and the real man in his makeup and as for the women that are there they are angels so you see there is no one to do the business of the heavy villain sixty miles from the nearest post and neighboring mining camp it was utterly cut off from communication the biggest half of the year by impassable mountains of snow how dark it was down there the earth it seemed had been cracked open then it seemed as if nature had reached out a hand smoothed down the ruggedest places set the whole in a dense and sable forest topt the mountains round about with everlasting snow then reached it on to man and then it looked as if man had come along just as it was nearly ready slid into the crack and not being strong enough to get out resolved to remain there the wild beasts were utterly amazed in this place even the red man had never yet set his lodge deep and dark and still even the birds were mute great snowy clouds white as the peaks about which they twined and to which they flew like flocks of birds at night to rest would droop and droop through the tops of tossing pines and all the steep and stupendous mountain side on either hand glistened with dew and rain in summer or glittered and gleamed in mail and rime of frost and ice in winter these white foamy frightened little rivers ran and tumbled together as if glad to get down the rugged rocky mountain and from under the deep and everlasting shadows of fir and pine and tamarack and spruce and madrona and the dark sweeping yew with its beads of scarlet berries they fairly shouted as they ran and leapt into the open bit of clearing at the forks perhaps they were glad to get away from the grizzlies up there and were shouting with delight at all events they rose together here united their forces in the friendliest sort of manner and so moved on down together with a great deal more dignity than before you see it was called the forks simply because it was the forks in california things name themselves or rather nature names them and that name is visibly written on the face of things and every man may understand who can read if they call a man smith in that country it is simply because he looks as if he ought to be called smith smith and nothing else now there was limber tim one of the first and best men of all the thousand bearded and brawny set of missourians a nervous weakly sensitive sort of a fellow who kept always twisting his legs and arms around as he walked or talked or tried to sit still who never could face anything or any one two minutes without flopping over or turning around or twisting about or trying to turn himself wrong side out and of course anybody instinctively knew his name as soon as he saw him the baptismal name of limber tim was thomas adolphus grosvenor and yet these hairy halfsavage unread missourians who had stopped here in their great pilgrimage of the plains and never yet seen a city or the sea or a schoolhouse or a church knew perfectly well that there was a mistake in this matter the moment they saw him and that his name was limber tim it is pretty safe to say that if one of these wild and unread missourians had met this timid limber man meandering down the mountain trail met him i mean for the first time in all his life without ever having heard of him before he would have gone straight up to him taken him by the hand and shaking it heartily said how dye do limber tim the forks had just been struck some missourians had slid into this crack in the earth had found the little streams full of gold and making sure that they had not been followed and like indians obliterating all signs of their trail they went out slily as they came struck the great stream of immigrants from the plains and turned the current of their friends from pike into this crack of the earth till it flowed full and there was room for no more the forks was at once a little republic a sort of san marino without a patron saint or a single tower a thousand men i said and not a single woman that is not one woman who was what these men called on the square of course two or three fallen women soiled doves had followed the fortunes of these hardy fellows into the new camp but they were in some respects worse than no women at all as was usual with these fallen angels they kept the camp or certain elements in the camp in a constant state of uproar and contributed more to the rapid fillingup of the new graveyard up on the hill than all other causes put together the fat and dirty little judge who really wanted to keep peace and who felt that he must always give an opinion when asked why it was that the boys would fight so dreadfully over these women and kill each other said it is all owing to this glorious climate of californy the truth is they fought and killed each other and kept up the regular sunday funeral all summer through not because these bad women were there but because the good women were not there yet possibly the glorious climate of californy had a bit to do with the hot blood of the men after all chapter ii little billie piper nobody knew when he came perhaps nobody cared he was the smallest man in the camp in fact he was not a man he was only a boyish girlishlooking creature that came and went at will he was so small he crowded no one and so no one cried out about him or paid him any attention so long as they were all busily taking possession of and measuring off the new eden what a shy sensitive girlishlooking man his boyish face was beautiful dreamy and childish it was sometimes halfhidden in a cloud of yellow hair that fell down about it and was always being pushed back by a small white hand that looked helpless enough in the battle of life among these bearded and brawny men on the edge of the new world he had a little bit of a cabin on the hillside not far way from the forks and lived alone this living alone was always rated to be a bad sign it was counted selfish few men lived alone in the mines in fact the cabins in the mines were generally jammed and crowded as tight with men as if they had been little tin boxes packed with sardines when the bees in this new and busy hive began to settle down to their work when they in fact got a little of the hurry and flurry of their own affairs a little off their minds and they had a bit of time to look into the affairs of others they began to reflect that no man had ever entered this little cabin cabins in the mines in those days were generally open to all the latch string to use the expression of the sierras hung on the outside to strangers but this one peculiar cabin had no latchstring for any man men began to get curious i assert that curiosity is not the monopoly of sex one sunday some half idle and wholly inquisitive men went up to this cabin as they passed in the trail which ran hard by and asked for a drink of water a little hand brought a dipper of water to the door a boy face lifted up timidly to the great bearded men from missouri as they in turn drank and passed the big tin dipper from one to the other till it was drained then the little hand took the dipper back again and disappeared while the men half ashamed and wholly confounded stumbled on up the trail the boy had been so civil so shy so modest and yet when occasion offered so kind withal that few could refuse to be his friends and now he had only by lifting his eyes won over this knot of halfvulgar halfruffianly fellows wholly to his side once the saloonkeeper the cinnamonhaired man of the howling wilderness as the one whisky shop of this new eden was called met him on the trail as he was going out with a pick and shovel on his shoulder to prospect for gold what is your name my boy billie piper the timid brown eyes looked up through the cluster of yellow curls as the boy stepped aside to let the big man pass and the two without other words went on their ways oddly enough they allowed this boy to keep his name they called him little billie piper he was an enigma to the miners sometimes he looked to be only fifteen then again he was very thoughtful the fair brow was wrinkled sometimes there were lines sabre cuts of time on the fair delicate face and then he looked to be at least double that age he worked or at least he went out to work every day with his pick and pan and shovel but almost always they saw him standing by the running stream looking into the water dreaming seeing in natures mirror the snowy clouds that blew in moving mosaic overhead and through and over the tops of the tossing firs he rarely spoke to the men more than in monosyllables yet when he did speak to them his language was so refined so far above their common speech and his voice was so soft and his manner so gentle that they saw in him in some sort a superior yet limber tim the boyman came pretty near to this boys life at least he stood nearer to his heart than any one their lives were nearer the same level one sunday they stood together on the hill by the graveyard above the forks tell me said the boy laying his hand on the arm of his companion and looking earnestly and sadly in his face tell me tim why it is that they always have the graveyard on a hill is it because it is a little nearer to heaven his companion did not understand and yet he did understand and was silent they sat down together by and by and looked up out of the great caсon at the drifting white clouds and the boy said looking into heaven as if to himself o fleets of clouds that flee before the burly winds of upper seas then as the sudden twilight fell and they went down the hill together the white crooked moon as if it had just been broken from off the snow peak that it had been hiding behind came out with a star how the red star hangs to the moons white horn there was no answer for his companion was awed to utter silence one day bunker hill a humpedback and unhappy woman of uncertain ways passed through the crowd in the forks some of the rough men laughed and made remarks this boy was there also lifting his eyes to one of these men at his side he said god has made some women a little plain in order that he might have some women that are wholly good these things began to be noised about all things have their culmination even the epizootic has one worst day things only go so far rockets only rise so high then they explode and all is dark and still the judge stood straddled out before the roaring fire of the howling wilderness one night tilting up the tails of his coat with his two hands which he had turned in behind him as he stood there warming the upper ends of his short legs and listening to these questions and the comments of the men at last he seemed to have an inspiration and tilting forward on his toes and bringing his head very low down and his coattails very high up he said solemnly fellowcitizens its a poet then bringing out his right hand and reaching it high in the air as he poised on his right leg in this glorious climate of californy be gad it is cried an irishman jumping up a bryan a poet a rale live lord obryan and so the status of the strange boy was fixed at the forks he was declared to be a poet and was no more a wonder curiosity was satisfied it is something to know that it is no worse growled a very practical old man as he held a pipe in his teeth and rubbed his tobacco between his palms he spoke of it as if it had been a case of the smallpox and as if he was thinking how to best prevent the spread of the infection chapter iii the first woman in the forks one day limber tim came up from the howling wilderness all excitement all gyrations and gimlets and corkscrews he twisted himself around a sapling this great overgrown sixfoot boy without a beard and shouting down to his pardner in the mine old sandy who stood at the bottom of the open claim leaning on his pick resting a moment looking into the bright bubbling water that burst laughing from the bank before him dreaming a bit in the freshness about him and said hallo i say a widders come to town dye hear a widder one whats up and up and on the square sandy only looked up for he was getting old and gray and wrinkled then he looked at the silver stream that ran from the bank and through the rocks at his feet and called to him in the pleasant balmy sunset sweet with the smell of fir and he did not disturb the water again with his pick it looked too pretty laughed and sparkled and leapt and made him glad and yet sad a poet was this man sandy a painter a sculptor a mighty moralist a man who could not write his name he laid down his pick for the sun was just pitching his last lances at the snowpeaks away up yonder above the firs above the clouds and night was coming down with steady steps to possess this chasm in the earth limber tim untwisted himself from the sapling as sandy came up from the mine twisting his great shaggy beard with his right hand while he carried his black slouch hat in his left and the two sauntered on toward their cabin together while sandys great gum boots whetted together as he walked the parson was in a neighboring cabin when it was announced that the first woman had come to the camp the intelligence was received in a profound silence there was a piece of lookingglass tacked up over the fireplace of this cabin old baldy whistled a little air and walked up to this glass sidewise silently and stood there smoothing down his beard ginger blue cried the parson at last bounding up from his bench and throwing out his arms as if throwing the words from the ends of his fingers ginger blue hellterflicker and here he danced around the cabin in a terrible state of excitement to the tune of a string of ironclad oaths that fell like chainshot they called him the parson because it was said he could outswear any man in the camp and that was saying a great deal wonderful as were his achievements in this line after the announcement every one of the ten men there took a look at the little triangular fragment of lookingglass that was tacked up over the fireplace the arrival of eve in paradise was certainly an event but she came too early in the worlds history to create much sensation stop here and fancy the arrival of the first woman on earth today in this day of committees conventions brassband receptions and womans rights you imagine a princess had come to camp a good angel with song and harps or at the least carpetbags and extended crinoline waterfalls and false hair a packtrain of saratoga trunks and all the adjuncts of civilization not at all she had secured a cabin by some accident very near to that of the boy poet and settled down there quietly to go to work yes limber tim had seed her she had ridden the bell mule of the packtrain down the mountain and into town he told how the hats went up in the air from in and about the howling wilderness and how the boys had gone up in rows to the broken lookingglass in the new barbershop and how some had even polished their bowieknives on their boots and sat down and tried to see themselves in the shining blade and adjust their dress accordingly in a little time sandy bent silently over the table in the cabin and with his sleeves rolled up high on his great hairy arms and kneaded away at the dough in the gold pan in silence while limber tim wrestled nervously with the fryingpan by the fire is she purty limber purty sandy shes purtier nur a spotted dog sandy sighed for he felt that there was little hope for him and again fell into a moody silence there was a run that night on the little jew shop at the corner of the howling wilderness before midnight the little kinkyheaded israelite had not a shirt collar or handkerchief or white fabric of any kind whatever in the shop it might have been a bit of firstclass and oldfashioned chivalry that had lain dormant in these great hairy breasts or it might have been their strict regard for the appropriateness of names that made these men at once call her the widder or it might have been some sudden revelation a sort of inspiration given to the first man who saw her as she rode down the mountain into camp or the first man who spoke of her as she rode blushing through their midst with her pretty face held modestly down but be all that as it may certainly there was no design no delay no hesitation about it from the first and yet the appellation was singularly appropriate and perhaps suggested to this poor lone little woman daring to cross the mountains and to come down into this great chasm of the earth among utter strangers the conduct of her life the first woman came unheralded like all good things on earth she came quietly as a snowflake down in their midst without ado or demonstration who she was or where she came from no one seemed to know perhaps the propriety of questioning occurred to some of the men of the camp but it never found expression i had rather say however that when they found there was a real live woman in camp a decent woman who was willing to work and take her place beside the men in the great battle bear her part in the common curse which demands that we shall toil to eat they quietly accepted the fact as men do the fact of the babys arrival without any question whatever this was not really the first woman to come into the camp of this thousand of bearded men and yet it was the first there were now five or six maybe more down at the forks some from sydney some from new orleans waifs of the foam painted children of passion i am not disposed to put all these women in the catalogue of saints they were very devils some of them these women set man against man and that winter made many a crimson place in the great snow banks in the streets they started the first graveyard at the forks and kept it recruited too every holiday and almost every sunday true they did some good i do not deny that for example i have in my mind now the picture of one bunker hill holding the head of a brave young fellow shot through the temple his long black hair in strings and streaming with blood she held him so till he died and mourned and would not be separated from him while a hope or a breath remained the blood on her hands on her face all over her costly silks and lace and on the floor then she had him buried elegantly as possible sent for a preacher away over to yreka to say the funeral service put evergreens about his grave and refused to be comforted all this was very beautiful a touch of tenderness in it all but it was spoiled by the reflection that she had allured and almost forced the fellow into the fight in hopes of revenging herself on the man whom she hated and by whose hand he had to fall there was another woman there who was very benevolent in fact they all were liberal with their money and were the first and freest to bestow upon the needy this woman was a mexican from durango i think and her name was dolores gentle in her manner patient sad not often in the difficulties that distinguished the others but generally alone and by far the best liked of all these poor magdalens this good nature of hers made her most accessible and so she was most sought for deeds of charity toward spring it was said she was ill but no one seemed to know or maybe no one cared if you will stop here to consider it will occur to you that it is a mans disposition to avoid a sick woman but a womans disposition to seek out a sick man and nurse him back to health this being true here is a text for the sorosis a bank had caved on a man only a prospecter a german who lived away in a little cabin on the hillside and crushed him frightfully the man was penniless and alone and help had to come from the camp some one went to dolores she was in her room or cabin out a little way from any one alone and ill sitting up in bed looking wild enough as the man afterwards stated he told her what had happened she leaned her head on her hand a moment and then lifted it looked up and drew a costly ring from her finger the only one on her pale thin hand and gave it to the man who hurried away to get other aid elsewhere now there was nothing very odd or unusual in a woman giving a ring that was often done in fact there was scarcely any coin on the creek in cases of this kind a man generally gave the biggest nugget or specimen he had in his pocket a ring if he could not do better sometimes a sixshooter and so on and let them make the best of it but always something if that something was possible let this be said and remembered of these brave old men of the mountains a few days after this it came out that dolores was dead then it was whispered that she had starved to death this last was said with a sort of a shudder it came out with a struggle between the teeth as if the men were afraid to say it on investigation it was found that the poor woman had been ill some time had lost her bloom and freshness and what becomes of a woman of this kind who has no money when she has lost her bloom and strength never had much money always gave it away to the needy as fast as she got it and so had nothing to fight the world with when she fell ill then the man with the rent the lord of the log cabin a cross between a shylockjew and a flintfaced yankee took her rings and jewels one by one the baker grew exacting and finally the butcher refused to bring her meat and that was all there was of it that was the end that butcher never succeeded there after that some one wrote small pox over his shop every night for a month and it was shunned like a pesthouse but all that did not bring poor dolores back to life the ring was an antique gold with a costly stone and a spanish name which showed her to have been of good family a wedding ring but this woman however was an exception and at best when in health save her generous and sympathetic nature was probably no angel one of these meddlesome men a hungry lean unsatisfied fellow a man with a nose sharp and inquisitive enough to open a castiron cannon ball said one night to a knot of men at the howling wilderness saloon why widder why call her the widder who knows that she was ever married at all a man silently and slowly arose at this and firmly doubled up his fist he stood there towering above that fellow and looking down upon that sharp inquisitive nose as if he wanted to drive it back into the middle of his head but maybe shes a maid answered the terrified nose in haste and fear the other sat down slowly and silently as he had risen and perfectly satisfied that no insult had been intended this was sandy the judge was there and as the conversation had fallen through by this mans remark he felt called upon to resume it in a friendly sort of a way and said no no shes not a maid i reckon not an old maid he scratched his bald head above his ear and went on for the big man at his side began to double up his knuckles i should say shes a widder you see the maids never gits this far they seem to spile first the judge spoke as if talking of a sort of pickled oyster or smoked ham chapter iv sunday in the sierras never did the press feed on a political war or a calumniated poet as these men of the howling wilderness fed on this one woman of the forks yet let it be remembered they always and to a man with scarce an exception spoke of her with the profoundest respect few of them had had the pleasure of seeing her fewer still of speaking to her yet she was the everpresent topic even the weather in a london winter is hardly more popular a theme than was the widow when they met in knots in the little town after the days work was over the brave silent modest little woman had put her hands to the plow at once these men knew perfectly well that honest people had no business there but to work and when her little hands that did not look at all as if they had been used to toil took hold of the hard fact of life and the little face bent above the washtub and the fine white brow glistened with a diadem of diamonds that grew there as a price for bread they loved her to a man what strange savage scenes were enacted here before the arrival of this one good woman every saturday night was a sort of carnival of death men went about from drinkingshop to drinkingshop howling like modocs swinging their pistols proclaiming themselves chiefs and seeking for bloody combat they gave the country a name and a reputation in this first year of gold mining in the sierras that will survive them every one on sunday the scene was somewhat changed with all their savagery and wildness and nonsense it was always understood that the work of the week must go on and sunday was the great day of preparation sunday was not a day of rest it is true the miners slept a little later on sunday morning but sunday was to all a day of terror and petty troubles beyond measure it always came to some ones turn every sunday morning in every mess or cabin to begin his weeks cooking for his mess and for that reason if for no other there was at least one man miserable in every cabin whenever the dreaded sunday came then there was the mending of clothes mercy great big hairy men sitting up and out on the hillside with their backs up against the pines sitting there out of sight half naked stitching stitching stitching and swearing at every stitch but the great and terrible event of sunday before the widow came was the washing of clothes neither love nor money could induce any one save the uncertain little chinaman to undertake this task for them before the arrival of the widow therefore when sunday came these men went down in line silently and solemnly to the little mountain stream allowed to rest and run clear and crystallike on sunday and stood in a row along its banks in topboots duck breeches red shirts and great broad hats then at a word each man laid aside his hat undid the bosom of his shirt straightened his arms and drew his shirt up and over his head and then fastened his belt and squatted by the stream and rubbed and rubbed and rubbed brawnymuscled men nude above the waist naked and not ashamed hairybreasted and bearded noble kingly men miners washing their shirts in a mountainstream of the sierras thoughtful earnest splendid men boughs above them pinetops toying with the sun that here and there reached through like fingers pointing at them from the far pure purple of the sky and a stillness so profound perfect holy as a temple nature knows her sabbath i would give more for a painting of this scene that sun that sky and wood the water there the brave strong men the thinkers and the workers there nude and natural silent and sincere bending to their work than for all the battle scenes that could be hung upon a palace wall when the great man comes the painter of the true and great these men will be remembered it is said that diogenes when he saw a boy drinking water from his hand scooped up from the stream threw away his cup the last utensil he had retained this shirtwashing went on in some camps for years these men were compelled to study simplicity and did from necessity nearly what the cynic did from caprice where every man had to carry his effects on his back for days and days through steep and rugged paths an extra garment was not to be thought of men got used to the oneshirt system and seemed to like it some stuck to it with a tenacity hardly respectful to the near approach of civilization once upon a time to coin a new beginning a younger brother came out to visit one of these brave old miners now gray and grizzled but true to his old traditions and habits of life he called on him on sunday entered his cabin and found him covered in his blankets what my brother are you sick said he after the first salutations and embraces were exchanged sick no not sick then why are you in bed oh i washed my shirt today and got in bed to let it dry why havent you got but the one shirt but the one shirt no do you think a man wants a thousand shirts these men were mostly shy with their letters and their tales of love that was sacred ground upon which no strange rude feet could pass no goldhunter there perhaps but had his love his one only love without a chance or possibility of changing the object of his devotion even if he had desired it men must love as well as women it is the most natural and consequently the most proper thing on earth imagine how intensified and how tender a mans devotion would become under circumstances like these the one image in his heart the one hope her so much time to think bending to the work in the running water under the trees on the narrow trail beneath the shadows of the forest by the camp and cabinfire her face and hers only with no new face rising up crossing his path confronting him for days for months for years see how holy a thing his love would grow to be this you observe is a new man a new manner of lover love i say is a requirement a necessity it is as necessary for a complete man to love as it is for him to breathe pure air and it is as natural these men being so far removed from any personal contact with the objects of their affections and only now and then at long intervals receiving letters all marked and remarked across the backs from the remailings from camp to camp of course knew of no interruptions in the current of their devotion and loved in a singularly earnest and sincere way i doubt if there be anything like it in history when men go to war they have the glory and excitement of battle to allure them then the eyes of many women are upon them they are not locked up like these men of the sierras with only their work and the one thing to think of when they go to sea sailors find new faces in every port but these men from the time they crossed the missouri or left the atlantic coast had known no strange gods hardly heard a womans voice till they returned but let us return to this one firm first woman who had come into camp and taken at once upon her shoulders the task of washing and mending the miners clothes men even the most bloated and besotted walked as straight as possible up the trail that led by the widows cabin as they passed that way at night and kept back their jokes and warwhoops till far up the creek and out of her hearing in the pines a general improvement was noticed in all who dwelt in sight or hearing of her cabin in fact that portion of the creek became a sort of west end and cabin rent went up in that vicinity men were made better gentler no doubt of that if then one plain woman rude herself by nature can do so much what is not left for gentle and cultured woman who is or should be the true missionary of the west the world a womans weakness is her strength she was tall gentle genial too and soon a favorite with her many many patrons she had a scar on the left side of her face they said reaching from the chin to the cheek but with a womans tact she always kept her right side to her company and the scar was not always noticed what had been her history what troubles she had had what tempests she had stood against or what great storm had blown this solitary woman far into the great black sea of firs that belts about and lies in the shadow of the sierras like a lone white seadove you sometimes find far out in the china seas no man knew and be it said to the credit of the forks no man cared to inquire this meeting together this coming and going of thousands of men from all parts of the earth where each man stood on the character he made there in a day deadened curiosity perhaps at all events you can go a stranger today any where along the pacific and if your character indicates the gentleman you are accepted as such and no man cares to ask of your antecedents a convenient thing i grant for many but nevertheless a good thing and a correct thing for any country the old jewish law of every seven years forgiving each man his debt was an age in advance of our laws of today and if any means could be devised by which every seven years to forgive all men their offences and let them begin life anew all together an even start it would be better still how the work did pour in upon this first woman in this wild eden set with thorns and with thistles there were not many clothes in the forks that were worth washing but the few pieces that were presentable came almost every day to the door of the widow to be taken in by the little hand that ever opened to the knock of the miners knuckles on the door and reached through the partly opened place and drew back timidly and with scarce a word no man had yet entered her cabin the wise little woman if one man had been so favored without good and sufficient reason then jealousy unless others had been allowed to enter also would have made a funeral and very soon too with that one favored man the central figure no man had entered that cabin but a boy had and oftentime too in fact from the first little billie piper whose cabin as i have said stood hard by seemed to be as much at home and as much in place with the widow as he was out of place with the men the friendship here made him enemies elsewhere such is human nature chapter v washee washee two days after the widow had arrived washeewashee as the boys had named him stood out on the steps of his cabin all the afternoon looking up the forks and down the forks and wondering what in the world was the reason the boys did not come creaking along and screeching their great gum boots together with their extra shirt for wash wadded down in one of the spacious legs three days after the widow had arrived she had absorbed all the business four days after she had arrived she absorbed washeewashee and now it was the brown hand of little mooneyed washeewashee that reached through the door took the clothes and handed them out again or at least such portions as he chose to hand out to the bearded giants standing there patiently waiting at the door of the widows cabin the face of the widow was now almost entirely invisible it was as if there was no sun at the forks and all the sky was in a perpetual eclipse of clouds soon there was trouble clothes began to disappear one bearded sovereign a gallant man who refused to complain because there was a woman in the case was observed to wear his coat buttoned very closely up to his chin and that too in midday in summer this good man had at first lost only his extra shirt he did not complain he simply went to bed on sunday sent his shirt early to the wash expecting to rise in the afternoon dress and go to town a week went by the man could not stay in bed till the day of judgment so he rose up buttoned up to the throat and went down to buy another supply other circumstances not dissimilar in result began to be talked of quietly and men began to question whether or not after all the camp had been greatly the gainer by this new element in its population one afternoon there was a commotion at the door of the widows cabin sandy was in trouble with washeewashee the mooneyed little man tried to get back into the house but the great big giant had been too long a patient and uncomplaining sufferer to let him escape now and he reached for his queue and drew him forth as a showman does a black snake from a cage the widow saw the great hairy face of this grizzly giant and retreated far back into the cabin she was certain she was terribly afraid of this great big awkward halfclad exasperated man and therefore with a womans consistency she came to the door and in a voice softer than running water to sandys ears asked what could be the matter sandy was taken by surprise and could not say a word he only rolled his great head from one shoulder to the other got his hands lashed up somehow in his leather belt and stood there sadly embarrassed but who ever saw an embarrassed chinaman the innocent little fellow turning his soft brown almond eyes up to the widow told her as poor sandy stared on straight down the hill that this dreadful amelikan wanted him to leave her and to go home with him to be his wife when sandy heard this last he disappeared crestfallen and utterly crushed he went home but not to rest he told limber tim all about what had happened how he had stood it all in silence till it came to the last shirt how the chinaman had lied and how he was now certain that it was this same little celestial who had been robbing him limber tim raised himself on his elbow where he lay in his bunk and looking at sandy struck out emphatically with his hand and cried lay fur him sandy drew on his great gum boots again limber tim rose up and then the two men kept creaking and screeching and whetting their great boots together as they went without speaking and in single file down the hill towards town there was an expression of ineffable peace and tranquility on the face of washeewashee that twilight as he wended his way from the widows cabin to his own his days work was done and the little mans face looked the soul of repose possibly he was saying with the great good poet whose lines you hear at evening time on the lips of nearly every english artisan something attempted something done has earnd a nights repose washeewashee looked strangely fat for a chinaman as he peacefully toddled down the trail still wearing as he neared his cabin that look of calm delight and perfect innocence such only as the pure in heart are supposed to wear his hands were drawn up and folded calmly across his obtruding stomach as if he feared he might possibly burst open and wanted to be ready to hold himself together in the greatlittle republic there where all had begun an even and equal race in the battle of life where all had begun as beggars this tawny little man from the faroff flowery kingdom was alone he was the only representative of his innumerable millions in all that camp and he did seem so fat so perfectly full of satisfaction perhaps he smiled to think how fat he was and too how he had flourished in the little democracy he was making a short turn in the trail still holding his clasped hands over his extended stomach still smiling peacefully out of his halfshut eyes washee washee a double bolt of thunder was in his ears a tremendous hand reached out from behind a pine and then the fat little chinaman squatted down and began to wilt and melt beneath it washeewashee come washeewashee was not at all willing to come but that made not the slightest difference in the world to sandy the little almondeyed man was not at all heavy old flannel shirts cotton overalls stockings cotton collars and cambric handkerchiefs never are heavy no matter how well they may be wadded in and padded away and tucked up and twisted under an outer garment and so before he had time to say a word he was on his way to the widows with sandy while limber tim with his mouth halfopen came corkscrewing up the trail and grinding and whetting his screechy gum boots together after them there is a fine marble statue in the garden at naples near the massive marble head of virgil which represents some great giant as striding along with some little pigmy thrown over his shoulder which he is carelessly holding on by the heel sandy looked not wholly unlike that statue as he strode up the trail with washeewashee he reached the door of the widows cabin knocked with the knuckles of his left hand while his right hand held on to an ankle that hung down over his left shoulder and calmly waited an answer the door halfway opened beg pardon mum he bowed stiffly as he said this and then shifting washeewashee round quietly took his other heel in his other hand and proceeded to shake him up and down and dance him and stand him gently on his head until the clothes began to burst out from under his blue seamless garment and to peep through his pockets and to reach down around his throat and dangle about his face till the little man was nearly smothered then sandy set him down a moment to rest and he looked in his face as he sat there and it had the same peaceful smile the same calm satisfaction as before the little man now put his head to one side shut his pretty brown eyes a little tighter at the corners and opened his mouth the least bit in the world and put out his tongue as if he was about to sing a hymn then sandy took him up again he smiled again sweeter than before sandy tilted him side wise and shook him again then there fell a spoon then a pepperbox and then a small brass candlestick and at last as he rolled him over and shook the other side there came out a machine strangely and wonderfully made of whalebone and brass and hooks and eyes that sandy had never seen before and did not at all understand but supposed was either a fish trap or some new invention for washing gold then limber tim who had screwed his back up against the palings and watched all this with his mouth open came down and reaching out with his thumb and finger as if they had been a pair of tongs took the garments one by one named them for he knew them and their owners well and laid them silently aside then he took washeewashee from the hands of sandy and stood him up or tried to stand him up alone he looked like a flagstaff with the banner falling loosely around it in an indolent wind he held him up by the queue awhile but he wilted and sank down gently at his feet all the time smiling sweetly as before all the time looking up with a halfclosed eye and halfparted lips as though he was enjoying himself perfectly and would like to laugh only that he had too much respect for the present company if i could only shake the lies out of him mum as easily as i did this ere spoon and this ere candlestick and this ere this ere sandy had stooped and picked up the articles as he spoke and now was handing them to the widow in triumph poor little helpless pitiful fellow the widow was looking straight at the celestial who sat there piled up in a little bit of a heap the limpest thing in all the forks perhaps save limber tim let him go please let him go bring the things and come in you can go now john but dont do so any more it is not right the widow smiled in pity as she said this to washeewashee the chinaman understood the first proposition perfectly but not the last at all to him all this was simply a bad investment to him it was only a little shipwreck and having been taught by the philosophers of his country to prepare for adversity in the hour of prosperity he was not at all lacking in resignation now he rose up smiled that patient and peaceful smile of his and wended his way to his home sandy looked a moment at the retreating hungrylooking little chinaman and then thrust his two great hands into his two great pockets and tilting his head first on the left shoulder and then on the right tried hard to look the widow in the face but found himself contemplating the toes of his great gum boots will you not come in the man rolled forward he sat down in the widows cabin in a perfect glow of excitement and delight i am bound to admit that upright and great as sandy was he kept thinking to himself what will the judge and the boys say of this he even was glad in his heart that limber tim stood with his back glued up against the palings on the outside and his hands reached back and wound in and around the rails so that he could testify to the boys tell it in fact to the world that he had entered in and sat down in the widows cabin it was not easy work for sandy sitting there he soon began to suffer he hitched about and twisted around on the broad wooden stool as if he had sat down on a very hot stove the widow sat a little way back across the cabin a bit of work in her lap looking up at sandy now and now dropping her halfsad blue eyes down to her work and all the time in a low sweet way doing every word of the talking sandys hot stove kept getting hotter and hotter he began to wish he was down with the boys at the howling wilderness consulting the oracle of cocktails all at once he seemed to discover his great long legs they seemed to him as if they reached almost clean across the cabin like two great anacondas going to swallow up the widow he fished them up curved them threw his two great hands across them nursed them affectionately but they seemed more in the way and uglier than ever before then he thrust them out again but jerked them back instantly and drove them back under his bench as if they had been two big and unruly bulldogs and he nearly upset himself in doing it they had fairly frightened him they were surely never half so long before it seemed to him as if they would reach across the room through the wall and even down to the howling wilderness he twisted them up under the bench and got them fast there and was glad of it for now they would not and could not run out and rush across the room at the widow but now poor sandy saw another skeleton his eyes came upon them suddenly in a sort of discovery it seemed as if he had just found them out for the first time and knew them for mortal enemies and determined to do away with them at once and at any sacrifice such hands had the widow really been looking at them all this time the back of that hand was big and rough as the bark of a tree that finger nail had a white rim of dough around it that thumb nail was as big and about as dirty as a crevicing spoon he picked up that hand thrust it under him sat firmly over on that side and held it down and out of sight with all his might the other one lay there still in the way it was uglier than the one he had just slain and hidden away in the bush there was dirt enough about the nails to make a small mining claim he rolled the hand over and over on his lap as if it had been somebodys baby and a baby with the colic at last in a state of desperation he rolled it off and let it fall and take care of itself it hung down at his side like a great big felon from the scaffold it twisted and swung around there as if it had just been hung up by the neck in the expiation of some awful crime it felt to sandy as if it weighed a ton he tried to lift it up again to take care of it to nurse it to turn it over on its stomach to stroke it and talk to it and pity it and soothe away its colic but lo he could not lift it he began to perspire he was so very warm it was the warmest time that sandy had ever seen all this time sandy had sat close by the door and not one word had he uttered the widow rose up laid her work on the table all the time smiling sweetly half sadly and going up to the fireplace took from the box in the corner pine knot after pine knot and laid them on the blazing fire come the evening is chilly will you not sit closer to the fire sandy sat still as the statue of moses in the vatican but that abominable felon hanging by the neck at his side kept twisting around and around and around as if he never would die or be still the widow sat down with her work as before and this time she began to talk about the weather trusting that on this subject at least her great good friend could open his lips and speak how very cold it is this evening the chill of the snow is in the air it blows down from the banks of snow on the mountain and i fancy it may be cold here in this rickety cabin the summer through still the ugly convict that now began to grow black in the face swung and twisted at his side but he did not speak do you not feel cold yes um the two words came out like the bark of a bulldog as if one of the brutes he had drawn back under his bench had stuck out his nose and yelped in the face of the widow and sandy was frightened nearly to death the perspiration dropped from his brow to his hand and he knew that things could not last in this way much longer the bulldogs would be out and he knew it the dead man that he was sitting down upon would rise up to judgment and the felon at his side was only swinging and turning and twisting more than before sandy shut his eyes and attempted to rise his gum boots screeched the bench creaked as he began to undouble himself it turned up and hung on behind him as if it had been a lobster he shook it off and began to tower up like a pine he feared he would pierce through the roof and began to look out through the halfopen door and to stretch out the prostrate hand then he stood still and was more bewildered than before the widow was looking straight at him and expecting him to speak he wished he had not got up at all if he was only back on that overthrown bench with the dead man beneath him and the bulldogs below and the felon swinging loosely at his side how happy he would be he tried to speak tried like a man but if it had been to save his life to save her life the world he could not find will to shape one word he backed and blundered and stumbled across the threshold and drew a breath such a breath the first he had drawn for half an hour as he stood outside with the widows little feet following to the threshold and her pretty miniature face looking up to his as if looking up to the top of a pine you will come again will you not you have been so very kind please to call step in as you pass and rest it is so lonesome here you know nobody that anybody knows and then you are such good company and then the pretty little widow with the sad sweet face laughed the prettiest little laugh that ever was laughed this side that other eden with its one fair woman limber tim closed his mouth and unscrewed himself from the palings on the fence without as sandy appeared and the two took their way to their cabin and you are such good company that was all sandy could remember what could he have said he tried and tried to recall his observations whatever they may have been on the various topics of the day but in vain he could only remember the circumstance of driving two ugly bulldogs back under his bench of slaying and hiding away his mortal enemy and then hanging a felon for high treason and then chiefest of all you will come again it is lonesome here you are such good company you are such good company the wind sang it through the trees as he wended his way home the water away down in the caсon below the trail sang it soft and low and sweet sang it ever and nothing more and the teakettle that night simmered and sang and sang this one sweet song for sandy he took the first opportunity after supper to slip out and away from limber tim and there in the dark with his face to the great black forest he stood saying over and over to himself in his great coarse voice trying to catch the soft tones of the widow you are such good company that evening limber tim leaned up against the logs of the howling wilderness and told all that had happened and how sandy had seen the widow how he had sat in her cabin how he had talked and how she had smiled and what a very hero his pardner had become he told of washeewashee the story of washeewashee went through the forks and then the next morning the forks rose up and went through washeewashee perhaps it was what the widow had said about the poor little helpless harmless man that saved him but certain it was for some unknown reason the miners dealt gently with this strange little stranger had this been one or even a dozen of their own kind some tree in the neighborhood of the forks would have borne in less than an hour one or even a dozen of strange and ugly fruit they went to washeewashees cabin he smiled as he saw them approach half shut his eyes as they entered laid his head a little to one side as they tore up his bunk and looked perfectly happy and peaceful as a lamb as they pulled out from under it enough old clothes to open a shop in petticoat lane or even in bow street they found a rifleblanket in one of his wooden shoes and it was heavy with golddust poor washeewashee when called upon to explain said timidly that he had found it floating up the river past his cabin and took it in to dry it he seemed hurt when they refused to believe him they found a hose coiled up in his great bamboo hat one of the men took hold of his queue his beautiful long black queue that swept the ground with its braided folds and black silk tassels tipped with red and gold and found it heavy with nuggets hidden away for what purpose goodness only knows it was heavy enough to sink it like a shot were it a fish line and all this gold was his they threatened hard things to washeewashee these rough outraged hairy fellows who had patronized him and helped him and tried to get him along in the world but he was perfectly passive and tranquil a man who stood there with a bundle of recovered treasuretrove in the shape of shirts and coats of many colors because of many patches took washeewashee by the little pink ear and twisted him up and around till he saw his face then he let him go and catching his clothes up under his arm strode on out of the cabin and on down to his claim and his work the meekest man that the world has seen since socrates was washeewashee he sat there with the same semigrin on his face the same half smile in his almond eyes though a man shook a rope in his face jerked it up thrust out his tongue pointed to a tree and hung himself in pantomime before this placid chinaman what will we do with him a bearded citizen stood there with a bundle of clothes under his arm waiting to be gone poor lonesome harmless little man sandy stood there repeating the words of the little widow without knowing it he does lie so helplessly said one if he could only lie decently we might hang him decently tell you what flog him and send him adrift the man who proposed this was a stranger with an anchor and other hallmarks of the sea on his hairy arms wolves would eat im on the mountain wolves eat a chinaman they d eat a gum boot fust tell you what well do growled the gopher reform him reform hell said the sailor to himself come lets do a little missionary business and begin at home urged the gopher get the judge to reprimand him have him talk to him an hour then let the parson speak to him another hour if he lives that through he will be an honest man or if not honest he will at least be harmless now they had no preacher in the forks not even the semblance of one yet neither had they a lawyer or doctor but this parson was a power in the camp he was perhaps the most popular man there he was certainly the most influential for he was a man who could talk they called him the parson because he was certainly the profanest man in all the mines the idea was novel and was at once adopted here at last was a practical application of the popular feeling in older republics that the officers are the servants of the public the little judge here was certainly the peoples servant if he had not been if he had asserted himself at all and taken up arms and fortified himself behind a barricade of books they would simply have called a miners meeting in half an hour and in half an hour would have had the little man ousted and another man in his place and then back to their work as if nothing ever had happened never in the world had men known such absolute liberty as was attained here there was not even the dominion of woman and yet they were not happy they marched washeewashee to the howling wilderness told the sentence and called upon the parson to enforce judgment he now took a cordial and began washeewashee sat before him on a bench leaning against the wall the little man seemed as if he was about to go to sleep possibly his conscience had kept him awake the night before when he found that all his little investments had been a failure in the forks the parson began washeewashee flinched jerked back sat bolt upright and seemed to suffer then the parson shot another oath this time it came like a cannon ball and red hot too for washeewashee was almost lifted out of his seat then the parson took his breath a bit rolled the quid of tobacco in his mouth from left to right and from right to left and as he did so he selected the very broadest knottiest and ugliest oaths that he had found in all his fifty years of life at sea and on the border washeewashee had lost his expression of peace he had evidently been terribly shaken the parson had rested a good spell however and the little slim brown man before him who had crawled out over the great wall of china sailed across the sea of seas climbed the sierras and sat down in their midst to begin the old clothes business without pay or promise was again settling back as if about to surrender to sleep cannon balls conical shot chain shot and shot red hot never were such oaths heard in the world before the chinaman fell over stop cried the barkeeper of the howling wilderness who didnt want the expense of the funeral stop do you mean to cuss him to death the chinaman was allowed time to recover and then they sat him again on the bench a man fanned him with his broad bamboo hat lest he should faint before the last half of the punishment was nearly through and the judge was called upon to enforce the remainder of their sentence the judge come forward slowly put his two hands back under his coat tails tilted forward on his toes and began washeewashee in this glorious climate of californy how could you washeewashee nodded and the judge broke down badly embarrassed at last he recovered himself and began in a deep earnest and entreating tone washeewashee in this glorious climate of californy you should remember the seventh commandment and never under any circumstances or temptations that beset you should you covet your neighbors goods or his boots or his shirt or his socks or his handkerchief or any thing that is his or the judge paused the men giggled and then they roared and laughed and danced about their little judge for washeewashee had folded his little brown hands in his lap and was sleeping as sweetly as a baby in its cradle chapter vi some unwritten history the murder of joseph smith the socalled prophet meant more than any other similar event in history this man as well as his brother hiram was not only an honest brave gentleman but also a man of culture and refinement the latter it may not be generally known was a candidate for congress when that place was counted the post of honor nothing in the new world ever so intensified the minds of men as the life and death of this singular man joseph smith on the one hand he was hated to death on the other hand he was adored while living worshiped when dead men for his memorys sake burned their bridges behind them as it were and fled destitute to the wilderness with no capital but a hoe and a wheelbarrow they built up in a quarter of a century in the middle of a desert the most remote and the most remarkable commonwealth that the world has ever seen salt lake city was the one pier upon which was laid the long and unbroken iron chain of the pacific railroad on what singular foundations lie the corner stones of some of the greatest achievements i think you can safely say that had there been no joseph smith there had been up to this date at least no pacific railroad this tragedy meant everything to those who took part in it no matter on which side they fought or followed no one saw beyond the circle of houses in which they then lived and moved as a rule those who followed the prophet as well as those who murdered him were wild ignorant men from the mountains of tennessee the wilds of virginia and their own missouri to these men as i have said this tragedy meant all the world carthage to them meant all that carthage ever meant to rome nearly a hundred men heavily masked moving down upon a prison with its half dozen inmates a little tussle one struggle at the door then a few shots then a few men lying in their blood on the prison floor then a leap from a window a fall a man lying dead in the jail yard some masked men pick up the body they sit it up against a pump in the yard and then they as if to be doubly certain fire at the dead body of the prophet as they file out of the jail yard and disappear all is consternation terror now flight it seems there will not be one human being save the dead and dying left in the town one family alone dares to remain to care for the murdered the work was well done if such a deed can be done well this certainly was the secret was kept as never had secret been kept before life was depending not only the life of the man who had taken part but the lives of his children his wife all his house who says the west is not the world of romance and tragedy a pendulum must swing about as far one way as it does the other blood meant blood from the stains on that prison floor sprang the draggons teeth out of that awful day came forth a singular conception the danites destroying angels the prophet of god as these men professed had been slain unlike the christians they proposed to slay in revenge i fancy you might trace this on till you came to the awful tragedy of mountain meadows putting the two tragedies together side by side and passing them on to the impartial judgment of some pagan i am not certain that he would not pronounce in favor of the mormon history trenches closely upon romance and here we must leave the very uncertain and crudely traced outline of the former and follow on in the latter as we began the story runs that the danites found trace of one man who had taken an active part in the death of their prophet his name was williams and was a man of a large and refined family williams in the course of a year was found dead drowned drowned he certainly was but whether by accident or the design of enemies for suicide does not sever the life of the borderer was not known then his eldest son was found dead in the woods his empty rifle was in his hand he too might have perished either by accident or design the mother was the next victim there was consternation in the family in all the settlement another victim then another now it was certain that some awful agency was at work and that the family was doomed the only hope of safety lay in flight one night the four surviving children three grown sons and a daughter set out to cross the plains they had a team of strong horses and pushed on in the hope of falling in with some train of emigrants joining them and thus blending in with and mixing with their members throw the enemy from off the track they found their train joined it crossed the missouri river and moving on began to deem themselves secure soon it came the turn for one of the brothers to stand guard he kissed his pale sad sister as he shouldered his gun and went on duty and it was well that he said goodbye for he was never heard of afterwards as they neared the rocky mountains a party of half a dozen rode out from the train to take buffalo one of the two remaining brothers was of this party he never returned now only two remained the brother and sister often sat silent and bowed by the campfire and looked sadly into each others faces what could they be thinking of what was the one question in their minds the man could only have been saying to himself sister whose turn next is it you or i his brow darkened as he thought how terrible it would be to leave his sister all alone and there was an old roman nobility in the wish that she might die before him the question was not long unsettled as they neared the sierras a stray shot from the willows that grow on the banks of the humboldt laid the brother dead at his sisters feet nancy williams was now left alone one day as they ascended the sierras she too was missed little was said people feared to speak there was something terrible in this persecution to the death in the dark who were these men and where did they sit at your very elbow in camp and dip from the same dish they too could keep secrets as well as the assassins of their socalled prophet what had become of nancy williams had she too really been murdered or had she in terror stolen away in disguise and made her way into the mines alone no one knew people soon became too much concerned with their own affairs as they neared the goldfields and men only now and then thought of the name of nancy williams one day two strange men entered the howling wilderness saloon and spoke in signs and monosyllables to the cinnamonhaired barkeeper and pointed up toward the cabin of the widow sandy entered as these two men went out the barkeeper looked at sandy a long time as if some great question was battling in his mind at last in a husky and hurried voice he said as he looked out through the door and over his shoulder as if he feared the very logs of the house might betray him thems danites what in hell do they want at the forks the sledgehammer fist fell on the counter like a thunderbolt shoo the red bristled head of the barkeeper reached over toward sandy the barkeepers hand reached out and took sandy by the loose blueshirt bosom and drew him close up to the red head then again looking toward the door and then back over his shoulder as if he suspected that his own bottles might hear him he said in a sharp hissing whisper shoo they want nancy williams sandys mind at once turned to the widow he dared not trust the barkeeper in truth no man dared trust his best friend where this most terrible and secret order was concerned he did not answer this man but silently and as unconcerned as possible turned away and went back to his cabin chapter vii that boy as before remarked the boy poet little billie piper sly and timid as he was with the men was about the first to make friends with this first woman in this wild eden men noted this as they did all things that in any way touched the life or affairs of the widow and made their observations accordingly thims a bad lot said the irishman as he rested his elbow on the counter and held his glass poised in the air thims a bad lot fur the woman as writes poetry then the son of erin winked at the row of men by his side winked right and left lifted his glass shut both his eyes and swallowed his tarantula juice as they called it in the mines then this man wiped his broad mouth on his red sleeve hitched up the broad belt that supported his duck breeches and said with another wink jist think of bryan that fellow lord obryan why gints i tell yez he was pizen on the six but the parson the great rival of sandy for the widows affections took a deeper interest in this than that of an idle gossip it was with a lofty sort of derision in his tone and manner that he now always spoke of the strange little poet as that boy the parson regarded him with bitter envy as he oftentimes at dusk and alone saw him enter the widows cabin at such times the parson would usually stride up and down the trail and swear to himself till he fairly tore the bark from the trees on one occasion the boy returning to his own cabin at an earlier hour than usual was met in the trail where it ran around the spur of the mountain on a high bluff by the infuriated parson little billie as was his custom gave him the trail all of the trail and stood quite aside on the lower hillside to let him pass but the parson did not pass on he came close up to the boy as he stood there alone in the dusk half trembling with fear as the parson approached the strong man did not speak at first his face was terrible with rage and a strange tumult of thought the stars were half hidden by the sailing clouds and the moon had not risen it was almost dark away up on the mountain side a wolf called to his companion and a lonesome nightbird with a sharp cracked voice kept up a mournful monotone in the caсon below the boy began to tremble as the man towered up above him and looked down into his uplifted face by god youngster muttered the man between his teeth the boy sank on his knees as he saw the parson look up and down the trail as if to make sure that no one was in sight then he reached his great hand and clutched him sharp by the shoulder come here come come with me the broad hand tightened like a vice on the shoulder the boy tried to rise but trembled and half fell to the ground the infuriated half monster man held tight to his shoulder and led toward the precipice the boy half lifted half led half dragged found himself powerless in the hands of the parson and was soon on the brink of the caсon now sir damn you what have you been doing at the widows the boy stood trembling before him boy do you hear i intend to pitch you over the rocks and break your infernal slim little neck the boy still was silent he could not even lift his eyes he was preparing to die now sir tell me the truth what have you been doing at the widows the boy trembled like a bird in the clutches of a hawk but could not speak the parson looked up the trail and down the trail all was silent save the roar of the water in the caсon below the interrupted howl of the wolf on the hill and the mournful and monotonous call of the nightbird he looked up through the caсon at the sky it was a dark and cloudy night now and then a star stood out in the fresco of clouds but it was a gloomy night now you look here and he shook the boy by the shoulder and laughed like a demon dont you know that if you go on this way you will fall over this bluff some night and break your cussed little neck dont you know that you boy you brat still the boy could not speak or even lift his face ill save you the trouble said the parson between his teeth the boys will rather like it they will say they knew you would break your neck some night the boy did not speak but beneath the iron clutch of the parson settled to his knees now sir you have just one minute do you see that star when that flying cloud covers that star then you die and may god help you and me the mans voice was husky with rage and from the contemplation of his awful crime speak boy speak speak but once before i murder you the boys eyes were lifted to the star to the flying cloud that was about to cover it and then to the eyes of the parson and he trembling half whispering said please parson may i pray the iron hand relaxed the man let go his hold and staggering back to the trail went down the hill in silence and into the dark where he belonged the two men who had entered the saloon at the forks so mysteriously and had so terrified the barkeeper had disappeared yet sandy every man knew that these men or their agents were all the time in their midst no one knew the face of nancy williams everybody knew the story of her life at first there was terror in the camp could the widow be nancy williams it was decided that that was impossible then all was peace chapter viii sandys courtship swiftly and very sweetly for sandy the days went by in the forks down there deep in the earth almost in the dark of the underworld in the cool of the forest in the fragrance and spice and sweetness of the fir and madrona and tamarack for ever dripping with dew and dropping their fragrant gums and spices on the carpeted mossy mountain side filling the deep chasm with an odor found nowhere save in the heart of the sierras and sandy was happy at last you will please come again you are such good company sandy had come to think he was one of the best talkers in the world and thinking so he was really able to begin to talk such is the tact and power for good or ill of woman water will find its level in this camp in all new camps in all new countries new enterprises wars controversies no matter what there are certain men who come to the surface these come to the front and men stand aside and they take their place they stay there for they belong there they may not come immediately but let any great question be taken up let it be one of enough consequence to stir up the waters and the waters will find their level no man need stilt himself up or seek applause or friends in high places or loud praise if he belongs to the front he will get there in time and will remain there when he arrives if he does not there is but little need for him to push and bribe and bother at all about it he will only stand up in the light long enough to show to the world that some one has escaped from the woodcut of a comic almanac or the zoological gardens and will then sink back to end his life in complaining of hard treatment and lack of appreciation let us rather accept the situation good or bad play the piece out and look to promotion in the next great drama do not despise my spicy little camp in the sierras it was a world of itself perhaps it was as large as all paradise was at the first and then it was so new so fresh so fragrant sweet and primitive it was something to be the first man in that camp cжsar if they have written their chronicles true would have preferred it to the second place in rome here only the strong clear heads towered up it was not accident that made sandy or the parson either a head man in the forks the forks knew just how sterling and how solid and how sincere he was no flattery here there was not a penny to win by it no applause to care for here no public opinion to appease or woo if a man did not like the company at the howling wilderness he need not put in an appearance he could stay at home lord of his castle toil three hundred and sixtyfive days in the year and no man would question him or doubt his motives nor was it any accident that made limber tim the partner of sandy these things have a deeper root than men suppose sandy was the strongest man in the camp limber tim was the weakest nothing in nature was more natural than their present relation it is as remarkable as it is true that wild beasts even when the sexes more decent than men are divided from each other mate thus the strong bear or the strong buck companions with the weak this sandy never blustered or asserted himself at all he was born above most men of his class and he stood at their head boldly without knowing it had he been born an indian he would have been a chief would have led in battle and dictated in council without question or without opposition from any one had he been born in the old time of kings he would have put out his hand taken a crown and worn it as a man wears the most fitting garment by instinct sandy was born king of the forks he was king already without knowing it or caring to rule it there are people just like that in the world you know great silent fearless fellows or at least there are in the sierraworld and they are as good as they are great they are there throned there filling up more of the world than any ten thousand of those feeble things that god sent into the world in mercy to the poor good men who sit all day silent and crosslegged and in nine parts sewing on a table they will not go higher they can not go lower they accept the authority as if they had inherited through a thousand sires chapter ix that boy is ill how that courtship got on or where and when sandy first opened his lips nobody ever knew at first he took limber tim with him but really limber was so awkward in the presence of ladies or at least so thought sandy to himself that he was ashamed of him it was a great relief to sandy if he had only known enough to admit it to himself to find some one in the room more awkward than himself nothing is a better boon when embarrassed than to see some one there a bigger dolt than yourself limber tim would come in but he would not sit down he would go over against the wall and stand there on one leg with his hands stuck in behind him and his head lolled to one side while his mouth fell open with his back glued up against the wall as if he was a sort of statuary that had made up its mind never to fall down on its face he would stand in that attitude till the widow would speak to him or even smile on him and then he would flop right over with his face to the wall whip out a great pencil from his canvas pocket and then slowly begin to scrawl the date or as near as he could guess it and sketch grotesque pictures all over the new hewn logs of the cabin the widow used to call that place the almanac for limber tim knew the date and day of the year if any man in the forks knew it though it sometimes happened that when the packtrain with the provisions would come in from the outer world they would find they were two three and even four days behind or ahead in their calculations at last sandy began to get tired of limber tim on the wall at the widows perhaps he was in the way at all events he shook him as they called it at the howling wilderness and played it alone one evening sandy had a sorry tale to tell the little woman she listened as never she had listened before poor little billie young piper the boy poet the boy who was always so alone was down with a fever and was wild and talking in strange ways and they had no help no doctor nothing yes yes cried sandy the forks is a doin its level best watchin and a watchin but he wont git up agin its all up with poor billie and all the forks was doing its best too but the boy was very ill the forks was good and it was also very sorry for it had laughed at this young man with hands white and small and a waist like a womans and now that he was dying it wanted to be forgiven it was something to the forks that it had allowed this boy to bear his own christian name the only example of the kind on its records the widow was not very talkative after that and sandy went away earlier than usual he thought to drop in and see the boy but turned aside and called at the howling wilderness in a few minutes he went back to the cabin of the sufferer gently he lifted the latch and on tiptoe he softly entered the room where he lay the man was utterly amazed the widow sat there holding his hands now now pushing back the soft long hair from his face folding back the blankets cooling his hot brow with her soft fresh hand and looking into his eyes all the time with a tenderness that was new to sandy the boy was wild with the fever and weak and helpless men stood back around the wall and in the dark they had not dared to speak to her as she entered they were so amazed that a woman would dare do this thing to come in among them alone take this boy in her arms wave them back wild beasts as they were they stood there mute with amazement and devotion i will go now the boy then reached his hands and tried to rise up i will go away up up out of it all i dont fit in here i dont belong here i dont know the people and the people dont know me then he was still and his mind wandered in another direction when he began again now i will go and i will go alone i am so so tired i am so hot and thirsty here i will cross on the cool mountain and rest as i go the woman looked in his face took his face in her hands as she sat by the bed raised him tenderly and talked in a low soft voice all night long soft and sweet and tender to the stranger as the voice of a mother she held his hand all night as if she would hold him back from crossing over the river and talked to him tenderly as if to draw him back to earth the gray dawn came at last stealing down the mouth of the great black chimney through the little window in the wall where a paper did the duty of a pane and there the men still stood in a row around the walls of the cabin and there the widow still sat holding the boys hand cooling his brow calling him back to the world and he came he opened his eyes and knew his fellowmen for these fevers of the mountain are sudden and severe and their work is soon done or abandoned after that the camp had a patron saint the parson fell ill next but the boys rated him so soundly about his motive as if any man could have a motive in falling ill that he fell to cursing and cursed himself into a perspiration and so got well one morning the widow found a nugget of gold on her doorstep what particular goose of the camp had laid that great gold egg before her door she did not know maybe after all it was only the devotion of some honest clearheaded man some wealthy fortunate fellow who wanted to quietly reward her for her noble deeds in the day of trouble then came another nugget and then another she laid them in a row on her mantelpiece and men for visitors were not so infrequent now as at first would come in handle them make their observations guess from what claim this one came or that and no man there ever told or hinted or in any way remarked that he had sent this or that or had had any part in the splendid gifts that lay so carelessly on the little widows mantelpiece the little dreamer the boypoet was once more seen on the trail with his pick and pan looking for gold in the earth by day for gold in the skies at night but never a word did he whisper of the awful threat of the parson chapter x a scene in the sierras to the amazement of all the forks one day when a bearded man in gum boots slouch hat and blue shirt reached in at the widows for his washing the hand that reached it out was not the widows it was the little brown lazy hand of washeewashee of course the camp did not like this this chinaman to them was a sort of eclipse a dark body passing between the miners and their sun they remonstrated and the parson bore the remonstrance to the widow in a speech of his own and to his own great surprise it was not ornamented with a single oath the forks began his reformation let me go on with it why not answered the woman you will be plundered of what the parson looked at the gold nuggets on the mantelpiece and shifted the quid of tobacco from right to left washeewashee will lie began the widow soberly he can lie and he does lie very cheerfully and very rapidly in spite of his name which might suggest better things but he steals no more do you little brownie washeewashees little black eyes glistened with gratitude the little pagan was coming up in the social scale the widow had begun her missionary business where all the world ought to begin it at home the parson went away he felt that somehow his footing with the widow was shaken and that he must do something to redeem the day the parson was always trying to do something original he concluded to lay for the chinaman he took a fresh quid of tobacco stowed himself away in the bush and waited in the twilight the mournful the sad but beautiful ghost of the great golden days of the sierras a hand reached out and took washeewashee by the queue as a man would take a tethered horse by the lariat the little man did not smile as before he even struck back with his little brown bony hands he wound one of them in the parsons beard and shouted aloud to the empty woods the valor of honesty was on him however kick as he might and shout as he could it all did but little good and the parson proceeded very coolly to take him by the two heels hold him up in the trail and shake him in a smooth level part of it just as if he was about to empty a bag and did not wish to waste the contents now the parson was not at all vicious on this occasion he had no wish to harm the chinaman he only wished to help the widow he shook washeewashee in perfect confidence that he would find all the gold nuggets half the spoons and nearly all the household goods in the little widows warm and sparely furnished room he had not been a bit surprised if he had shaken out the widows goods and wares her washtub and clothesline ah certainly said the parson pausing to himself for is not washeewashees line the clothesline shake shake shake it was of no use something had fallen from his blue blouse but it was not gold he stood the little man down with the other end up and was a bit angry that he did not go on smiling as before he stooped and picked up the little black object that had been shaken from the brown little fellow before him the parson began to swear it was only a little tencent testament in diamond type with a cloth cover the parson put his head to one side filliped the leaves with his thumb and finger and then feeling perfectly certain that it did not belong to any of the boys in the camp and equally certain that it was not an article that he cared to carry around loose with him he filliped the leaves again and handing it back to washeewashee said git the parson took one end of the trail and the little pagan the other a missourian who lay in his bunk up against the wall smoking his pipe of pigtail after supper looked out from his cabin window through the wood and up towards the parsons cabin where the trail wound on the hillside above him its a thunderin and a lightnin like cats and dogs theres agwyne to be a storm tonight but it was only the parson swearing at his bad luck and that chinaman only a testament then an idea struck him like an inspiration did not the good little widow give the brown wretch this thing he stopped swearing stood still in the trail a moment and then giving a long whistle as he drew a long breath he went on to his cabin in silence that testament troubled the parson there was not much religion in the forks there was little sign of anything of that kind among the men of the sierras perhaps there were other testaments hidden away under the bunks of the miners but they were never visible i know of one the gift of a good mother that forever refused to get lost or wear out or disappear under any circumstances other books would get themselves borrowed and never come back other books would get themselves thrummed and thumbed the backs torn off and the leaves torn out but this one little book with its black modest cover was always the same it looked as new and nice as ready to be read as full of hope and promise after ten years of service in the sierras as it did the day it first nestled down in the bottom of the carpetbag to wait patiently for the prodigal to return and feed upon its glorious promises but the presence of this book had a wider meaning than all this to the parson williams had been a sort of calvin he was a terrible religious enthusiast it was his devotion his misled enthusiasm that made him take part in the persecution and death of the socalled prophet it was that which brought the awful persecution upon him and his the children it was said inherited their fathers religious zeal this testament was to the parson only another evidence that the widow was indeed the missing nancy williams he told all this in confidence to a knot of friends the next day deboon only brushed and brushed with both hands a pet fox which perched friskily on his shoulder but said nothing the gopher slowly arose and shook himself then he reached out his fist and shook it in the air what if she is by the eternal tom cats what if she is the real living and breathing nancy williams and what if they do say she killed one of em the night before she got away eh here she is and here she stays and let me see the destroying angel danite or devil that dares to interfere the man strode out of the cabin like a king and deboon only stroked his frisky fox and walked on after him looking back quietly at the little crowd over his shoulder yet for all that these men who were so brave and defiant in open fight were awed and almost terrified by the strange and mysterious order that moved so secretly and so certainly upon its victims and no other man there gave any expression to his thoughts chapter xi the parsons pursuit of love but the danites did not again openly appear the widow it seemed was now secure and the men began to forget that they had ever counted her the last of the doomed family or suspected that there was blood on her hands as the summer wore away her suitors dropped off like early candidates for office and left the field almost entirely to the two leading men of the camp sandy and the parson sandy was a man of magnificent stature with a graceful flow of sandy beard but as i have said an awkward child of nature a born leader of men but a man who declined to lead unless forced to come to the front by his fellows and for the time take charge of whatever matter was under consideration in the camp sandy was a man you believed in trusted and honored from the first there was not a crafty fiber or thought in his physical or mental makeup the parson was a successful miner a massive gothic man though not so tall as sandy he had been a sailor i think at all events he had a blue band of indian ink with little diamonds of red set in between the bands on his left wrist possibly it was his right wrist for i can not recall positively at this distance of time but i think it was the left the parson was the first authority in history politics theology anything whatever that came up i do not think he was learned but he was always so positive and always so ready with his opinions and always so ready to back them up too that all were willing to ask his opinion in matters of doubt and few were willing to question his replies after awhile it became talked about that sandy was losing ground with the widow or rather that the parson was having it pretty much his own way there as in other things in the camp and that sandy rarely put in an appearance a year went by and then a pretty little cottage began to peep through the trees from a little hill back of town and then it came out that this with its glass windows and green windowblinds was the property of the parson and destined as the home of the widow i think the camp was rather pleased at this true there was a bit of ambition and a grain of cunning too in the parsons nature which made the free wild men of the mountains look upon him sometimes with less favor than they did on sandy still some of them liked him and all were glad that the widow was to have a home at last but somehow the wedding did not come on as soon as was expected and the widow kept on rubbing rubbing day after day week after week as if nothing of the kind was ever to happen to her late in the fall one evening as the men stood in a semicircle in the howling wilderness saloon with their backs to the blazing log fire sandy brought his fist down emphatically on the bar as he took part in the conversation and turning to the crowd said its an everlastin and a burnin shame he rested his right elbow on the bar and drew the back of his left hand across his mouth as if embarrassed and again began its a breathin and a burnin shame i say that the woman has got for to go on in this way a washin of duds for us fellows of this here camp if this here camp cant afford one lady in its precincts why then i shall pull up stakes and go to where the tall cedars cast their shadows over the coyote and the coyote howls and howls and and he wiped his mouth again and broke down utterly but he had said enough a responsive chord was touched and the men fairly sprang to their feet with delight at the thought some of the best things in life are like leads of gold we come upon them in a kind of sudden discovery the parsons eyes twinkled with delight i move that sandy take the chair for this occasion and second the motion and plank down twenty ounces for the widow sandy removed his slouch hat blushed behind his beard at the new dignity and said bully for you i raise you five ounces and ante the dust here he drew a long heavy purse from his pocket and passed it over to the barkeeper who thereby became treasurer of the enterprise without further remark the parsons eye twinkled again i see your five ounces and go you ten better called said sandy and he pecked at the barkeeper which little motion of the head meant that that further amount was to be weighed from the purse for the benefit of the widow one by one the boys came forward and as the enterprise got noised about the camp they came down to the howling wilderness saloon till far in the night to contribute what they called their widows mite even the head man of the company up the creek known as the gay roosters and who was notoriously the most rough and reckless man in the camp jumped a firstclass poker game where he was playing at twenty dollars ante and pass the buck to come in and weigh out dust enough to call the parson and sandy the forks felt proud of itself for the deed men slept sounder and awoke in a better humor with themselves for the act yet all this time it was pretty well conceded that the gold and the widow too would very soon fall to the possession of the parson set em deep parson set em deep said the head of the gay roosters as he shook hands with the parson that night winked at the boys and returned to his game of poker there had been many a funeral at the forks but never a birth or a wedding but now this last with all its rites and mysteries was about to come upon the forks and the forks felt dignified and elated not one of all these thousand bearded men showed unconcern it was the great topic the presidential campaign the dolly varden of the day the approaching wedding was the morning talk the talk at noon and the talk at night and it was good for the camp the last fight was forgotten monte took a back seat in the minds of these strange strong men and if the truth could be told i dare say the german undertaker who had set up under the hill noted a marked decline in his business the boys were with the parson and the parson with the boys they all conceded that he was a royal good fellow and that the widow could not well do better the amount of gold raised by the men in their sudden and impulsive charity was in itself for one in the widows station a reasonable fortune what if she gits up and gits the man who said that was a narrowminded oneeyed suspicious fellow who barely escaped being knocked down by the head of the gay roosters and kicked into the street by the crowd there was a poor dutchman in the camp who had been crippled in the first settlement of the camp and who had been all the time too lame to work and too poor to go away the parson and sandy were sent in a committee to the widow with the gold she smiled took the heavy bag in her hand turned shut the door in their faces but did not say a word that evening she was seen to enter the crippled dutchmans cabin the next day the crippled dutchman rode up the trail out of camp and was seen no more still later in the fall the parson sat in the howling wilderness with his back to the blazing crackling fire having it all his own way at his favorite game of old sledge he had led his queen for the jack just as though he knew where every card in the pack was entrenched then he led the king with like composure and was just crooking his fingers up his sleeve for the ace when a man in black with a beaver hat and white necktie rode by the window on a black horse somebodys a dyin up the creek i speck said stubbs maybe its old yallar he allers was a kind of a prayin codfish eatin cuss any how here stubbs turned and kicked nervously at the fire the game did not go on after that no one said any thing perhaps that was the trouble the men fell to thinking and the game lost its interest there was no fight of importance at the howling wilderness that night and by midnight the frequenters of the saloon had withdrawn the candles were then put out and the proprietors barricaded the door against belated drunkards spread their blankets on a montetable with their pistols under their heads and by the smouldering fire were at rest the ground was frozen hard next morning and the miners flocked into the howling wilderness the parson was leading off gaily again and swearing with unusual eloquence and brilliancy when a tall thin and sallow man from missouri known as the jumper entered he looked wild and excited and stepped high as if on stilts the tall thin man went straight up to the bar struck his knuckles on the counter and nodded at the red bottle before him it came forward with a glass tumbler and he drank deep alone and in silence when a miner of the sierras enters a saloon where other men are seated and drinks alone without inviting any one it is meant as a deliberate insult to those present unless there is some dreadful thing on his mind the jumper tall and fidgety turned to the parson bent his back against the counter and pushed back his hat then he drew his right sleeve across his mouth and let his arms fall down at his side limp and helpless and his round brown butternut head rolled loose and awkward from shoulder to shoulder parson well well spit it out cried the parson as he arose from the bench with a dreadful oath spit it out what in h l is busted now parson here the head rolled and the arms swung more than ever and the man seemed in dreadful agony of mind the parson sprang across the room and caught him by the shoulder he shook him till his teeth rattled like quartz in a mill the the man in black gasped the jumper the black man on the black horse with a white choker the parson looked blank and staggered back as the man gasping for breath concluded well hes gone back and he wont marry yer cause why he says sandy says yer got one wife now any how in missouri and maybe two the parson sunk into a seat dropped his face in his hands for a moment trembled only a little and arose pale and silent he did not swear at all i am perfectly certain he did not swear i know we all spoke of that for a long time afterward and considered it one of the most remarkable things in all the strange conduct of this man when the parson arose the jumper shook himself loose from the counter and tilted across to the other side of the room to give him place the stricken man put his hands on the counter peeked over the barkeepers shoulder at his favorite bottle as if mournfully to a friend but said not a word he emptied a glass and then without looking right or left opened the door and went straight up to the parsonage the parsonage was the name the boys gave to the cottage on the hill among the trees gone for his two little bullpups said stubbs that was what the parson called his silvermounted derringers there will be a funeral at the forks tomorrow gasped the jumper here the german undertaker arose cheerfully and went down to his shop well sandy is no sardine bet your boots sandy aint no sardine said stubbs and any how hes got the start just a little if the parson does nail him for hes won her heart and thats a heap i think for wimmens mighty scace in the mines sumthin to die for you bet chapter xii grit the parson was absent for hours and the howling wilderness began to be impatient hes a heelin himself like a fightingcock said stubbs and if sandy dont go to kingdom come with his boots on then chaw me up for a shrimp the man here went to the door opened it put his head out in the frosty weather and peered up the creek for sandy and across the creek for the parson but neither was in sight the gay rooster company knocked off from their work with many others and came to town in force to see the fight the howling wilderness was crowded and doing a rushing business the two barkeepers shifted and carefully arranged the sandbags under the counter which in that day and country were placed there in every wellregulated drinking saloon so as to intercept whatever stray bits of lead might be thrown in the direction of their bodies in the coming battle and calmly awaited results about dark a thin blue smoke as from burning paper curled up from the chimney of the parsonage and the parson came slowly forth blamed if he hasnt been a makin of his will and a burnin of his letters looks grummer than a deacon too added the man as the parson neared the saloon he spoke quietly to the boys as he entered but did not swear that was thought again remarkable indeed he went up to the bar tapped on the counter with his knuckles threw his head back over his shoulder toward the crowd and yet apparently without seeing any one and said boys fall in line fall in line rally around me once again they fell in line or at least the majority did some however stood off in little knots and groups on the other side and pretended not to have heard or noticed what was going on these it was at once understood were fast friends of sandys and unbelievers in the parson the glasses were filled quietly slowly and respectfully almost like filling a grave and then emptied in silence again it was observed that the parson did not swear that was considered as remarkable as the omission of prayer from the service in a wellregulated church and i am sure contributed to throw a spirit of restraint over the whole party friendly to the parson besides it was noticed that he was pale haggard had hardly a word to say and most of all had barely touched the glass to his lips no one however ventured to advise question or in any way disturb him all were quiet and respectful it was very evident that the feeling in the forks at first was largely with sandy but sandy did not appear that evening this of course was greatly against him the forks began to suspect that he feared to take the responsibility of his act and meet the man he had so strangely defamed and to all appearances so deeply injured the next day the saloon was crowded more densely than before men stood off in little knots and groups talking earnestly there was but one topic only the one great subject the impending meeting between the two leading men of the camp and the probable result the parson was among the first present that day pale and careworn they treated him with all the delicacy of women not a word was said in his presence of his misfortune or the occasion of their meeting to the further credit of the forks i am bound to say that there had as yet been no bets as to which one of the two men they should have to bury the next day the day passed and still sandy did not appear had there been any other way out of camp than through the forks and up the rugged winding corkscrew stairway of rocks opposite and in the face of the town it might have been suspected that he had taken the widow and fled to other lands the parson came down a little late next morning pale and quiet as before he did not swear this time in fact he did not even drink he sat down on a bench behind the montetable with his back to the fire and his face to the door the men respectfully left a rather broad lane between the parson and the door and the montetable was not patronized the day passed dusk and still sandy did not appear by this time he had hardly three friends in the house hasnt got the soul of a chicken caved in at last gone down in his boots busted in the snapper lost his grip dont dare show his hand these and like expressions thrown out now and then from the little knots of men here and there were the certain indications that sandy had lost his place in the hearts of the leading men of the forks toward midnight the bolt lifted shoo the door opened and sandy entered backed up against the wall by the door and stood there tall and silent his great beard was trimmed a little his bushy hair carefully combed behind his ears and the necktie was now subdued into a neat loveknot in spite of its old persistent habit of twisting around and fluttering out over his left shoulder his eye met the parsons but did not quail the barkeeper settled down gracefully behind the bags of sand so that his eyes only remained visible above the horizon the head of the gay roosters tilted a table up till it made a respectable barricade for his breast and the crowd silently settled back in the corners packed tighter than sardines in a tin box you might have heard a mouse had it crossed the floor even the fretful fire seemed to hold for the time its snappish red tongue and the wind without to lean against the door and listen the parson slowly arose from the table he had his right hand in his pocket and was very pale experienced shootists old hands at mortal combat with their kind glanced from man to man measured every motion every look with all the intense eagerness of artists who are favored with one great and especial sight not to be met again others held their heads down and only waited in a confused sort of manner for the barking of the bulldogs neither of sandys hands were visible but as the parson took a few steps forward and partly drew his hand from his pocket sandys right one came up like a steel spring and the ugly black muzzle of a sixshooter was in the parsons face still he advanced till his face almost touched the muzzle of the pistol he seemed not to see it or to have the least conception of his danger it was strange that sandy did not pull maybe he was surprised at the singular action of the parson perhaps he had his eye on the unlifted right hand of his antagonist at all events he had the drop and could afford to wait the smallest part of a second and see what he would do i have been awaiting the parson halted and paused at the participle i have been awaiting for you sandy a long time his voice trembled the voice that had thundered above a hundred barroom fights and had directed the men through many a difficulty in camp was now low and uncertain sandy he began again and he took hold of the counter with his left hand i am agoingaway your cabin will be too small now and i want you to promise me to take care of the parsonage till i come back sandy sank back closer still to the wall and his arm hung down at his side you will move into the parsonage when it is all over its full of good things for winter you will take it i say at once promise me that the parsons voice was a little severe here more determined than before and as he concluded he drew the key from his pocket and handed it to sandy you will yes the men looked a moment in each others eyes perhaps they were both embarrassed the door was convenient that seemed to sandy the best way out of his confusion and he opened it softly and disappeared the howling wilderness was paralyzed with wonder the parson looked a little while out in the dark through the open door and was gone there was a murmur of disappointment behind him dont you fear at last chimed in the head of the gay roosters dont you never fear that old seadog the parson is deeper than a infernal gulf look here he put up his finger to the side of his nose after a pause and stroking his beard mysteriously said i say look here shoo not a word softly now powder thats what it means powder gits em both into the parsonage and blows em to kingdom come together the howling wilderness was reconciled it was certain that the end was not yet by a great deal it was again struck with wonder however and for want of a better expression took a drink and settled down to a game of monte early next morning a morning full of unutterable storms and drifts of snow sandy entered the widows cabin the parson was not to be seen either at the howling wilderness or about his own house men stood about the door of the howling wilderness and up and down the single street in little knots noting the course of things at the parsonage and now and then shaking their loose blanket coats and brushing off the fast falling snow after a while when the smoke rose up from the chimneytop and curled above the parsonage with a homelike leisure as if a womans hand tended the fire below a man with his face muffled up was seen making his way slowly up the rugged way that led from town across the sierra it was a desperate and dangerous undertaking at that season of the year he made but poor headway against the storm that came pelting down in his face from the fields of eternal snow but he seemed determined and pushed slowly on sometimes it was observed he would turn and shading his eyes from the snow look down intently at the peaceful smoke drifting through the trees above the parsonage some poor idiot will pass in his checks tonight if he dont come back pretty soon said stubbs as he nodded at the man up the hill brushed the snow from his sleeves and went back into the saloon there were now two subjects of conversation in the camp the departure of the parson and the courtship of sandy one day however there was quite a riffle in the usually smooth current of affairs it was this a busy meddling man was seen to lay hold of sandy and talk a long time in a mysterious and suspicious manner he would point to the cabin of the widow then to the cabin of the poet and gravely shake his head the man was heard to couple the two names together at last sandy shook this man off and went on his way with anything but a satisfied look after an open demonstration like that the camp felt that it was privileged to speak openly what it had seriously but silently noted before it had now three topics to talk about the departure of the parson the courtship of sandy but now above all and chiefly the secret and frequent visits of the poet to the widows cabin chapter xiii an announcement one day a miner laid his two fingers crosswise and twisting his head to one side as he spirted a stream of tobacco juice across the saloon said sandy is a infernal fool the men winked and he went on he wants to marry that ere widow wal now that ere widow is in love with that ere boy nobody to blame you see if the widow loves the boy thats the widows bizness not mine only sandy mustnt be a fool besides and here the mans voice sank low and he looked around as if he feared a danite might be standing at his elbow besides its my private opinion that that ere widow is the nancy williams it was late in the fall and it certainly must have been a cold frosty morning for sandys teeth chattered together as if he had an ague when he told the judge in fact he stood around the howling wilderness more than half a day but he could not or at least would not drink though he did very many foolish things and seemed ill at ease and troubled in a way that was new to him at last he got the judge to one side he took him by the collar with both hands he backed him up in a corner and as he did so his teeth chattered and ground together as if he stood halfnaked on the everlasting snows that surrounded them he pushed his face down into the red applelike face of the magistrate and began as if he was about to reveal the most terrible crime in the annals of the world all the time he was holding on to the judge with both hands as if he feared he might not listen to his proposal but tear away and attempt to escape at last sandy drew a sharp short breath and blurted out what he had to say as if it was tearing out his lungs good good the judge drew a long breath he swelled out to nearly twice his usual importance you could have seen him grow it was now the judges turn to lay hold of sandy for now as the great strong man had accomplished his fearful task told his secret and done all that was necessary to do he wanted to get away to go home go anywhere and collect his thoughts and to rest the judge held him there told him the great advantages that would come of it the high responsibility that he was about to put his shoulder to and talked to him in fact till he grew white and stiff as a signpost yet all that sandy could remember for almost all that he said was something about the glorious climate of californy never rode a king into his capital with such majesty as did the judge the next day enter the forks he was swelling bursting with the importance of his secret but now he had sandys permission to tell the boys and he went straight to the howling wilderness for that purpose his face glowed like the fire as he stood there rubbing his hands above the great mounting blaze and bowing right and left in a patronizing sort of a way to the miners who had sauntered into the saloon at last the little redfaced man turned his back to the fire stuck his two hands back behind his coattails which he kept lifting up and down and fanning carelessly as if in deep thought stood almost tiptoe stuck out his round little belly and seemed about to burst with his secret o this wonderful californy climate he puffed a little as he said this and fanned his coattails a little bit higher perked out his belly a little bit further and stood there as if he expected some one to speak but as the miners seemed to think they had heard something like this before or at least that the remark was not wholly new none of them felt called upon to respond well the little man tilted up on his toes as he said this and took in a long breath hit comes off about the next snow fall he had said these words one at a time and by inches as it were slowly deliberately as if he knew perfectly well that he had something to say and that the men were bound to listen this time they all looked up and half of them spoke and oh didnt he torture them not that he pretended to keep his secret of half a day not at all on the contrary he kept talking on and tiptoeing and fanning his coattails and pushing out his belly and puffing out his cheeks just as careless and indifferent as if all the world knew just what he was going to say and was perfectly familiar with the subject yes gentlemen puffed the little man on or about the next snowfall the widow as a widow ceases to exist that lovely flower my friends is to be transplanted from its present bed to to into the o this wonderful climate of californy the howling wilderness was as silent as the catacombs of rome for nearly a minute then sandy had not been deterred either by the widows strange intimacy with the eccentric little poet or by the suspicion of the camp that this woman was the last of the doomed family the first thing that was heard was something like a redhot cannonshot the cinnamonheaded man behind the bar dodged down behind his barricade of sandbags till only his bristling red hair and a sixshooter were visible the decanters tilted together as if there had been an earthquake it was a missourian swearing somebody back in the corner said jerusalem said it in joints and pieces and then came forward and kicked the fire and stood up by the side of the red little man and looked down at him as if he would like to eat him for a piece of raw beef a fair boy the dreamer the poet went back to a bunk against the further wall where the barkeepers bulldog lay sleeping in his blankets and put his arms about his neck and put his face down and remained there a long time perhaps he wept was he weeping for joy or for sorrow there was a great big grizzly head moved out of the crowd and up to the bar the head rolled on the shoulders from side to side as if it was not very firmly fixed there and did not particularly care at this particular time whether it remained there or not a big fist fell like a stone on the bar the glasses jumped as if frightened half to death they ran up against each other and clinked and huddled together there and fairly screamed and split their sides in their terror a big mouth opened behind an awful barricade of beard again the big fist fell down again the glasses screamed and clinked with terror and the head rolled sidewise again and the big mouth opened again and the big voice said by the baldheaded elijah and that was all then there was another calm and you might have heard the little brown woodmice nibbling at the old boots and leather belts and tin cans stowed away among the other rubbish up in the loft of the howling wilderness then the fist came down again and the big mouth opened and the big mouth said slow and loud and long and savage like the growl of a grizzly swaller my grandmothers boots then the man fell back and melted into the crowd and whatever romance there was in his life whatever sentiment he may have had whatever poetry there was pent up in the heart of this great titan it found no other expression than this the genteel gambler who sat behind a table with its green cloth and silver farobox forgot to throw his card but held his arm poised in the air till any man could have seen the jack of clubs though a thousand dollars worth of golddust depended on the turn yet all this soon had an end of course and there was a confusion of tongues and a noise that settled gradually over against the bar even then it was afterwards remarked though the men really interested did not know it at the time that the cinnamonheaded dealer of drinks put cayenne pepper in a gin cocktail and scheidam schnapps in a tom and jerry limber tim was there in their midst but was a sad and a silent man perhaps he had been told all about it before and perhaps not tim was not a talker but a thinker this to him meant the loss of his partner the man he loved a divorce poor limber he only backed up against the wall screwed his back there twisted one leg in behind the other stuck his hands in behind him and so stood there till he saw a man looking at him then he flopped over with his face to the wall dug up his great pencil from his great pocket and fell to writing on the wall and trying to hide his face from his fellows rather sudden aint it judge well not so sudden not so sudden considerin this this this glorious climate of californy after awhile when the monte game had asserted itself again and things were going on in the saloon just about as they were before the judge made this announcement a tall and inquisitive man with a hatchet face and a hump in his shoulder and a twist in his neck which made him look like an interrogation point rose up and reaching his neck out toward the bar said in a sharp whisper ill bet a forty dollar hoss shes the real nancy williams the redheaded barkeeper bristled up like a porcupine and then put out his broad hand as if it was an extinguisher chapter xiv a wedding in the sierras the weddingday came the camp had been invited to a man there was but one place in the camp that could hold a tithe of its people and that was the howling wilderness the plan had been to have the wedding under the pines on the hill but the wind came pitching down the mountain with frost and snow in his beard that morning and drove them to the shelter what a place was that howling wilderness it was battlefield prizering deadhouse gamblinghell courthouse chapel every thing by turns there they stood side by side and hand in hand before the crackling fire before the little judge the house was hot it was crowded thick as the men could stand tighter than sardines in a tin box the men stood there bareheaded with hardly room to breathe the fat little magistrate was terribly embarrassed he had sent all the way across the mountains by the last packtrain by the last express by the last man who had dared the snows but no packtrain no express nothing had returned with the coveted the somuchneeded marriage ceremony and service which he had resolved to read to the people interspersed with such remarks and moral observations as the case might require alas the form of the ceremony had not arrived he had nothing of the kind to guide him he had never officiated in this way before he had never studied up in this branch why should he have studied up in this line when there was but one woman in all his little world as the form had not arrived he had nothing in the world but his moral observations to use on this imposing occasion and he was embarrassed as a man had never been embarrassed before he stood there trying hard to begin he could hear the men breathe the pretty little woman was troubled too her face was all the time held down her eyes drooped and she did not look up did not look right or left or anywhere but seemed to surrender herself to fate to give herself away her soul seemed elsewhere as if she sat on a high bank above all this and was not of it or in it at all do you solemnly swear the judge had jerked himself together with an effort that made his joints fairly rattle he hoisted his right hand in the air as he said this and having once broken ground he went on do you solemnly swear to love and honor and obey poor limber tim who had just room enough behind the judge to turn over here became embarrassed through sympathy for the little redfaced magistrate and of course flopped over and began to write his name and the date and make pictures on the wall with a nervous rapidity proportionate to his embarrassment do you solemnly swear it was very painful the little man took down his lifted flagstaff to wipe his little bald head and he could not get it up again but stood there still and helpless you could hear the men breathe deeper than before as they leaned and listened with all their might to hear they heard the water outside gurgling on down over the great boulders over their dams and on through the caсon they heard the little brown woodmice nibble and nibble at the bits of baconrind and old leather boots up in the loft above their heads but that was all at last the judge revived and began again in a voice that was full of desperation do you solemnly swear to love and protect and honor and obey till death do you part and here the voice fell down low lower and the judge was again floundering in the water then his head went under utterly then he rose and now i lay me down to sleep rolled tremulously through the silent room from the lips of the judge then again the head was under water then it rose up again and there was something like twinkle twinkle little star then the voice died again again the head was under water then it rose again and the head went up high in the air and the voice was loud and resolute and the man rose on his tiptoes and beginning with when in the course of human events he went on in a deep and splendid tone with the declaration of independence to the very teeth of tyrannical king george and then bringing his hand down emphatically on the gambling table that stood to his right said loud and clear and resolute and authoritatively as he tilted forward on his toes so help you god and i pronounce you man and wife the exhausted judge sank back against the wall on top of limber tim and then as if he all at once came to remember a part of the ceremony and after sandy and the widow and all were thinking that it was quite over he began in a low but clear voice then by virtue of the authority in me vested and according to the laws and the statutes of the state of california in such cases made and provided i pronounce you man and wife then he rose up came forward and shaking the new bride by the hand then lifting it to his lips and kissing it gallantly he said carelessly and as if nothing had happened you will pardon me for pausing occasionally as i did the room is so warm and the ceremony is so long that i really began to be exhausted he was going on to say something about the glorious climate of california but the men came forward crowded around in this day of all days and quite squeezed the little man away from the widow as she was still called it was perfectly splendid how they did shout and laugh and cheer and how careful they were to shake all the round oaths out of their speech before addressing her and how they did crowd around as sandy led her away every man of them even to washeewashee to wish her god speed and a long and a pleasant life in their midst down there in the gorge in the heart of the great sierras only two circumstances in connection with this first family of the sierras worth mentioning occurred for some months the first of these was the banishment of the boypoet from the presence of the widow sandy led her at once to the parsonage with the green window blinds as he had solemnly promised the parson to do into this house the boy was never seen to enter sandy it was whispered had forbidden him the house the verdict of the camp was served him right the other little event was to all appearances of still less consequence yet it showed that there was a storm brewing and it was a straw which showed which way the wind was blowing the boy was seen late at night by some men who were passing peering in at the widows window he ran away like one caught in a crime but they said he looked pale as a ghost and sickly and sad and lonesome chapter xv whats the matter now just exactly how many days or weeks or even months had blown over the forks through the long bleak winter since the wedding no man knew these men in the mountains snowed up for halfayear where there is no business where there is no law no church nothing but halfwild men hard at work these men i say sometimes forget the day the week even the month yet the day of the week is always kept six days they labor in the mine the seventh they do not rest but they at least do not mine certainly there was snow on the day of the wedding and certain it was that there was a little fall of snow on the high hillsides and in the black fir tops and the great pines were tipped in white as sandy hurried from his cabin down to the forks in search of his now divorced and forgotten limber tim he was pale and excited he pushed his great black broad hat down over his eyes as he hurried on down the trail slipping and sliding over the worn walk over the new sprinkle of snow in his great big gum boots then he pushed his hat back so as to get the cool wind of march in his face and even the blustering snow in his beard he found limber at last standing on one leg by the great log fire in the howling wilderness lonesome as a crow in march he pulled his hat again down over his eyes as he approached his old partner and stooped his shoulders and looked out from under its rim as if he was half afraid or else was half ashamed in all western towns in all mines in all cities great or small for that matter there is always one common center here it was the howling wilderness if a man felt sad what better place than the howling wilderness saloon to go to for distraction if a man felt glad where else could he go to share his mirth here was happiness or unhappiness all great extremes run together tears flow as freely for joy as for grief between intense delight or deepest sorrow the wall is so thin you can whisper through it and be heard here at fifty cents a glass you had dealt out to you over a great plank laid up upon a barricade of sandbags that were laid there to intercept any stray bullet that might be making its way towards the crimsonheaded vendor of poisons almost any drink that you might name and it is safe to say that all of the following popular drinks that is old tiger bad eye forty rod rat pizen rot gut hells delight and howling modoc were all made from the same decoction of bad rum worse tobacco and firstclass cayenne pepper the difference in proportion of ingredients made the difference in the infernal drinks if one of those splendid misled fellows who really knew no better felt very sad he took one of these drinks if he felt very glad he took two sandy wheeled on his heel the moment he found his old friend and went out without saying a word he stood there in the snow the wind twisting about his beard blowing his old hatrim up and down and he seemed as one lost at length he lifted the latch again hastily hesitated looked back around up towards his cabin on the hill and then suddenly pushing his hat back again as if he wanted room to breathe he tumbled into the saloon went right up before limber tim and bringing his two hands down on his two shoulders said tremulously limber tim sandy had laid hold of him as if he had determined to never let him go again and the man fairly winced under his great vicelike grasp he looked at the back log on the fire looked left and right but did not look sandy in the face if he had he would for the first time in all his timid experience have been able to have had it all his own way o limber sandy had fished up one of his hands high enough to pull his hat down over his eyes and now nothing was to be seen but a hat rim and the fringe of a grizzly beard limber tim looked up he never before had heard his old partners voice troubled and he was very sorry and began to look or to try to look sandy in the face up went a big hand from a shoulder back went the old hat and then limber tim looked to the left at a lot of picks and pans and tom irons and crevicing spoons that lay up against the wall but did not speak limber tim i tell you my my sandy choked he never had yet been able to call her his wife he had tried to do so over and over again his dear little wife had taught him many things had made him in fact another man but she never could get him to speak of her to the other miners but as the widow he had gone out by himself and practiced it in the dark to himself he was certain he could say it in the crowd but somehow just at the moment he tried to say it he was certain some one was thinking about it just as he was was watching him and so it always and for ever stuck in his throat how he loved her how tender he was to her all the time how he did little else but think of her and her happiness day and night but he had been a savage so long had been with the boys so much that he could not find it in his power to say that one dear word it was like a new convert trying to pray in public in one of the great camp meetings of the west or to stand up before all his neighbors and confess his sins he stood still only a second in fact all this took but a moment for sandy was in a terrible hurry limber tim had never seen him in such a hurry before up shot the hand down slid the hat and sandy was quite hidden away again it was a moment of terrible embarrassment when an englishman is embarrassed he takes snuff when a yankee is embarrassed he whips out a jackknife and falls to whittling anything that he can find not excepting the ends of his fingers but a true californian of sierras jerks his head at the boys heads straight up to the bar knocks his knuckles on the board winks at the barkeeper pecks his nose at his favorite bottle fills to the brim nods his head down the line to the left then to the right hoists his poison throws back his head and then falls back wiping his mouth with the back of his hand quite recovered from his confusion sandy backed his partner into a corner rapidly and then laying his hands again on his shoulders said limber tim shes sick he had to throw his head forward to say it it came out as if jerked from his throat by a thousand fishhooks he raised his two great hands and reaching out his face again clutched the two shoulders and said shes d d sick up went the hands back went the hat the door was jerked open a man whirled out of the door as if he had been a whirlwind up the trail up over the stones and snow and logs sandy climbed to his cabin on the hill while the boys followed him with their eyes and then stood looking at each other in wonder as he disappeared in the door through the cabin burst the man and back to the little bedroom as if he had been wild as the north wind that whistled and whirled about without the little lady lay there quiet now but her face was white as ashes the blood had gone out from her face like a falling tide the pain was over but only like a tide to return how white she was and how beautiful she was how helpless she was down there in the deep hidden in a crack of the world away from all old friends away from all her kindred all her sex and kind she was very ill so alone was she not a doctor this side of that great impassable belt of snow that curved away like a deep white wave around and above the heads of the three little rivers sandy saw all this felt all this it cut him to the core and he shook like a leaf what a pretty nest of a bedroom how fragrant it was from the firboughs that were gathered under foot there were little curtains about this bed there deep in the sierras coarse they were it is true very coarse but white as the snow that whirled about without the cabin still you might have seen here and there that there were cloudy spots that had refused all the time to be quite washed out rub and soak and soap and boil them as the widow and washeewashee would if you had lain in that bed through a spell of sickness and looked and looked at the curtains and all things as sick people will all the time look and look when they lie there and can do nothing else you would at last have noticed that these coarse but snowy curtains had been made of as many pieces as jacobs coat and lying there and looking and looking you would have at last in the course of time read there in one of the many cloudy spots these words stamped in bended rows of fantastic letters selfrising flour warranted superfine lbs there was a little cracked piece of lookingglass on the wall no bigger than your palm it was fastened on the wall over perhaps the only illustrated paper that had ever found its way to the forks there were little rosettes around this little glass that had been made from leaves of every color by the cunning hand of the widow there were great mapleleaves and leaves of many trees in all the hues of summer hung up here and there sewn together and made to make the little bedroom beautiful and what a treasure the little glass was it seemed to be the great little center of the house all things rallied or seemed to be trying to rally around it to be sure the widow was not at all plain plain to sandy she was the center of the world the rising and the setting of the sun the carpet had been finished by the same cunning hand this had been made of gunny bags sewn together with twine and under this carpet there was a thick coat of fine firboughs that left the room all the time sweet and warm and fragrant as a forest in the spring there were little threelegged benches waiting about in the corners but by the bedside sat the great work of art in the camp a rockingchair made of elk horns this was the gift of a rejected but generous lover on the little wooden mantelpiece above the fireplace there stood a row of nuggets they lay there as if they were a sort of winter fruit put by to ripen they were like oranges which you see lying about the peasants houses in italy and almost as large these were the gifts of the hardy miners of the forks to their patron saint gifts given at such times and in such ways that they could not be well refused once there had been late in the night a heavy stone thrown against the door while the two turtle doves as the camp used to call its lovers sat by the fire in less than a second sandys pistol stuck its nose out like a little bulldog and began to look down the hill in the darkness a man leaned over the fence and laughed in his face now dont do that sandy now dont sandy let his pistol fall half ashamed for it was the voice of a friend goodbye sandy the man called back up the trail in the dark goodbye thats for the widder made my pile and off for pike goodbye when washeewashee went out next morning for wood there he found lying at the door the cause of the trouble in the night it was a great nugget of gold that the rough missourian had thrown to his patron saint as he passed once a miner sent them a great fine salmon the widow on opening it found it half full of gold she took all this back to the man whom she found seated at the green table at the howling wilderness behind a silver faro box for to mining the man also attached the profession of gambler she laid this heap of gold down on the table before the man with the faro box and cards the miners gathered around the man with the silver box began to deal his cards all on the single turn missus sandy the judge came forward dont bet it all on the first deal do you thats pretty steep even for the oldest of us bet i dont bet at all i bring poker jake his money back i found this all in the fish he sent us it is his it is a trick perhaps fish dont eat gold you know o yes they dus missus sandy poker jake stopped with the card half turned in the air the widow held up her pretty finger and her pretty lips pouted as she made her little speech to the gambler and told him she could not keep the gold the miners gathered around in wonder and admiration jake laid down his card well cant a salmon eat gold if he likes no there missus sandy yer wrong argued the little judge and then he began to tell her the story of jonah and the whale and wound up with the declaration that there was nothing at all unnatural in a fish eating gold in this glorious climate of californy will you not take back your gold nary a red there was a pale thoughtful young man half ill too feeble to work to leave to retreat from the mountains standing by the fire when the widow had entered the saloon it was the boy poet she took up the bag of gold turned around looked back in the corner of the saloon for he had retreated out of sight as she entered saw the young man hiding back in the shade leaning over the bunk caressing the dog possibly he was crying her face lighted with a light that was high and beautiful and half divine she turned held the gold out to poker jake no and then is it mine all mine to do as i like with it yours lady yours to take and go home and git from out of the caсon out of this hole in the ground and live like a christian as yer are and not live here like a wild beast in a carawan the man stood up as he spoke and was proud of his speech and the men cheered and cheered and said bully for poker jake then the little widow turned again went back to the boy leaning over the bulldog thrust it in his arms as he rose to look at her and turning to the men was gone they looked at each other in amazement and disgust they could hardly believe their senses how dare she do it before us all said one chapter xvi was the woman insane as the boy left the saloon one of the men said now i guess the little cuss will git up and dust and that thought was their consolation not that they hated this boy but they felt that he was out of place in the cabin of their widder other and equally ingenious ways all quite as innocent had been used by the miners to force their gifts upon the one sweet woman the patron saint of the camp until she might have been almost as wealthy as the good old saint who lies mouldering before the eyes of all who care to pay a fivefranc note in the mighty cathedral at milan but now they would do no more nuggets and bars and scales and specimens and dust in her home in profusion and why did the little woman remain in the wilderness why did not this little woman rise up some morning smile a goodbye to those about her leave the business to washeewashee take her great big bodyguard mount a mule turn his head up the corkscrew trail toward the clouds toward the snow and find a milder clime who could she have been this half hermit this little missionary who had in one winter half civilized almost christianized a thousand savage men without preaching a single sermon possibly she knew how rare manhood is where men are thickest how scarce men are where they stand heaped and huddled up together in millions and was content to remain with these rough fellows doing good receiving their homage possibly there was a point of honor in thus remaining with these men of the mines it might have been she refused to go away and leave those behind her in the wilderness to whom she owed all the camp had brought her because they would have missed her so sadly and yet after all had things gone on smoothly there was no great reason for her to hurry away but as it was it was certainly going to blow great guns and she certainly knew it but here she was now ill very ill all this gold was dross it was nothing to her now she could hardly lift her hand to the row of golden oranges that lay there before her on the little mantel she looked at sandy as he entered and tried to smile there were tears in her eyes as she did this and then she hid her face in her hands he went and stood and looked in the fire and tried to think what he should do then he went and stood by her bed and waited there till she uncovered her face and looked up she was very pale and he tried but could not speak is it raining sandy dear she asked this because as she put her hand out some drops fell down from his head upon her own my pretty baby my baby in the woods what in the world is the matter he leaned over her and his voice trembled as he spoke then he went down on his knees and his beard swept her face is it cold sandy dear do you think that we that i could cross the mountains today if we went slow and careful and climbed over the snow on our hands and knees dont you think it could be done sandy she kept on asking this question and arguing it all the time because the man kept looking at her in a wild helpless way and could not answer a word if we went up the trail a little way at a time and then rested there under the trees and waited for the snow to melt and then went on a little way each day and so on as fast as it melted off up the mountain dont you think it could be done sandy the man was dumb he kneeled there grinding his great palms together looking all the time and looking at nothing there was a long silence then and still sandy kneeled by the bed his eyes kept wandering about till they lighted on a striped gown that hung hard by on the wall he fell to counting these stripes he counted them up and down and across and then counted them backward and was quite certain he had got it all wrong and fell to counting it over again the little woman writhed with pain and that brought the dreamer to his senses again it passed and she pale fair beautiful with her hair about her like folds of sable fur she put out her round white arms to the great halfgrizzly halfbaby by her side she was still a long time then then she called him pretty names and she cried as if her heart would break sandy i told you it was not best it was not right it would not do that you would be sorry some day and that you would blame and upbraid me and that the men would laugh at you and at me but you would not be put off do you not remember how i shut myself up and kept away from you and would not see you and how you kept watch and sent round and would see me whether or no he now remembered and what then had he repented on the contrary he had never loved her half so truly as now his heart was too full to dare to speak do you not remember that when i told you all this would happen that you said it could not happen that happen what would no man should mock or laugh or reprove and live well now sandy dear it will happen i have done you wrong i now want to tell you to take back your promise that is best the man rose up the place where he had hid his face was wet as rain sandy sandy can we cross the mountains now the little lady lay trembling in her bed with her hands covering her face then she put down her hands and looked up into the face of her husband sandy leave me she sprang up in bed as she said this as if inspired with a new thought there take that gold this gold all of it she left her bed with a bound and heaped the gold together and turned to sandy take it i tell you and go that is best that is right i want you to go go now go will you go will you not go when i command you to go not when youre sick my pretty get well and then i will go go and stay till you tell me i may come back will you not go not while youre sick my pretty then i will go she caught a shawl from the wall her face was aflame she sprang to the door through the door and out to the fence in a moment sandys arms were about her now and he led her back and laid her in her bed she lay there trembling again and sandy bent above her sandy when all the world turns against me and laughs at me what will you do he did not understand he could not answer when men laugh at me when i pass what can you say and what will you do what will i do the man seemed to hear now and to understand he sprang up spun about and tossed his head what will i do shoot em scalp every mothers son of em and he brought his fist down on the little mantelpiece till the bits of gold remaining and the little trinkets leapt half way across the room the little woman lay a moment silent and then she threw back the clothes and pushing sandy back as if he had been a great child sprang up again and again dashed through the door limber tim had been standing there all the time half hidden behind the fence against which he had glued his back waiting to be of some use if possible to the guardian angel of the camp there was also a row of men reaching within hail all the way down to the town waiting to be of help for limber tim had told them the widow was ill the man started from his fastening on the fence at sight of this apparition wild halfclad with her hair all down about her loose ungathered garments and he stood before her i want to go home the woman cried wringing her hands i want to go home i will go home there is something wrong you do not understand sandy is an angel i am a devil i want to go home the strong mans arms were about her again as she stood there on the edge of the fence and he bore her back half fainting and quite exhausted into the house he laid her down and stood back as if half frightened at what he had done never before had he put out a finger said a word held a thought contrary to her slightest and most unreasonable whim then he came back timidly as if he was afraid he would frighten her for she began to tremble again and she was whiter than before she did not look up she was looking straight ahead down toward her feet but she knew he was there knew he would hear her let her speak never so low when the great trouble comes sandy when the trouble comes and covers both of us with care will you remember that you would not put me off when the trouble comes will you ever remember that you would not let me go away that you would not go away will you remember sandy she was getting wild again and sprang up in bed as she said this last and looked the man in his face so earnest so pleading so pitiful that sandy put up his two hands and swore a solemn oath to remember she sank back in bed drew the clothes about her hid her face from the light and then sandy drew back and stood by the fire and the awful thought came fully and with all its force upon him that she was insane ah that was what it was she feared she would go mad mad mad he thought of all the mad people he had ever seen or heard of thought how he had been told that it runs in families how people go mad and murder their friends destroy themselves go into the woods and are eaten by wild beasts lost in the snow or drowned in the waters hurrying by wood and mountain wall and then he feared that he should go mad himself poor little soul he kept saying over to himself poor noble little soul would not marry me because she knew she would go mad and she was dearer to the man now than ever before sandy the sufferer barely breathed his name but he leaned above her while yet she spoke sandy bring billy piper what he threw up his two hands in the air the woman did not seem to heed him but resting and lying quite still a moment said softly bring bunker hill bring what who go bring bunker hill if his wife had said bring satan or had repeated her bring billy piper the man could not have been more surprised or displeased now this bunker hill or bunkerhill was a poor woman of the town the best one there it is true but bad enough no doubt at the best she was called bunker hill by the boys and no one knew her by any other name because she was a sort of a hunchback did you say my pretty did you say sandy bring bunker hill and bring her soon soon sandy soon soon for the love of god the woman was writhing with pain again as the man shot through the door and looked back over his shoulder to be sure that she did not attempt to leave the house or destroy herself the moment his back was turned limber tim was there waiting silently and patiently he scratched his head and wondered and raised his brim as he ran and slid and shuffled with all his speed down the trail toward the town to bring the woman men stood by in respectful silence as he passed they would have given worlds almost to know how the one fair woman fared but they did not ask the question did not stop the man a moment a moment might be precious it might be worth a life there are some rules of etiquette some principles of feeling in the wild woods among the wild men there that might be transplanted with advantage to a better society there might have been a feeling of disappointment or displeasure on the part of the men standing waiting waiting for an opportunity to be of the least possible service as they saw bunker hill leave town to return with limber tim but it had no expression the man who sat behind the silver farobox no doubt felt this disappointment the keenest of any one when we feel displeased or disappointed at any thing we are always saying that that is about the best that could be done what else could she do the womans ill the widder is sick she sends for a woman a bad woman praps but the best we got well a womans better as a man any ways you puts it what else could she do a bad womans better as a good man what else could she do i puts it to you what else could she do the crowd at the howling wilderness was satisfied but the men stood there or sat in knots around the barroom in silence the crimsonheaded barkeeper had not seen such a dull day of it since they had the double funeral what could be the matter men made all kinds of guesses but somehow no one hinted that the little woman was mad the roaring whirlpool as the howling wilderness was sometimes called drew in but few victims all that night men kept away kept going out and looking up toward the little cabin on the hill the man with the silver farobox sat by the table with the green cloth as if in a brown study the great fire blazed up and snapped as if angry for but few men gathered about it all that evening the little brown mice up in the loft could be heard nibbling at the old boots and bacon rinds and their little teeth ticked and rattled together as if the upper half of the howling wilderness had been the shop of a mender of watches now and then the man behind the silver farobox filliped the pack of cards with his fingers turned up the heels of a jack in the most unexpected sort of way as if just to keep his hand in but the mice had it mostly their own way all that night one by one the men who stood waiting dropped away and out of the line to get their dinners but still enough stood there the livelong night to pass a message from mouth to mouth with the speed of a telegram into town then these men standing there and those who went away as to that fell to thinking of bunker hill somehow she had advanced wonderfully in the estimation of all from the moment she had been sent for by the widow it was a sort of special dignity that had been conferred this woman bunker hill had been knighted by their queen she had been picked out and set apart and over and above all the other fallen women of the forks even limber tim who stood there on one leg with his back screwed tight up against the palings began to like her overmuch and to wonder why she also would not make some honest man an honest wife in fact many men that night recalled many noble acts on the part of this poor woman and they almost began to feel ashamed that they had sometimes laughed at her plainness and promised in their hearts to never do so again chapter xvii captain tommy there was a gray streak of dawn just breaking through the black treetops that tossed above the high far deep snow on the mountain that lifted to the east as the door opened and bunker hill came forth alone there were ugly clouds rolling overhead mixing marching and countermarching as if preparing for a great battle of the elements on the west wall of the mountain a wolf howled dolefully to his mate on the opposite crest of the caсon the water tumbled and thundered through the gorge below and sent up echoes and sounds that were sad and lonesome as the march to the home of the dead she came out into the gray day slowly and thoughtfully her head was down and when limber tim helped her over the fence she was shy and modest as if she herself had been the widow he tried to ask about the widow but that awful respect for the other sex that seems born with the american of the far west kept him silent and as bunker hill led on rapidly towards town and did not say one word about the sufferer he followed as ignorant as any man in camp on the way the woman slipped on the wet and icy trail and fell for she was in terrible haste and terribly excited perhaps she cut her arm or hand on the sharp stone as she fell for as she hastily arose and again hurried on she kept rubbing and holding her right arm with her left she led straight to the howling wilderness lifted the latch and entered she looked all around but did not speak she was in a great hurry and was evidently looking for some one she wished to find at once no man spoke to her now the few found there at this hour were the wildest and most reckless in the camp but they were respectful as if in the presence of a lady born and bred a lady there was something beautiful in this silence and respect even the man with the silver farobox for a breastwork rose up and stood in her presence while she remained he did not do it on purpose he would not have done it the day before had she stood before him by the hour he did not even know when he arose but when she bowed just the least bit and turned away and went out again into the cold and did not drink did not drink mind you did not even look at the crimsonheaded man who had risen up in perfect confidence he found himself standing and found his heart filling with a kind of gallantry that he had not known before he had risen in her presence by instinct come we must find captain tommy the woman said this to limber tim as they left the saloon and then led swiftly on to captain tommys cabin this captain tommy was a character and a power too and wretch as she was was a woman to be leaned upon and trusted too to the last true she was very plain but you may adopt it as one of your rules of life and act upon it with absolute certainty that if you have to trust any woman trust a plain one rather than a handsome one for the plain ones were not made to sell else they too had been made handsome not to be too particular about a delicate subject said old baldy who had been fortunate enough to know her her memory possibly may reach back to the black hawk war but the crowning feature of this woman was her enormous head of hair it was black as night and bushy as a kanakas all about her head in a heap that seemed to be constantly in motion but at the back and down between her shoulders it had gathered into a queue and hung down there like a bellrope with a black tassel at the end she generally kept her mouth closed but men observed that when she wanted to say any thing she pulled up her back took hold of the bellrope and pulled and pulled till her mouth came open then she would throw out her sunken breast and wind and wind with her two hands and corkscrew at her back hair and pull and twist and wind until she had wound herself up so tight that it was impossible to close either her mouth or her eyes after that she could talk faster than any man in the world and faster than a great many women until she ran down and the bellrope hung loose between her shoulders then her mouth would close suddenly and she would have to stop that instant even if in the midst of a sentence until she could seize the bellrope pull herself open and wind herself up again the captain had admirers in the forks many and many a worshiper and not altogether without reason there was about her a certain sweetness of nature that contrasted well with the rough life in which she was thrown and the strong men noted this and liked the sense of her presence besides that this woman had a certain sincerity about her a virtue that is as rare as it is dear to man i think if we look at ourselves clearly we will discover that this one quality wins upon us more than any other that is more than beauty more than gold sincerity earnestness for my part i only make that one demand on any man or any woman you can not be graceful at will or wealthy or beautiful or always goodnatured but you can be in earnest you can refuse to lie either in word or in deed i demand that you shall be in earnest before you shall approach me be in earnest even in your villainy the woman knocked on the door with her knuckles and called through the hole of the latchstring to the woman within for captain tommy was also a woman and a woman of the order of a less order even than this good samaritan who stood calling through the keyhole and shivering with the cold there was an answer and then the two stood there in the bleak still cold gray morning together there was a noise of somebody dressing in the dark very fast a hard oath or two the scratching of a match the lifting of a latch in the rear of a cabin the sound of a mans boots scratching over the stones of a back trail that led to the howling wilderness and then the door opened and bunker hill led in instantly went right up to captain tommy took her hand in her own and whispered in her ear the captain caught her breath and then with both hands up as if to defend herself staggered close back against the wall then as if suddenly recovering herself and coming upon a new thought she relaxed her lifted arms let them fall and rounding her shoulders walked up to the smouldering fire turned her back put her hands behind her looked at bunker hill sidewise and said yer be darned its so tommy sure as gospel and we want you she wants you she sent for you sent me and you will come for you are needed i cant go it all night some people must be there and that some people must be women no you dont play me go long with yer larks git the captain was getting out of temper what was to be done bunker hill went close up to her and leaning up whispered sharply in her ear the captain only said yer be blowed and turned and kicked the fire till it blazed up and filled the room with a rosy light such only as smouldering pine logs can throw out when roused up into a flame and then she turned around and looked at bunker hill as if she had firmly made up her mind not to be hoaxed she looked at the goodsouled hunchback before her as if she would look her through then suddenly her eyes rested on one of her white cuffs what the devils that on yer sleeve been in a row again eh come come theres no time to lose its awful bunker hill laid hold of captain tommys arm and attempted to drag her to the door she was getting desperate tommy pulled back and still kept looking at the excited womans white sleeve or cuff what the devils that on your sleeve it looks like blood bunker hill lifted her arm looking now herself pulled back her sleeve and held it to the light blood it is will you believe me now the stubborn woman who had been standing on the defensive with her back to the fire darted forward now all excitement all sympathy she snatched her outer garments from the foot of the bed where they had lain all this interview and threw them on her back she did not stop to fasten them she caught a blanket from the bed threw it over her head as she passed out all breathless and left the cabindoor wide open with the fitful pine fire making ghosts on the floor and the fitful march morning riding in on the wind and sowing it with ashes chapter xviii blood limber tim all this time had held his back against the wall as firmly as if it was about to fall on all their heads and their lives depended on his strength his mouth had been wide open with wonder he had not understood at all from the first but now he was more than bewildered he was terrified blood blood he unscrewed himself from the wall went winding his long limber legs up the trail past the howling wilderness after the silent but excited women and all the time this awful sentence of bunker hills was shooting through his brain blood blood it is will you believe me now he reached his post by the pine fence and being no wiser than before he again wound himself up against the palings and reached back his arms and wove them through the pickets and stood there on one leg looking over his shoulder as the two women disappeared into the widows cabin dawn comes slowly down in these dark deep wooded caсons of the sierras morning seems to be battling with the night night is entrenched in the woods and retreats only by inches the battle of the wilderness in the steelgray dawn cold and sharp limber tim heard a cry that knocked him loose from the fence he picked himself together and again twisted himself into the pickets but all the time he kept seeing bunker hill pushing back her sleeve holding up her arm in the ghostly light of the pinelog fire and saying blood it is will you believe me now blood mused the man somebodys hurt somebodys hurt awful bad too or they wouldnt keep a feller astandin agin a fence the whole blessed night the mans teeth began to chatter the thought of blood and the bleak cold morning kept them smiting together as if he had had an ague a man in great gum boots came screeching by the cabin his nose was pointed straight for the howling wilderness but backing against limber tim as he hung up against the fence stopped and asked timidly and very respectfully of the widow limber held his head thoughtfully to one side as if he was trying to balance the important facts in his mind and reveal only just so much of the condition of the widow or sandy or bunker hill or whoever it was that was hurt as was best and no more but for a time was silent a thought struck him and he mused sandys cut his foot or praps its bunker hill shot herself with that darned pistol she allers packs in her breeches pocket well an ows the widder the man was getting impatient for his drink it aint the widder at all its sandy sandys cut his foot cut his foot last night a cuttin wood in the dark thats whats the matter limber tim pecked his head pursed up his mouth and for the first time in his life perhaps felt that he was really a man of some consequence by the holy poker thought it was the widder not much its sandy cut his foot i tell yer blood clean up to his elbows blood all over the house bunker hill all over blood hells a poppin i tell yer and poor limber tim so excited himself by this recital that he broke loose from the fence and chattered his teeth together like a chipmunk with a hazelnut then the man passed on down the trail and limber tim again grew on to the fence and chattered his teeth together and waited developments not at all certain that he had not lied ows the widder limber limber unloosed himself from the fence and tried to stand straight up and tell the truth and nothing but the truth better thank yer that is the blood is stopped or most of it you know the most of it bunker hill is hurt some too you know blood all over her arm poor girl poor girl but she didnt whimper not she nary a sniff both of em hurt yes same bullet you know same shot same pistol same the man had too much to tell already and almost ran in his haste to reach the howling wilderness and tell what had happened this time as limber tim screwed himself up against the fence he felt pretty certain that somewhere or somehow during the morning he had lied like a trooper and was very miserable hard on sandy that said the barkeeper to the second earlyriser who had just arrived as he stood behind his breastwork in his nightshirt and handed down to his customer his morning bottle with his hairy arms all naked and his red uncombed hair reaching up like the blaze from a pineknot fire yes answered the man as he fired a volley down his throat and then fell back to the fire wiping his big bearded mouth with the back of his hand yes but limber tim says shell soon be up again says the bloods all stopped and all that you see the signs are all in her favor its a good thing for a shot to see it bleed best thing for a bad shot is to see it bleed well that is if yer can stop the blood in time but now in this ere case the bloods all stopped just come down from there limber just told me bloods all stopped there was a man standing back in the corner by the fire half in the dark warming the lower end of his back and listening with both ears all this time he now came out of the dark and began you darned infernal fool sold clean out its not the widder at all its sandy split his foot open with an ax blood gushed out all over bunker hill kivered bunker hill with blood clean up to the elbows and what the devil was bunker hill adoin at sandys the man from the dark saw that somebody had been sold and fearing it might possibly be himself simply pecked at the other man staggered up to the bar pecked at the head that blazed like a pineknot fire and then the three drank in silence there was a sort of truce a silent but wellunderstood agreement that nothing further should be said but that when the truth came out one should not tell on the other and turn the laugh of the camp upon him early the men began to drop in to the great whirlpool the one great center of this snowwalled world to ask gently and with tender concern in their faces after the fortunes of the widow it was a great day for the cinnamonhaired little man and he made the most of it men fell into disputes the moment they arrived but as no one knew any thing they always settled it with a treat all round and then waited for results the barkeeper was appealed to as barkeepers like barbers are supposed to know all the news but this man like most barkeepers in the wilderness was a cautious man and said he knew all about it but could not take sides or decide between his friends time would tell who was right and who was wrong at last the judge rolled in like a little sea on the shore he had come straight down from the widows had gone up to get the truth of the matter and had unscrewed limber tim from the fence and made him tell all he knew of the unhappy lady and how it happened then the boys backed the little judge up against the bar and stood him there and read him from top to bottom as if he had been a bulletin board split his foot clean open you see did it while a choppin wood in the dark speck he was a lookin at the widder when it happened half laughed a big man with a big mouth and a voice like a numidian lion the clumsy cuss that is what oregon jake said after catching his breath over his tumbler of old tom and that is all the sympathy that sandy got after they found out as they thought that he had only split open his foot with an ax the clumsy cuss chapter xix how did it happen the sun at last shot sharply through the far fir tops tossing over the savage and sublime mountain crest away to the east with its battlement of snow and limber tim was glad at the sight of it for he was very cold and stiff and hungry and thirsty and tired of his post of honor and disgusted with himself for the miserable mistakes he had made that morning he had been standing there like a forlorn and lonesome cock all the morning on one foot waiting for the dawn and now he fairly wanted to crow at the sight of it men came and went now and every man asked after poor sandy limber tim now told the same story right straight through all about how it happened how bunker hill was kivered with blood and all about it even to the most minute detail for certainly thought he to himself it is sandy or sandy would have come out long ago he even believed it so firmly that he began to be sorry for sandy and to wonder how long it would be till sandy would be out and about again on crutches then he said to himself it would be at least a month and then when the next man came by and inquired after sandy he told him that in a month sandy would be about on crutches at this piece of information limber tim felt a great deal better he said to himself he was very glad it was no worse and then he screwed his back tighter up to the fence than before and stood there trying to warm in the cold sunlight of a moist morning in the sierras it was like standing on the apennines and turning your back and parting your coat tails and trying to warm by the fires of vesuvius in the midst of meditations like these the door opened and sandy shuffled through it shot over the fence slapped his two great hands on the two shoulders as before and before limber tim could unscrew himself from the fence cried out whisky limber whisky quick the gals is almost tuckered go split he spun him around and sent him reeling down the trail then returned and banged the door behind him limber tim scratched his ear as he stumbled over the rocks in the trail and wound his stiffened legs about the boulders and over the logs on his way to the howling wilderness and was sorely perplexed wal it aint sandy any way ef his big hands have lost any of their grip i dont see it anyhow he shrugged his shoulders as he said this to himself for they still ached from the vicelike grip of the giant still limber tim was angry notwithstanding the discovery that his old partner was sound and well and he lifted the latch with but one resolution and that was to remain perfectly silent and let his lies take care of themselves men crowded around him as he entered and gave his orders but this bulletinboard was a blank he had set his lips together and they kept their place for the first time in his troubled and shaky existence he began to know and to feel the power and the dignity of silence he knew that every man there thought that he who stood next to the throne knew all and felt dignified by this and dared even to look a little severe on those who were about to ask him questions he had crammed a bottle of socalled bourbon in his left boot and was just pushing into the right a phial of wrath when some one in the cabin sighed poor sandy still limber tim went on pushing the phial of wrath into his gum boot as well as he could with his stiffened fingers then a man came up sharply out of the crowd and throwing a big heavy bag of gold dust as fat as a pet squirrel down on the counter proposed to raise a puss for sandy this was too much limber tim raised his head and slipping as fast as he could through the crowd for the door said back over his shoulder it aint sandy at all its bunker hill its the gals the gals is almost tuckered there was the confusion of babel in the howling wilderness the strange and contradictory accounts that had come down from the widows their shrine the little log house that to them was as a temple a city set upon a hill were anything but satisfactory the men began to get nervous and then they began to drink and then they began to dispute again and then they began to bet high and recklessly who it was that had cut his foot got it all right now said poor limber tim to himself as he made his way up the trail as fast as possible with the two bottles in the legs of his great gum boots for safe carriage got it all right now thats it bunker hill cut her foot or shot her hand with that darned derringer or something of the kind thats it thats where the blood came from thats why shes tuckered thats whats the matter and so saying and musing to himself he reached his post uncorked the phial of wrath as it was called looked in at the contents turned it up towards the sun as if it had been a sort of telescope and smacking his lips felt slightly confirmed in his opinion he also resolved to ask sandy like a man what the devil was up the moment he appeared again the door flew open sandy flew out rushed over the fence took the bourbon from the trembling hand of limber tim and before he could get his wits together had disappeared and banged the door behind him limber tim did not like this silentdignity business a bit lookee here he said as he again turned the telescope up to the sun and then looked at the door ill see whats what i reckon he went up to the fence leaned over but his heart failed him then he resorted to the phial of wrath again looked at the sun and as he replaced it in his boot felt bold as a lion the man was drunk he climbed the fence staggered up to the door lifted the latch and pushed it open bunker hill came softly out of the bedroom pushed the man back gently as if he had been a child shut the door slowly and the man went back to his post men have curiosity as well as women weak women over weaker tea discussing strong scandal in some little wouldbefashionable shoddy saloon in paris are not more curious than were these halfwild men here in the woods the difference however is this was an honest sympathetic interest it was all these men had outside of hard work to interest them they wanted to know what was the matter in their little temple on the hill the camp was getting wild limber tim tried to screw himself up against the fence for some time and failing in this turned his attention again to the phial of wrath he was leaning over trying to get it out of his boot leg when the door opened and bunker hill stepped out carefully but supple and straight as he had ever seen her limber tim was quite overcome he looked up the caсon and then down the caсon theyll be a comet next he shook his head hopelessly at this remark of his and again bent down and wrestled with the boot leg and bottle bully for bunker hill guess shes not hurt much after all the men went out of the howling wilderness as the man who shot this injunction or observation in at the door went in and to their amazement saw the woman alluded to walk rapidly on past the saloon she did not look up she did not turn right or left or stop at the saloon or speak to any one she went straight to her own cabin then the men knew for a certainty that it was the little widow who was ill and they knew that it was this woman who was nursing her and they almost worshiped the ground that the good samaritan walked upon soon bunker hill came out again and again took the trail for the widows cabin and walking all the time rapidly as before the men as she passed took off their hats and stood there in silence there was a smile of satisfaction on her plain face as she climbed the hill she went up that hill as if she had been borne on wings her heart had never been so light before for the first time since she had been in camp she had noticed that she was treated with respect it was a rare sensation new and most delightful the hump on her back was barely noticed as she passed limber tim trying to lean up against the fence and entered with a noiseless step and almost tiptoe the home of the sufferer the men respected this woman now more than ever before they also respected her silence at another time they would have called out to her sent banter after her in rough unhewn speech and got in return as good or better than they sent but now no man spoke to her she had been dignified sanctified by her mission of mercy whatever it meant or whatever was the matter and she was to them a better woman men who met her on her return gave her all the trail and held their hats as she passed one old man gave her his hand as she crossed a little snow stream in the trail and helped her over it as if she had been his own child yet this old man had despised her and all her kind the day before she went and came many times that day and always with the same respect the same silent regard from the great missourians whom the day found about the forks then captain tommy came forth in the evening and also went on straight to her cabin and her face was full of concern the captain had not been a person of any dignity at all the day before but now not a man had the audacity to address her as she passed on with her eyes fixed on the trail before her when she returned the man at his post had fallen poor limber tim he would not leave his station and sandy had something else to think of now and so he fell on the field it was not that he had drunk so much but that he had eaten so little his last recollections of that day were a long and protracted and fruitless wrestle with the phial of wrath in his bootleg and an ineffectual attempt to screw the picket fence on to his back it was no new thing to find a man spilt out in the trail in these days and his fall excited no remark they would carry men in out of the night and away from the wolves or else would sit down and camp by them till they were able to care for themselves a man took a leg under each arm another man took hold of his shoulders and limber tim now the limpest thing dead or alive was borne to his cabin one two three days the camp that at first was excited almost beyond bounds had gone back to its work and only now and then sent up a man from the mines below or sent down a man from the mines above to inquire if there was yet any news from the widow but not a word was to be heard all these days the two women went and came right through the thick of the men but no man there was found rude enough to ask a question never had the camp been so sober never had the forks been so thoughtful the cinnamonheaded barkeeper leaned over his bar and said confidentially to the man at the table behind the silver farobox who had just awakened from a long nap ef this ere thing keps up i busts then the redhaired man drew a cork and went on a protracted spree all by himself send for a gospel sharp all to once jake lets go the whole hog the forks only wants to get religion now and die chapter xx a flag of truce how beautiful was all this profound veneration for woman in this wild eden how high and holy the influence of this one woman over these halfgrizzlies these hairyfaced men who had drunk water from the same spring with the wild beasts of the sierras now they would not drink would hardly shout or speak sharp while she lay ill whatever was the matter or the misfortune they had too much respect for her for themselves to carouse till she should again show her face or at least while her life was uncertain the fourth day came down into the caсon and sat down there as a sort of pioneer summer birds flew over the camp from one mountain side to the other and sang as they flew men whistled old tunes in a dreamy sort of a way as they came up from their work that day and recalled other days and were boys once more in imagination away in the world that lay beyond the rocky mountains there is something in this glorious climate of californy say what you will mused the judge as he lit his pipe and sat down on a stump in the street limber tim and the cinnamonhaired man had settled down into that collapse which always follows a protracted spree or a heavy carouse and they too sat on their respective stumps out in the open air while the saloon was left all to the little brown mice upstairs men were lounging all up and down the street on old knotty logs that no ax could reduce to firewood or leaning against the cabins on the warm sides that were still warm with the sunshine gone away or loafing up and down with their pipes in their mouths and their ragged coats thrown over one shoulder like the bravos of italy certainly there was something in the glorious climate of california there had been no news from the widow all this time a keeneyed man just now lifted his eyes in the direction of the cabin in fact it was a custom an instinct to lift the face in that direction many times a day if any of these men ever prayed in that camp and the truth could be told you would find that that man first turned the face and kneeled looking in that direction her house was a sort of second mecca the camp however after being a long time patient and silent had got a little cross yet it had not lost a bit of its blunt and honest manhood it had simply made up its mind that the widow and sandy were both of age and able to take care of themselves if they were willing to get the toothache or something of the kind and then retreat into their cabin and pull the latchstring inside after them they could do so and the camp would not interfere the man who had been looking up the hill now turned to his partner drew his pipe from his mouth wrinkled up his brows and then slowly reached out his arm and with his pipestem pointed inquiringly up the hill a man and a woman were coming slowly and cautiously down the way from the widows cabin they were coming straight for the great center of the forks the howling wilderness the woman had something in her arms she walked as carefully as if she had been bearing a waiter of wine could this be the widow it could hardly be bunker hill thought the forks as it rose up from its seat on the stumps and lifted its face up the trail for she is almost as tall and comely and steps as nimbly as any woman in camp could this be sandy he looked larger than ever before a sort of gog or magog the man stuck his pipe between his teeth again and puffed furiously for a minute and then sat down over the log again let his feet dangle in the air and leaning forward rocked to and fro as if nursing his stomach and seemed wrapped in thought sandy by the great cжsar bunker hill by the holy poker and whats that she got a carryin its a tablecloth a hangin out for dinner its a flag of truce cried the judge standing on tiptoe on his stump and straightening his fat little body up towards the sierras and hasnt sandy growd since we seed im eh and dont he step high jerusalem dont he step high and wheres captain tommy and wheres the widow anxiously inquired the forks still looking up the hill towards its little shrine at last they entered the town and the town met them on the edge at its outer gate as it were with all its force the woman indeed bore a flag of truce a long white banner streamed from her arms and fell down to her feet and almost touched the ground a close observer would have seen that this flag was made of the very same coarse material from which the widow had made the curtains of her little bed they entered the edge of the town these three and the town stood there as silent as if it had risen up on its way to church on a sunday morning these three do you mind stood there still right in the track of the town and the town looking at them as if they had come from another world and so at least they had a part of them these three sandy bunker hill and the first baby born in the mines of the sierras bunker hill held the baby out in one hand and with the other tenderly lifted back the covering while sandy stood by like a tower on a hill smiling pushing back his hat pulling down his whiskers looking over the little army of men with a splendid sort of sympathy and selfaccusation combined he seemed to be saying as he turned their eyes to the little red half opened rosebud just look there see what ive done his great face was radiant with delight and then there was a shout such a shout the spotted clouds that blew about the tall pine tops indolent and away up on the mountains brow seemed to be set in motion again the coyote rose up from his sleep on the mountain side and called out to his companions across the gorge as if he had been frightened while captain tommy who had been left with the widow came to the door and stood there listening and looking down into the camp to see what in the world had happened she saw mens hats go up in the air and then again the shouts shook the town three cheers for sandy they were given with a tiger three cheers for the widow three cheers for missus bunker hill and then the poor girl leaning out of the door took up her apron and wiped tears of joy from her eyes for three times three were given for captain tommy then she went back into the house back to the bedroom with the curious little curtains and gunnybag carpets and told the widow and the two women wept in each others arms together men slapped each other on the back bantered each other and talked loud of old missouri and the institution of marriage of all things perhaps this baby was the last they had looked for or thought of in a camp of thousands where the youngest baby there save the boy poet had a beard on his face the men had forgotten to think of children it is quite likely they fancied that children would not grow in the sierras at all the judge was the first to come forward as was his custom he looked it in the face began to make a speech but only could say its this glorious climate of californy and then he blushed to the tip of his nose backed out and others came in turn to see the wonderful little creature that had come all alone farther than across the plains farther than any of them farther than the farthest of the states even from the other world to settle in the sierras well ef that aint the littlest is that all the big they is well dont think sandy hardly got his first planting did he pike well that bangs me all hollow dang my cats if its bigger nor my thumb devil of a little thing to make such a big row about eh sandy was all submission and pride and tenderness and received the congratulations and heard the goodhumored speeches of the goodhumored men as if they were all meant in compliment to him how radiant and even half beautiful was the plain face of poor miss bunker hill as she lifted it up before the camp now conscious that she had done a good thing and had a right to look the world in the face and receive its kindness and encouragement older men and more thoughtful came up at last to look upon the little wonder and to read the story of this new volume fresh from the press they looked long and silently they were as gentle as lambs death had no terror to them it was not half so solemn so mysterious as this birth in the heart of the sierras life was there then as well as death people would come and go there as elsewhere the hand of god had stretched over the mountain down into the awful gorge and set down a little angel at their cabin doors it was very very welcome and the old men bobbed their heads with delight at last all was still and the little judge felt that this was not an occasion to be lost in fact had there been a clergyman there to say a word it had had more good effect than all the funeral sermons that the little redfaced man had pronounced in the camp the occasion was a singular one and the mens hearts were now as mellow as newplowed land that had long lain fallow and waiting for the seed this my friends began the little man standing upon a stump and extending his hands towards the baby this my friends shows us that the wonderful climate of californy just then some one poked the fat little fellow in the stomach with his pipestem and he doubled up like a jackknife and quietly got down as if nothing had happened there was a lull then and things began to look embarrassing sandy was now of course too proud too happy too much of a man to carouse but he called the cinnamonheaded man to his side by a crook of his finger and making the sign so well known in the sierras and so well understood by all who are thirsty the parties divided the camp to carouse to the little stranger in the howling wilderness and sandy to return to his famly heres to to to heres to it heres to the little halfapint the men were standing in a row their glasses high up and dipping in every angle and to every point of the compass but they did not know the babys name they did not even know its sex and so in that moment without stopping to think and without any time to spare they spoke of it as it and they named it little halfapint chapter xxi the question none could answer how the widows heart had been beating all this time how she waited and waited and listened and how often she sent captain tommy to the door to tell her if possible how her baby fared among the halfwild men of the camp how glad she was when she saw sandy enter all flurry and delight as if he had been the central figure in some great triumph then a bit of the old sadness and cast of care swept over her face and she nestled down in the pillow and put up her two hands to hide a moment from the light the other two were too busy with the little halfapint to notice her trouble then they laid it down in a cradle that had been made for rocking and washing gold and good little bunker hill sat by it and crossed her legs and took up her work and went on sewing and singing to herself and swinging her leg that hung over and rocking the cradle with her foot in the old fashioned way when babies were born in the leaves of the woods of the wabash and mothers sat singing by the campfires knitting and rocking their babies in their sugartroughs down in the howling wilderness i am bound to say the carousing began early and with a vigor that promised more headaches than the camp had known since the widow first set foot in the forks little halfapint was toasted and talked of in every corner of the house was it a girl or was it a boy why had they not asked so simple and so civil a question they called for limber tim they would appeal to him but limber tim was not to be found in all the manifold depths of the howling wilderness he had had his carouse and was now playing sober indian in fact he was hanging very close about the little rocking cradle up in the front room of the widows cabin never was the cradle allowed to rest but rock rock till the widow and sandy too were both made very sensible sleeping or waking that little halfapint small as it was was filling up the biggest half of the house nearly midnight it was when limber tim leaning over the cradle and looking or pretending to look at the baby said to bunker hill who bent down over it on the other side pretty aint it guess it is looks just like its father for the world and little humpbacked bunker hill began to make faces and to shake her head and nod it up and down and coo and crow to little halfapint as if it was really able to hear and understand and answer all she said to it down at the saloon all this time the spirits flowed like water the cinnamonhaired fellow had fallen upon a harvest and was making the most of it he had laid off his coat run his two hands up through his hair till it stood up like forked flames and was thumping the glasses as if in feats of legerdemain how he did score with the charcoal on the hewn logs behind he marked and scored that night till the wall behind him looked as if it might be the iliad written in greek or all the characters on the obelisk of saint peters yet with all this happiness on the hill and this merrymaking under the hill in the heart of the sierras in commemoration and celebration of the beginning of a new race in a new land there was one man back in the corner of the saloon who looked on with something of a sneer on his hard hatchet face and who refused to take any part now and then this man would lift up his left hand hold out his fingers and count one two three four five to himself with his other hand and then shake his head the men began to look at him and wonder what he meant then this man would count again one two three four five six seven then when the men would waddle by in their great gumboots and look back at him over their beards he would look them square in the face and wink and screw and shrug his shoulders this man stopped there in the middle of the spree and pursing his brow and holding up his fingers once more and looking as profound as if wrestling with a problem in euclid said to himself hosses is ten cows is six cats is three but human beins blowed if i know and he shook his head at last this hard hatchetfaced looking man standing back alone in the corner seemed to have got it all counted up to his own satisfaction he counted however again then he said as if to himself seven months at the very outside and slapped his hands together with great glee and sucked his thin brown lips as if he had just tasted something very delicious then this hatchetfaced fellow still rubbing his hands and still twirling his lip and all the time grinning with a grin that was sweet and devilish turned to the first man at his side and whispered in his ear this man started and spun around when the hardfaced man had finished as if he had been a top and the hatchetfaced fellow had struck him with a whip the man spun about in fact till the hardfaced fellow caught hold of his eye with his own and held him there till he could catch his breath then the man after catching his breath and catching it again said slowly but most emphatically ompossible the hatchetfaced man simply pecked in the face of the other he did not say any thing more to him but he pecked at him again and he pecked emphatically too and in a way that would not admit of any two opinions as if the man were a grain of corn and he had half a mind to pick him up and swallow him down for daring to hint that it was impossible then the man went off suddenly to one side and he too fell to counting on his fingers and to taking a whole knot of men into his confidence then the hatchetfaced fellow went up to another man and whispered in his ear with his smirk and his sweet devilish smile and he soon set him to spinning round like a top and to lifting up his fingers and counting one two three four five then all around the saloon men began to get sober and to hold up their hands and to count their fingers at last the little fat redfaced judge was heard to say they was married in the fall about about about eh about what month do you remember eh squeaked out the hatchetfaced interrogation point through the nose as he planted himself before the little judge about the last cleaning up said the judge cheerfully that was about about and the hatchetfaced man with the nasal twang and sharp nose began again to count on his fingers about four five six seven months ago yes yes said the goodnatured unsuspicious important little judge about six seven months ago i reckon and then he smiling innocently fell in between two great bearded giants as a sort of hamsandwich filling to take a drink at the bar ompossible said the first top to the hatchetface ask him the hatchetface and sharpnose looked towards the little fat judge wedged in between the giants the top spun up to the little judge wedged his head in between the giants shoulders and asked a question the judge shook his head and then wiping his mouth with the back of his hand said half sadly no i am not no i am sorry to say i am not that is a happiness still in store no i am not a family man never was married in my life but whatever may transpire in this glorious climate of californy the top had its answer and spun back to its place without waiting for the last of the speech the two men talked together again then they appealed to an old man who sat mute and sullen back on the bench by the bulldog no he didnt know about such things didnt care a cuss anyhow and the two men went away as if a flea or two had left the dog and hopped into their ears they went to another man dont see the point blowed ef i do six months seven months eight months ten months all along there i spose the great washington cжsar horace greeley all sich bigbugs it might take one two three years that little cuss today only a month or two i reckon its all right i reckon it aint my funeral any how and what the devil you come botherin of me for anyhow ef yer dont want to drink yerself let a fellow alone what does and he shook them off with a gesture of the hand and a jerk of the head that meant a great deal more than he had said there were not so many fingers up now as before the question evidently had been settled in the minds of the men fully in favor of the little halfapint few understood these things at all fewer still cared to go into particulars at this time and the question would keep till they had more leisure and less whisky finally the hatchetfaced man went round and sat down opposite the man who sat behind the little silver farobox by the pinetable and began to whisper in his ear the goodnatured genius halfgambler halfminer who had played the little prank with the salmon and golddust had had a dull night of it and most like even for that reason was a little out of humor at all events he did not answer at once but set down his little silver box and taking up his cards began to spin them one by one over the heads of the men or through the crowd as it opened back at the old bulldog that lay on the bunk on the bags of gold under the blankets and half whistling to himself as he did so the hatchetfaced man fearing the man had forgotten his presence and his revelation leaned over again and began to whisper and to count on his fingers then he looked sharp at the gambler and began again hits my pinion that its that boy billie piper how many months did you say asked the gambler at last seven or eight at the furthest and how many had it ought to be twelve and the smile that was sweet and devilish played about the thin blue lips below the sharp and meddlesome nose and are you a family man no and you say shes bilked us yes youre a darnd infernal liar the gambler rose as he said this snatched up his silver box and dashed it into the teeth of hatchetface and he coward as he was put up his hands and held them to his mouth while the blood ran down between his fingers i dont keer judge i dont keer if i broke every tooth in his head i dont low no whitelivered son of a gun to go about atalking about a woman like that then the gambler walking off said to those around him in a lower tone it dont take no twelve months nohow now theres the yaller cat bout four litters in a year twelve months be blowed thats an old womans story then thats in missoury anyhow and whats the climate of missoury got to do with californy id like to know no gentlemen some apples gits ripe soon and some dont git ripe till frost comes thems things gentlemen as we dont know nothing about thems mysteries and none of our business nohow show me the man and here he began to roar like a numidian lion and to tower up above the crowd while a face like a razor shot out through the door looking back frightened as it fled show me the man as says its not all right and ill shake him out of his boots the gambler picked up his battered box but he was evidently not in a good humor he wiped it on his coatsleeve and polished it up and down but was ill content at last looking out from under his great slouch hat he saw the top in the center of a little knot of men holding up his hand and counting his fingers he threw the box down on the table and rushed into the knot of men a bully set you are aint you gwyne around acounting up after a sick woman and what do you know anyhow he took hold of the nervous top and again set it spinning that little woman she come as we come god almighty didnt set no mark and gauge on you and you shant go round and count up after her do you hear now you git youre wanted hatchetface wants yer do you hear the man spun his top about till its face was to the door and it went out as a sort of handle to the hatchet and was seen no more that night yet for all this there had been a great ripple in the wave that had to run even to the shore before it could disappear from the face of things at the forks chapter xxii debatable ground the next day when sandy came down the enthusiasm was at a low ebb he missed the great reception he had expected and went back home that night a troubled and anxious man what could be the matter he asked limber tim but limber tim had learned the power and security of silence and either could not or would not venture on any revelations besides that he was very busy helping bunker hill with the baby the camp openly and at all convenient times discussed the question now and it began to gradually take shape in the minds of men that something was really wrong kind old sandy did not dream what the trouble could be he feared he had not been generous enough under his good fortune and was all the time opening the mouth of his leather bag at the bar and pouring gold dust into the scales and entreating the boys to drink to the health of their little halfapint yes our little halfapint it is i reckons leastwise its pretty certain it aint yourn sandy looked at the man and then the man set down his glass untouched and went off he had not meant all that he had said but having blurted it out in a very awkward way and at the very worst time got off and out of it as best he could sandy was tortured the dear little widow saw it and asked him what the trouble was and the man blunt honest fellow told all that had happened the camp was disgusted with the man who had mooted this question they counted him a traitor to the forks a sort of judas if he had gone and hung himself the camp would have been perfectly satisfied in fact it is pretty certain that the camp would have been very glad to have had any excuse even the least bit of an excuse to do that office for him then the camp was angry with sandy too on general principles he had betrayed them into a sort of idolworship under a mistake he had lured it into the expression of an enthusiasm quite out of keeping with the dignity of a rough and hardy race of men and it did not like it the great big idiot said the camp didnt he know any better dont he know any better now than to go on in this way halftickled to death thinking himself the happiest and the most blest of men the camp was ashamed of him the little judge finding things going against the first family of the forks felt also that he in some way was concerned and felt called upon to explain this was his theory and explanation the widow was a widow yes the legislature met at san josй on the first day of september yes the legislature granted that first session enough divorces to fill a book well this young woman this widow might a bin married she might a bin on her way to the mountains she might a stopped in there and got her divorce one day on her way up she might a come right on here and got coaxed into marrying sandy rather quick work wouldnt it be judge well considering the climate of californy i think not and the little man pushed out his legs under the cardtable puffed out his little red cheeks leaned back and felt perfectly certain that he had made a great point while the wise men of the camp sat there more confused than before however as the days went by men went on with their work in their mines down in the boiling foaming full little streams now overflowing from the snows that melted in the warm spring sun and said but little more on the subject it was certain that they were very doubtful for they only shook their heads as a rule when the subject was mentioned now in the great center that was a bad sign and very hard evidence of displeasure with their patron saint of the autumn and the long weary winter the widow must have known all this not that sandy had said a word further than she had almost forced him to speak not that she had yet ventured down into the forks or that bunker hill had breathed a word about it but i fancy that women know these things by instinct they somehow have a singularly clear way of coming upon such things day after day she read sandys face as he came up from his mine dripping with the yellow water spurted from the sluice all over his broad slouch hat long brown beard and stiff duck breeches she read it eagerly as one reads the papers after a battle and read it truly as if it had been a broadsheet in print and found herself in disfavor with the camp then she began to think if sandy was thinking of his promise if he had remembered and still remembered the time when in her great agony he promised though all the world turned against her and cried shame he would not upbraid her she wondered if he ever wished he had gone when she commanded him and implored him to go and she began to read his face for the truth she read read him all through page after page chapter after chapter she found there was not a doubt in all the realm of his soul and her face took on again a little of its gladness yet the touch of tenderness deepened the old sadness had settled back again and this time to remain the still blue skies of california were bending over the camp not a cloud sailed east or west or hovered about the snowpeaks it was full summertime in the sierras before it was yet midspring and men began to pour over the mountains across the settled and solid banks of snow birds flew low and idly about the cabins and sang as the men went on with their work down in the foaming muddy little rivers and all the world seemed glad and strong with life and hope still the widow was glad no more and men began to notice that sandy did not come to town at all it was even observed that he had found a cutoff across the spur of the hill by which he went and came to and from his mining claim without once setting foot in the howling wilderness or even the forks limber tim too seemed sad and sorely troubled sunshine and singing birds do not always bring delight to all there is nothing so sad as sadness at such a time chapter xxiii another wedding at the forks limber tim no longer wrestled with saplings or picketfences or even his limber legs he had other and graver matters on hand the birds were building their nests all about him and he too wanted to gather moss at last the boyman was happy at least he came one night very late to sandys as the widows home was now called and standing outside of the house and backing up against the fence and sticking his hands in behind him and twisting his left leg around the right he called out to sandy in a voice that was wild and uncertain as a wind that is lost in the trees sandy laid it down tenderly covered it up and watching it a minute and making sure that it was sound asleep and well went out limber tim was writhing and twisting more than ever before sandy was glad for he now knew that he was perfectly well and that he had got the great matter settled and that in a way perfectly satisfactory to himself and yet the two men were terribly embarrassed what made the embarrassment very much the worse was the fact that they were at least halfamile from the nearest saloon fortunately it was very dark for a californian night and the men could look each other in the face without seeing each other there was a long and painful silence limber tim wrestled with his right leg with all his might and would have thrown it time and again but from the fact that his two arms were thrust in behind and wound through the palings so that it was impossible for him to fall his mouth was open and his tongue was out but he could not talk at last sandy broke the prolonged and profound silence win her limber won her sandy bully for limber tim then there was another painful silence and limber tim twisted a paling off the fence with his arms and kicked half the bark off his right shin with his left bootheel sandy limber then limber tim reached out his tongue and spun it about as if it had been a fishline and he was fishing in the darkness for words at last he jerked back as if he had got a bite jerked and jerked as if his throat was full of fishhooks and jerked till he jerked himself loose from the fence and poising on his heel before falling back into the darkness and twisting himself down the hill said this git the judge sandy fetch her home tomorrow spliced tomorrow sandy git the judge tomorrow and tomorrow kept coming up the hill and out of the darkness till the nervous man was half way to the howling wilderness the judge was there a cooler man now even though it was midsummer his shirt was open till his black hairy breast showed through as if it had been a naked bearskin the forks came in force to its second wedding but the forks too was cooler and had put aside to some extent its faith and its folly and yet it liked bunker hill ever so much bunker hill said the forks had not been the best of women in days gone by but bunker hill had never deceived she stood alone there that day the day of all days to any woman in the world and the boys did not like it at all why had she not asked the widow to be by her side surely she had stood by the widow in the day of trouble why was not the widow there and then they thought about it a little while and saw how impossible it was for poor deformed little bunker hill to dare to ask the widow to come and stand with her at her wedding the woman who stood there about to be made the head of the second family in the forks had nursed the widow back to life and health had seen all the time the line that lay between them and had not taken a single step to cross it when her task was finished she had gone back to her home she carried with her the memory and the recollection of a duty well performed and felt that it was enough she had not seen the widow any more the judge stood there with the declaration of independence the statutes of california and the marriage ceremony all under his arm and ready to do his office the sun was pouring down in the open streets little bunker hill felt hardly somehow that she had a right to be married out in the open day in the fresh sweet air and under the trees and limber tim preferred to be married where his partner had been married and so it was that they had met in the howling wilderness as before all was silence now all were waiting for the judge to begin up in the loft the mice nibbled away at their endless rations of old boots and a big redheaded woodpecker pounded away on the wall back by the chimney without there was a commotion at the door then there was a murmur of admiration and applause the men gave way they pushed and pushed each other back as if they had been pushing cotton bales they opened a line and down that line a beautiful woman with her eyes to the ground and a baby in her arms moved on till she came and stood by the side of the little hunchback still silent and looking with the old look of sad sweet tranquility upon the ground it was really too much for the little man who had opened his bosom and who all the time had stood there with his books under his arm perfectly cool and perfect master of the situation now he was all of a heap he had been acting with a sort of condescension toward the two halfchildren who had come before him that day and had even prepared a sort of patronizing halfmissionary halfreformatory sermon but now and all suddenly he was utterly overthrown he began to perspire and choke on the spot the silence was painful the woodpecker pounded as if he would knock the house down and the mice rasped at their old boots and rattled away like men sawing wood the judge began to hear himself breathe in this moment of crisis he caught a book from his side and proceeded to read he read from an act to amend an act entitled an act for the improvement of the breed of sheep in the state of california back in the saloon there were men who began to giggle these were some men not from missouri they were of the hatchetfaced order men who spoke through their noses idecated men the camp called them and men that above all others had put the little judge in terror when he heard the men laugh then he knew he had opened his book at the wrong place and his face grew red as fire he could not see to read to the end nor could he now be heard he suddenly closed the book and said then by virtue of the authority in me vested and under the laws of the state of california in such cases made and provided i pronounce you man and wife then the little judge came up shook them both by the hand and his voice was suddenly clear as a bell and he felt that he could now go on and speak by the hour the widow bowed down above her baby and kissed the newmade bride silently and tenderly as if she had been her sister and then with the same sweet half sad smile she turned to the door her face still to the ground and covering up the little sleeper in her arms and looking neither right nor left went back alone to her cabin the dark day was over at the play whenever you see the whole force of the company come forward and stand in a row and assume the most striking and imposing attitudes and hear the fiddlers play and the brass trumpets bray as never before then you may be very sure the tragedy is about over so it goes in life the crowd had melted away a bit because it was very warm and then the men were getting noisy enough for this was the day on which every true american was expected to get drunk it was a sort of fourth of july the old question was being again raised the bride was standing there in the midst of the men a true good woman a woman who had sinned yet a woman who had suffered one who had fallen was she yet one who had resisted more than many a woman who would have cast a stone at her she was very glad and not a man but was glad to see it that baby it is an angel and its mothers name is madonna that little bit of a brat why i seed it first first of any body and it wasnt bigger than a pound of soap after a whole days washing make a fuss about that little thing a man who would make a fuss about a baby no bigger than that no matter when it was born is a fool bully for bunk for for missis tim bully for missis tim and the men shouted and mrs tim blushed from sheer joy the gopher cheered perhaps more lustily than any one for he admired the widow and knew her love and worth the gopher it is true was in disgrace for the story went that the young man his partner who was the first to be buried in the forks had fallen by his hand the blow had been struck in a crowd it was said and no one saw it or at least no one cared to tell of it if he did and so the gopher had been left alone and he had left men alone and lived all the time by himself in a sort of cave and that is why he was called the gopher strange stories were told of this gopher too and men who pretended to know said his cave was lined with gold that baby began the gopher lifting up his doubled fist and bringing it down now and then by way of emphasis that baby look here heres one baby among a thousand men heres a thousand men asking if its got a father now does that little baby want a father ive got a cave full of gold and ill be its father ill be its brother and uncle and aunt and mother the gopher thundered his fist down on the bar as he concluded and the glasses there jumped up and clinked together and bowed to each other as if they had been dancers about to begin a cotillion the woodpecker flew away and the mice were heard no more that day for the men shouted their approval till they were hoarsevoiced as mules deboon had been sitting there all the time half doubled over a bench he perhaps was thinking of the first wedding for he kept looking straight across the room to the pinelogs on the other side and then he seemed to fix his eyes on some object there and to fall to thinking very generally at last he began to count on his fingers then suddenly he fairly laughed with delight he sprang up stepped across the room put his finger on the spot where limber tim had stood scrawling with his big pencil the day he was so embarrassed at sandys wedding and shouted out look here there it is thats the date thats the day they was married september eighteen hundred and fifty just eight months roared a man in the crowd eight months ten of em and he fell to counting on his fingers as he turned to the crowd and continued right on up to july with perfect confidence the camp roared and shouted and danced as never before why had it been so stupid as not to set this thing right from the first it was the most penitent community that had ever been the widow was once more its patron saint the gopher stood up by the wall are you all satisfied now satisfied they would never doubt any woman any more as long as they lived he took his bowieknife while the crowd turned to take a drink and cut the date from the wall and the only record perhaps of the first marriage in the sierras was no more the sharpnosed man one of those miserable men who never are satisfied unless they are either miserable or making some one else so came up to the wall out of the crowd and began to look on the wall for the date as if he thought there might have been some mistake and he wanted to count it all over again this man began to count on his fingers and to look along on the wall suddenly there was a something gleaming in his face like a flash of lightning it was the gophers bowieknife it was within two inches of his throat are you satisfied my friend smiled the gopher with a smile that meant brimstone perfectly satisfied said the wretch in return and at the same time he bowed and backed as fast as he could till he came to the door and then he was seen no more be it really all on the square judge asked citizen tim one day timidly and in confidence right didnt i marry em but it warnt twelve months twelve months dont care ef it warnt six months i married em and i married em good and fast and thats the end of it public opinion flows and ebbs like the tide of the sea at one time this little camp was unanimous in the opinion that the mysterious little woman could be none other than nancy williams and it would talk of little else then it would tire of this subject change its opinion and let the matter drop for months together chapter xxiv the judge is lonesome in the spring a young mans fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love this was the song of the fat little judge one fine morning as he wandered down towards the howling wilderness sniffing the glorious balm the very breath of the forest and glancing ever and anon over his shoulder towards the cabin of captain tommy how new and fresh and sweet and fragrant the odors of the mighty mossy woods that climbed and climbed and ever climbed as if to mount the summits and push their tasselled tops against the indolent summer clouds that hovered like great whitewinged birds above the peaks of snow so new and fresh it seemed that summer morning that the little judge stopped on the hillside and stood there to inhale its sweetness how fresh and fine is this new world of californy it is only finished today i can smell the varnish on it the judge took out his great cotton bandanna took off his hat and polished his bald head till it shone in the sun like a mirror then the little man stuffed his big handkerchief back in his bosom and went on down the trail humming softly to himself in the spring a young mans fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love a man in great gum boots duck breeches a hat like a tent with a gold pan under his arm and a pipe sticking out through a mask of matted beard met the little man in the trail heard his song as he passed and looking back over his shoulder said to himself the derned baldheaded old rooster whats he asingin hymns fur now the little judge could not sit down in the saloon he felt that something was the matter and he thought that he was lonesome the little brown mice upstairs could be heard all day now for the miners were at work up to their thighs in the water delving away there in their great gum boots as if they were in a sort of divingbell so the judge went away from the howling wilderness there was no man to be found who had time to talk and so he sought a woman captain tommy stood in the door of her cabin all untroubled she had seen the little judge approach but she was too happy drinking in the great summers day that filled all things with peace and a calm delight and she did not stir there are days and occasions when even the most plain women are positively beautiful and when a plain woman is beautiful she is the most beautiful thing in the world this was captain tommys day to be beautiful and perhaps she felt it for there she stood really playing the coquette hardly turning her eyes to look on the little alcalde although she knew he was mad in love with her he stood before her in the sun with his hat in his hand then she looked into the polished mirror which he humbly bowed before her and she saw that she was really beautiful captain said the mirror and it bowed still lower lady in this glorious climate of californy i have snatched a few moments from my professional duties to come to you to say to you to to beg of you that you will will you in this glorious climate of californy this morning the mirror was close up under her eyes she smiled and then she lifted her two hands and began to wind herself up as fast as possible so that she could answer the eager and earnest little man before her the judge waited in an ecstacy of delight for he knew by the twinkle in her eye that he should have to send for the blackclad man with the white necktie who had so terrified the parson and he was very happy chapter xxv after the deluge what then by slow degrees no one knew just when or how the boypoet began to find his way back after a year or two to the widows cabin the miners wondered that sandy did not protest they saw with some alarm that the widow was even more kind to him than before was it the pale pleading face of the consumptive boy that moved her years went by and the chronicler stood again in the forks the town was gone the miners had uprooted its very foundations then came floods and buried the boulders and the banks of the stream and widened it out and made it even as a newplowed field then a man the hon mr sandy who had sat down with his family quite satisfied in the sierras extended a fence around the site of the old city and planted and sowed and then reaped the richest of harvests on the site of the howling wilderness the yellow golden grain reached up till it touched the very beard of the giant so do perish the mining towns of the sierras the hills are not so wild now the woods have been mown away and up on the hillsides the miners have sat down old and wrinkled and few in numbers and around their quiet old cabins have planted fruit trees and trees even from the tropics and these trees flourish here too for though the snow falls deep and the sun has little room between the walls of the mighty caсon still it seems never now so bleak or cold there is one little house on the hillside with porches and spanish verandahs and hammocks swinging there and all that nestled down among the fruittrees that bend with fruit and blossom around this cabin and back of it and up the mountains among the firs you see pretty children passing in and out laughing as they run shouting like little modocs shaking back their hair all full of the gold and glory of the california sun and making every one happy who beholds them all in the glorious climate of californy says the little man as he comes puffing up the hill to his home and the children of the first families run to meet him can it be possible did they all grow young again did they go back and begin life at the beginning truly there is something in the climate and the fountain of youth flows certainly somewhere out of the sierras for look there stands a woman winding herself up to welcome her husband she is only a little stouter and is even beautiful as for limber tim being an idecated man he started a newspaper in the nearest town and after many battles and many defeats finally climbed high on the ladder of distinction and is now the hon mr tim with a political influence second in that part of the country to no man and to only one woman how things are changed to be sure the caravans of clouds that little billie piper was wont to look up to and wonder at still cross the caсon and march and countermarch and curl about the far snow peaks as before but the coyote has ceased to howl from the hillside and what can that be curling like steam up from out the mighty forest that belts the snow peaks about the heads of the three little streams that make the forks it looks like a train of clouds driven straight through the tree tops it is so high and fairylike and far away it is as if it were on the very summit of the sierras ah that is the engine blowing off the clouds of steam as she drops shoots slides glides from the mountain to the sea the train is a mile in length the dust of three thousand miles is on her skirts but before the going down of the sun she will draw rein to rest by the golden gate chapter xxvi the widow in disgrace stick a pin here be sure you remember that these settlers of the sierras were as distinct a people from the settlers by the sea as you can conceive the one was of the west the other of the east the one ate codfish and had a nasal accent and sang hymns the other had never seen the ocean he detested codfish ate bacon and swore like a pirate years went by and people strangers came and went but our first famlies of the sierras remained this is history the phoenicians landed and left their impress on ireland long before england heard of the first cжsar their impetuous blood signalizes the fenian of today the pilgrim fathers refused to return a world of immigration flowed to and fro but these few gave to the bleak and barren east the sharp nose the nationality good or bad of the north of north america while the few first settlers of the south gave spring to a current that will flow on for a thousand years i am all the time wondering when i think of the people of the sierras what women or men and women the traveler of a century hence will find there i think he will not find a coward or a miser i think he will find a brave generous openhanded and unsuspicious people a people full of freedom of lofty aspiration of purity partaking of the awful sublimity that environs them and somewhere in these sierras will they name the new parnassus the nine sisters in the far new day will have their habitation here when the gold hunter has gone away and the last pick lies rusting in the mine the sea of seas shall rave and knock at the golden gate but this shall be the vineland the place of rest that the old greeks sought forever to find this will be the land of eternal afternoon a land born of storm and rounded into shape by the blows of hardy and enduring men it shall have its reaction its rest the great singer of the future born of the gleaming snows and the gloomy forests of the sierras shall some day swing his harp in the wind and move down these watered and wooded slopes to conquer the world with a song for peace now you would have me say that we never once sinned in this eden of ours in the sierras there is an old and a beautiful story you knew it long before you learned to read it was in that other eden there the living god spake face to face with man he visited him every day in his own form and yet he fell we do not claim to be much better than they were in eden even in the sierras the forks like every other place in the world had its little center of aristocracy there was here as in any other little community one leading woman of fashion the one tyrant who admitted this or that one to the social center this woman an ancient schoolmarm had firmly set her face against the widow from the first from this there was no appeal the widow was in disgrace still she refused to banish the boypoet from her presence the old suspicion hung in the minds of the miners at the forks one day there were two old men made mellow from the juice of grapes they had planted and grown on the hillsides about their cabins who grimly wagged their heads and looked wise at the mention of the widow as she was still called and sympathized with sandy yes praps it was and praps it wasnt one would say as he thought of little halfapint now a noisy little tomboy filling the fir woods with laughter but then her having that ere poet about her all the time thats what sticks in my crop thats what sticks in my crop echoes his fellow as he pushes the bushy beard from his mouth and lifts his gourd of wine the reputation of this ere camp says another as he sets down his empty gourd and lays his forefinger in his palm and settles his head wisely to one side the reputation of this ere camp depends on a havin of this ere thing cleared up about the widder it looks pesky black put in the other garrulous old woman in duck breeches cause why she still sees him and sandy three old heads helpless goodnatured old women who had spent their manhood and their strength long before their grapevines were growing on the hillside huddled close together in half maudlin conversation sandy hes a chuckleheaded old idiart hes a gitten old and he cant help hisself hes a gitten old the chuckleheaded old idiart lookee here an old fortyniner rose half way up felt that his spine was not very reliable and so spread out his two great hands on the two shoulders of his boon companion and peered down in his face till their two beards white as foam almost flowed together lets run im out at these words an old crippled man suddenly started up from his place back in the corner and tottered forward to where the three old heads were huddled together run out billie little billie piper that never gits any older never has a beard that come here that come when did little billie piper come gintlemen you listen to me when you run out little billie piper by god you run him out over my bones and here the gopher thundered his two fists down on to the pineboard table and turning on his heel tottered out and up the hillside to his cabin chapter xxvii billie piper and deboon it is more than possible that we in america did once have a real bourbon amongst us if a bonaparte could come and wed with us and cast his fortune with us why certainly a very heir to the crown of france might come and spend his life with us live and die unknown i dont know that we ever had any kings or sons of kings or daughters of kings or any thing of the kind with us in the little eden of the sierras but i do know that we had some odd men there and some great men too men that deserved to be kings whatever they may have been and what they were what they had been no man ever knew there was a truce to investigation the family tree stood in the form of a sombre pine at each mans cabin door that was enough you could not go outside of the camp for inquiry the eternal girdle of snow lifted its front in everlasting protest how then shall i tell you who this silent widow that refused to go away that refused to surrender that refused to open her lips how shall i tell you who she was why she remained or from whence she came as for billie piper the majority of the camp of course had long settled down to the unalterable conviction that he remained for the love of the widow and the camp hated him for it he was shunned despised for he did not look the man he did not even act the man when he was insulted he did not resent it he only held his head at such times gave the road to all avoided all for weeks together went on with his work in a feeble way for he was very feeble now and never made answer to any one about this time he fell ill or at least the report ran that he was ill sandy was absent on business in the valley below one evening the widow was seen to enter his cabin the camp was indignant there were now many women in the place and her actions did not pass unobserved the next day the woman the leader of society in the little mountain metropolis cut the widow in the street or rather on the hillside for the mining town had passed away and there was no street now two sunbonnets made of pasteboard and calico that reached far out over the faces of the wearers like the cover of a pedlers wagon met that afternoon on the hillside its awful its just awful the two covered wagons were poked up close against each other she staid all night she staid with him till daylight i will cut her i have cut her the two covered wagons parted and passed on you remember deboon well let us see how the california gold mines treated some of the bold fellows who once courted fortune nearly a quarter of a century ago in the sierras these mines were great mills they ground men soul and body to powder time like a great river turned the stones and this man like thousands and thousands of others was ground down to nothing twenty years had now passed twenty terrible years in which this brave and resolute man had dared more than cжsar had endured more than ney and he now found that the entire end of his fathers name had been somewhere in the sierras worn or torn away and hid or covered up for ever in the tailings he was now nothing but bab while groundsluicing one night and possibly wondering what other deduction could be made and not leave him nameless he was caught in a cave sluiced out and carried headfirst through the flume this last venture wore him down to about the condition of an old quartercoin where neither date name nor nationality can be deciphered his jaws were crushed and limbs broken till they lay in every direction like the claws of a seacrab they took him to the county hospital and there they called him old bab it was a year before he got about and then he came leaning on a staff with a frightful face he had lost all spirit he sat moodily about the hospital and sometimes said bitter things one day he said of grasshopper jim who was a great talker that man must necessarily lie there is not truth enough in the united states to keep his tongue going for ever as it does one evening a young candidate told him he was going to make a speech and very patronizingly asked him to come out and hear him old bab looked straight at the wall as if counting the stripes on the paper then said half to himself the fact of balaams ass making a speech has had a more demoralizing influence than any other event told in the holy bible for ever since that time every lineal descendant seems determined to follow his example his face was never relieved by a smile and his chin stuck out fearfully so that one day when snapping andy who was licensed by the miners to be the champion growler of the camp called him old baboon it was as complete as a baptismal ceremony and he was known by no other name some women visited him one evening fallen angels women with the trail of the serpent all over them they gave him a pipe and money and above all words of encouragement and kindness he moodily filled the meerschaum they had brought him and after driving a volume of smoke through his nose looked quietly up and said society is wrong these women are not bad women for my part i begin to find so much that is evil in that which the world calls good and so much that is good in what the world calls evil that i refuse to draw a distinction where god has not then he fired a doublebarrelled volley at society through his nose and throwing out volume after volume of smoke as a sort of redoubt between himself and the world he hated drifted silently into a tropical golden land of dreams chapter xxviii the gopher and do you remember the man they called the gopher poor old gopher his was another story he died before baboon found his fortune else they might have set up together and behind their bulldogs and grizzlies growled at the world a day or two with perfect satisfaction but fate said otherwise the gopher had always been misunderstood even from the first if the camp held him at arms length in the old days it as a rule shunned him now when new men came in and murder began to be a word with a terrible meaning and even the good widow almost forgot him the camp went down and cabins were deserted by hundreds but there was one cabin that was never vacant it stood apart from town on the brown hillside and as it was one of the first so it promised to be the last of the camp it always had an ugly bulldog tied to the door was itself a low suspiciouslooking structure that year by year sank lower as the grass grew taller around it till it seemed trying to hide in the chaparral it had but one occupant a silent selfish man who never came out by day except to bury himself alone in his claim at work nothing was known of him at all save the story that he had killed his partner in a gamblinghouse away back somewhere in he was shunned and feared by all and he approached and spoke to no one except the butcher the grocer and expressman and to these only briefly on business i believe however that the old cripple baboon sometimes sat on the bank and talked to the murderer at work in his claim it was even said that baboon was on fair terms with the dog at the door this solitary man of the savage dog was as you guess the gopher that was not the name given him by his parents but it was the name the camp had given him a generation before and it was now the only name by which he was known the amount of gold which he had hoarded and hidden away in that dismal old cabin through years and years of incessant toil was computed to be enormous year after year the grass stole farther down from the hilltops to which it had been driven as it were in the early settlement of the camp at last it environed the few remaining cabins as if they were besieged and it stood up tall and undisturbed in the only remaining trail still regularly three times a day the smoke curled up from the gophers cabin and the bulldog kept unbroken sentry at the door in the january spring that followed the grass and clover crept down strong and thick from the hills and spread in a pretty carpet across the unmeasured streets of the once populous and prosperous camp little gray horned toads sunned themselves on the great flat rocks that had served for hearthstones and the wild hopvines clambered up and across the toppling and shapeless chimneys about this time a closelycontested election drew near it was a bold and original thought of a candidate to approach the gopher and solicit his vote his friends shook their heads but his case was desperate and he ventured down upon the old gray cabin hiding in the grass and chaparral the dog protested and the officeseeker was proceeding to knock his ugly teeth down his throat with a pickhandle when the door opened and he found the muzzle of a doublebarrelled shotgun in his face the candidate did not stay to urge his claims and the gophers politics remained a mystery here in this land of the sun the days trench deep into the nights of northern countries and birds and beasts retire before the sunset a habit which the transplanted saxon declines to adopt some idlers sat at sunset on the verandah of the last saloon looking down the gulch as the manzanita smoke curled up from the gophers cabin there is an hour when the best that is in man comes to the surface sometimes the outcroppings are not promising of any great inner wealth but the indications whatever they may be are not false it is dulse and drift coming to the surface when the storm of the day is over yet the best thoughts are never uttered often because no fit words are found to array them in oftener because no fit ear is found to receive them how lonesome it looked that little stormstained cabin thus alone stooping down hiding away in the long strong grass as if halfashamed of the mournful history of its sad and lonely occupant a sailor broke silence looks like a feejee camp on a south sea island robinson crusoe the last man of the original camp the last rose of summer this was said by a young man who had sent some verses to the hangtown weekly looks to me in its crows nest of chaparral like the lucky ace of spades added a man who sat apart contemplating the wax under the nail of his right forefinger the schoolmaster here picked up the ace of hearts drew out his pencil and figured rapidly there he cried flourishing the card i put it an ounce a day for eighteen years and that is the result the figures astonished them all it was decided that the old miser had at least a muleload of gold in his cabin it is my opinion said the new squire who was small of stature and consequently insolent and impertinent he had ought to be taken up tried and hung for killing his pardner in the time has run out said the coroner who now came up adjusting a tall hat to which he was evidently not accustomed the time for such cases by the law made and provided has run out and it is my opinion it cant be did not long after this it was discovered that the gopher was not at work then it came out that he was very ill and that old baboon was seen to enter his cabin chapter xxix a natural death early one frosty morning in the fall following old baboon sat by the door of the only saloon he held an old bulldog by a towstring and both man and dog were pictures of distress as they shivered from the keen cold wind that came pitching down from the snowpeaks as a man approached the man shivered till his teeth chattered and clutching at the string looked helplessly over his shoulder at the uncompromising barkeeper who had just arisen and opened the door to let out the bad odors of his den the dog shivered too and came up and sat down close enough to receive the sympathetic hand of old baboon on his broad bowed head this man was a relic and a wreck more than twenty years of miners life and labor in the mountains interrupted of late only by periodical sprees governed in their duration solely by the results of his last clean up had made him one of a type of men known only to the pacific true he had failed to negotiate with the savage cinnamonheaded vendor of poison but he was no beggar it was simply a failure to obtain a wall street accommodation in a small way i doubt if the bristledhaired barkeeper himself questioned the honesty of baboon it was merely a question of ability to pay and the decision of the autocrat had been promptly and firmly given against the applicant perhaps in strict justice to the redhaired wretch that washed his tumblers and watched for victims that frosty morning i should state that appearances were certainly against baboon you can with tolerable certainty in the placer mines tell how a miners claim is paying by the condition and quality of his topboots baboon had no boots only a pair of slippers improvised from old rubbers and between the top of these and the legs of his pantaloons there was no compromise across the naked coldblue ankles these signs together with a buttonless blue shirt that showed his hairy bosom a frightful beard and hair beneath a hat that drooped like a wilted palmleaf were the circumstantial evidences from which judge barkeep made his decision it would perhaps be more pleasant for us all if we could know that such men were a race to themselves that they never saw civilization that there never was a time when they were petted by pretty sisters and sat pure and strong the central figures of christian households or at least we would like to think that they grew upon the border and belonged there but the truth is very often they came of the gentlest blood and life the border man born and bred in storms never gets discouraged it is the man of culture refinement and sensitive nature who falls from the front in the hardfought battles of the west this mans brow was broad and full had his beard and hair been combed and cared for his head had looked a very picture but after all there was one weak point in his face he had a small hesitating nose as a rule in any great struggle involving any degree of strategy and strength the small nose must go to the wall it may have pluck spirit refinement sensitiveness and in fact to the casual observer every quality requisite to success but somehow invariably at the very crisis it gives way small noses are a failure this is the verdict of history give me a man or woman either with a big nose not a nose of flesh not a loose flabby nose like a camels lips nor a thin starved nose that the eyes have crowded out and forced into prominence but a full strong substantial nose that is willing and able to take the lead one that asserts itself boldly between the eyes and reaches up towards the brows and has room enough to sit down there and be at home give me a man or woman either with a nose like that and i will have a nose that will accomplish something i grant you that such a nose may be a knave but it is never a coward nor a fool never in the strong stream of miners life as it was no man could stand still he either went up or down the strong and not always the best went up the weak which often embraced the gentlest and sweetest natures were borne down and stranded here and there all along the river i have noticed that those who stop stand and look longest at the tempting display of viands in cookshop windows are those that have not a penny to purchase with perhaps there was something of this nature in old baboon that impelled him to look again and again over his shoulder as he clutched tighter to the towstring at the cinnamonheaded bottlewasher behind the bar a stranger stood before this man he turned his eyes from the barkeeper and lifted them helplessly to his charlie is dead charlie who who is charlie charlie godfrey the gopher and here is his dog and as he spoke the dog as if knowing his masters name and feeling his loss crouched close to the old mans legs a new commotion in camp say what you will of gold whenever any one shuts his eyes and turns for ever from it as if in contempt his name for a day at least assumes a majesty proportionate with the amount he has left behind and seems to despise chapter xxx a funeral the coroner who was a candidate for a higher office marshalled the leading spirits and proceeded to the cabin where the dead man lay he felt that his reputation was at stake and entering the cabin said in a solemn voice in the name of the law i take possession of this premisis some one at the door evidently not a friend to the coroners political aspirations called out o what a hat the officer was not abashed but towered up till his tall hat touched the roof and repeated in the name of the law i take possession of these primesis this time there was no response or note of derision and it was quietly conceded that the gopher and all his gold were in the hands of the coroner the cabin was a true and perfect relic of what might geologically speaking be termed a period in the plastic formation of the republic great pine logs one above the other formed three of its walls the fourth was made up by a fireplace constructed of boulders and adobe the bed had but one post a pine slab supported by legs set in the center of the earthen floor formed a table the windows were holes chiseled out between the logs that could be closed with wooden plugs in darkness or danger let these cabins not be despised their builders have done more for the commerce of the world than is supposed it is to be admitted that the dead man did not look so terrible even in death as the mind had pictured him his unclosed eyes looked straight at those who came only to reproach him and wonder where his money was buried till they were abashed standing there the jury under direction of the coroner gave a verdict of death from general debility some one tried to bring the coroner into contempt again by afterwards calling attention to the fact that he had forgotten to swear the jury but the officer replied it is not necessary in such cases by the law made and provided and so was counted wise and correct they bore the body in solemn silence to the grave yard on the hill may be a little nearer to heaven how odd that nearly all grave yards are on a hill said little billie piper once more but he said it now to himself for he stood alone no one shook hands with him now he had crept out of his bed to stand by his dead friend the places of chief mourners were assigned to baboon and the dog and billie piper whether these places were given because baboon and billie were the only present friends of the deceased or whether the dog quietly asserted a right that no one cared to dispute is not certain most likely it was one of those things that naturally and therefore correctly adjust themselves when these bearded men in blue shirts rested their burden at the open grave they looked at each other and there was an unpleasant pause perhaps they thought of the christian burialservice in other lands and felt that something was wanting at last baboon stole up close to the head of the grave hesitated lifted and laid aside his old slouch hat and looking straight down into the earth said in a low and helpless way earth to earth and dust to dust hesitated again and then continued the mustard and the clover seed are but little things and no man can tell the one from the other yet bury them in the uttermost parts of the earth and each will bring its kind perfect and beautiful and and man is surely more than a little seed and and here he quite broke down and knelt and kissed the face of the dead the men looked away for a while as if to objects in the horizon and then without looking at each other or breaking silence lowered the unshapely box caught up the spades and found a relief in heaping the grave then the coroner as in duty bound or as he expressed it as required by the law in such cases made and provided directed his attentions to a search for the buried treasure yeastpowder boxes oystercans and sardineboxes old boots and quicksilver tanks were carried out to the light and inspected without results in the straw of the bunk said the coroner and blankets bunk and straw were carried out to the sun but not an ounce of gold to make sure against intrusion of the illdisposed the unwearied coroner slept on the spot the next day the hearth was taken up carefully piece by piece but only crickets clad in black and little pinkeyed mice met the eager eyes of the men at last some one suggested that as the hardbaked earthen floor was the last place in which one would look for hidden treasures that was probably the first and only place in which the gopher had buried his gold the thought made the coroner enthusiastic he sent for picks and if we must tell the truth and the whole truth he sent for whisky also by sunset the entire earthen floor had been dug to the depth of many feet and emptied outside the door not a farthingsworth of gold was found the next day the chimney was taken down lizards dust of adobes but nothing more about this time the memory of the man just taken to the hill was held in but little respect and a good or bad name so far as the overzealous coroner was concerned depended entirely on the final results of the search but one more thing remained to be done that was to remove the cabin shingle by shingle log by log the structure was levelled woodrats kangaroomice horned toads a rattlesnake or two that had gone into winterquarters under the great logs and that was all not an ounce of gold was found in the last cabin of the missouri camp the flat was then staked off as miningground by some enterprising strangers and they began in the center to sluice it to the bedrock they sluiced up the gulch for a month and then down the gulch for a month until the whole hillside was scalped as it were to the bone and the treasurehunters were bankrupt but not even so much as the color of the dead mans gold was found the forks was disgusted and the gopher was voted a worse man dead than living it began to be noticed however that baboon had mended somewhat in his personal appearance since the death of the gopher and it was whispered that he knew where the treasure was some even went so far as to say that he had the whole sum of it in his possession some of these nights hell come up amissing said the butcher striking savagely at his steel across his block in justice to the forks it must be observed she was not without grounds to go upon in her suspicions for was not baboon near the man at his death and if he could get his dog why not get his gold also one night baboon holding tight to a towstring shuffled up to the stranger in the saloon and timidly plucking his sleeve said going away i hear yes to the states yes to missouri may be well then look here come with me and with an old dog bumping his head against his heels he led the way out the door down the gulch to the cabin he pulled the latchstring entered and finally struck a light sticking the candle in a whiskybottle that stood on a greasy table in the center of the earthen floor he picked up the towstring and pointing to the bunk in the corner they sat down together and the old dog rested his nose between the old mans legs after looking about the cabin in nervous silence for a time baboon arose with a look of resolution handed the man his string stepped to a niche in the wall and taking an old crevicingknife struck it in stoutly above the latch this means something said the man to himself here will be a revelation and a vision of the gophers goldbags crossed his mind with tempting vividness after a while the old man came back took up the whiskybottle removed the candle from its neck and holding it up between his face and the light which he held in the other hand seemed to decide some weighty proposition by the run of the beads in the bottle and then turned and offered it in silence as the stranger declined his kindness he hurriedly took a long draught replaced the candle then came and sat down close at his side took his string and the old dog again thrust his nose between his knees you see and the man leaned over to the other and began in a whisper and strangeness of manner that suggested that his mind was wandering you see we all came out here together godfrey thats the gopher wilson thats curly and i things didnt go right with me there after i came away so i just let them drift here lost my grip as they say didnt have any snap any more as people call it godfrey and wilson got on very well though till wilson was killed till the gopher killed him well now theres where it is said old baboon and he shuddered the dog too seemed to grow nervous and crowded his ugly head up tighter between the old mans legs theres where it is godfrey did not kill wilson the gopher did not kill curly no more than did you you see curly was young and out here he fell to gambling and taking a bit too much and one night when godfrey tried to get him away from a game a set of roughs got up a row upset the table and curly got knifed by some one of the set who made the row to get a grab at the money godfrey was holding the boy at the time to keep him from striking for he was mad drunk poor curly only said dont let them know it at home and died in his arms every body was stranger to every body then and no one took stock in that which did not concern him people said godfrey was right that it was a case of selfdefense and godfrey never said a word never denied he killed him but went back to the cabin and took possession of everything and had it all his own way he worked like a chinaman and never took any part in miners meetings or any thing of the kind and people began to fear and shun him byandby most of his old friends had gone and he was only known as the gopher again baboon paused and the dog crept closer than before as if he knew the name of his master once more the man arose lifted the candle contemplated the beads in the bottle as before and returned he did not sit down but took up and pulled back the blankets at the end of the bunk i thought as much said the stranger to himself the gold is hidden in the straw look at them said he and he threw down a bundle of papers and held down the dim candle there were hundreds of letters all written in a fine steelplate ladys hand some addressed to godfrey and some to wilson now and then was one with a border of black telling that some one at home no longer waited the return come home come home was at the bottom of them all one addressed to wilson of a recent date thanked him with all a mothers and sisters tenderness for the money he had so constantly sent them through all the weary years that was it you see that was it as godfrey thats the gopher is dead and can send them no more money and as you was agoing to the states i thought best that you should drop in and tell the two families gently somehow that they both are dead say that they died together he sent them the last ounce he had the week before he died and made me take these letters to keep them away from the coroner so that he might not know his address and so that they might not know at home that curly had died long ago and died a gambler take one of the letters along and that will tell you where they are again old baboon resumed the towstring he looked toward the door and when the man had stepped across the sill he put out the light and the two stood together the old dog knew there was but the one place for his master outside his cabin at such a time and blind leading the blind thither he led him through the dark to the saloon and whither went the parson that cold blustering morning he set his face against the snow and started out alone up the corkscrew trail to try to reach no one knew where or did he try to reach any place at all did he not take this course so that he might leave the mind of the woman he had loved free and careless of his fate sandy had promised and so he had led his new wife to the parsonage and taken possession as he had agreed but rough as he was he often wished he had not done so he could see the hand of his great rival the parson in all things around him sometimes he almost fancied he could see his face mournful sad looking in at the window out of the storm at the happy pair by his hearthstone early one autumn some prospectors pushed far up the fork running parallel with the trail leading out of camp and there in the leaves they found a skull there was a hole in the temple and the marks of sharp teeth on the smooth white surface they also found a small silvermounted pistol the party came down to the forks one night where friends were enjoying themselves at the saloon the leader told what they had found and laid the pistol on the counter it was one of the parsons little bullpups the pistol was empty one final word of the once genteel deboon and we prepare to descend from the sierras buffeted beaten down and blown about still he lingered near his old haunts in the forks at last the broken man who was now only known as old baboon because he was so ugly and twisted and bent and crooked when he had no home no mine no mind nothing at all and did not want any thing at all but a grave stumbled on to a mine that made him almost a prince in fortune he would not leave the sierras now he settled there here is an extract from a letter in which he invites a distinguished traveling yankee philanthropist and missionary to come to him and make his house his home after describing the house and lands he says the house stands in this wood of pine we have two california grizzlies and a pair of bulldogs sandy keeps the dogs chained but i let the grizzlies go free we are not troubled with visitors chapter xxxi the caravan of death the little poet had no place in the heart of the camp at the first and now at the last when he was about to go away he held even a less place than when he came nobody knew when he came nobody cared now that he was passing away at last nobody save the widow knew of it nobody cared to know of it truly this singular creature did not fit in anywhere in the sierras the widow had been seen to enter the little hermitage alone and very regularly of late but no one made inquiry or interfered now the case was peculiar the guilt of the widow was an accepted fact no one under the circumstances could speak to her of him they left this all to her a sort of monopoly of death we leave her at this bedside and turn for the last time to the little chinaman and what became of the little brown man with the meek almond eyes and the peaceful smile that for ever hovered about the corner of his mouth poor little washeewashee when the widow got married he had to go he could not embark in business again and he would not go away the widow always gave him all he asked when he came to her but that was very little she even tried to persuade him to accept little gifts and to take some delicacies for his stomachs sake but the little pagan would only shake his head smile the least bit out of one corner of his mouth and then go away as if half offended every five years there is a curious sort of mule caravan seen meandering up and down the mining streams of california where chinamen are to be found it is a quiet train and quite unlike those to be found there driven by mexicans and bearing whisky and dry goods in this train or caravan the drivers do not shout or scream the mules it always seemed to me do not even bray this caravan travels almost always by night and it is driven and managed almost altogether by chinamen these chinamen are civil very respectful very quiet very mournful both in their dress and manner these mules both in coming in and in going out of a camp are loaded with little beechwood boxes of about three feet in length and one foot square when the train arrives in a camp these boxes are taken from off the backs of the mules stored in some chinamans cabin close to the trail and there they lie so far as the world knows undisturbed for two or three days then some midnight the mules are quietly drawn up to the cabindoor the boxes are brought out and the mules are loaded and the line winds away up the hill and out on the mountain to where their freight can be taken down to the sea on wheels the only apparent difference in these boxes now is the lead label at either end which was not there when they entered the camp this is the caravan of the dead no chinaman will consent to let his bones lie in the land of the barbarian the bones of every chinaman even to the beggar if there ever was such a thing as a chinese beggar in california are taken back to the land of his fathers washeewashee stood watching the train climb the corkscrew trail in the gray dawn one morning and then shaking his head he went to the widow and said byee byee washeewashee allee samee and it was so his first great commercial enterprise had been a disastrous failure and the brown little fellow never recovered other chinamen poured into camp and he certainly had friends among them all but he went to none in his griefs as he did to the widow she who had been his friend in his first great trouble the little brown man took to opium and gradually grew almost black his little bright black eyes grew brighter his thin face grew thinner and he became a little more than a shadow still he would smile a bit out of that corner of his mouth would smile as if he was smiling at death and was trying to cheat him into the idea that he felt perfectly well the caravan came in due time as before it rested loaded climbed the hill and as the train led up against the morning star you might have read on one little box wherein a skeleton lay doubled up like a jack knife this name washeewashee chapter xxxii the end people began to remember that they had not seen their silent and singular little poet since the death and burial of the gopher surely he was ill at all events the widow went boldly and regularly now to his cabin and to the credit of the camp be it said it at last began to look with toleration on these missions to the humble vineclad hermitage of the sad and lonesome little poet only once more he came out and sat by the door pale and dreamy and full of mystery the schoolmaster not an unkindly man stopped a moment with his book and slate under his arm as he led a little girl by the hand and looking into the palid face before him said it is a hard old world billie a hard old world at best we have to belabor the old earth beat her to make her give us bread beat her the little thin hands clasped and lifted as if in prayer belabor my dear mother earth why she gave us birth she gives us all our bread she gives us all that is beautiful and good she will take us again to her bosom i will pray to earth that i may have rest on her tranquil breast the schoolmaster passed on and the sad little dreamer arose with difficulty and passed for the last time from the light of the sun when the schoolmaster walked by next morning the door stood open the little girl looked in and then ran away as if afraid did she see with her child vision the face of death the schoolmaster perhaps fearing to compromise his character by any association with this singular being hurried on after the little girl and did not turn around or look back till he had set foot over the sill of the little log schoolhouse on the hill his heart was beating very wildly he had said nothing he had heard nothing he had seen nothing but somehow the mans heart was beating with a strange terror and he wanted to turn back and enter the cabin and speak once more to the lonely little sufferer the man called his school to order however took off his coat hung it up behind the door ran his two hands through his hair time and again but failing to pacify himself by this means called out a little boy and flogged him soundly he afterwards remembered that there was a black cat sitting in the door as he passed quietly washing her face yet at the same time looking intently at him out of her green eyes the heroes of the world are women the women as a rule have done the great deeds of valor men however have written the histories and appropriated a great deal indeed to themselves i know very well that in a certain kind of noisy heroism man makes a great mark and instances of valor even in a quiet way where man fights his battle alone and in the dark without the observation or applause of the world are not wanting but the great battles in darkness and disgrace where death and ignominy waited the smallgreat battles the heart the battlefield where no friend would come where no pen should chronicle these silent fights have been fought and won by women understanding all this i can understand why the widow chose to bear all the reproof and let her friend the refugee the dreamer the poet live and die unknown and in peace the next morning as the schoolmaster came by with the little girl sliding up close to his legs on the opposite side from the cabin the widow with a face of unutterable sadness was outside trying to tie a piece of something black to the doorlatch the man lifted his hat and came reverently and slowly forward there was no need of saying anything now he understood it all and after assisting her in silence to do the office of respect for the dead within he took the little girls hand again in his turned to go took a few steps forward and then stopping and turning around again lifted his hat and said softly to the widow i will stop at the saloon and send up some of the boys to take charge of the body and prepare it for the grave no sighed the widow in a voice that was scarcely heard above the beating of her heart no george and she came slowly and calmly up to the man and stood there with her white face lifted close into his no george you will go back to the house and get your mother and your sister to come and help me now at the last for it is a woman that lies dead there in that little vinecovered cabin the woman had kept the womans secret she had given her life as it were for the life of another but now that all was over the whole story was to be written in the single name on the little granite gravestone it was the name of nancy williams the end publications of jansen mcclurg co chicago illinois caton a summer in norway with notes

tenderness as if of one who soaring upon the confines of a better life had longed to leave some sweet remembrance here they stand forth from the wayside of poetic literature like some peaceful chapel
