shannon and annie without you truly i would be lost one the morning began as did so many of their mornings with an argument later when it was important to recall the precise order of events the way everything had spun so effortlessly out of control cindy would struggle to remember what exactly she and her older daughter had been fighting about the dog the shower her nieces upcoming weddingit would all seem so mundane so trivial so unworthy of raised voices and increased blood pressure a blur of words that blew past their heads like a sudden storm scattering debris but leaving the foundation intact nothing extraordinary to be sure the start of an average day or so it had seemed at the time images cindy in the ratty greenandnavy terrycloth bathrobe shed bought just after tom left toweldrying her chin length brown hair as she emerges from her bedroom julia at the opposite end of the wide upstairs hall wrapped in a yellowandwhitestriped towel pacing back and forth in front of the bathroom between her room and her sisters impatience bubbling like lava from a volcano inside her reedthin sixfoot frame elvis the perpetually scruffy apricotcolored wheaten terrier julia brought with her when shed moved back home just under a year ago barking and snapping at the air as he bounces along beside her heather what in gods name are you doing in there julia banged on the bathroom door then banged on it a second time when no answer was forthcoming sounds like shes taking a shower cindy offered regretting her interference as soon as the words were out of her mouth julia glared at her mother from underneath a mop of ash blond hair painstakingly straightened every morning to obliterate even a hint of its natural curl obviously cindy marveled that one word could contain so much venom convey so much disdain im sure shell be out in a minute shes been in there for half an hour already therell be no hot water left for me therell be plenty of hot water julia banged her fist a third time against the bathroom door stop that julia youll break it if youre not careful oh yeah right like i could break the door as if to prove her point she thumped it again julia mother stalemate cindy thought as usual the way it had been between the two of them since julia was two years old and had balked at wearing the frilly white dress cindy had bought her for her birthday the stubborn toddler refusing to attend her own party even after cindy had conceded defeat told her she could wear whatever she liked nineteen years had passed julia was twentyone nothing had changed did you walk the dog cindy asked now and just when would i have done that cindy pretended not to notice the sarcasm in her daughters voice when you got up like youre supposed to julia rolled large green eyes toward the ceiling we had a deal cindy reminded her ill walk him later hes been cooped up all night hes probably desperate to go hell be fine i dont want any more accidents then you take him out julia snapped im not exactly dressed for a walk youre being obstinate youre being anal julia mother stalemate julia slammed her open palm against the bathroom door okay times up everybody out of the pool cindy absorbed the reverberation from julias hand on the door like a slap on the face she lifted her fingers to her cheek felt the sting thats enough julia she cant hear you shes doing it on purpose she knows i have a big audition today you have an audition for michael kinsolvings new movie hes in town for the film festival and hes agreed to audition some local talent thats great dad set it up cindy forced a smile through tightly gritted teeth youre doing it again julia mimicked her mothers strained expression if youre going to go catatonic every time i mention dad im not catatonic the divorce was seven years ago mom get over it i assure you im well over your father julia arched one thin eyebrow plucked to within a hair of its life anyway theyre looking for an unknown which probably means every girl in north america will be up for the part heather for gods sake julia shouted as the shower shuddered to a halt youre not the only one who lives here you know cindy stared toward the thick creamcolored broadloom at her feet it had been less than a year since julia had decided to move back home with her mother and sister after seven years of living with her father and only because her fathers new wife had made it clear she considered their fivethousandsquare foot lakeside penthouse too cramped for the three of them julia had made it equally clear to her mother that her move home was temporary one borne of financial necessity and that shed be moving into her own apartment as soon as her fledgling acting career took off cindy had been so eager to have her daughter back to make up for the time missed the years lost that even the sight of julias unruly dog peeing on the living room carpet did little to dampen her initial enthusiasm cindy had welcomed julia back with open arms and a grateful heart the door to heathers bedroom opened and a sleepyeyed teenage girl in an oversized purple nightshirt spotted with tiny pink hearts squinted into the hall delicate long fingers pushed several tendrils of loose brown curls away from the slight oval of her botticelli face then rubbed at the freckles peppering the tip of her upturned nose whats all the racket she asked as elvis jumped up to lick her chin oh for gods sake julia muttered angrily when she saw her sister then kicked at the bathroom door with her bare feet duncan get your bony ass out of there julia mother duncans ass is not bony heather said i cant believe im going to be late for my audition because my sistersmoronic boyfriend is using my shower t its not your shower hes not a moron and hes lived here longer than you have heather protested a huge mistake julia said looking accusingly at her mother v says who says dad cindys lips formed the automatic smile that accompanied each mention of her exhusband lets not get into that right now fiona thinks so too julia persisted she says she cant understand whatever possessed you to let him move in here did you tell that peabrained twit to mind her own goddamned business the angry words flew from cindys mouth she couldnt have stopped them if shed tried mom heathers dark blue eyes widened in alarm mother really julia said green eyes rolling back toward the ceiling it was the really that did cindy in the word hit her like an arrow to the heart and she had to lean against the nearest wall for support as if eager to add his opinion elvis lifted his leg into the air and peed against the bathroom door oh no cindy glared at her older daughter dont look at me youre the one who swore and got him all upset just clean it up i dont have time to clean it up my auditions at eleven oclock its eightthirty you have an audition heather asked her sister what for michael kinsolvings in town for the film festival and hes decided to audition local talent for his new movie dad set it up cool heather said as cindys lips curled again into a frozen smile the bathroom door opened and a cloud of steam rushed into the hall followed by tall skinny duncan rossi wet black hair falling across playful brown eyes and wearing nothing but a small yellowand white bath towel and a large lopsided grin he quickly ducked into the bedroom hed been sharing with cindys younger daughter for almost two years of course the original deal had been that he occupy the spare room in the basement an arrangement that lasted all of three months another three months were spent denying the obvious that duncan was creeping up to heathers bedroom after cindy was safely asleep and then creeping back down before she got up until everyone finally stopped pretending although no one ever actually acknowledged the move out loud in truth cindy had no problem with the fact heather and duncan were sleeping together she genuinely liked duncan who was considerate and helpful around the house and had somehow managed to maintain his equilibrium and good humor even after the maelstrom that was julia moved in across the hall both heather and duncan were nice responsible kids whod started dating in their first year of high school and had been talking about marriage ever since which was the only thing that really worried cindy sometimes shed look over at duncan and her daughter as they were reading the morning paper at breakfasthoney nut cheerios for him cinnamon toast crunch for herand think they were almost too comfortable with each other too settled she marveled at heathers eager embrace of such a safe middle aged lifestyle and wondered if being the child of divorce had played any part in it why is she in such a hurry to tie herself down shes only nineteen shes in college she should be out sleeping around cindy had shocked her friends recently by confiding well when else is she going to do it shed continued painfully aware of her own reluctant celibacy cindy could count on one hand the number of affairs shed had since her divorce two of those in the immediate aftermath of toms abrupt decision to leave her for another woman a woman hed left for yet another other woman as soon as his divorce from cindy became final seven years of other women cindy thought now each woman younger and tar tier than the last a dozen at least a bakers dozen she thought feeling her jaw lock and then along came little fiona the freshest tart of all hell she was only eight years older than julia not even a tart for gods sake a cookie mom heather was asking hmm is everything all right mrs carver duncan reappeared at heathers side the towel had been replaced by a pair of fashionably faded blue jeans he slipped a navy tshirt over his stilldamp utterly hairless chest is something wrong you have a very strange look on your face shes thinking about my father julia announced wearily what i am not then why the rigor mortis smile cindy took a deep breath and tried to relax her mouth feeling it wobble precariously from side to side i thought you were in such a hurry to get in the shower its only eightthirty julia said as elvis began barking would someone like to go for a walk duncan asked the dog whose response was to run around in increasingly frantic circles and bark even louder lets go then boy duncan bounded down o j s the stairs elvis racing ahead of him as the phone in cindys bedroom began to ring if its sean im not here julia told her mother why would sean be calling on my line because i wont speak to him on mine why wont you speak to him because i broke up with him and he wont take no for an answer im not here julia insisted as the phone continued to ring what about you cindy asked her younger daughter playfully are you here why would i want to speak to sean be back in twenty minutes duncan called from the front door my best kid cindy thought entering her room and reaching for the phone on the night table beside her bed im not here julia repeated from the doorway hello its me the voice announced as cindy plopped down on the edge of her unmade bed a headache slowly gnawing at the base of her neck is it sean julia whispered its leigh cindy whispered back as julia rolled disappointed eyes toward the window overlooking the backyard outside the lateaugust sun created the illusion of peace and tranquility why are you whispering cindys sister asked youre not sick are you im fine how about you youre calling awfully early early for you maybe ive been up since six it was cindys turn to roll her eyes leigh had elevated sibling rivalry to a fine art if cindy had been up since seven oclock leigh had been up since five if cindy had a sore throat leigh had a sore throat and a fever if cindy had a million things to do that day leigh had a million and one this wedding is going to be the death of me leigh said you have no idea what planning a wedding this size is like no idea i thought everything was pretty much taken care of cindy knew that leigh had been planning her daughters wedding ever since bianca was five years old is there a problem our mother is driving me absolutely nuts cindy felt her headache spreading rapidly from the top of her spine to the bridge of her nose she tried picturing her sister who was three years younger two inches shorter and fifteen pounds heavier than she was but she couldnt remember the color of her hair last week it had been a deep chestnut brown the week before that an alarming carrot red whats she done now cindy asked reluctantly she doesnt like her dress so change it its too late to change it the damn dress is already made we have fittings this afternoon i need you to be there me you have to convince her the dress looks fabulous shell believe you besides dont you want to see heather and julia in their dresses cindys head snapped toward julia still watching from the doorway heather and julia have fittings this afternoon no way julia exclaimed im not going i hate that stupid dress four oclock and they cant be late leigh continued oblivious to julias rant im not wearing that godawful purple dress julia began pacing back and forth in the doorway i look like a giant grape the girls will be there cindy said pointedly watching her daughter throw her arms up into the air but im getting a really bad headache a headache please ive had a migraine for two days now look i have a zillion things to do ill see you at four oclock im not going julia said as cindy hung up the phone you have to go youre a bridesmaid im busy shes my sister then you wear the damn dress julia mother julia spun around on her heels and disappeared into the bathroom at the end of the hall slamming the door behind her flashback julia a chubby toddler her shirley temple curls framing dimpled chipmunk cheeks burrowing in against her mothers pregnant belly as cindy reads her a bedtime story julia age nine proudly displaying the fiberglass casts she wore after breaking both arms in a fall off her bicycle julia at thirteen already almost a head taller than her mother defiantly refusing to apologize for swearing at her sister julia the following year packing her clothes into the new louis vuitton suitcase her father had bought her then carrying it outside to his waiting bmw leaving her childhoodand her mother behind later cindy would wonder whether these images had been a premonition of disaster looming of calamity about to strike whether shed somehow suspected that the glimpse shed caught of julia disappearing behind the slammed bathroom door was the last she would see of her difficult daughter probably not how could she after all why would she it was far too early in the day to be mindful of the fact that great calamity like great evil often springs from the womb of the hopelessly mundane that defining moments rarely have meaning in the present and can be seen clearly only in retrospect and so the morning of the day julia went missing was rightly perceived by her mother as nothing more than one in a long string of such mornings their argument only the latest installment of their ongoing debate cindy thought little of it beyond that which was obvious her daughter was giving her a hard time what else was new julia mother checkmate two met this great guy cindy stared across the picnic table at her friend trish sinclair was all careless sophistication and ageless grace she shouldnt have been beautiful but she was her face full of sharp competing angles her modiglianilike features further exaggerated by the unnatural blackness of her hair hair that hung in dramatic swirls past bony shoulders toward the ample cleavage that peeked out over the top buttons of her bright yellow blouse youre married cindy reminded her not for me silly for you cindy lowered the back of her head to the top of her spine lifting her face to the sun and inhaling the faintest whiff of fall a month from now it would probably be too cool to be sitting on a picnic bench in a friends backyard in the middle of the day choosing what movies to see at this years festival while eating open faced tuna sandwiches and sipping glasses of chardonnay not interested let me tell you about him before you make any hasty decisions i thought we were here to discuss movies cindy looked to her friend meg for help meg taylor looking closer to fifteen than forty was as fair and flatchested as trish was dark and voluptuous she sat on the other end of the long picnic bench wearing cutoff jeans and a redandwhitestriped tank top seemingly engrossed in the dauntingly thick catalog for this years festival the new patricia rozema film sounds good she offered her voice small and crinkly like tin foil unraveling what page cindy asked gratefully eager to move on the last time trish had fixed her up just before julias move home had been an unmitigated disaster at the end of the relentlessly confrontational evening with the thrice divorced divorce attorney the man had leaned in for what cindy assumed was a conciliatory peck on the cheek then rammed his tongue so far down cindys throat shed had visions of having to call a plumber to get him out special presentation meg told her page cindy quickly flipped through the pages of her festival catalog elegantly shot and finely performed meg read from the notes what is finally so impressive about rozemas new work isnt she the one who makes films about lesbians trish interrupted is she meg asked cindys eyes traveled back and forth between her two closest friends cindy and meg had been inseparable since the eleventh grade cindy and trish had bonded after colliding at the clinique counter at holts ten years ago mansfield park wasnt about lesbians cindy said thinking that neither woman had changed substantially over the years it had lesbian overtones trish said mansfield park is by jane austen meg reminded her it had definite overtones your point being i dont want any lesbians this year you dont want any lesbians j im tired of lesbians we saw enough films about lesbians last year cindy laughed you have a quota on lesbians does that include gays meg grabbed a green apple from a nearby basket and took a loud bite yes trish pushed a thick layer of dark bangs away from her forehead adjusted the heartshaped diamond pendant at her throat im tired of them too well there go half the movies cindy took a sip of wine held it inside her mouth feeling the lateaugust sun warm against her cheeks every year for the last six years the three women had gathered in megs backyard to eat drink and select from the hundreds of movies being previewed at the annual toronto international film festival another year had come and gone another festival was upon them not much had changed in the interim except julia had come home which meant everything had changed youd really like him trish said suddenly shifting gears although it was obvious by the way she leaned into the table that shed only been biding her time waiting for her next opportunity to reintroduce the subject hes bright funny goodlooking cindy watched a parade of clouds float past her line of vision several wisps breaking free to drape themselves across the sky like cobwebs not interested she said again his name is neil macfarlane and hes bills new accountant we had dinner with him last night and hes to die for i swear youll love him whats he look like meg asked tall slim really cute how about the winds of changer cindy proposed ignoring her two friends page trish groaned as the women flipped to the appropriate page yikes meg said almost choking on the apple she was chewing are you kidding an iranian film have you forgotten caravan to heaven was that the one where the camel got stuck in the sand and it took three hours to get him out trish winced at the memory thats the one so much for iran what about france cindy asked all they do in french movies is talk and eat meg said sometimes they have sex trish told her they talk during sex meg said so france is out cindy looked from meg to trish then back again how about this one night crawlers page its swedish do we have a problem with sweden meg lifted the thick heavy catalog into her hands and read out loud as if shed been called on in class the film has a gritty feel for the seedy side of suburban life uncompromising and hold it trish interrupted what did we decide uncompromising means well cindy said lets see if we can remember the code lyrical means slow meg answered visually stunning means boring as hell trish said uncompromising means trish and meg exchanged knowing glances handheld camera they agreed good okay cindy said so we dont want lyrical visually stunning or uncompromising and weve eliminated gays lesbians and iran dont forget france lets not be too hasty about france cindy pleaded what about germany no sense of humor hong kong too violent meg said canada the women stared at each other blankly how about the new movie by michael kinsolving cindy asked page isnt he a bit passe he could use a hit thats for sure again meg lifted the heavy tome into the air and read aloud fresh stylish contemporary edgy she lowered the catalog back to the picnic table took another bite of her apple edgy is a bit troublesome it could be a code word for lowlife julia had an audition with michael kinsolving this morning cindy said really howd it go i dont know cindy pulled her cell phone out of her leopardprint purse pressed in julias home number then listened as it rang once twice three times she was about to hang up when she heard julias breathy whisper in her ear this is julia the recorded message began with seductive grace im so sorry i cant answer your call at the moment but i wouldnt want to miss a thing you have to say so please leave a message after the beep and ill get back to you as soon as i can or you can reach me on my cell at thanks so much and have a great day cindy hung up quickly called julias cell phone its your mother sweetie she said when confronted by the same message just phoning to see how your audition went call me if you get the chance otherwise ill see you at four oclock she added unable to stop herself whats at four oclock meg asked as cindy tucked her phone back inside her purse fittings for bridesmaids dresses ugh trish said i remember being a bridesmaid at my sisters wedding she had the ugliest dresses youve ever seen pink taffeta of all things can you picture me in pink i love pink meg said i was so embarrassed i just wanted to crawl in a hole and die and of course the marriage didnt last which to this day i blame on the dresses did you have bridesmaids when you married gordon she asked meg eight meg said flatly in pink taffeta cindy laughed at both the memory and the look on trishs face i was one of them she looks fabulous in pink taffeta meg said laughing now as well strains of beethovens ninth suddenly filled the air my phone cindy announced reaching back into her purse probably julia she lifted the phone to her ear i gave him your number trish said quickly what i gave neil macfarlane your number hello a large male voice pushed its way out of the small phone in cindys hand hello is anybody there i cant believe you gave someone my number without asking me first cindy hissed holding the phone tight against her chest hes really cute trish said by way of explanation hello the voice asked again im sorry hello cindy said fighting the urge to throw the phone at her friends head cindy neil cindy asked in return he laughed trish obviously told you id be calling cindy glared at trish who was pouring herself another glass of wine what can i do for you neil im afraid i already have an accountant be nice trish whispered in that case neil said easily maybe youd let me take you out to dinner one night dinner just because youre mad at me dont take it out on him trish said when exactly did you have in mind cindy heard herself ask how about tonight tonight hes really cute trish said her voice a plea tonight is fine cindy said giving in as trish squealed with delight and meg jumped up and down with girlish excitement when and where the pasta bar seven oclock ill meet you there cindy flung the phone back into her purse then confronted her friend whose always broad smile now stretched from one side of her face to the other i cant believe you did that to me oh relax youll have a wonderful time i havent had a date in over a year then its about time wouldnt you say i wont know what to talk about dont worry youll think of something i havent a clue what to wear something stylish trish said something sexy meg said oh sure something stylish and sexy i havent had sex in what three years trish and meg said in unison cindy laughed you probably told him that didnt you are you kidding i tell everyone trish poured cindy a full glass of wine raised her own glass in a toast to great movies great wine and great sex meg took another bite of her apple this is so french dont you think i cant believe she did that to me cindy muttered as she waited for the light at the corner of balmoral and avenue road to change i cant believe she gave him my number she shook her head growing impatient and running across the busy thoroughfare at the first break in the traffic i cantbelieve i said id go whats the matter with me she could hear elvis barking as soon as her toe hit the sidewalk even though her house was at the far end of the street that meant no one was home and the dog had probably peed on the hall rug a favorite new protest spot for being left alone for more than thirty minutes shed tried locking him in the kitchen but he always found a way out hed even figured out how to unlock the large wire crate cindy had purchased and that now sat empty in the garage cindy chuckled he was julias dog all right a slight breeze whispered through the lush green leaves crowding the branches of the large maple trees lining the beautiful wide street in the heart of the city cindy and tom had purchased the old brownbrick home near the corner of balmoral and poplar plains only months before tom moved out and shed kept it as part of their divorce settlement in return tom got to keep the oceanfront condo in florida and the lakeside cottage in muskoka which was fine with cindy whod always considered herself a city girl at heart it was one of the reasons she loved toronto and had loved it from the moment her father had relocated the family here from the suburbs of detroit just after her thirteenth birthday at first shed been apprehensive about moving to a new city a new countryits always snowing up there the people only speak french stand absolutely still if you see a bearbut within days all such fears had been dispelled by the pleasant reality that was toronto more than the interesting architecture the diverse neighborhoods the plethora of art galleries trendy boutiques and theaters what cindy loved most about the city was the fact that people actually lived there that they didnt just work there during the day only to disappear into distant suburbs at night the entire downtown core was residential stately old mansions with backyard swimming pools shared the same streets as towering new office buildings and everything was only minutes away from a subway linethe subways clean the streets safe the people polite if admittedly more reserved than their neighbors to the south a city of over three million peoplefive million if you counted the surrounding areasand there were rarely more than fifty murders a year amazing cindy thought now stretching her arms into the air hugging the city to her breast forgiving even the summer humidity that sent spasms through her already curly hair after her father died cindys mother had briefly considered moving back to detroit where her brother and sister still lived but her daughters by then both married and with families of their own had talked her out of it in truth norma appleton hadnt needed much persuading within months shed sold the old family home on wembley avenue and moved into a brandnew condominium on prince arthur only a block north of the shopping mecca that was bloor street and less than a fiveminute drive from either of her children we should have let her move back to detroit leigh had lamented on more than one occasion shes driving me nuts you take her too seriously dont let her get to you easy for you to say youre the one who can do no wrong i do plenty wrong you dont have to tell me a laugh escaped cindys mouth and skipped down the empty street it always surprised cindy that her mother and sister were so often at odds when in fact they were so much alikea little of each went a long way cindy checked her watch it was almost three oclock shed have just enough time to walk the dog and change out of her shorts before heading over to marcels for the fittings then shed have to race back home and shower and change for her stupid date with neil macfarlane and she still had no idea what she was going to wear she didnt have any clothes that were both stylish and sexy whatever had possessed her to say yes did she need this kind of stress in her life she crossed her fingers said a silent prayer that juliawould be at the fitting promptly at four oclock it was amazing she thought how much time and energy she expended fretting over her older daughter when julia was living with her father cindy had worried about her every minute of every day was she eating properly getting to bed on time doing her homework was she safe was she happy did the child cry herself to sleep every night as cindy often did regretful of the choice shed made did she wish she was home with her mother and sister where she knew in her heart she belonged was it misguided pride that kept her with her father year after stubborn year it seemed that even in her absence julia had taken up a disproportionate amount of space in the house on balmoral avenue missing julia had become a steady part of cindys life a persistent ache in the pit of her stomach an ulcer that refused to heal even after julia decided to move back home a slight movement caught cindys eye and she turned her head toward her nextdoor neighbors house faith sellick a new mother at age thirtyone was rocking back and forth on the top of her front steps her long brown hair uncombed and all but covering her face faith cindy cautiously approached her neighbors front path watched as the normally friendly and outgoing young woman slowly raised her head from her knees tears streaking a face that was round and pretty and totally void of expression faith whats going on are you all right faith glanced over her shoulder toward the house then back again at cindy cindy saw that the front of the young womans white blouse was stained with the milk leaking from her swollen breasts creating quartersized circles in the thin fabric whats the matter faith wheres the baby faith stared at cindy with sad dull eyes cindy looked past the young woman straining to detect sounds of life from the interior of the house but the only thing she heard was elvis barking next door a thousand thoughts rushed through cindys mind that faith and her husband had had a terrible fight that hed walked out on her and the baby that something horrible had happened to kyle the couples twomonthold son that faith had come outside to get a breath of fresh air and inadvertently locked herself out except none of that explained the blankness in faiths eyes and why she was staring at cindy as if shed never seen her before in her life faith whats the matter talk to me faith said nothing faith wheres kyle has something happened to kyle faith stared at the house fresh tears falling the length of her cheeks in the next instant cindy vaulted past the young woman and into her house she took the stairs two at a time racing toward the nursery and pushing open the door her breath stabbing at her chest like a hunting knife tears stung her eyes as she threw herself toward the crib terrified of what she might see the baby was lying on his back in the middle of crisp blueandwhite gingham sheets he was wearing a yellow sleeper and a matching yellow cap his beautiful face as smooth and round as his mothers his perfect lips settled into a perfect pout red little fists curled into tight little balls tiny knuckles white was he breathing cindy edged closer to the crib and leaned her body over the side bar pressing her cheek to the babys mouth and breathing in his wondrous infant scent gently she touched her cool lips to his warm chest holding her breath until she felt his body shudder with the effort of a single deep breath and then another and another thank god cindy whispered feeling the infants forehead with her lips to make sure he wasnt feverish then straightening up and backing slowly out of the room her legs wobbling as she closed the door behind her having to remind herself to breathe thank god youre okay faith was still sitting on the top of the outside landing swaying rhythmically from side to side as if mimicking the branches of the maple tree in the middle of her front lawn when cindy stepped back outside sat down beside her faith faith said nothing continued rocking from side to side faith whats wrong im sorry faith said so quietly cindy wasnt sure shed heard her at all why are you sorry did something happen faith looked quizzical no then whats the matter what are you doing out here is the baby crying no hes sound asleep faith ran unsteady hands across her breasts hes probably hungry hes asleep cindy repeated im a terrible mother no youre not youre a wonderful mother cindy assured her truthfully recalling faiths excitement when shed knocked on cindys door to announce her pregnancy how sweetly shed asked for any advice cindy could give her how wonderfully gentle and patient she was with the baby i think we should go inside faith offered no resistance as cindy helped her to her feet the top of her head in line with cindys chin cindy guided her through the large front foyer into the rectangularshaped living room at the back of the house a powder blue sweater lay on the hardwood floor next to the baby grand piano and faith reached down to scoop it up pushing her hands roughly through the sleeves and quickly securing its three white buttons then she sank down into the green velvet sofa and leaned her head against the pillows whats ryans number at work ryans at work faith said yes i know i need his phone number faith stared blankly at the pale green wall ahead its okay ill find it you stay here lie down faith smiled and obediently lifted her feet off the floor bringing her knees to her chest cindy quickly located ryans work number from the bulletin board by the kitchen phone and punched in the correct numbers it was answered on the first ring ryan sellick the man said instead of hello ryan cindy enunciated clearly this is cindy carver i think you need to come home three youre late im sorry i got here as fast as i could i said four oclock leigh reminded her sister square red nails tapping on the gold band of her watch for emphasis then pushing newly streaked hair away from a face that was pinched with incipient hysteria the impatience in her hazel eyes was underlined in heavy black pencil and mascara sat like tiny lumps of coal on her lashes anxiety draped across her shoulders like a wellworn shawl its almost fourthirty she said marcel has to leave at five im really sorry cindy looked from her sister to the short curlyhaired man in tight brown leather pants who was conferring with his assistant in a far corner of the long cluttered room there was a problem with my nextdoor neighbor shes acting very strangely im afraid things just kind of got away from me they always do leigh said whats that supposed to mean look youre here now lets not make a big deal out of it cindy took a deep breath silently counting to ten if you hadnt picked a dressmaker whose shop is halfway out of the city i might have been able to get here on time she wanted to say if you hadnt scheduled the damn fittings for the height of rush hour traffic i might not have been so late besides youre the one making the big deal out of it not me instead she said so hows it going so far as expected leigh lowered her voice to a whisper mother is driving me nuts what are you whispering about a womans gravelly voice called from one of the dressing rooms at the back of the shop cindy spun around absorbing the details of the small dressmaking salon in a single glance the wide front window the bare white walls lined with racks of silk and satin gowns in varying stages of completion bolts of bright fabric carpeting the floor and occupying the only two chairs in the room a full length mirror in one corner three appropriately angled mirrors in another another room at the back crowded with assorted tables sewing machines and ironing boards cindy sidled up to a rack of more casual suits and dresses that was pushed off to one side wondering whether she might find something on it that was sufficiently stylish and sexy for her date with neil macfarlane cindys here leigh called to her mother hi dear her mothers disembodied voice sang out hi mom hows the dress you tell me cindy watched her normally vivacious seventytwoyearold mother push open the heavy white curtain that served as her dressing room door and frown uncertainly her fingers pulling at the sides of the magenta satin gown tell her she looks beautiful leigh whispered behind cupped fingers pretending to be scratching her nose what did your sister say she said you look beautiful cindy told her what do you think naturally leigh said under her breath what i think doesnt count whats your sister muttering about now im right here mother you dont have to ask cindy i think you look beautiful cindy said genuinely agreeing with her sisters assessment and reaching out to pat her mothers fashionable blond bob norma appleton made a dismissive gesture with her mouth well of course you girls would stick together whats the problem youre having with the dress mom cindy asked spotting a short red cocktail dress on the rack of more casual offerings wondering if it was her size i dont like the neckline her mother tugged at the offending area its too plain the neckline might be too lowcut cindy thought noting the daring bodice of the short red dress she didnt want to give neil macfarlane the wrong idea did she hes really cute trish whispered in her ear ive already explained to mother a million times im right here you know norma appleton said you can talk to me ive already told you a zillion times that marcel will be adding beading along the top cindy mentally discarded the short red dress her eyes moving down the rack to a long shapeless beige linen sack definitely not she decided picturing herself lost inside its voluminous folds she didnt want neil macfarlane to think he was dating a nun did she you havent had sex in three years i hate beading her mother was saying since when do you hate beading ive always hated beading what about a jacket cindy suggested trying to still the voices in her head maybe marcel could make up something in lost z lace she glanced imploringly at marcel who promptly left his assistants side to join them in the center of the room a lace jacket is a lovely idea her mother agreed i thought you didnt like lace leigh said ive always liked lace the last time shed had sex cindy recalled shed been wearing a lace peignoir the mans name was alan and theyd met when he came into megs shop to buy a pair of crystalandturquoise earrings for his sisters birthday cindy found out that he didnt have a sister when his wife came by the following week to exchange the earrings for something subtler by then of course it was too late the peignoir had been purchased the deed had been done what do you think marcel cindy asked now her voice unnaturally loud the poor man took a step back glancing anxiously at cindys mother trying not to fixate on the deep creases her fingers were inflicting on the delicate satin of his design without hesitation marcel reached for the tape measure that circled his neck like a scarf whatever you desire whatever you desire cindy repeated silently savoring the sound how long had it been since anyone had offered her whatever she desired would neil macfarlane hes to die for i swear youll love him did i hear you say something about problems with a neighbor her mother asked lifting her arms to allow marcel to measure their length yes cindy said grateful for the chance to get her mind on something else you remember the sellicks from next door they had a baby a few months ago she asked as if she werent sure i think she might have postpartum depression i had that leigh said you had hemorrhoids her mother said marcel winced wrapped the tape measure across norma appletons expansive bosom joy field in i had postpartum depression with both jeffrey and bianca i dont remember that of course not now if i were cindy cindy never had postpartum depression and speaking of bianca cindy interjected just where is the beautiful bridetobe she looked around the salon realizing for the first time that neither her niece nor her daughters were anywhere in sight they got tired of waiting and went to starbucks heather looks so beautiful in her dress norma appleton said and the bride mother leigh asked pointedly how does bianca look in her gown or doesnt she rate a mention what are you talking about i said she looked beautiful no you didnt i most certainly did what about julia cindy interrupted julia leigh scoffed julia has yet to honor us with her presence she isnt here yet im sure things just got away from her leigh said forcing a smile i said i was sorry cindy reached into her purse for her cell phone she had an audition maybe she had to wait what kind of audition her mother turned around so that marcel could measure her back for michael kinsolving the director hes in town for the film festival cindy pressed in her daughters number listened to the telephone ring you and that stupid festival leigh said dismissively isnt michael kinsolving dating cameron diaz their mother asked or maybe its drew barrymore ever since charlies angels i cant keep the two of them straight anyway i hear he has quite a reputation with the ladies oh for heavens sake mother leigh exclaimed impatiently how would you know anything about this michael whoeverthe hellheis her mother pulled her shoulders back with just enough righteous indignation to cause marcel to lose his balance and drop his tape measure i read about him in people magazine michael kinsolving is a very important director cindy said as julias breathy voice caressed her ear im so sorry i cant answer your call at the moment the recording whispered seductively cindy immediately hung up dialed julias cell phone listened to the same breathy message he hasnt had a hit in a long time their mother said knowingly apparentlyhes some sort of sex addict i believe thats michael douglas marcel piped up enthusiastically regaining his footing and retrieving the tape measure from the floor really before he married catherine zetajones are we actually having this conversation leigh threw her hands into the air in frustration whats your problem dear her mother asked my problem leigh began as little beads of perspiration began breaking out across her forehead causing her newly streaked bangs to curl in several awkward directions is that my daughters wedding is less than two months away and nobody seems to give a good goddamn that time is running out and theres still tons of stuff to do itll all work out dear her mother tugged at the long taffeta skirt doesnt there seem to be an awful lot of material here it makes me look very hippy shes not answering cindy returned the phone to her purse and stared at the front door as if willing julia to walk through shes forty minutes late maybe she got lost lost leigh asked incredulously she gets on the subway at st clair she gets off at finch how could she possibly get lost maybe she missed her stop you know julia sometimes she gets distracted julias never had a distracted moment in her life she knows exactly what shes doing at all times whats that supposed to mean leigh why dont you show us your dress their mother suggested yes cindy agreed wearily mom says its wonderful mom hasnt seen it good try her mother whispered to cindy as leigh retreated to the dressing rooms at the back of the shop shaking her head and muttering to herself youve got to say something to your sister darling shes driving me nuts cindy caught her reflection in one panel of the threesectioned fulllength mirror and advanced steadily toward it horrified by what she saw but unable to turn away as if shed stumbled across the scene of an accident when did i get so ugly she wandered hypnotized by the creases clustered around her large eyes and small mouth staring at them until her stilldelicate features blurred then disappeared altogether leaving only the telltale lines of middle age she squinted trying to find the young woman shed once been remembering that at one time shed been considered beautiful like julia when was the last time a man had told her she was beautiful cindy wondered now backing away from the mirror and pushing a bolt of fabric off one of the chairs she sat down her head heavy with conflicting emotions impatience with her sister anger at her older daughter curiosity about neil macfarlane was he really as smart funny and goodlooking as trish claimed and if so why would he be interested in a fortytwoyearold woman with lessthanperky breasts and a collapsing rear end undoubtedly such a prize catch could have his pick of any number of perfect young females eager to make his acquaintance certainly tom had considered the choice a nobrainer cindy checked her watch almost four fortyfive already by the time she finished up here and got home assuming she wasnt a raving lunatic and was still capable of handling an automobile shed be lucky if thered be enough time to shower and change let alone make sure there was something in the house for the kids to eat she sighed thinking that heather and duncan could order in a pizza and remembering that julia had mentioned she might be having dinner with her father was that where she was ta dum leigh announced pulling back the dressing room curtain and appearing before her mother and startled sister in yards of pink taffeta this is not happening cindy thought she opened her mouth to speak but no words emerged of course im planning to lose ten pounds before the wedding so itll be tighter here leigh pulled at the tucks at her waistline and here she flattened the taffeta across her hips it made a swishing sound so what do you think she lifted her hands into the air above her head did a slow turn around i wouldnt do that dear norma appleton pointed to the underside of her daughters arms do what your hi helens her mother said grimacing my what your hi helens her mother repeated with a point of her chin what are you talking about what is she talking about leigh demanded of cindy remember auntie molly cindy asked reluctantly of course i remember auntie molly remember she had this friend helen who lived across the street i dont remember any helen anyway cindy continued bracing herself for the explosion she knew would follow whenever auntie molly saw helen she used to wave to her and say hi helen hi helen and the skin under her arms would jiggle and so mom started referring to that part of the arm as the hi helens what hi helen her mother said waving to an invisible woman on the other side of the room hi helen youre saying my arms jiggle everybodys arms jiggle cindy offered yours dont her mother said no cindys arms are perfect leigh agreed angrily pacing back and forth in front of her mother and sister thats because cindy has time to go to the gym five times a week i dont go to the gym five times a week because cindy only has to go to work when she feels like it thats not true i work three afternoons a week so she has lots of time to do things like go to the gym and the film festival and whats this problem you have with the film festival i dont have any problem with it in fact id dearly love to spend ten days doing nothing but running from one movie to the next i love movies as much as you do you know then why dont you go because i have responsibilities because i have four kids and a husband to look after your daughters getting married your sons are in college and your husband can take care of himself as if youd know anything about taking care of husbands leigh said then blanched visibly i didnt mean that cindy nodded unable to find her voice this is all your fault leigh accused her mother you and your damn hi helens you take things much too seriously her mother said you always did besides thats no excuse for being mean to your sister leigh acknowledged her guilt with a bow of her head im really very sorry cindy please forgive me youre under a lot of stress cindy acknowledged trying to be generous trust me you have no idea leigh hugged her arms to her sides kept them absolutely still its been one disaster after another the hotel double booked the ballroom which took days to get straightened out the florist says lilacs are out of the question for october who has lilacs in october their mother asked my future inlaws havent offered to pay for a thing and now jason has decided he wants a reggae band instead of the trio we hired hes the groom cindy reminded her sister hes an idiot leigh shot back as the front door opened whos an idiot leighs daughter bianca marched into the store followed by cindys daughter heather two steps behind cindy smiled at the two denimclad young women standing before her like leigh twentytwoyearold bianca was slightly overweight the extra weight concentrated mostly in her hips which made her appear shorter than she actually was also like her mother biancas eyes were hazel her mouth full her smile wide snapshots sixyearold cindy dressed in a wonder woman costume on halloween smiling shyly at the camera while threeyearold leigh naked except for an awkward black mask mugs outrageously in the background thirteenyearold cindy and tenyearold leigh standing on either side of their mother in front of their new house on wembley avenue leighs right hand stretched behind her mother her fingers raised above cindys head like donkey ears mother and teenage daughters sitting on alarge rock at the edge of lake joseph cindy squinting into the sun leighs face hidden in the shadows hi aunt cindy hi sweetheart whos an idiot bianca asked again leigh shrugged off her daughters question pretended to be busy with the folds of her gown hi mom heather greeted cindy with a kiss on the cheek hi darling i hear youre a knockout in your dress sorry i missed it im sure therell be other opportunities heather said with a wink julia here yet of course she isnt here leigh answered before cindy had the chance you look nice heather told her aunt leigh raised one hand to her head fiddled girlishly with her hair before dropping her arm selfconsciously back to her side massaging the flesh above her elbow is your arm hurt heather asked let me try julia one more time again cindy retrieved her phone from her purse quickly punching in julias cell phone number again she heard the breathy voice the fake regret im so sorry i cant answer your call at the moment where are you julia she wondered feeling her sisters angry eyes burning holes in the back of her blue blouse julia its almost five oclock cindy said evenly where the hell are you four t h a h e first time julia disappeared she was four years old cindy had taken the girls to a nearby park and was busy pushing heather on a swing when she realized that julia was no longer among the children playing in the sandbox shed spent the next twenty minutes running around in increasingly frantic circles accosting strangers and shouting at hapless passersby ive lost my little girl please has anyone seen my daughter cindy had run home to call the police heather slung across her shoulder like an old purse only to find julia sitting on the front steps what took you so long the child demanded ive been waiting for you was julia somewhere waiting for her now cindy wondered entering her bedroom and walking past her younger daughter who lay sprawled across cindys king size bed watching television elvis beside her what on earth are you watching cindy asked mesmerized by the sight of a staggeringly wellendowed young woman with big hair and a tiny white bikini rubbing great gobs of green finger paint over the expansive chest of a muscular young man the young man was grinning so hard his face looked as if it might explode cindy inched back picturing white teeth spraying toward the pale blue walls of her bedroom like confetti its called blind date how appropriate cindy thought sitting down on the end of her bed trying not to think of the night ahead what are they doing getting to know each other heather deadpanned i guess some people will do anything to get on tv cindy found herself thinking of julia despite her best efforts not to she was still angry that her older daughter hadnt shown up for her fitting that she hadnt so much as called to offer an excuse get down elvis cindy said sharply transferring her anger at her daughter to her daughters dog elvis looked at her with sleepy brown eyes sighed deeply and rolled over on his side the second time julia had disappeared was less than a year after the first this time cindy had put heather in bed for her afternoon nap and come downstairs to find the front door open and julia gone cindy had torn the house apart looking for her then raced up and down the block screaming out her daughters name when shed returned to the house her phone was ringing it was tom julias here hed said simply a smile lurking behind his words apparently julia had grown impatient with her mother and walked the twelve blocks to her fathers office you took too long with heather julia scolded her mother when tom brought her home had julia grown impatient with her mother yet again cindy wondered pushing herself to her feet and walking toward her closet you see the premise of this show heather was explaining is that they fix two people up and then send them off to the beach or rock climbing or something like that for the afternoon and then later they go out for an intimate dinner where was julia why hadnt she phoned and at the end of the date heather continued they each tell the camera whether or not theyd go out with that person a second time based on a deep spiritual connection no doubt cindy said snapping back into the present her eyes scanning the line of wooden hangers in her closet for something that could conceivably pass for stylish and sexy there isnt a damn thing julia would be able to put together something she thought what i said i have nothing to wear me neither can we go shopping tomorrow cindy rifled through her pantsuits dismissing one as too heavy one as too lightweight another as too formal for a first date although it looked like something an accountant might like she finally settled on a pair of gray linen slacks and a loosefitting white blouse at least they were clean oh wow you wont believe what theyre doing now heather cried her voice a mixture of shock and delight mom youve got to get out here and see this cindy bolted from the closet in time to see the toothy muscle man aim a flowing water hose down the bottom half of his companions minuscule bikini while the bighaired bigbreasted bimbo squealed with delight how can you watch this garbage are you kidding its great then noticing the clothes in her mothers hands what are you doing are you going out the latter question carried just a trace of indignation i wont be late where are you going just out for dinner i wont be late so you said who are you going to dinner with no one special what does that mean heather sat up on the bed crossed her legs balanced her chin in the palms of her hands her radar on full alert it doesnt mean anything youre being very evasive youre being very nosy youre being obstinate shed told julia this morning youre being anal im just curious heather was saying you always ask me where im going thats because im your mother do you have a date heather pressed you do dont you with who with whom cindy corrected i thought you were majoring in english with whom are you going out mother heather asked in julias voice the word mother snapping at cindy like an elastic band cindy shook her head in defeat his name is neil macfarlane hes trishs accountant is he cute cindy shrugged irish says he is youve never seen him cindy blushed so this is like a blind date heather asked with exaggerated flourish vocally capitalizing the last two words and pointing toward the tv screen with both hands you ever been part of a threesome the grinning romeo was asking his giggling juliet while handfeeding her lobster then licking at the butter that dripped from her chin oh my cindy said is that what youre going to wear heather indicated the clothes in her mother hands cindy held the blouse up under her chin what do you think you might want to go with something a little more lowcut you know make more of an impression i think this is exactly the impression i want to make wheres duncan cindy asked suddenly realizing she hadnt seen duncan since they got home heather feigned indifference shrugged leaned back on her elbows dont know you dont thats unusual heather shot her mother a look no its not were not joined at the hip you know you two have a fight its no big deal cindy could tell from her daughters tone that it was a subject best not pursued besides if heather and duncan were fighting she really didnt want to know the details in truth she already knew way too much about their relationship that was the problem with sleeping down the hall from your daughter and her livein boyfriend you heard every whisper every playful sigh every enthusiastic squeak of the bed could you do me a favor cindy said with a smile waiting for her daughter to ask what then continuing when she didnt could you call your father for me why find out if julias having dinner over there why dont you call i dont want to cindy admitted why not because im asking you to call heather groaned what kind of answer is that heather please ill call when the show is over when is that another fifteen minutes we connected on an intellectual level the bimbo was telling the camera then youll call your dad julias fine you know she told you she wasnt coming to the fitting i dont know what youre so worried about im not worried then you dont think she could have gotten lost do you lost heather demanded in her aunts voice the last time julia disappeared cindy remembered she was thirteen years old cindy was still reeling from her fathers sudden death from a heart attack two months earlier tom was away on a business trip with his latest paramour and heather was singing a solo with her school choir that night julia was supposed to be home in time to accompany her mother to the concert but by seven oclock she still wasnt back cindy spent the next hour calling all julias friends checking with neighbors driving up and down the rainsoaked streets shed tried reaching tom in montreal but he wasnt at his hotel finally at nine oclock distraught and unsure what to do next shed driven to the school to pick up heather only to find a defiant julia comforting her sister i told you id meet you in the auditorium julia chastised her mother dont you listen had julia told her of her plans this morning cindy wondered now throwing her clothes on the bed and walking into the bathroom was this mixup all her fault had she not been listening look at me she moaned i look awful you dont look awful heather called from the bedroom im short five six isnt short my hairs a mess cindy pulled at her loose brown curls your hair is not a mess heather appeared in the bathroom doorway mom whats wrong wrong arent i the one whos supposed to be whining about her appearance and you the one reassuring me with quaint motherly platitudes cindy smiled heather was right when had their roles suddenly reversed youre probably just nervous about your date its not a date cindy corrected and im not nervous she turned on the tap began rigorously scrubbing her face shouldnt use soap her daughter advised stilling her mothers hand and reaching into the medicine cabinet for a jar of moisturizing cleanser i mean you buy all this stuff why dont you use it its too much work i cant be bothered try this heather instructed then this she pulled an assortment of bottles off the shelf of the crowded cabinet and spread them across the cherrywood counter then ill do your makeup and speaking of makeup whats with auntie leigh and the tammy faye baker eyes im hoping its a phase lets hope its over by the wedding the phone rang its about time cindy marched back into her bedroom grabbed for the phone hello she said eagerly waiting for julias voice cindy its leigh her sister announced as if she knew theyd been speaking about her i just want to apologize again for what i said earlierabout you spending all your time at the movies and not knowing how to take care of a husband oh cindy said flatly that i was out of line yeah cindy agreed you were anyway im sorry apology accepted its just this wedding and mom of course of course the pressure is nonstop sometimes i get a little overwhelmed cindy nodded into the receiver her sister sighed i wish i had your life she said cindy laughed as she hung up the phone whats funny heather asked my sisters idea of an apology cindy stared at the tv a second young woman whose dark bikini matched her ebony skin was climbing into a hot tub with a baldheaded tattoocovered man who looked like a black mr clean whats she sorry for heather asked thats just the point she isnt cindy shook her head trying to remember the last time shed felt close to her younger sister memory eightyearold leigh shadowing cindys every move following her from room to room as if glued to her side why does she have to do everything the same as me cindy protests pushing leigh aside the same as i her mother corrects besides imitation is the sincerest form of flattery i hate her i hate her too leigh echoes youll love each other when you grow up their mother promises did they cindy wondered now watching as mr clean explained his various tattoos to his curious companion she and leigh were so different they had different interests different styles different tastes in clothes in politics in men try as they might and occasionally they really did try they never quite seemed to connect their empathy was forced their sympathy strained they tolerated each other sometimes just barely strangely enough their relationship had been at its best just after cindy got married and again just after she got divorced when cindy eloped with tom to niagara falls without a word to anyone it had been leigh whod convinced their parents to get over their anger and accept the young man cindy had chosen leigh had been a regular guest at their tiny apartment a coconspirator after the fact after tom walked out taking julia with him leigh had been equally supportive dropping over dinners going grocery shopping for her distraught sister offering to babysit heather for months shed called first thing every morning and again before she went to bed shed made sure cindy had the best divorce lawyer in the city shed literally clapped her hands when cindys settlement guaranteed her security for life leighs own marriage to a high school principal had always seemed happy enough warren was a kind man patient to a fault and he seemed to genuinely love his wife warren would never cheat on me leigh had said on more than one occasion and cindy had nodded her agreement confident in the tightness of her sisters assessment pretending not to hear the silent addendum the way tom cheated on you mom heather was asking now whats the matter why are you smiling like that cindy unclenched her teeth just this stupid tv show she flicked off the remote control watching mr clean and his companion disappear into darkness hey call your father for me please cindy added when her daughter failed to respond heather slumped toward the phone i dont understand why you cant call him i dont want to speak to the cookie cindy muttered what just call him heather punched in the numbers shifting her weight from one foot to the other as she waited for someone to answer the phone hey fiona she said while cindy scrunched up her nose as if shed just smelled something unpleasant its heather im fine how are you cindy walked back into the bathroom stuck out her tongue at her reflection im just fine she said in the cookies chirpy little voice right as rain happy as a lark peachy perfect is my sister there cindy grabbed a brush dragged it through her hair listened for the answer is she expected there for dinner so julia wasnt there at least not yet ask her if shes heard from her cindy instructed her daughter returning to the bedroom the brush dangling from her hair have you heard from her heather asked dutifully then shook her head in her mothers direction okay well if you do heather continued over her mothers continued prompting have her call home okay yeah everythings fine i just want to speak to her okay yeah bye she hung up the phone julias not there heather shrugged her indifference shes fine mom it would be nice if she phoned thats all how come you call fiona a cookie cindy shrugged pulling roughly at the brush in her hair feeling the handle break off in her hand oh thats just great ill do it slowly gently heather extricated the head of the brush from her mothers hair then she slid it back into the handle and began tenderly manipulating cindys soft curls youll see im going to make you absolutely gorgeous for your date tonight its not a date i know its not i probably shouldnt even be going l s tdont be silly ill be fine here by myself its julia im worried about heather stopped her gentle ministrations thats it youre done heather nodded returning the brush to her mothers hands you dont need me she said i s tfive so how do you know trish cindy tucked her hair behind her right ear less from necessity and more because it gave her something to do with her hands she straightened the cutlery on the white tablecloth although it was already perfectly straight and refolded the burgundycolored napkin in her lap then she tucked the hair behind her right ear a second time and stared out the long window behind neil macfarlanes head watching the blue slowly leak from the sky bathing the expansive panorama in muted gray soon it would be dark she thought mindful that the days were getting shorter hold that thought she told herself save it for when the conversation runs dry for when the small talk gets so tiny it threatens to disappear altogether isnt that why she stopped dating in the first place why she vowed never to subject herself to the single scenes unpleasant vagaries again or was it because the men had simply stopped calling we met about ten years ago at one of the makeup counters in holts we actually walked right into one another reaching for the same bottle of moisturizing cream cindy continued unable to stop the unexpected torrent of words we were both in a hurry it was during the film festival and we didnt have much time between films the man across the table nodded i understand trish is quite the movie fan yes we both are of course the most logical followup would be for her to ask and you do you like movies too but she didnt because such a question would imply she was interested in whether neil macfarlane liked movies or not and she was determined not to be interested in anything about neil macfarlane at all so instead cindy scratched at the back of her neck and reached for the bread basket although she merely shifted it a little to the left before returning her hands to her lap she didnt want to fill up on bread she didnt want to get bread crumbs all over her white blouse and gray linen pants she didnt want the waiter approaching with one of those frightening little gadgets they employed to clean the tables of assorted debris each roll offering a silent rebuke for being such a sloppy eater all she wanted was to finish her dinner assuming the waiter ever came by to take their order drink her wine assuming the wine steward could locate the expensive bordeaux neil had ordered and get the hell out of the restaurant and home to julia assuming her older daughter had finally decided to put in an appearance where was she anyway at the very least why hadnt she called cindy rifled through her purse and checked that her cell phone was on everything all right neil asked fine cindy smiled careful to avoid the intense scrutiny of his eyes eyes shed noticed immediately that were an amazing shade of blue somewhere between teal and turquoise with a sparkle no less as if it had been dabbed on with silver paint trish hadnt been exaggerating neil macfarlane was cute all right more than cute he was dropdead gorgeous cindy had decided immediately that the less she looked at him the better off shed be first impressions a man tall and slender wavy brown hair atop a boyish face waits for her at the bottom of the elegant open red mahogany staircase the city stretched out tantalizingly behind him in the long expanse of glass he smiles deep dimples creasing his cheeks as she warily approaches and the city blurs behind him he is wearing a blue shirt that underlines the fierce blue of his eyes his hands are warm as they reach for hers his voice is soft as he speaks her name cindy he says with the quiet confidence of someone who is used to being right neil she asks in return feeling instantly foolish who else would he be already she feels inadequate so what kinds of movies do you like neil was asking as the wine steward approached the table proudly displaying the requested bottle for neils perusal looks fine neil told him although his eyes never strayed from cindy cindy in turn focused all her attention on the wine steward watching as he slowly and expertly began the process of removing the cork from the bottle i like all movies she said vaguely disappointed when the cork put up no real resistance sliding out of the bottle with ease the steward offered the cork to neil who dutifully sniffed at it and nodded his approval then tasted the sampling the steward poured into his glass fine he said excellent it just needs a few minutes to breathe neil advised her i know how it feels cindy thought but didnt say watching as the steward filled her glass just short of halfway so you have no preferences at all neil was asking what was the matter with him cindy wondered impatiently why did he insist on making conversation he didnt really give a damn what kinds of movies she liked or how she and trish had met or anything about her for that matter and if he did it was only because he wanted to sleep with her and he knew his chances would be greatly improved if he at least feigned an interest in her although why he would want to sleep with her was a total mystery look at him for heavens sake cindy thought deliberately looking at the floor on any given night he undoubtedly had his choice of any number of much more attractive much fitter much younger women why would he want to sleep with her that was easy she decided he wanted to sleep with her because she was here it was as simple as that it didnt mean anything it doesnt mean anything how many times had tom told her exactly that cindy raised her head stared directly into neil macfarlanes brilliant blue eyes i like sex and violence she stated honestly the first time shed admitted that to anyone what you asked what kind of movies i like i like sex and violence she repeated reaching for her wineglass taking a long sip feeling the wine slightly abrasive as it scratched against her throat he was right it needed a few more minutes to breathe cindy tossed her hair back took another sip you look shocked neil smiled the dimples framing his mouth like quotation marks i understand liking sex but blood and guts not blood and guts so much cindy countered feeling the wine curl into her stomach like a contented cat in a wicker basket i dont like watching people get blown up ad nauseum i guess what i like is more the threat of violence the possibility that something terrible is about to happen womeninjeopardy neil said matteroffactly nodding as if he understood as if he already understood everything there was to know about her as if there was nothing more to discover i hate that term cindy said stronger than shed intended womenmjeopardy she repeated taking another sip of wine emboldened its condescending you never hear people say menin jeopardy and i mean isnt that what drama is all about people in jeopardy why is it somehow less valid when it concerns women im really sick of that attitude whoa she thought where had that come from neil leaned back lifted his hands in the air in a gesture of surrender cindy braced herself for his comeback some smart remark that would put her in her place reduce her to the role of angry manhating feminist instead he said youre right im right she thought relief washing over her like an unexpected shower she tapped her heart with her open palm i dont think anybodys ever said that to me before he laughed i guess ive just never really thought about it but now that ido i see your pointall drama is about people in peril at a time in their lives when theyre at risk when they have to take a chance make key decisions get out of sticky situations save themselves the term womenin jeopardy is condescending youre absolutely right cindy smiled he must really want to sleep with me she thought did trish tell you i havent had sex in three years the words were out of her mouth before she could stop them neils hand froze as he reached for his glass i dont think she mentioned that no slowly carefully he brought the glass to his lips then took a long sip of wine holding it in his mouth almost as if he were afraid to swallow you think its breathed long enough cindy asked enjoying his discomfort he gulped it down exhaled deeply definitely breathed long enough the waiter approached and asked if theyd reached a decision about their order neil grabbed for his menu forgot what i wanted he said sheepishly blue eyes quickly scanning the nights offerings i guess ill just have the special the calves liver sounds wonderful cindy said thinking how nice it felt to be in control for a change when was the last time shed felt in control of anything and id like the endive and pear salad to start suddenly she felt ravenous ill start with the calamari neil said good choice the waiter told him before departing with the menus what was the matter with my choice cindy wondered feeling oddly slighted her power already deflating what was the matter with her what on earth had possessed her to tell a virtual stranger she hadnt had sex in three years trishs accountant for gods sake what he must think of her have you noticed the days are getting shorter she asked a bit desperately neil looked toward the windows that embraced the east and south walls of the tony restaurant i guess they are he looked back at cindy the look in his eyes a mixture of bemused curiosity and wary anticipation as if he were slightly afraid of what she might say next but was looking forward to it just the same so tell me all about the joys of accounting are there any i like to think so neil answered his voice a smile theres something very satisfying about numbers how so numbers are what they are theyre very straightforward unlike people cindy nodded her agreement i cant imagine you have much trouble with people neil shrugged lifted his glass in a toast to people cindy clicked her glass against his avoided his eyes so i guess you were always really good at math right right i was horrible in math it was my worst subject english was my worst my best cindy said there was a moments silence can we go back to talking about sex now neil asked and cindy laughed in spite of her desire not to can we just forget i said anything about that that might be difficult can we try absolutely another moment of silence look im obviously not very good at this at what this whole scene dating you know what makes you say that well im not exactly a sparkling conversationalist on the contrary you sure got my attention again cindy laughed yeah well sex is a cheap way to get someones attention not always so cheap cindy quickly finished off the wine in her glass so what did trish tell you about me neil sat back in his chair gave the question several seconds thought she said that you were bright beautiful and extremely picky when it came to men which is a nice way of saying i havent had sex in three years cindy heard herself say before throwing her hand over her mouth god whats the matter with me you havent had sex in three years neil answered with a sly smile a wave of heat spread across cindys face and neck like a sunburn she felt all eyes staring at her maybe i should just make a general announcement hell i think there are some people in the far corner over there who might not know why havent you had sex in three years are you really that picky when it comes to men prickly is probably a better word cindy admitted men dont like angry women and youre an angry woman apparently ive always had trouble dealing with your anger her exhusband had told her you okay neil asked yes why i dont know you just got this funny little look on your face im fine cindy said i mean other than the fact that i feel like a total idiot im fine i think youre charming im having a great time you are arent you cindy laughed actually yes i am good have some more wine he filled both their glasses then clicked his glass against hers to angry women cindy smiled to brave men memory toms voice on the answering machine hi its me look theres no easy way to say this so ill just come right out with it im leaving actually ive already left call me a coward and a few other choice words im sure youll think of but i just thought it was better if we didnt speak in person you know ive always had trouble dealing with your anger anyway im at the four seasons hotel call me when you stop swearing so trish tells me you work in hazelton lanes neil was saying yes a friend of mine owns this neat little jewelry store i help her out three afternoons a week how long have you been doing that about seven years since your divorce trish told you about that she said youve been divorced seven years this was the part of dating cindy liked least the emotional resume where you were expected to trot out your dirty laundry and bare your soul vent your frustrations recount your pain and hope for a sympathetic ear but cindy had no interest in trotting baring venting and recounting and shed long since given up on hope she took a deep breath okay im going to get this over with as quickly as possible so listen carefully my husband walked out on me seven years ago for another woman which was no huge surprise since hed been cheating on me for years what was surprising was that my older daughter chose to go with him although i probably shouldnt have been so surprised because she was always her fathers little princess anyway cindy continued glancing toward the phone in her purse my settlement ensured i didnt have to worry about finding a job which was good because i only had a high school education having eloped when i was eighteen still with me hanging onto every word after i got married i worked at eatons for a couple of years selling towels and bedding and exciting stuff like that helping put my ex through law school pretty standard stuff and then i got pregnant and i quit work to stay home with julia and then two years later heather came along something for which julia never quite forgave me cindy strained to keep her voice light witness her decision to go live with her father but you saw her didnt you weekends holidays she was a teenager i saw her whenever she could fit me into her busy schedule which wasnt too often cindy felt her stomach cramp at the memory that must have been very difficult for you it was awful i felt as if someone had ripped my guts out i cried every day couldnt sleep wondering what id done wrong sometimes i could barely get out of bed i honestly thought id lose my mind thats when meg my friend offered me a job working at her little boutique at first i said no but eventually i decided i had to do something and its been great i work three afternoons a week i take off whenever i feel like it and to top it off my daughters come back again cindy glanced toward her purse do you keep her in there neil asked cindy smiled sorry its just that she was supposed to call anyway sorry about unloading on you like that can we do us both a favor and never mention my exhusband or my divorce again ill drink to that they clicked glasses your turn cindy leaned back in her chair sipped on her wine family history in fifty words or less he laughed well i was married for how long fifteen years and youve been divorced for how long im not divorced oh my wife died four years ago oh im so sorry she woke up one morning said she wasnt feeling quite right and six weeks later she was dead ovarian cancer how awful trish didnt tell me i doubt she has any idea ive only known her a short time and all she asked me was whether i was married and if id be interested in going out with her friend cindy shook her head and you poor man said yes i said yes do you have children a son max hes seventeen great kid cindy tried picturing julia at seventeen but the years between fourteen and twentyone had pretty much melted together in cindys mind like chocolates left too long in the sun all those years lost years she could never get back the waiter was suddenly standing beside them endive and pear salad for the lady he announced as if she might have forgotten calamari for the gentleman he put the dishes on the table enjoy thank you cindy lifted her fork stabbing it into her salad as she stole another glance at the phone in her purse hi mom sorry about not calling earlier but ive had the most incredible day but cindys phone remained stubbornly silent and julia remained as ever tantalizingly out of reach six the phone rang at just after am cutting through cindys sleep like a dull blade she flung her arm toward the sound knocking the back of her hand against the night table beside her bed and crying out in pain as she groped for the receiver hello she said barely recognizing the sound of her own voice i understand youve lost your daughter the caller said instantly cindy was wide awake her body rigid her feet on the floor poised to run who is this it doesnt matter who i am what matters is i found her cindys eyes shot through the darkness to the window as if julia might have been spirited through the slats of the california shutters and was now hidden among the leaves of the red maple trees in the backyard her heart pounded loudly against her ears like a restless ocean surf where is she how is she you should take better care of your children the caller scolded please can you just tell me where she is you know what they say dont you finders keepers what losers weepers who are you what have you done with julia i have to go now wait dont hang up please dont hang up cindy felt the line go dead in her hands as if julia herself had just died in her arms no no mom a frightened voice called from the doorway mom whats the matter cindy spun around the blankets falling from her naked body as she jumped from the bed her pupils dilating with disbelief as she absorbed the identity of the person walking toward her julia youre here youre all right shethrew her arms around her daughter wrapped her in a smothering embrace i was having the most awful nightmare it was so real but youre okay youre okay she kissed julias cheek and forehead felt julias skin grow colder with each brush of her lips my poor baby youre freezing come get into bed whats the matter darling are you sick cindy maneuvered her daughter into her bed julias body going limp as she lay back against the pillow her blond hair floating around her face like seaweed in a shallow lake everythings okay now sweetheart mommys here ill take care of you julia stared at her mother through cold dead eyes she spoke without moving her lips this is all your fault she said cindy screamed and then suddenly someone was at her side touching her shoulder stroking her arm mom mom whats the matter mom wake up wake up and then something wet on her cheek a rhythmic thumping at the side of the bed cindy opened her eyes saw heather trembling beside her the moonlight through the bedroom shutters drawing a series of broad horizontal stripes across her face elvis was on his hind legs at the side of the bed his eager tongue extending toward her face his tail slapping enthusiastically at the sideboard whats happening you tell me are you all right somewhere behind heather something stirred cindy arched forward strained through the darkness past her younger child is someone there julia is that you its me mrs carver duncan replied joining heather and elvis at cindys side he was wearing only the bottom half of a pair of blueandwhitestriped pajamas heather was wearing its matching top oh cindy quickly pulled the covers up around her chin my robe she said motioning vaguely toward the foot of the bed heather reached for the greenandnavy terrycloth robe draped it across her mothers shoulders you must have been having a nightmare cindy stared blankly toward the foot of the bed the details of her dream already receding bursting like bubbles against the night air evaporating taking julia away a nightmare yes it was awful you want some warm milk or something heather asked i can make you a cup cindy shook her head is julia home even in the dark cindy could see the frown on her younger daughters face her doors closed duncan volunteered its always closed heather reminded him you want me to check ill do it cindy secured her robe around her and climbed out of bed you two go back to bed get some sleep its late she followed them out of the room and into the wide hall stopping with them in front of julias door elvis licking at her bare toes her fingers stretched toward the doorknob shes gonna be real mad if you wake her up heather warned shes going to be really angry cindy corrected silently too tired to say the words out loud she felt the doorknob twist in her palm heard the loud creak as she pushed open julias door cindy poked her head inside the room her eyes straining through the darkness toward the bed it was empty cindy knew it instantly even before elvis went charging past her and began wrestling with the stuffed animals propped against julias pillows heather ran after him stubbing her toes on several of the cds scattered across the blue carpet and swearing loudly shit she cried as cindy flipped on the overhead light good thing julias not here duncan observed wryly as elvis began barking where the hell is she cindy surveyed the mess that was her daughters room discarded clothes lay scattered across the floor on the bookshelves lining one wall on the walnut desk propped against another and over the back of the black leather chair in front of it a hot pink minidress was draped across the top of the white shutters a pair of outrageously highheeled sandals hung from their straps on a bedpost shes probably at dads heather said shooing elvis off julias bed then why hasnt she called because shes julia heather reminded her mother then maybe shes with sean i thought they broke up so heather asked cindy nodded wondering whether she could call sean at this hour of the morning dont even think about it heather warned as if reading her o mothers mind shes fine mom stop worrying you can bet shes not worrying about you youre right cindy said trying not to picture julia lying bleeding and alone in some ditch at the side of a dark road or worse you never said how your date went tonight heather stared at her mother expectedly it wasnt a date yeah okay so the question is did you connect on a deep intellectual and spiritual level cindy pictured neils wondrous dimples when he laughed felt the touch of his skin as his hand repeatedly brushed up against her arm as he walked her home tasted his sweet breath as he leaned in to kiss her cheek good night we connected so therell be a second non date well see cindy kissed heathers forehead patted duncans bare arm get some sleep you too heather said come on elvis elvis immediately spread himself across cindys feet refused to move looks like hes sleeping with you tonight heather said following duncaninto their bedroom and closing the door great elvis rolled over onto his back offered his stomach to be rubbed come on you nut lets go to bed elvis flipped back onto his feet took two steps then stopped sat down and stared back at julias room as if he too were confused by her absence shes fine cindy told him as elvis cocked his head to one side attentively except that im going to kill her when she gets home she shuffled toward her room plopped down on her bed then lay down on top of her covers elvis immediately jumped on the bed and burrowed in against the inside of her knees cindy turned on one side elvis snuggled closer i dont think this is going to work cindy told the dog after several minutes spent in a futile effort to get comfortable i guess im just not used to sharing my space anymore sorry about that she sat up flipped on the light beside her bed reached for the phone dont even think about it she heard heather say but it was too late already cindys fingers were punching in the numbers she hadnt realized she knew by heart the voice that answered the phone on its fourth ring was wary and weighted with sleep hello cindy pictured the young woman sitting up in bed pushing lush red ringlets away from her kewpiedoll face the strap of an expensive pink silk peignoir slipping down one milkwhite shoulder full bosom heaving fetchingly in the soft moonlight a book cover cindy thought picturing it in her mind romance for cookies fiona cindy said imagining tom sitting up beside his young wife playful fingers sliding the errant strap back over her shoulder its cindy its two oclock in the morning cindy i know what time it is is something wrong is julia there julia no whats going on cindy heard tom grumble shes your exwife you ask her the cookie said as cindy pictured her flopping back on her pillow and covering her eyes with a disinterested hand cindy what the hells going on its after two oclock cindy felt her throat constrict as it always did when she was forced to actually speak to her former husband fiona has already told me the time and im sorry to bother you at this hour i really am but julias not home and i havent heard from her all day and i just wondered if youd spoken to her there was a long pause not since around tenthirty this morning she didnt call you after her audition no and youre not worried cindy heard the growing panic in her voice why would i be worried cindy recognized the oncefamiliar tone his lawyers voice i dont have time for your petty insecurities it said i dont demand that my daughter check in with me every minute of the day and night neither do i you have to let go cindy tom said tears stung cindys eyes how can i let go of something i never had she thought or youll drive her away again i didnt drive her away cindy thought bitterly you drove her away in your goddamn bmw shes probably with sean cindy nodded dont even think of calling him now tom said cindy hung up without saying good night bastard she whispered as if afraid he could still hear her she remained motionless in her bed for several seconds elvis pressing against her side what about you she asked the dog you think im overly protective you think ive driven her away again in response elvis jumped off the bed and ran to the bedroom door then stopped and looked back as if expecting her to follow i dont think you understand the dog began pacing restlessly back and forth in the doorway what you have to go out elvis barked ssh okay okay ill take you out cindy tightened the sash of her terrycloth bathrobe and slid her feet into a pair of well worn white slippers stomping down the stairs to the front door i cant believe im doing this you better have to pee thats all i can say she opened the door to the cool night air and stepped onto the front landing elvis immediately took off down the front steps and disappeared elvis wait where are you going a sudden blur raced across her front lawn cutting through the bushes that separated her property from her nextdoor neighbors elvis get back here i cant believe this her slippers flopping noisily around her feet like rubber flippers cindy inched her way down the front steps elvis get back here youre a very bad dog oh sure she thought thatll get him back here in a hurry youre a really good dog elvis she said trying again come to mommy except she wasnt his mommy julia was his mommy which made her elviss grandmother dear god she wailed its okay cindy hes over here a voice announced from somewhere beside her cindy gasped her head snapping toward the sound sorry i didnt mean to scare you the voice was coming from beyond the bushes its me ryan cindy kicked off her slippers and pushed herself through the bushes several branches slapping against her face as she stepped onto ryan sellicks front lawn the damp grass creeping between her bare toes ryan was sitting on his top step in much the same position his wife faith had occupied earlier in the day light from two brass lanterns hanging to either side of the front door illuminated his fine features the long straight nose the thin lips the sculpted cheekbones the slight cleft in his chin dark hair fell across his forehead and over the back collar of his shirt a shirt that was either black or brown as were his eyes julia had always considered him terribly handsome cindy remembered as she approached seeing elvis with his head resting comfortably in ryans lap contently licking at the crisp denim of ryans jeans she noticed ryans feet were as bare as her own and that there was a long fresh scratch beneath his right eye that hadnt been there earlier in the day im sorry to bother you cindy remained at the foot of the outside steps not wanting to intrude any further into his privacy elvis get down here hes fine ryan stroked behind the dogs ears actually im grateful for the company are you okay couldnt sleep cindy nodded hows faith he shrugged as if he werent sure how to answer the question my sister had postpartum depression cindy offered with two of her children really and what happened cindy struggled to remember but like her mother she actually had no recollection of leigh having suffered from any such affliction i guess it just went away with time thats pretty much what her doctor says will happen apparently its not all that uncommon so ive heard you never had it no i was lucky i guess cindy had sailed through both her pregnancies and their aftermath relishing the time when her daughters were infants despite the fact that julia had been coll icky and demanding from the moment of her birth heather on the other hand had slept through the night at ten weeks settled into a threefeedingsaday schedule the week after that and potty trained herself at thirteen months cindy sat down on the bottom step and stared down the quiet street half expecting to see her older daughter emerge from the shadows of the streetlamps has the doctor recommended any medication he prescribed valium but it doesnt seem to be doing much good maybe she needs something stronger maybe she needs to talk to a psychiatrist maybe ryan sellick massaged the bridge of his nose as if trying to keep a budding headache at bay what about faiths mother any chance she could help out for a few weeks her mothers been back and forth from vancouver several times already i cant expect her to keep flying over every time theres a problem and my parents are both dead so what about hiring a nanny faith wont hear of it what kind of mother cant take care of her own child she says whenever i so much as mention the idea ryan shook his head gingerly patting the deep scratch beneath his eye i dont know what to do i cant keep taking time off work thats for sure i didnt get to the office today till almost noon and then i had to leave again when you called maybe i could drop by a few times a week cindy suggested no i couldnt put you to that much trouble its no trouble cindy assured him and ill talk to heather and julia see if theyd be willing to babysit occasionally ryan laughed an unexpectedly hearty sound whats funny he shook his head julia just doesnt strike me as the babysitting type cindy had to agree i didnt realize you knew my daughter so well its all in the way she walks nobody struts a street quite like julia cindy watched julias image step out of the shadows and walk toward them head high shoulders rotating in time with her hips arms swinging at her sides she moves as if a camera is following her cindy thought recording her every move everything all right at home ryan asked what was he talking about what do you mean well julia and heathers boyfriend ive forgotten his name duncan yeah duncan they were going at it pretty good this morning they were fighting in the driveway i heard the yelling from inside my house he motioned toward the dining room to the left of the front door it must have been when i was out shopping for chardonnay cindy thought recalling todays lunch with genuine nostalgia already it seemed so long ago why would julia have been fighting with duncan and why hadnt he mentioned their argument to her earlier why hadnt heather what time was that a little before eleven i think so julia had been fighting with duncan just before shed had to leave for her appointment maybe the argument had upset her caused her to blow the most important audition of her career maybe thats why she hadnt come home because she was too angry and embarrassed and upset damn that duncan anyway cindy thought pushing herself to her feet she should never have allowed him to move into her house i should get home let you get some sleep she said come on elvis partys over surprisingly the dog immediately jumped to his feet and followed after her thanks for being such a good neighbor ryan called as cindy reached the sidewalk in front of the house cindy waited while elvis relieved himself against the side of a tall maple tree everythings going to work out fine youll see confidence radiated from her voice and it was only later when she was lying in her bed wide awake at nearly am julia still not home that cindy wondered who it was shed been trying so hard to convince seven at precisely seventhirty the next morning cindy phoned sean banack sean this is julias mother she said instead of hello is julia there what the sleepy voice was raspy with cigarettes and alcohol im sorry what he said again its cindy carver julias mother cindy repeated picturing sean banack slowly propping himself up on one elbow in the middle of rumpled white sheets his free hand pushing long blond hair away from his forehead then rubbing at tired brown eyes she wondered if julia was stretched out beside him im not here she could almost hear her daughter whisper before flipping onto her other side and covering her head with a pillow mrs carver sean asked as if he still wasnt sure who she was im sorry to be calling so early but i need to speak to julia julias not here please sean this is really important shes not here he repeated stubbornly do you know where she is sean made a sound halfway between a laugh and a cry im very sorry mrs carver but julia is no longer my problem what does that mean it means we broke up it means i dont have a clue where she is it means its seventhirty in the morning and i didnt get to bed till after three which means im still a little drunk and ive got to get some sleep sean cindy cried before he could disconnect please julia didnt come home last night and im very worried if you have any idea at all where she might be sorry mrs carver sean said before hanging up the phone im not the one you should be speaking to what do you mean who should i cindy stared at the dead phone in her hands for several long seconds before dropping it back into its carriage great just great elvis stirred beside her then jumped from the bed stared at her expectantly what does that mean im not the one you should be speaking to she asked the dog who cocked his head from side to side as if carefully considering his response then he ran to the bedroom door and barked thats all you have to say elvis barked again and began digging at the carpet i know i know you have to go out give me a minute okay elvis promptly sat down patiently waiting as cindy showered and slipped into a pair of jeans and an old orange tshirt did julia come home while i was in the shower she asked the dog as he dutifully followed her into julias empty room cindy glanced toward the closed door of the bedroom heather shared with duncan it bothered her that neither of them had said anything about duncans fight with julia a fight so acrimonious it had spilled from the house to the street so loud it had attracted the attention of their nextdoor neighbor she thought of storming into their room and demanding an explanation but decided such confrontations were better left till she got back from walking the dog perhaps by that time julia would be home come on boy cindy attached elviss leash to his collar and grabbed a plastic bag from the kitchen it was only after shed stepped outside and closed the front door behind her that she realized shed forgotten her key at least now she had an excuse for having to wake everyone up early where are you julia cindy asked the sundappled street listening to the whir of cars already clogging avenue road avenue road she repeated silently turning in the opposite direction and waiting as elvis relieved himself on a neighbors front lawn what a strange thing to call a street almost as if the city council had run out of names where are you julia she repeated stopping again while elvis left his mark on a newly planted strip of grass she turned left on poplar plains and proceeded south letting elvis lead the way it was going to be a beautiful day she thought feeling the sun warm on her arms the slightest of breezes teasing the leaves on the trees a week from now the university of torontos fall semester would be getting under way and heather and duncan would be back in class cindy would be sitting in a crowded movie theater with hundreds of other avid film devotees and julia julia would be where where was she now where are you julia cindy asked again tugging on elviss leash when he stopped too long at the corner of poplar plains and clarendon picking up the pace as they turned the corner onto edmund hurry up and do your stuff cindy instructed amazed when the dog immediately squatted leaving a large steaming deposit in the middle of the sidewalk cindy held her breath as she scooped the dog poop into the clear plastic bag good boy she said all my children should listen so well she thought what had sean meant when he said julia was no longer his problem clearly he was upset about their breakup but hed sounded so bitter im not the one you should be speaking to what did that mean exactly whom should she be speaking to damn it julia where are you cindy nodded hello to a heavyset man who was skipping rope in front of a mustardyellow apartment building on the other side of the street even from this distance she could see he was sweating profusely and she wondered if such intense exercise was good for him she checked her watch it was a little past eight oclock maybe thats where julia wasat an earlymorning exercise class yes that was it shed probably met up with a group of friends after her audition and theyd spent the afternoon together gone out for a dinner of sushi and wine then partied until it was too late to call home when she woke up shed gone directly to her yoga class there was nothing to worry about nothing awful had happened julia hadnt been hurt molested kidnapped murdered dismembered her body parts hurled into the middle of lake ontario she was perfectly fine and shed be back within the hour to shower and blowdry her hair razorstraight for the undoubtedly busy day ahead she hadnt called because she simply wasnt used to reporting her whereabouts to her mother her father had never demanded that shehow was it he so sensitively put itcheck in with him every minute of the day and night i hope youre picking up after your dog a woman called from a nearby apartment window cindy waved the plastic bag full of poop above her head what do you think this is she snapped a purse the woman quickly retreated lowering her window with a loud bang so many angry people cindy thought proceeding up avenue road dropping the plastic bag into a garbage bin already overflowing with them she turned west on balmoral heading for home ive always had trouble dealing with you ranger she heard tom say as she ran up the steps and banged on her front door i dont understand how you could leave the house without your keys heather scolded her mother yawning as she poured herself a large bowl of cinnamon toast crunch and plopped down at the kitchen table burying her face in the morning paper you didnt tell me duncan and julia had a fight yesterday cindy said in return it was no big deal big enough to concern several of the neighbors cindy embellished really who thats not the issue there is no issue what was the fight about nothing heather shrugged tossed the front section of the globe and mail onto the round pine table you know julia and you know what julia and duncan were fighting about tell me heather lowered the paper and released a deep breath of air looking imploringly toward the doorway as if hoping duncan would miraculously appear but the shower was still running and it was unlikely duncan would be down for a while it was nothing really her highness was running late as usual and she wanted a ride to her audition when duncan said he was going in the opposite direction and didnt have time to chauffeur her around she got angry and started yelling she even followed him to his car cindy silently berated herself for not having been home to drive her daughter to her audition would it have killed him to give her a lift would it kill her to get her drivers license how can anyone fail that stupid test three times cindy had occasionally wondered the same thing but not even the sight of julias mesmerizingly long legs had been enough to influence the instructors decision thats not the point the point is that not everyones life revolves around julia stop worrying mom shes fine then where is she why hasnt she called cindy braced herself for her daughters careless shrug but surprisingly none came did you check with dad cindy nodded and sean he says julia is no longer his problem he hinted she might be seeing someone else really you have no idea who that might be no but then im not exactly julias main confidante you could ask lindsey lindsey lindseyjulias latest greatest best friend ever she met her last month the one with the enormous implants a huge bosom balancing precariously atop a skinny torso flashed before cindyseyes the implants wafted into the air like two heliumfilled balloons blocking the young womans face do you know her number its probably in julias address book several minutes later cindy was in julias bedroom guiltily rummaging through her things but if julia had an address book shed taken it with her cindy looked under every piece of clothing searched through every drawer amid a sea of debris she found a crumpled fivedollar bill a sweater shed been looking for all winter and several packets of condoms but no address book did it matter she couldnt remember lindseys last name cindy slapped angrily at her thighs what kind of mother doesnt know the names of her daughters friends im absolutely positive shes okay heather said when cindy returned to the kitchen but maybe you should call the hospitals she added quietly just in case cindy spent the next hour calling every hospital in the city she started with the downtown hospitalsmount sinai the toronto hospital womens college the western st mikes even the hospital for sick children and then she branched out calling sunnybrook north york general humber memorial and even scarborough they all told her the same thing no one named julia carver was registered as a patient no one fitting her description had been brought into the emergency department in the last twentyfour hours she called the police asked whether thered been any accidents or incidents that might have involved her daughter but the answer was no and she hung up feeling relieved grateful and alarmed all at the same time she noted the time on the microwave oven it was ten oclock a full day had elapsed since shed seen julia cindy looked around the nowempty kitchen heather and duncan were upstairs engaged in a quiet but unmistakable argument theyd tried to pretend nothing was amiss but cindy could feel the tension between them was julia in any way responsible for that tension she found herself remembering how often she and tom had put on similar fronts smiling pleasantly for the children before retreating to their bedroom to unleash angry words between tightly gritted teeth their hostility all the more intense for being so zealously suppressed cindy reached for the phone punched in toms office number smiling tightly as she waited for his secretary to answer thomas carvers office the secretary chirped in her little girl voice although the woman was almost cindys age mr carver please cindy the secretary asked is that you irena cindy acknowledged amazed her voice was still recognizable after all this time how are you great run off my feet as usual havent heard from you in forever how are you doing im doing very well thank you cindy lied is he in she asked not sure exactly what to call her exhusband couldnt very well ask to speak to the shithead hes not hes in meetings most of the day and i dont think hes planning on coming back to the office being friday and the long weekend and everything you know cindy nodded although she didnt know when she and tom had been married one day was pretty much the same as the next thered been no such thing as a weekend let alone a long one he was always at the office as was irena will he be checking in this morning im sure he will could you please tell him to call me as soon as possible its very important is it anything i can help you with irena asked i dont think so cindy pictured the attractive middleaged woman leaning forward in her chair crossing one dimpled knee over the other and tucking her short blond hair behind her right ear shed known about irenas longstanding affair with her husband almost from its inception it wove in and around his other affairs like threads in a large tapestry cindy wondered ifit was still going on or whether it had ended with the cookies arrival thats the way the cookie crumbles she found herself thinking as she hung up the phone it rang immediately julia cindy felt her heart pounding against her chest the blood rushing to her ears no its trish just calling to see how last night went last night your date with neil macfarlane my date with neil cindy repeated trying to calm herself down it didnt go well no it went great details trish pressed with a girlish giggle i need details tell me everything trish can i call you later cindy implored im expecting an important call everything all right everythings fine there was a brief pause okay call me later cindy replaced the receiver glared at the phone why hadnt she told trish about julia damn it julia call me as if on cue the phone rang julia no me her sister said cindy felt her shoulders slump toward the floor leigh can i call you back later are you kidding your lines been busy all morning im not waiting around for you to fit me into your busy schedule its just that im expecting julia to call yeah and when she does would you tell her that i rescheduled her fitting for next wednesday at two oclock and that if she doesnt show up then theres no way marcel can have her dress ready on time which would mean she wont be in the wedding party ill tell her what was the point in saying anything else tell her biancas counting on her leigh said instead of goodbye as soon as cindy hung up the phone rang yet again hello julia its meg howd your date go last night l s tcindy felt her knees go weak she grabbed onto the side of a chair for support it was fine just fine great it was great was he as cute as trish claimed hes very cute cindy said are you okay you dont sound like yourself actually im not feeling so hot oh no you cant get sick now the festival starts next week im sure ill be fine well were not taking any chances dont come in this afternoon i can manage the store by myself would you mind terribly of course not just feel better cindy hung up the phone wondering why she hadnt told her two closest friends that julia hadnt come home last night that she hadnt seen or heard from her since yesterday morning shed been desperate to tell them but something had held her back what embarrassment shame fear fear of what exactly that if she spoke the words out loud they might come true and julia might be lost forever she thought of lindsey julias latest greatest best friend ever who was she anyway unlike both cindy and heather julia was always forming attachments that were as shortlived as they were intense men and women flitted around the circumference of julias life drifting in and out occasionally penetrating the inner circle but more likely succumbing to the force of gravity and falling unheralded off the everrolling curve some emerged unscathed grateful for the ride however brief some left resentful and angry nursing ugly wounds that refused to heal why hadnt she kept a closer vigil what kind of mother was she cindy crossed to the counter on the other side of the room holding her hands beneath her arms to keep them from shaking luckily there was still some coffee in the coffeemaker and she poured her self a cup it tasted bitter but she drank it anyway repeatedly glancing back at the phone silently begging julia to call assure her she was alive and well this is silly youre making yourself nuts cindy said out loud just calm down breathe deeply repeat after me there is nothing to worry about there is nothing to worry about the phone rang cindy lunged at it as if shed been shot from a canon hello julia neil macfarlane the voice announced cindy is that you cindy swallowed the threat of tears yes neil hello is this a bad time my daughter didnt come home last night she heard herself whimper im so scared ill be right over he said eight has she ever done anything like this before you mean stayed out all night neil nodded he was sitting beside cindy on one of two tan leather sofas in her living room behind them a wall of windows overlooked the spacious backyard facing them were three paintings of pears in varying degrees of ripeness cindy couldnt remember the name of the artist whod painted these pictures tom had bought them without asking either her opinion or approval make the money i make the decisions being pretty much the theme of their marriage along with the neverending parade of other women cindy thought smiling sadly at the goodlooking man perched on the opposite end of the couch and wondering if hed ever cheated on his wife she ran her hand across the sofas buttery surface fine italian leather guaranteed to last a lifetime unlike her marriage she thought the sofas had also been toms decision as was the checkered print of the two wing chairs sitting in front of the black marble fireplace why had she never bothered to change anything after he left had she been subconsciously waiting for him to return she shook her head trying to excise her former husband from her brain cindy neil was asking leaning forward extending his hands toward hers are you all right you have this very strange look on your face yes shes stayed out all night before cindy said answering his question wondering how long ago hed asked it but she always calls shes never not called except once just after she moved back home cindy recalled when she was making a point about being an adult and no longer answerable to her mother her father shed argued pointedly had never placed any such restrictions on her her mother cindy had countered needed to be assured of her safety it was a matter of consideration not constraint in reply julia had rolled her eyes and flounced out of the room but shed never stayed out all night again without first phoning home except one other time when she forgot cindy remembered but then shed called first thing the next morning and apologized profusely shouldnt you be at work she asked neil trying to prevent another example from springing to mind i take fridays off in the summer cindy vaguely recalled him having told her that last night look you dont have to stay i mean it was very thoughtful of you to come over and everything i really appreciate it but im sure you have plans for the long weekend i have no plans and julia should be home any minute now cindy continued ignoring the implications of his remark at which point im going to strangle her and everything will be back to normal she tried to laugh cried out instead oh god what if something terrible has happened to her nothing terrible has happened to her cindy stared at neil imploringly you promise i promise he said simply amazingly cindy felt better thank you neil reached over took her hands in his there was a sudden avalanche of footsteps on the stairs and heather bounded into view i heard the door is julia home cindy quickly extricated her hands from neils returned them primly to her lap who are you heather this is neil macfarlane the accountant heather advanced warily quick eyes absorbing neils black jeans and denim shirt neil this is my younger daughter heather neil stood up shook heathers hand nice to meet you heather heather nodded i thought maybe julia was back no cindy said heather swayed from one foot to the other duncan and i were just going to head down to queen street unless you need me for anything no honey im fine youre sure cause i can stay if you want no sweetheart you go ill be fine youll call me as soon as julia gets home cindy nodded looked anxiously toward the front door you know my cell number of course cindy pictured a series of numbers realized they were julias maybe youd better write it down heather walked into the kitchen im leaving it by the phone she called back as duncan came barreling down the stairs julia home he asked not yet he stared blankly at neil crossed one arm protectively over the other are you a cop cindy blanched why would he ask that hes an accountant heather said reentering the room we should go she guided duncan toward the front door remember to call me when julia gets home cindy nodded watching them leave do you think i should call the police if youre worried yes neil said its only been twentyfour hours thats long enough she thought of tom probably she should wait for him to return her call discuss the matter with him before she did anything rash i should probably wait a little longer have you checked with the place where julia had her audition to make sure she showed up i dont know who to contact cindy admitted i mean i know the audition was for michael kinsolving but hes probably just renting some space and i dont know the address or the phone number i dont know anything she wailed silently what kind of mother am i who doesnt know anything tom will know she said my exhusband julias father he arranged the audition hell know all the more reason to wait until she spoke to him before calling the police she acknowledged to herself neil walked to the fireplace lifted a plexiglas frame from the mantel is this julia cindy stared at the picture of julia that had been taken several days after her eighteenth birthday she was smiling showing a mouthful of perfect professionally straightened and whitened teeth elegant shoulders thrust proudly back in her new cream colored gucci leather jacket a present from her father diamond studs sparkled from each ear another present from daddy the night this picture was taken cindy had presented her daughter with a delicate necklace with her name spelled out in gold less than a month later julia had broken it while trying to pull a turtleneck sweater over her head i forgot i had it on shed announced nonchalantly returning the necklace to her mother to be fixed cindy dutifully had the necklace repaired only to have julia lose it a few weeks later thats an old picture cindy said now taking the photograph from neils hands and returning it to the mantel one finger lingering caressing her daughters cheek through the small square of glass shes a very beautiful girl yes she is like her mother the phone rang cindy raced to the kitchen tripping on the large sisal rug in the front hall banging her hip against the side of the kitchen door damn it she swore lifting the phone to her ear hello well damn it yourself her mother replied whats the matter darling forgot to put on your makeup cindy raised a hand to her bare cheek realized she had indeed forgotten to put on any makeup still neil had said she was beautiful she thought gratefully shaking her head as he approached signaling the caller wasnt julia im fine mom just a little busy at the moment can i call you back you dont have to bother im just checking in everything all right your sister said you sounded pissy and im afraid i have to agree with her cindy closed her eyes ran her free hand through her hair everythings fine mom ill call you later okay fine darling take care my mother cindy said hanging up the phone and immediately checking her voicemail to make sure no one else had called my sister told her i sounded pissy when she called earlier im sure she meant pithy neil offered cindy laughed thanks for coming over i really appreciate it i just wish there was something more i could do something clicked in cindys mind you can take me to see sean banack she announced suddenly who ill explain on the way cindy grabbed a piece of paper and scribbled a note for julia leaving it in the middle of the kitchen table in case her daughter should return while she was gone on the way out the door she called julias cell phone again and left another message thered been something in seans voice when shed talked to him earlier cindy thought replaying their conversation in her mind word for word something more than cigarettes and alcohol something more than fatigue and impatience and hurt feelings anger she realized hed sounded pissy is sean here he isnt the young man said standing in the doorway blocking cindys entrance to the small secondfloor apartment that was situated over an old variety store on the south side of dupont street near christie the man was tall and black with an athletic build and a shiny bald head a silver loop dangled from his left ear a set of earphones wrapped around his neck like a noose he was wearing a sleeveless white tshirt and black sweatpants and his left hand clutched a large plastic bottle of evian you must be paul cindy said pulling the name of seans roommate from the recesses of her subconscious she extended her hand gently pushing her way inside the stuffy nonair conditioned apartment neil following right behind the young man smiled warily and you are this is neil macfarlane and im cindy carver julias mother the expression on the young mans face altered ever so slightly nice to meet you mrs carver mr macfarlane excuse o j the mess he looked sheepishly toward the cluttered l of the livingdining room behind him cindys eyes followed his books and papers covered the light hardwood floor and brown corduroy sofa in the middle of the room a deeply scratched wooden door balancing on four short stacks of red bricks served as a coffee table several old copies of the toronto star lay stretched across the small dining room table like a linen tablecloth husband phoned wife after beheading her screamed an inside headline man stalked victim for three days before fatal attack announced another seans doing research on aberrant behavior paul explained following her eyes for a script hes writing cindy nodded remembering julia had once boasted that sean was writing a script especially for her as far as cindy knew sean had yet to find a producer for any of his efforts he supported himself by bar tending at fluid a popular downtown club has julia been around lately she asked straining to sound casual havent seen her since there was an uncomfortable pause you should probably talk to sean do you have any idea when hes coming back no i wasnt here when he went out do you mind if we wait cindy immediately plopped herself down on the sofa moving a wellthumbed copy of a paperback book to the cushion beside her the book was called mortal prey paul hesitated the thing is i have to be somewhere by noon and i was just gonna hop in the shower oh you go right ahead cindy instructed well be fine sean could be a while if hes not back by the time youre ready to leave well go all right i guess its all right the young man muttered under his breath perhaps sensing cindys determination and not wanting to make a scene i wont be long take your time as soon as cindy heard the shower running she was on her feet what are you doing neil asked where are you going the second question was by far the easier of the two to answer to seans room she said trying to decide which of the two rooms at the back of the apartment was his opening the first door she came to grateful when she saw a row of high school football trophies bearing seans name lined up in front of the open window posters from popular movies covered the walls spiderman invasion of the body snatchers from hell the texas chainsaw massacre cindy winced at the image of a horrifying leatherfaced figure brandishing a chainsaw in front of him like a giant phallus a helpless young woman secured to the wall behind him she remembered that movie hated herself now for enjoying it what was the matter with her that she liked such things i dont think this is such a good idea neil said his voice a strained whisper as he followed her inside the tiny bedroom probably not cindy admitted looking from the unmade bed to the water stained desk on the opposite wall an empty picture frame sat to one side of a bright blue imac in the middle of the desk a neat stack of blank paper was piled on the other what is it youre looking for i dont know cindy took a step back her ankle brushing up against the wastepaper basket on the floor her attention was immediately captured by the torn and crumpled remains of an eightbyten glossy she bent down and scooped the battered picture of her daughter into her shaking hands its julias most recent head shot she just had it taken a few weeks ago cindy tried vainly to iron out the creases of the blackandwhite photograph piece together the smile on her daughters face obviously sean had torn it from its frame in a fit of fury was it possible hed attacked her daughter in a similar rage maybe you should just leave it neil advised removing the picture from her trembling hands what else is in here cindy asked ignoring neils warning turning the wastepaper basket upside down and watching as scrap pieces of paper used tissues pencil shavings and a browning apple core tumbled toward the floor garbage garbage garbage she muttered her fingers loosening their grip on the white plastic container allowing it to slip from her hand she began pulling open the desk drawers poking around inside them there was nothing of consequence in the first drawer and she was just about to close the second when her fingers located something at the very back an envelope she realized pulling it out and opening it a small gasp escaping her lips what is it cindys mouth opened but no words emerged as her fingers flipped through a succession of small color photographs all of julia all in various stages of undress julia in a seethrough lavender bra and thong set julia wearing only the bottom half of a black string bikini her hands playfully covering obviously bare breasts julia in profile the curve of one naked breast visible beneath the crook of her elbow the top of her bare bottom rounding out of the frame julia wrapped provocatively in a bedsheet julia wearing high heels and a mans unbuttoned shirt and crooked tie why would she do this cindy wondered out loud showing the pictures to neil before tucking them into the pocket of her khaki cotton pants what was the matter with julia had she no common sense whatsoever cindy rifled through a few more items and was about to close the drawer when her eyes fell across a sheet of densely typed paper the dead girl she read by sean banack cindy pulled the piece of paper from the drawer and carried it over to the bed where she sank down her lips moving silently across the page as she read she stares up at him defiantly despite the fact her hands and feet are bound behind her naked body and she knows beyond any shadow of a doubt that he is going to kill her he should have taped her eyes shut as well as her mouth he thinks then he wouldnt have to see the look of contempt he knows so well but he wants her to see him he wants her to know whats coming to see the knives and other medieval instruments of torture spread out across the floor and understand what hell he has prepared for her he lifts the smallest yet sharpest of the knives into his hands cradles it delicately between his fingers fingers she claims are hopelessly inept fairy fingers she calls them to his face a faggots hands he draws a fine line down the taut flesh of her inner arm her eyes widen as she watches a thin red streak wind its way across the whiteness of her skin slowly he lifts a second knife into the air in a graceful arc then plunges it into her side careful to keep the blade a safe distance from her vital organs making sure the thrust isnt hard enough to kill her because what would be the fun in that over so soon so quick before hes had a chance to really enjoy himself before shes had a chance to fully suffer for her sins and she must suffer as he has suffered for so long what are you doing let go of me shed yelled when he pulled up beside her then bundled her into the trunk of his car she this spoiled child of privilege who claimed nosebleeds anywhere north of highway is about to bleed to death in an abandoned shed just south of the king side road in the middle of bloody nowhere serves you right bitch he says slicing at her legs before throwing her on her back pushing the largest of the knives between her thighs green eyes widen in alarm as the knife slides higher cuts deeper not laughing now are you bitch wheres all that defiance now with his free hand he grabs another knife slashes at her breasts her blood is everywhere on her on him on the floor on his clothes in his eyes beneath his fingernails his faggot fingernails he thinks rejoicing as he plunges the knife deep inside her then savagely rips the duct tape away from her mouth so that he can hear her final screams oh dear god cindy cried rocking back and forth neil extricated the paper from cindys hands what is it no please no it was then she heard the noise from somewhere beside them whats going on in here paul asked from the doorway mrs carver what are you doing in here cindy scrambled to her feet lunged at the startled young man naked except for the white towel wrapped around his waist wheres my daughter what have you done with her paul took a step back clutching the towel at his hips i dont know honestly i have no idea where she is youre lying i really think you should leave im not going anywhere until i speak to sean i already told you i dont know when hell be back is he with julia no way julia ripped his guts out man look im gonna have to call the police if you dont clear out of here right now neil looked up from the pages he was reading and yanked the phone from the small table beside seans bed thrust it toward paul call them he said nine a dark green jaguar was parked in cindys driveway when she got home oh no cindy said panicking as neil pulled his black nissan alongside it its my exhusband why is he here maybe he brought julia home neil offered hopefully cindy bolted from the car and was halfway up the steps when her front door opened tom stood in the doorway to her house one welltoned arm crossed over the other a look of bemused impatience creasing his tanned face he was dressed head to toe in beige linen a color that complemented the recent blond streaks in his still shockingly full head of hair his feet were bare inside brown tas sled loafers as smugly handsome at fortyfive as hed been at twentyfive cindy thought disappointed that middleage hadnt damaged him in any obvious way that he hadnt grown fat or bald that his wrinkles actually added to his appeal elvis was sitting at his feet as if he were used to having tom there cindy groused silently when behind him something moved a young woman cindy realized relief pulsing through her veins julia she cried out a shape emerged from the inside shadows took its place in the doorway snaked a proprietary hand through tom carvers arm hello cindy the cookie said pushing the dog away with her feet she was wearing a tight creamcolored jersey over tight creamcolored pants which at first glance made her seem nude a most disconcerting thought cindy decided thinking of the pictures of julia in her pocket and watching the cookie lean her head on toms shoulder as if to say hes mine now i get the point cindy said to herself you dont have to work so hard aloud she said is julia inside tom shook his head we dont know where julia is the cookie informed her then noticing neil standing in the driveway whos this cindy spun around as neil came up behind her this is neil macfarlane my accountant she added stumbling over the lie neil this is my exhusband tom carver and the fiona his current wife she stressed the word current as if the condition were temporary i didnt realize accountants made house calls tom said slyly extending his hand special circumstances neil said genially then quietly to cindy would you like me to leave no please stay the police might want to ask you some more questions the police whats going on here tom stood back to let them enter as if the house is still his cindy thought feeling herself bristle as she sidestepped around her exhusbands young wife elvis licking at her legs julia didnt come home last night she reminded him looking around for heather heather heathers not here the cookie said what do you mean shes not here who let you in tom smiled sheepishly i have a key he said having the grace to look at least moderately embarrassed look lets not c make this into a big deal okay what do you mean you have a key i said lets not make this and i said what do you mean you have a key i changed the locks seven years ago what do you mean you have a key julia thought i should have one julia gave you a key to the house the key and the alarm code the cookie said possible payback for cindysearlier use of the word current she thought her father and me should have a key in case she ever needed something or her father and i cindy corrected impatiently and with all due respect this really isnt any of your business it certainly is my business okay okay tom said arms outstretched as if trying to placate both women he glanced over at neil women his eyes said clearly enjoying the fuss knowing it was about him i cant believe you came into my house when i wasnt here heres your key tom dropped the key into cindys outstretched hand i dont understand what youre so worked up about the cookie said were the ones who should be upset we were halfway to the cottage when irena called and we had to come racing back i thought you were in a meeting cindy said to her exhusband pointedly ignoring his young wife secretarys still lying for you i see tom shrugged scenes from a marriage cindy cleans up the kitchen after getting both children ready for bed she wraps toms dinner in plastic wrap and puts it in the fridge for him to eat when he gets home then re corks the bottle of wine whens daddy coming home julia calls out from the top of the stairs soon cindy assures her he promised to read me a story julia says an hour later sitting up in her bed stubbornly refusing to fall asleep ill read to you cindy offers but julia turns from her covering her face with her pillow as if she senses her fathers absence is somehow her mothers fault cindy retreats to her own room thumbs through the latest issue of vanity fair and watches tv until her eyes are so heavy with fatigue she can no longer focus its ten oclock she reaches for the phone her arm stopping in midair falling to her side irena has already told her tom is stuck in meetings and cant be disturbed at eleven oclock cindy turns off the lights and gives in to sleep at twenty minutes after midnight she awakens to the sound of a key turning in the front door and hears her husbands guilty footsteps on the stairs daddy she hears julia cry with sleepy delight as he visits her room to kiss her good night cindy feigns sleep as he creeps into their room and takes off his clothes crawling in beside her without washing up even though he has undoubtedly showered before coming home she can smell another woman on his skin she moves to the far side of the bed hugs her knees to her chest till morning earth to cindy a voice snapped at the silence cindy turned toward the grating sound my husband asked you a question the cookie said you called the police tom asked a second time yes i did they should be here any minute julias going to be so pissed the cookie said i dont understand why you felt it necessary to involve the police l s twhat exactly is it you dont understand cindy asked her exhusband checking her watch its almost one oclock nobody has seen or heard from julia since yesterday morning shes going to be so pissed do you know where she is no tom admitted but but what you dont think its a little early to be sending in the cavalry did you know she broke up with her boyfriend yes i knew that so what kids a loser a very angry loser cindy said so angry he wrote a really scary story about a man who kidnaps his former girlfriend and tortures her to death tom waved a dismissive hand in front of his face as if swatting away a fly i think youre overreacting really well the police dont think so theyve asked me for a recent photograph of julia she patted the pocket of her khaki pants tried not to see the pictures inside it i still dont understand when exactly you spoke to the police ill explain neil said motioning tom and fiona toward the living room you go find the photograph he directed cindy and what exactly is your part in all this tom was asking neil as cindy left the room running up the stairs elvis at her heels cindy stood motionless outside julias bedroom for several seconds as if waiting to be invited in elviss tail slapping happily against the door her daughter wouldnt like her snooping around in her room any more than cindy had appreciated seeing tom on the wrong side of her front door how dare he come inside the house make himself at home bring that silly twit he married into her space rub her nose in his new lifewhat was the matter with him did he think that just because hed once lived here that gave him some kind of residual rights joy fielding i make the money i make the decisions cindy took a deep breath trying to calm herself down what exactly was she so angry about the fact that tom seemed so unconcerned about their daughters whereabouts or the fact that he still looked so damned good that despite the years and everything that had happened he still had the power to make her go weak in the knees its not fair she muttered turning around in helpless circles trying to think where julia might have stored her most recent head shots probably in the same place she keeps her address book she thought shaking her head aware this was the second time this morning shed invaded her daughters privacy shes going to be so pissed she told the dog in the cookies voice as once more she rifled through the drawers of julias desk getting pretty good at this cindy thought counting three boxes of unused stationary at least thirty black pens several scraps of paper with nameless phone numbers scribbled across them four unused key chains two empty picture frames a leopardprint chiffon scarf a dozen matchbooks and three unopened packages of juicy fruit gum no head shots she opened the closet slapped at the sizetwo clothing dangling precariously from the wooden hangers again rummaging through the stacks of sweaters piled carelessly on the builtin shelves and straightening the shoes lined up across the closet floor no head shots she ransacked each drawer of her daughters dresser suppressing a shudder when she came across julias collection of sexy pushup bras and thong panties doesnt she have any normal underwear cindy wondered recalling the days of her own youth how she hadnt even owned a bra when she married tom her sister leigh who was several cup sizes larger than cindy used to tease her about her lack of endowment my breasts might be small cindy had countered but theyre perfect now theyre just small she thought dryly closing the last of juliasdresser drawers and looking out the front window in time to see a police cruiser pull up in front of the house the police had arrived at seans apartment within twenty minutes of his roommates call theyd listened with interest as paul apprised them of the situation told them that hed asked cindy and neil to leave repeatedly and that theyd refused cindy in turn patiently explained that her daughter had recently broken up with her boyfriend pauls roommate and that she was now missing she and neil had come by to talk to sean only to find julias torn picture in his wastepaper basket and this alarmingly odious little story she said her voice cracking her patience evaporating as she thrust the offending piece of paper at the two police officers and suggested they start combing the area immediately south of the king sideroad for any abandoned shacks hey hey hold on a moment theyd said trying to slow her down slow down cindy repeated now falling to her knees and peeking under her daughters bed the dogs nose wet against her cheek she saw an old electric keyboard and a new acoustic guitar both covered in dust which wasntsurprising since cindy couldnt remember the last time shed heard julia play either she was about to give up in defeat go downstairs and tell the police that julia must have taken the head shots with her when she went to her audition when she saw the large manila envelope peeking out from under the shaft of the guitar perfectly logical place to keep them cindy said stretching to retrieve the envelope and opening it as the front doorbell rang elvis barked loudly in her ear then ran from the room ill be right down she called over the dogs repeated yapping hello officers please come in she heard tom say as if this were still his house cindy pulled a handful of photographs out of the envelope smiled sadly at her daughters beautiful face she looks so radiant cindy thought admiring the determination in her daughters eyes as if nothing can stop her as if nothing can get in her way julia gives good attitude tom had once remarked and as much as cindy hated to admit her exhusband was right about anything he was right about that julia stared back at her mother from the blackandwhite glossy her head tilted provocatively to one side straight blond hair cascading toward her right shoulder her skin flawless with just the hint of a smile on her enviously full lips and yet cindy knew that beneath all the bravado lay a bundle of insecurities wriggling like snakes inside a canvas bag unlike heather who had the confidence but not the attitude julia had the attitude without the confidence it was an interesting contradiction cindy thought removing several of the head shots from the top of the pile to give to the police she thought of the pictures in her pocket cant very well show these to the police she thought removing them from her pocket and glancing through them cindy tom appeared in the doorway as if hed been lurking there all along just waiting for the right moment to pop into view clearly a man who understood the value of good timing who knew how to make an entrance whats taking you so long the police are waiting cindy jumped to her feet only to stand frozen to the spot unable to move whats going on tom said what are you doing he walked to her side and removed the pictures from cindys hand i found them in seans apartment she looks pretty good tom remarked casually cindy shook her head in dismay youre unbelievable come on cindy lighten up you cant see anything you can see shes naked you can also see shes enjoying herself thoroughly which makes it all right which makes it none of our business shes your daughter shes a consenting adult do you think i should show these pictures to the police only if you want to cloud the issue he warned her what do you mean i mean the police are easily distracted one look at these and they arent going to take your concerns too seriously i thought the objective here was to find our daughter so suddenly im not overreacting of course youre overreacting its part of your charm dont patronize me dont punish me for something that happened seven years ago cindys eyes widened in disbelief you think this is about you about our divorce isnt it its about our daughter our daughter whos missing he reminded her as if she didnt know the air rushed from cindys lungs you dont think somethings happened to her do you no i dont tom said evenly i think she just decided to get away for a few days without telling anyone tom shrugged it wouldnt be the first time shes done this before once he admitted she was upset about my getting married so she took off came back a couple of days later apologized said shed just needed some time to get her head clear and you didnt tell me i didnt want to worry you unnecessarily he reached over touched her arm i know our daughter she likes to stir things up a little like her mother he added with a smile cindy looked toward the window youre so full of shit she said maybe he conceded but i still think we should wait until tuesday before dispatching the troops or were going to be awfully embarrassed when julia comes waltzing home i dont give a rats ass about being embarrassed really cindy your language fuck you cindy told her exhusband watched him wince well i guess theres a certain comfort in knowing that some things never change he shook his head look your accountant suggested i call michael kinsolving to see if julia showed up for her audition who knows maybe she mentioned something to him about her plans for the weekend do you think thats possible anythings possible come on the police are waiting they were halfway down the stairs before cindy realized that tom hadnt returned the photographs of julia she was about to ask for them back when one of the police officers appeared at the bottom of the stairs staring toward them expectantly cindy watched her former husband smile as he slipped the provocative photographs of julia into the pocket of his linen pants ten maybe she eloped the cookie was suggesting to the second police officer as cindy and her exhusband reentered the living room beside detective andy bartolli detective bartolli was the elder of the two men and the stockier his partner detective tyrone gill was younger by a decade and taller by several inches both had necks the size of tree stumps what did you say cindy felt the sudden constraint of toms hand on her arm as if he feared she was about to throw herself at his wifes head the cookie tossed long red hair from one shoulder to the other maybe she eloped she repeated as if she really thought cindy might not have heard her the first time cindy stole a glance at the two detectives sensing their interest already starting to wane theres no urgency here the looks they exchanged suggested what makes you think she might have eloped detective bartolli asked julia would never elope cindy interjected oh please the cookie said how many times have i had to listen to that stupid story about you and tom running off to niagara falls without telling anyone she thought it was so romantic she did cindy fought back tears julia had never said anything of the sort to her the police waited as tom called michael kinsolving whose assistant said the famous director had left town until tuesday and couldnt be reached although the assistant confirmed that julia had indeed shown up for her fifteenminute audition promptly at eleven oclock after asking several pointed questions about julias recent state of mindhas she been depressed lately how upset was she about the breakup with her boyfriendthe policemen left with several copies of her head shots promising to phone as soon as they spoke to sean banack with toms approval and over cindys objections they decided to wait until after the long weekend before launching a more formal investigation what now cindy asked when they were gone try to relax her exhusband advised call me in muskoka if you hear anything youre going to the cottage cindy asked incredulously i cant do anything here julias fine the cookie said with a yawn shes a big girl she probably just needed some time away from her mother would somebody please get this moron out of my house cindy pleaded looking from tom to neil the cookie turned a sickly shade of beige that perfectly matched her outfit the dog started barking i think its time we left tom said yes youre very good at that cindy agreed only half under her breath the phone rang both tom and cindy strode purposefully into the kitchen colliding in the doorway as they reached for the hone hello cindy said pressing the phone to her ear her eyes warning tom to back off whats wrong her mother asked cindys shoulders slumped with disappointment what makes you think somethings wrong mom tom rolled his eyes toward the ceiling so thats where julia gets it cindy thought a mother always knows when somethings wrong her mother said and cindy felt her heart sink thinking of julia well go tom whispered whos that her mother asked was that tom youre amazing mother cindy watched tom usher the cookie out the front door whats he doing there now i know somethings wrong its nothing ill be right there no mom mother damn it she dropped the phone into its carriage shit whats up neil asked goodnaturedly coming into the kitchen my mothers coming over sorry for the language she said still smarting from toms earlier admonition what language cindy fought the urge to kiss him full on the mouth you should probably go im happy to stay and i would dearly love you to stay cindy thought i think youve met enough of my family for one day she said instead walking him to the door thinking how his body contrasted with toms while both men were approximately the same height and weight tom had a way of overwhelming everything in his path rather like julia neil was more like heather an easier more accommodating fit thank you cindy told him both eager and reluctant to say goodbye talk about bad timing i dont think i could have managed without you he smiled i bet you say that to all your accountants cindy reached out touched his cheek beside her elvis growled got a little more than you bargained for didnt you ill call you later he said patting elvis on the head she watched him back his car out of the driveway i wont hold my breath she said wistfully as his car disappeared down the street it was only then that cindy became aware that she herself was being watched she swiveled toward her neighbors house faith she said returning the other womans wan smile i didnt see you there how are you feeling j o fine faith sellick was wearing a sloppy redandblackcheckered shirt over a pair of black capris a red ribbon dangled from her hair lots of activity at your house today yes i saw the police car it was nothing faith nodded stared at the street wheres the baby ryan took him to the office this morning that was nice of him it gives you a chance to relax i guess its such a beautiful day cindy remarked when she could think of nothing else to say would you like a cup of tea she heard herself ask realizing she was reluctant to go back inside the house that she was afraid to be alone time alone meant time to think time to think meant time to worry time to worry meant time to imagine the worst that would be nice faith said carefully measuring out each word tea would be very nice good come on over she walks as if shes asleep cindy observed her eyes following faith sellick as the young woman floated down her front steps and along the sidewalk elvis ran forward to nip at her heels hello boy faith said absently come inside cindy stood back to let faith enter this is really very sweet of you my pleasure cindy led faith into the kitchen motioned toward the four pine chairs at the rectangular pine table faith sank into the closest one stared at cindy expectantly regular or herbal cindy asked as elvis spread himself across the top of faiths feet faith said nothing and for a moment cindy wondered if shed understood the question she was about to ask it again when faith finally answered herbalshe said her sudden smile at odds with the sadness in her eyes ginger peach or spearmint spearmint faith laughed a delicate tinkle that danced in the air like wind chimes cindy filled the kettle with water turned on the burner turned back to faith thinking that the young woman looked much older than her years closer to forty than thirty cindy thought noting the dark circles rimming faiths eyes the sallowness of her complexion did you get any sleep at all last night faith nodded a bit its not easy being a new mother cindy pictured julia as a baby its not easy being a mother period she added picturing her now seems easy enough for most people dont kid yourself your girls are so beautiful theyve turned out so well thank you cindy crossed her fingers said a silent prayer did you worry about them a lot when they were babies of course i worry about kyle all the time thats perfectly normal i worry about everything faith continued as if cindy hadnt spoken his safety his health whether hell be happy when he grows up i dont think you ever really stop worrying about those things again cindy thought of julia i mean look at whats going on in the world today terrorists suicide bombers aids poverty child abuse faith cindy advised gently interrupting the seamless flow of catastrophes youll make yourself nuts if you worry about all those things how can you not worry all you have to do is pick up the morning paper dont pick it up you have to know whats happening you cant just bury your head in the sand why cant you because things wont get any better that way and you think worrying yourself sick is going to make things better no but you should be aware you can be aware again when kyle starts sleeping through the night it just doesnt seem right to bring a child into a world where so many bad things are happening where there are so many evil people there are good people too cindy said trying to reassure them both i try to be a good person you are a good person faith grimaced as if shed had a sudden spasm im not a very good mother why would you think that kyle cries all the time he has colic it has nothing to do with you i try to comfort him i feed him i hold him i even sing to him but he still cries tulia was the same when she was a baby the only one who could get her to stop crying was tom toms your exhusband yes was that him before with the redhead that was him is she his new girlfriend wife i think ryan has a girlfriend faith said matteroffactly as the kettle began whistling no cindy started then stopped how would she know whether or not ryan had a girlfriend what makes you say that she asked busying herself with making the tea i can see it in his eyes what do you see its more what i dont see cindy understood without asking exactly what faith meant shed seen the same lack of substance in toms eyes before he walked out as if he were already gone still she said hes probably just tired no its more than that less she corrected i dont think he loves me anymore im sure ryan loves you faith cindy pictured ryans troubled face as he sat on his front steps elviss head in his lap the subtle scent of spearmint filled the air as cindy deposited the steaming mug of herbal tea on the table in front of faith hes just worried about you thats all worry isnt love faith lifted the mug to her lips quickly laid it back down its hot better give it a few minutes to cool off my grandmother used to say that faith smiled at the memory give it a few minutes to cool off she repeated in a voice not her own she died last year cancer im sorry shed had this really hard life her oldest son committed suicide you know how awful yeah my uncle barry he was schizophrenic i dont really remember him he died when i was still a kid he hanged himself in the bathroom my grandmother found him faith raised the mug to her lips a second time breathed in the aromatic steam still rising from its surface suicide kind of runs in my family what cindy recalled detective bartollis questions about her daughters recent state of mind has she been depressed lately how upset was she about the breakup with her boyfriend i had a greataunt who threw herself off a tall building faith was saying and two cousins who slashed their wrists and my mom took too many pills once but then she called all the neighbors and told them what shed done so they rushed her to the hospital and she had to have her stomach pumped thats terrible cindy gingerly sipped at her tea not quite sure what to say next you would never julia would never what oh oh no no of course not i would never do anything like that because things are never as black as they seem cindy said earnestly the cliche filling her mouth like a wad of cotton balls things always get better unless they get worse she added silently i dont have the courage to kill myself faith was saying you think its a question of courage has she been depressed lately i know some people consider suicide the cowards way out but i never thought of it that way i mean to do something as as taking your own life i think that requires tremendous guts more guts than i have thats for sure good cindy suppressed a shudder as she settled into the chair across from faith vaguely recalling an article shed read about the ripple effect of suicide how the suicide of one family member often served to validate anothers that such action came to be seen as an acceptablealternative a viable option for solving ones problems she shook her head the women in her family might be emotional headstrong and impulsive but they were definitely not suicidal and they were far too interested in having the last word to take themselves out of the argument early because you have everything to live for cindy heard herself continue i mean its hard now youre going through a very difficult time youre exhausted your hormones are raging but itll get better trust me a year from now youll feel so much better about everything do you think ryan will leave me ryans not going anywhere faith he says he wants three more children what do you want i dont know what about your job im on maternity leave till the new year but i dont think i should go back why not i thought you loved teaching how can i possibly handle twentyfive kids when i cant take care of one cindy watched ominous clouds gather in faiths eyes as she sipped steadily at her tea well you dont have to make any major decisions right now i guess thats right you have plenty of time faiths eyes filled with tears ryans so busy these days i hardly see him anymore she lifted her shoulders to her ears in a prolonged shrug when he first started working at granger mcallister it was just this tiny firm now there are seven architects secretaries assistants so many people and theyre busy all the time hes always having to rush off somewhere this tea is really good she said finishing what remained in her mug would you like some more oh no thank you i should be getting home i promised ryan id try to straighten things up a bit he says the house is a pigsty why dont you take a nap first cindy suggested hearing a car pull into the driveway julia she thought running to the door opening it in time to see acab backing into the street and her mother walking up the front steps as elvis ran down to greet her whats the matter her mother said ignoring the dog and dont tell me nothing i can see it in your face whos this cindy followed her mothers eyes to the woman standing behind her mom this is faith sellick my neighbor faith this is my mother pleased to meet you faith stepped outside shielding her eyes from the sun thanks again for the tea you dont have to leave on my account cindys mother said no i have to go i have so much to do first you have to take a nap right faith ambled down the steps theres something not quite right about that one her mother remarked as soon as faith was out of earshot shes the one i was talking about yesterday with the postpartum depression her mother nodded so are you going to invite me in tell me what tom was doing here cindy led her mother into the kitchen motioned toward the recently vacated chair i think you better sit down eleven at exactly am cindy bolted upright in her bed and cried oh no i forgot she jumped out of bed and rushed into the bathroom elvis jumping excitedly into the air beside her as if this were some great new game they were playing almost tripping over him as she lunged toward the medicine cabinet cindy tried to focus on the assorted bottles of headache remedies halfempty boxes of bandaids partially squeezed tubes of ointments abandoned spools of dental floss and discarded brands of hair gel that met her halfclosed eyes the detritus of everyday life she thought reaching into the cabinet hoping she wasnt too late the doctor had warned her that if she didnt take her pills at the same time every day she would die how long ago was that weeks months years how long had it been since shed last remembered to take her pills oh no oh no what the hell am i doing cindy suddenly asked herself coming wide awake and staring at her reflection regarding the woman in the glass as if she were some alien being what is the matter with you what pills slowly cindy took stock of the situation her panic gradually subsiding her heartbeat returning to normal she was standing naked in her bathroom in the middle of the night searching for pills that didnt exist on the advice of a doctor who also didnt exist obviously shed been having another nightmare although she couldnt remember a single detail its that damn herbal tea she told the woman in the glass that stuffll kill you her reflection nodded cindy watched the woman run a tired hand through her lifeless hair her eyes filling with tears would somebody please just shoot me now put me out of my misery in response her reflection dropped her chin toward her chest the silence buzzing around their respective heads like determined mosquitoes youve got to get some sleep cindy muttered on her way back to bed but even as she was climbing back under the covers she knew sleep was lost to her that the hours between now and seven oclock would be spent in restless tossing and turning that if she slept at all it would be in fits and starts and that she would wake up feeling even less refreshed and more tired than before she closed her eyes trying not to picture her daughter hogtied and bleeding on the dirt floor of some abandoned shack in the middle of nowhere please no she whispered into the pillow feeling it wet against her skin please let julia be all right please let this whole thing be nothing but a bad dream a terribly long bad dream cindy thought flipping onto her other side hearing elvis groan beside her knowing that this nightmare was horribly real and that if her daughter didnt come home soon she would most assuredly die as the imaginary doctor of her dreams had warned oh god cindy sat up only to flop back down she rolled onto her other side sat up turned on the light reached for the paperback novel on the nightstand beside her bed and glared at the phone undoubtedly tom and the cookie were having no such trouble sleeping she pictured the cottage on lake joseph the large rustic bedroom shed once shared with tom the long side window open to allow the cool muskoka breezes entry the image of her former husband in bed with his young wife pasted itself across the pages of her book cindy brushed it aside with a disdainful swipe of her hand accidentally ripping off the top corner of the page she read then reread the first few paragraphs of the chapter before tossing the novel to the foot of the bed in defeat how could she read when she couldnt concentrate where are you julia had she really considered her parents elopement so romantic was it possible she might have pulled the same stunt herself with whom just come home cindy prayed please come home when she comes home cindy vowed silently im going to buy her those brown suede boots she was admiring in davids the ones i told her were way too expensive when she comes home im going to take her to her favorite sushi restaurant for dinner and lunch and even breakfast if thats what she wants when she comes home i wont yell or complain or get on her case about inconsequentials ill be more understanding of her problems less judgmental more patient less critical ill be the perfect mother the perfect friend our lives will be perfect when she comes home when she comes home cindy repeated hopefully in her head as shed been repeating for so much of julias life shed already lost her daughter once she wasnt about to lose her again cindy pushed herself out of bed slipped a pink cotton nightshirt over her head and tiptoed down the hall to julias room elvis at her heels she stood in the doorway and peered toward julias bed is someone there a voice asked cutting through the darkness like a laser cindy gasped as a figure sat up in the bed reaching for the lamp on the night table just as cindy flipped on the overhead light julia she cried arms extending into the room then dropping heavily to her sides her feet coming to an abrupt halt as if shed just waded into cement sweetheart her mother said softly getting out of julias bed and walking slowly toward her are you all right cindy shook her head dislodging a steady flow of tears im sorry i forgot you were here her mother had insisted on spending the night after cindyconfided that julia was missing did i wake you up her mother led her to the side of julias bed sat down next to her not really i heard some kind of noise a few minutes ago i thought it might be julia coming home that was probably me i woke up in a sweat because id forgotten to take my pills what pills there are no pills cindy raised her hands helplessly in the air i must be losing my mind her mother laughed something funny about that norma appleton took cindys hands in hers only that i remember going through a very similar experience years ago constantly waking up in the middle of the night convinced id forgotten something terribly important i think it has to do with menopause menopause im not in menopause close no way im only fortytwo all right dear thats all i need to worry about right now youre missing the point here darling the point being the point being that i think this is pretty common in women of a certain age mother i used to call it the of ifs the what the of ifsoh fucki forgot excuse me whatyou think youre the only one who knows words like that close your mouth dear a bug will fly in cindy stared at her mother in disbelief so thats where i get it she thought here comes the mouth tom used to say at the start of any argument you and that mouth he used to say sorry for the language shed apologized to neil earlier what language hed asked what are you thinking her mother asked now what youre smiling i am god her mother didnt miss a thing must be gas shell come home her mother said her eyes on the distant past her voice heavy with experience youll see tomorrow morning shell come waltzing through the front door as if nothings happened amazed at all the fuss angry you were worried furious you called the police a flush of shame bowed cindys head i put you through hell when i ran off with tom she acknowledged you were young and in love her mother said generously i was willful and selfabsorbed that too cindy shook her head what was i thinking i dont think you were i was actually angry at you for having worried you were livid how dare i call your friends how dare i embarrass you like that how could i involve the police you were gone less than fortyeight hours youre a grown woman a married woman no less what was the matter with me oh you went on and on is it too late for me to apologize her mother draped a protective arm around cindys shoulder hugged her to her side its never too late she whispered kissing her daughters wet cheek you think this is payback time gods idea of poetic justice i like to think that god has better things to do with his time do you think julia could have eloped with some guy do you cindy shook her head when julia spoke about getting married she talked about vera wang dresses and a photo spread in people magazine its not her style besides she broke up with her boyfriend she thought of sean banack you dont think she was overly upset about that do you i mean upset enough to do something stupid julia hurt herself over a man her mothers question was answer enough then whats happened to her where is she i dont know sweetheart i do know you need to get some sleep or youre not going to be in any shape to yell at her when she comes home come on her mother urged pulling down the covers on the other side of julias queensize bed why dont you sleep with me tonight i could use the company wordlessly cindy climbed into julias bed burrowing in against her mothers side her mothers arm falling across her hip as elvis flopped down between their feet the lingering aroma of julias angel perfume on her pillow filled cindys nostrils she closed her eyes sucked at the scent as if she were a baby at her mothers breast when julia comes home cindy recited silently ill buy her the biggest bottle of angel perfume they sell when she comes home ill get her a gold pass to the film festival so she can attend all the galas when she comes home ill hold my tongue hold my temper hold my baby in my arms again when she comes home cindy repeated over and over again in her mind until she fell asleep when she comes home when she comes home mom grandma heather asked from somewhere above their heads whats going on cindy opened her eyes saw heather looming above her the pull of gravity distorting her sweet features cindy pushed herself up against the headboard rubbing her eyes as elvis bounded over to lick her face my heavens whats that cindys mother asked as the dog poked his nose under the covers get out of here she groused as elviss long tongue flicked toward her lips he stuck his tongue in my mouth get away from me you silly dog heather shooed elvis off the bed i didnt know you were here grandma i was in bed before you came home i thought julia was back cindy felt her heart cramp no i take it you havent heard anything heather shook her head why are you sleeping in here cindy and her mother shrugged in unison what time is it cindy asked almost nine oclock nine oclock when was the last time shed slept till nine oclock even on a weekend whats the matter heather asked do you have to be somewhere no both women answered but i have a lot to do cindy added quickly like what cindy brushed the question aside with an impatient wave of her hand is duncan still asleep i need to talk to him hes not here where is he heather shrugged not here heather look mom im real sorry but i dont know where duncan is every minute of the day really sorry cindy and her mother corrected together what its an adverb heathers grandmother explained heather nodded backing slowly out of the room i think ill take elvis out for his walk now if thats all right with the grammar police cindy smiled thank you darling i made coffee heather said thank you cindy said again marveling at her daughters easy grace even dressed in tight lowfitting jeans and a navelbaring candyapplered tank top she somehow managed to look elegant shes a very sweet thing her mother said after heather had left the room yes she is like her mother she kissed cindys forehead cindy felt her eyes fill with tears thanks for being here mom she said by ten oclock cindy had showered and dressed and was on her fourth cup of coffee you should eat something her mother advised im not hungry you should eat something anyway you have to keep up your strength l s tcindy nodded irritation beginning to mingle with gratitude while it was nice to have her mother here to feel her love and support in this difficult time norma appleton had an annoying tendency of taking up more than her fair share of oxygen prolonged exposure to her company rendered breathing increasingly difficult grown women had been known to run screaming from the room overcome by intense feelings of suffocation was that how cindy made julia feel as if there werent enough air in the room dont feel you have to stay here with me mom she said delicately im sure you have a million other things to do what things i dont know whats more important than this cindy shook her head in defeat finished the coffee in her cup poured herself another you should eat something her mother said cindy pulled several crumpled pieces of paper out of the pocket of her gray sweatpants glanced at the phone whats that her mother asked just some phone numbers i found in julias room whose are they cindy studied the numbers on the scraps of paper tried willing them into familiarity i dont know her mother reached across the kitchen table turned the pieces of paper in cindys hand toward her so that she could read them then repeated the numbers out loud are you going to call them should i might as well whatll i say cindy crossed the room in three quick strides then lifted the phone to her ear her fingers already pressing in the first of the numbers start with hello thanks mom cindy said as the phone was answered on its first ring esthetics by noelise a womans voice announced im sorry what esthetics by noelise the woman repeated as if she were no longer sure oh oh im sorry i must have the wrong number no problem esthetics by noelise cindy told her mother hanging up the phone whats that where julia gets her legs waxed try the next one the second number belonged to sushi supreme the third to a local talent agency julia was hoping to sign with last one cindy said punching in the final set of numbers listening as the phone rang four times before being picked up by voicemail you have reached the offices of granger mcallister the taped message began our normal hours of operation are from nine to five monday through friday if you know the extension of the person you wish to speak to you may enter it now if you would like to access our company directory cindy hung up the phone whats the matter her mother asked already at her side granger mcallister cindy repeated why do i know that name a law firm no i dont think so cindy pictured the name written in broad strokes across the beige tile floor when he first started working at granger mcallister it was just this tiny firm theyre architects cindy said flatly hearing faiths voice what would julia want with an architect i have no idea i think ryan has a girlfriend was it possible julia and ryan were involved but im damn sure going to find out the phone rang just as she was reaching for it its julias line cindy said her finger hesitating over the key for line two answer it her mother urged cindy took a deep breath pressed the appropriate key picked up the phone hello julia its lindsey im at the yoga studio whats taking you so long ill be right there cindy replied in julias breathy whisper then hung up the phone her heart racing ive got to go what do you mean youve got to go where are you going all of a sudden what are you doing cindy didnt answer the truth was she had no idea what she was doing or what she would do when she got to the yoga studio she grabbed her purse from the front closet and was already at the door when the phone rang again her line she turned toward the sound julias name freezing on her lips as her mother picked up the phone its leigh her mother said shes calling to see if you know where i am cindy opened the front door swallowed a deep gulp of air dont tell her anything her mother nodded understanding im sorry you were worried cindy heard her say as she was closing the front door but somethings happened here julias missing twelve the yoga studio was located in an old sixstory building on the north side of bloor street just west of spadina across the street from a large grocery store and the central branch of the jcc for some reason in the last several years this nondescript studio in an unfashionable part of town had become a favorite spot for visiting celebrities to unwind and work out which was the main reason cindy knew her daughter frequented the place occasionally julia had regaled her mother with tales of stretching out beside the likes of gwyneth paltrow and elisabeth shue one day shed vowed other girls would be telling their mothers theyd worked out beside julia carver there was nowhere out front to park so cindy spent almost fifteen minutes navigating the areas frustrating arrangement of oneway streets before ending up back on the main road spotting someone pulling out of a space on the south side of bloor cindy promptly executed an illegal uturn causing the driver in the car behind her to jam on her brakes and eliciting a raised middle finger from the driver in the oncoming lane a middleaged man who pulled up beside cindys tancolored camry as she was backing into the freshly vacated spot and sat on his horn until she turned off her engine cindy sat staring out her front window refusing to look at the man in the car beside her knowing he hadnt left her enough room to open her door and that if she wanted to leave her car shed have to climb across the front seat and use the passenger door she checked her watch feeling the mans eyes burning acid powered holes through the car window whats the hurry lady she heard him shout through two layers of glass you have a bladder problem oh dear she thought not sure what to do so many angry people in this world so many crazy people she shuddered what if julia had encountered such a man suppose shed inadvertently said or done the wrong thing offended someone in some innocent unforeseen way you almost got us both killed back there the man raged cindy saw his arms waving with much agitation around his head as if hedstumbled into a nest of bees she pictured a knife in those hands heard julias distant screams her eyes filled with tears behind the mans car horns began beeping urging him forward still he didnt move was he planning to sit there all day cindy pushed the tears from her cheeks and rechecked the time it was getting late the yoga class would be half over by now lindsey might have already given up on her tardy friend and gone home she couldnt just sit here all morning waiting for this lunatic to leave im sorry she said sincerely turning in the mans direction noting that fury had reddened his complexion and distorted his features like a clumsy finger through clay i didnt mean to cut you off lady you should be shot came the mans instant retort then he pulled away extending his middle finger high out the window in a final blistering farewell cindy pushed open her door hearing the blast of another horn and feeling a hot gust of exhaust on her legs as a red porsche barely missed running over her toes another middle finger waved back in her direction she fought back the renewed threat of tears as she waited for a break in the traffic a man begging for change in front of a nearby convenience store shook his head in dismay as she scurried across the street then turned away as she approached as if repelled by her carelessness fine then she muttered returning a fistful of coins to her pocket dont take my money cindy pulled open the outside door to the yoga studio and approached the ancient elevators pressing then repressing the call button at least four times before she heard the old wires groan somewhere above her head signaling the elevators excruciatingly slow and shaky descent she pushed her way through the elevators heavy metal doors before they were fully open then realized she didnt know what floor the studio was on whats the matter with you how could you be so stupid she asked out loud exiting the elevator just as a sloppily dressed young woman chewing an enormous wad of gum shuffled in excuse me do you know what floor the yoga studio is on she asked the girl who stared at her blankly and continued chewing her gum could you hold the elevator a minute please cindy raced to the directory on the wall to the left of the buildings entrance she quickly scanned the list noted the correct floor and ran back just as the elevator doors were drawing to a close could you hold the door she began but the girl chewed her gum and stared right through her as if cindy didnt exist i dont believe this would it have killed you to wait two goddamn seconds cindys voice followed the elevators ascent as her fist slammed repeatedly against the call button oh god im losing it she looked around for the stairs taking them two at a time so many angry people in this world she was thinking again so many crazy people and im definitely one of them she acknowledged reaching the fourthfloor landing her thighs quiverl s tins her knees about to give way the tips of her fingers brushing against the concrete floor as she collapsed from the waist gasping for breath what was the matter with her where was she going in such a hurry and what was she going to do when she got there cindy pushed damp hair away from her face straightened her shoulders and waited until her breathing had returned to normal before stepping into the hall and winding her way past the offices of several small companies until she found the door to the yoga studio she pressed her forehead against it listening to the silence suddenly the door opened and cindy fell into the room im so sorry are you all right a middleaged woman in an unflattering black leotard reached out to block cindys fall i had no idea anyone was there wild gray hair shot out at right angles from the womans worried face as if shed been struck by lightning i did that to her cindy thought forgive me she said it was my fault can i help you a voice asked from somewhere behind the shock of gray hair cindys eyes swept from one end of the long rectangular room to the other an old brown sofa and a couple of shabby beige chairs were hunched around a low coffee table in one corner a high glass cabinet containing yogarelated books and merchandise stood in another and a cluttered reception desk sat in the middle several styles of white gray and black tshirts imprinted with the yoga studio logo were pinned to one wall like artwork and the scent of oranges courtesy of several plates of freshly cut orange quarters filled the air like cologne two women were sipping bottled water and eating oranges on the sofa another woman was straightening a bunch of yoga mats that were stacked beside the doors to the inner rooms can i help you the receptionist asked again she was a pale young woman approximately julias age with fine reddishblond hair and a smattering of oversized freckles that was smeared across her nose like peanut butter im looking for lindsey lindsey lindsey cindy repeated as if the simple repetition of the name was enough i was supposed to meet her here at ten oclock she may already be in class im very late cindy added unnecessarily the receptionist nodded we have several classes going on at the moment do you know who her class was with no but how many lindseys can there be actually we have several lindseys and i believe two of them are here this morning the girl checked the register yes lindsey josephson and lindsey krauss lindsey josephson and lindsey krauss cindy repeated silently neither name was the least bit familiar she was waiting for my o j daughter julia julia carver a smile danced across the receptionists face julias your daughter cindy nodded feeling a surge of motherly pride so strong it brought tears back to her eyes shes so gorgeous yes she is julias going to be famous then ill get to say i knew her when again cindy nodded please god she was thinking just let julia be all right its lindsey krauss what her friend its lindsey krauss shes in peters class she pointed toward one of the closed doors beyond the cabinet at the far end of the room can i go in well its eighteen dollars and the class is almost over why dont you just wait until it finishes she indicated the sofa and chairs with her chin cindy dropped a twentydollar bill onto the desk and headed toward the studio wait your change the receptionist called after her then when cindy failed to respond youll need a mat cindy grabbed a bright blue mat from the shelf as she opened the door and peeked inside the room ten people eight women and two men all with their eyes closed stood beside their mats balancing on the hardwood floor on one foot like human flamingos their other legs were crossed over the knees of their standing legs their hands brought together in front of them as if in prayer their elbows extended at their sides several of the women wobbled precariously on the balls of their feet fighting to stay upright and the face of one man was pinched in such concentration he looked in danger of imploding there were no movie stars that cindy could identify but she did recognize lindsey krauss a tall willowly brunette whose surgically enhanced bosom overwhelmed her otherwise boyish frame cindy made her way over slowly to where lindsey was standing in the center of the room setting her mat down behind her and wondering how best to approach her she isnt wobbling at all cindy thought marveling at the young womans effortless mastery of the exercise shes perfect cindy thought like julia the teacher a supple young man with light brown hair and clear blue eyes nodded almost imperceptively at cindy as she tried to assume the proper position what the hell am i doing she wondered struggling to balance on one foot why hadnt she just relaxed in the comfortable waiting area sipping bottled water and eating fresh orange quarters until the class was over what did she possibly hope to accomplish in here focus on your breath the instructor advised gently his voice a whisper if your mind starts to wander just bring it back to the breath it will help you stay balanced not when youre as seriously unbalanced as i am cindy thought sliding her left foot up along her right thigh her right foot cramping in protest now slowly lower your leg peter instructed as cindys foot hit the floor with a resounding thud a slight grimace creased peters unlined brow very good now lets take a final vinyasa before we move into relaxation a final what cindy wondered as the instructor lifted his hands into the air above his head the class immediately followed suit lifting their own arms into the air then bending from the o e waist and rapidly extending one leg forward the other one back lindseys right leg shot back kicked at cindys shin she swiveled around guiltily im sorry she whispered lindsey cindy said seizing the opportunity lindsey glanced over her shoulder as she brought her other leg back to meet the first mrs carver and now slide gently into the cobra peter directed i need to talk to you lindsey along with the rest of the class slid forward on her belly then raised herself up on her arms before pushing herself into something the instructor referred to as the downward dog she stared at cindy upside down from between legs spread shoulderdistance apart i dont understand what are you doing here wheres julia thats what i need to talk to you about allow your shoulders to relax the instructor intoned a slight edge creeping into his voice i dont understand lindsey said again pushing herself into an upright position ladies please can we save the conversation until after class sorry lindsey said can we talk later cindy whispered it wont take long all right thank you ladies please sorry cindy said very good now slowly lie down on your back and concentrate all your energy on your breathing cindy lay down feeling the muscles in her back melt into the rubber of the mat she took a deep breath the air filling her nostrils and traveling to her lungs her abdomen gradually expanding like when i was pregnant with julia she thought remembering the pride shed felt as her stomach filled with life very good peter was saying now release that breath ridding all toxins and stress from your pores blow the worries of the world gently from your lips feel them leave your body cindy had loved being pregnant despite the morning sickness and overwhelming fatigue of the first few months shed loved that her breasts were so voluptuous her skin so glowing shed even loved the ugly loosefitting clothes and shed loved that tom was so solicitous so caring so eager to be a father looking back their marriage was probably its happiest during her first pregnancy now take another deep breath and open your heart feel it fill with positive energy her second pregnancy had been a completely different story this time the morning sickness lasted all day and water retention caused her to swell from head to toe the constant nausea meant cindy was unable to devote much time or energy to julia whod grown used to both and it was during those nine months that julias allegiance had subtly shifted from her mother to her father it was also during this time that cindy first discovered tom was cheating on her if your mind starts to wander peter was saying somewhere above her head bring it back to the breath cindy had blamed herself for toms affair the fact that she was always sick always tired sick and tired of feeling sick and tired as special as shed felt during her pregnancy with julia was how superfluous she felt during her pregnancy with heather almost like an afterthought in her own home tom had taken over cindys role with relish playing barbie with julia for hours on end reading her story after story taking her to the park on weekend afternoons after hed tucked julia into bed at night hed lock himself in the den or go back to the office to catch up on his work or hed go for ad rive to relax he said relax the voice continued now floating across the room relax let go the pattern had continued after heathers birth the fact that heather had proved as easy an infant as julia had been difficult strangely only made things worse julia blamed cindy for bringing this unwanted intruder into their lives turned increasingly to her father shut her mother out almost completely shes never forgiven me for heather cindy told her mother who said that cindy had once felt the same way about leigh let go peter was saying soft hands on cindys trying to manipulate her fingers let go let go im sorry cindy whispered realizing how tightly her fists were clenched at her sides feel your breath seep into your fingertips allow your hands to relax cindy felt her fists gradually open under peters expert and gentle touch tom used to touch her with that same kind of tender strength she thought the best lover shed ever had his caress as addictive as the most powerful narcotic theyd made love through all his infidelities made love that awful night hed told her he was leaving and for several months after hed moved out when she thought there was still a chance he might come home and for several months after that while they were hammering out a settlement and even after their divorce was final when she knew there was no hope at all the lovemaking had finally stopped the afternoon julia packed her new suitcase and left her mothers house to go live with her father thats it peter said his voice filled with quiet pride as he patted cindys fingers youre smiling whats going on lindsey asked as cindy followed her into the main reception area is julia sick she grabbed an orange quarter from the bowl on the desk heres your change the receptionist offered cindy holding out a twodollar coin cindy ignored the money watching lindsey suck the juice from the sliver of orange when was the last time you spoke to julia this morning this morning cindys heart began to race yeah i called and asked her what she was doing we were supposed to meet for coffee at ninethirty cindy felt her heart sink that was me what that was me you spoke to i dont understand why would you julias missing what since thursday cindy saw the movement in lindseys brown eyes as the girl retraced the last two days in her mind have you heard from her since then no no i havent i left her a message yesterday but she didnt get back to me is that unusual not really julias not great about returning calls do you have any idea where she might be lindsey shook her head discarded the orange peel please lindsey cindy urged sensing that lindsey knew something she wasnt telling if you know anything at all excuse me a woman from lindseys class reached between them to grab a piece of orange i know she had an audition with that bigshot hollywood director michael something kinsolving yes we know that we the police have been notified cindy said hoping to shock lindsey into revealing whatever it was she knew around her several women lingered pretending not to listen the police you really think somethings happened to julia i dont know what to think im sure shes all right mrs carver how are you sure lindsey grabbed another orange slice stuffed it inside her mouth i just cant imagine look i really have to go my boyfriends waiting downstairs let him wait

protested to the gathering crowd honestly i dont but cindy demanded i know theres a but there what arent you telling me lindsey lowered her head spoke out of the side of her mouth her voice no more than a whisper there was this guy maybe shes with him what guy i dont know his name really i dont lindsey insisted as cindy was about to interrupt she was very secretive about him she wouldnt tell me anything except except what except that she was crazy about him she told you she was crazy about him but she wouldnt tell you his name she said she couldnt what do you mean she couldnt she said it was a very complicated situation complicated in what way is he married ryan sellick winked at her from the dark corners of her imagination what exactly did she tell you about him nothing honestly ive told you everything i know i really have to go now im sure theres nothing to worry about lindsey fled the room as a woman from her class approached can i get you agl ass of water the woman asked cindy tears filled cindys eyes causing the womans face to blur her features to overlap like a cubist painting do you need a ride home another woman offered thank you i have my car cindy said her voice a monotone is there anything we can do cindy nodded you can find my daughter thirteen as soon as she left the yoga studio cindy drove north on spadina to dupont fully intending to go home but instead of turning right toward poplar plains she turned left continuing west to christie where she pulled to a stop across the street from an old convenience store on the corner then turned the engine off and sat staring up at sean banacks apartment what am i doing here she thought now pressing her forehead against the leather of the steering wheel hadnt the police told her to let them handle things except that the police were waiting until tuesday and tuesday might be too late cindy lifted her head looked across the street sean banack was standing in front of the convenience store staring at her in the next instant cindy was out of the car and running across the road sean sean wait she shouted at him over the tops of the passing cars i need to talk to you sean banack took several steps back as cindy drew near muscular arms raised as if warning her to keep her distance he was of medium height and build handsome in a careless sort of way his normally long blond hair cut very short his blue jeans worn very tight light brown eyes challenging hers i dont think we have anything to talk about mrs carver i do so what i want doesnt count sean lifted his palms into the air as if already conceding defeat now i see where julia gets it gets what herhow can i put this politelyher singleminded determination cindy smiled at the thought that her daughter might resemble her in any way at all wheres julia not here where then i have absolutely no idea i dont believe you sean banack took another step back until he was literally up against the redbrick wall of the convenience store mrs carver whats going on here my daughter is missing sean she hasnt been home in two days and that gives you the right to show up at my apartment and hassle my roommate to go through my things to tell the police i had something to do with julias disappearance youre saying you didnt of course i didnt i read your story sean looked at the sidewalk swayed from one foot to the other scratched the side of his head it was just a story im a writer its what i do it was a vile horrible story i didnt say i was a good writer he looked sheepishly at his feet as if ashamed of his meager stab at humor look mrs carver i can see that youre really upset and i understand why reading that story would freak you out in light of whats happened whats happened cindy repeated what did you do to her i didnt do anything please just tell me where she is i dont know where she is you wrote that you had her tied up in an abandoned shack what i wrote was a goddamn story a story that has nothing whatsoever to do with julia for gods sake mrs carver i loved your daughter i could never hurt her two young boys suddenly bounded from the convenience store laughing and punching one another in the arm what happened between the two of you cindy persisted stepping aside to let an elderly couple pass by why did you break up thats really none of your business please sean just tell me sean laughed but the laugh was hollow joyless you want to know why your daughter and i broke up mrs carver all right ill tell you julia and i broke up because she was cheating on me i found out shed been seeing someone behind my back for months who was it i dont know cindy felt her knees wobble then give way she crumpled to the sidewalk like a balled piece of paper tossed from someones fist sean banack was instantly on his knees beside her mrs carver mrs carver are you all right my little girl is missing cindy cried helplessly ill get you some water sean offered stay where you are ill be right back he disappeared into the convenience store but when he returned cindy was already gone where have you been her sister asked as cindy walked through the front door elvis immediately at her feet your phones been ringing all morning julia cindy asked staring at her sister afraid to say more no leigh said following cindy into the kitchen nobodys heard from her i cant believe shes been missing for two days and you didnt tell me i had to hear it from mom norma appleton shrugged from her seat at the kitchen table as leigh crossed the room i made some fresh coffee leigh said you want some thank you cindy sank into the chair beside her mother feeling displaced like an unwelcome guest in her own home admiring the effortless way her sister had assumed control elvis stretched himself heavily across her feet when did you get here couple of hours ago leigh deposited the cup of black coffee on the table in front of cindy where have you been its almost one i talked to a friend of julias and nothing ill have another cup of coffee her mother said youve had enough coffee today leigh mom dont argue with me okay its lunchtime ill make you some soup i dont want soup what kind of soup leigh crossed to the cupboards her eyes scanning the shelves cream of mushroom cream of asparagus split pea split pea wheres the can opener cindy pointed to a corner of the crowded counter next to a spice rack that had fallen off the wall and behind a stack of unopened mail and old fashion magazines julia had been saving youve been gone all morning where else did you go leigh opened the soup tin and poured its contents into a waiting pot cindy retraced in her mind all the streets shed traveled since leaving sean north on poplar plains east along st clair north on yonge east on eglinton south on mount pleasant east on elm circling blindly through the expensive oldmoney labyrinth that was rosedale escaping to the blossoming seediness of sherbourne heading south to the downtown core then west then north again up and down back and forth eyes scanning each pedestrian on both sides of the streets peering into parked cars squinting into the sun hoping the shadow on the opposite corner might be julias who phoned she asked not bothering to answer leighs question and thinking how much softer her sister looked without her normal layers of makeup how much prettier she looked with her hair brushed away from her face meg wondered how you were feeling said shed call you later and trish said to tell you she picked up the tickets for the film festival i take it they dont know about julia cindy nodded feeling both guilty and relieved guilty she hadnt yet confided in her two best friends relieved her sister knew that and your neighbor faith is that her name it was hard to make out what she was saying with that baby screaming in the background again cindy pictured ryan saw his phone number scribbled across the scrap of paper shed found in julias room what would julia be doing with ryans phone number at work was it possible he was the mystery man her daughter was involved with or was it someone else at granger mcallister what did she want just to tell you shes feeling a hundred percent better she and her husband are off to lake simcoe for the day shell call you tomorrow she didnt want you to worry so ryan would have to wait till tomorrow oh and heather called to see if julia was back yet cindy looked toward the hall what about duncan is he here havent seen him you want some soup no you should eat leigh said its important to keep up your strength mom says you didnt get much sleep last night she had a bad dream their mother explained thought she forgot to take her pills what pills it was just a dream cindy said wish bad dreams were all i had leigh carefully measured out two bowls of soup me i have something called benign positional vertigo whats that her mother asked apparently the calcium stones in my inner ear have come loose and they send a signal to my brain that im moving when im not so the minute i lie down on my back or turn over on my sideonly my right side mind you good thing isleep on my leftthe next thing i know the room is spinning around like im on one of those crazy rides at the exhibition the doctor says its benign positional vertigo she put the bowls of soup on the table dont let it get cold arent you having any cindy asked nah i hate canned soups if i have time tomorrow ill make you some real soup tomorrow cindy thought desperately hoping that by this time tomorrow julia would be standing where her sister was now tomorrow she thought silently repeating the word as if it were a prayer tomorrow when cindy woke up the next morning leigh was already in the kitchen preparing breakfast bacon and eggs heather marveled smiling at her mother from her seat at the kitchen table she was wearing an old pair of pink pajamas cindy hadnt seen in years elvis was sitting beside her expectantly clearly hoping a few errant scraps might come his way youre up early cindy kissed her daughters cheek patted the top of elviss head i smelled the bacon you didnt have to do this cindy said as her sister handed her a plate of crispy bacon slices and two depressingly perfect sunnyside up eggs leigh popped two pieces of raisin bread into the toaster howd you sleep okay cindy lied sitting down and cutting into the eggs you not great that mattress downstairs is a killer but what can you expect from a sofa bed mom still asleep cindy nodded what about duncan she asked heather the familiar shrug dont know you dont know he slept at macs last night mac leigh repeated turning the name over on her tongue why does that name oh my god she turned to cindy you had a call yesterday from a neil macsomething im so sorry i didnt recognize the name and i couldnt find a piece of paper to write on so i forgot all about him you really should keep a pad and pencil by the phone then this sort of thing wouldnt happen its okay leigh cindy said neils face appearing before her eyes only to smudge fade be blinked to the periphery of her line of sight bad timing she thought again banishing the image altogether she had enough on her plate at the moment when julia came home maybe why is duncan sleeping over at macs why shouldnt he sleep at macs came heathers tooquick reply well its the long weekend i assumed youd have plans trouble in paradise asked leigh grabbing the pieces of raisin bread as they popped from the toaster everythings fine heather said no toast for me thanks she swallowed the last of her bacon and carried her plate to the sink i have to get dressed its not even eight oclock leigh said where are you going thanks for the breakfast heather said sweetly it was a real treat is she always so forthcoming leigh asked after heather left the room shes not used to getting the third degree youre not curious where shes off to coffee leigh asked in the same breath yes and no cindy said yes to the coffee you were always way too lenient with them i beg your pardon im just saying that it doesnt hurt to ask a few simple questions leigh poured her sister a cup of coffee and put it on the table along with the raisin toast honestly cindy i just dont understand you i mean its one thing to respect your kids privacy but you always go too far i go too far cindy repeated numbly youre almost pathologically fair pathologically fair what does that mean it means you cant be both their mother and their friend what are you talking about please dont take that tone with me then stop talking to me like im one of your kids im just trying to help well news flashthis isnt helping look i know youre upset but dont try to make me feel badly because i made some polite inquiries bad cindy snapped what dont try to make me feel bad cindy continued feeling the anger rise in her throat you dont say i feel sadly do you no you say i feel sad in the same way you shouldnt say i feel badly you should say i feel bad you feel what not how its an emotion not an adverb leighs mouth fell open youre correcting my grammar cindy lowered her head not even eight oclock in the morning and already she was exhausted maybe shed spend the day in bed maybe shed go to church and pray maybe shed badger the police even though she knew they were waiting until the end of the long weekend confident julia would turn up on her own would she there had to be something she could do something to keep her from going out of her mind she just couldnt sit idly by and wait until tuesday especially with supermom hovering telegraphing her disapproval with every look and utterance look i can manage here she told her sister you dont have to stay dont be silly of course ill stay you have your own family to look after youre my family tears filled cindys eyes where is she leigh she asked burying her face in her hands have you checked her voicemail for messages cindy was immediately on her feet and at the telephone why hadnt she thought to check her daughters voicemail what was the matter with her i dont know her code she whispered suspecting that leigh knew all her childrens voicemail codes by heart cindy heard heathers footsteps on the stairs everything okay heather asked freshly changed into jeans and a light blue jersey heather leigh said do you know your sisters voicemail code heather quickly rattled off the four digits ive got to go she kissed her mothers cheek ill call you later try not to worry even before the front door closed cindy was entering the code to julias voicemail feeling guilty for snooping into her daughters personal life when julia got home shed apologize cindy decided hearing her sisters earlier pronouncement ringing in her ear almost pathologically fair shedsaid you have seven new messages a recorded voice chirped in cindys ear seven new messages cindy repeated looking around in vain for a pencil and a piece of paper her sister lifted her hands in the air told you so said the expression on her face in the end there was no need for paper and pencil five of the messages were from cindy forwarded from julias cell phone one was from lindsey the last one was a hangup cindy replaced the receiver desperation gnawing at her insides like a dull hunger are you all right cindy heard leigh asking through the ringing in her ears you dont look so hot cindy watched the room sway precariously from side to side as if she were riding on a high swing the earth pulling away from her feet benign positional vertigo she thought watching the ceiling swoop toward her like agi ant bird it plucked her into the air shaking her this way and that leaving her limp and helpless before abruptly letting go cindy felt herself plummeting to the ground just before she landed she heard elvis yelp saw her sisters eyes widen in alarm what are you doing leigh demanded hands on her hips cindys last thought before the darkness overtook her was that she hoped leigh could move fast enough to catch her before her head hit the floor fourteen w when cindy opened her eyes she saw neil macfarlanes handsome face im in heaven she thought watching her mother and sister insert themselves into the frame im in hell she thought quickly amending her earlier assessment the tan leather of the living room sofa groaned as cindy pushed herself into a sitting position whats going on apparently you fainted neil said from the seat beside her he was casually dressed in jeans and a yellow golf shirt his amazingly blue eyes were flecked with worry scared the hell out of me leigh said backing away from the sofa and rubbing her right hand with her left i think i may have done something to my wrist when i blocked your fall cindy tried shaking the heavy fog from inside her head but it hung on like a dead weight i dont understand how long was i out not more than a couple of minutes her mother answered i was in the bathroom when i heard your sister screaming well she scared the hell out of me leigh repeated and then the doorbell was ringing that was me neil said with a smile he brought bagels cindys mother said he helped me lift you onto the sofa leigh told her and so concludes our uptotheminute report neil said cindy shook her head i dont think ive ever fainted before its because you dont eat enough her sister pronounced which is why i brought bagels neil said maybe later cindy smiled so grateful for his presence she almost cried youve obviously met my mother and sister the necessary introductions have all been made can i get you a cup of coffee mr macfarlane leigh asked hovering like a waiting helicopter no thank you cindy pushed herself to her feet i could use some fresh air how about a walk neil asked elvis barked his enthusiastic approval headed for the door cindy laughed you said the magic word actually a walk sounds great elvis began circling the hall barking even louder okay okay you can come she walked slowly into the kitchen retrieved elviss leash and attached it to his collar youre sure youre all right to go out her mother asked im fine mom dont go too far she advised as cindy and neil headed down the outside stairs neils hand guiding cindys elbow dont let her do too much her mother called after them for heavens sake mom cindy heard leigh hiss from the doorway shes not a child stop fussing over her ouch my arm youre sure youre okay neil asked cindy as they continued down the street cindy felt her legs grow stronger her footing more secure with each step away from her house ill be fine as soon as we get around the corner the dog yanked on cindys arm demanding that she pick up the pace neil took the leash from cindys hand let me do this thank you cindy marveled at the way the dog immediately slowed down fell into step beside neil how did you do that its all in the pressure im not very good with pressure cindy said well theres only so much anyone can take they turned south on poplar plains i assume no ones heard from julia cindy nodded pointed to her right lets go to the park they walked in silence for several seconds along clarendon what made you drop by i wanted to see how everything was i called yesterday i didnt get your message until today yes your sister mentioned something about there being no pad and pencil by the phone she doesnt waste any time thats the impression i got cindy smiled shes really a very nice person im sure she is i shouldnt sound so ungrateful you dont they stopped for elvis to pee against a line of scraggly red and yellow rosebushes anyway when i didnt hear back from you i thought id take a chance and drop by see for myself how you were doing and you found me sprawled across the kitchen floor he nodded what happened to make you faint cindy shook her head damned if i know one minute i was looking at my sister next minute i was looking at you maybe you should call your doctor im sure my mother is doing exactly that as we speak they crossed russell hill road and headed up the side entrance to winston churchill park where cindy bent down and unhooked the leash from elviss collar letting the dog run free he bounded up the slight incline to the foot of a steep hill danger a sign proclaimed in big bold letters at its base slope fence hazard sleighing tobogganing prohibited a collapsing orange wire fence looped casually along the ground a flight of wooden steps ran diagonally up the right side of the hill elvis was already halfway to the top by the time cindy and neil began their climb you sure youre up for this neil asked lead on the top of the hill plateaued into a small field of dry yellow grass cindy and neil arrived at the top step in time to see elvis bound between a father and his young son who were struggling with a large blueandgold kite then pounce on a young couple sunbathing near the row of tennis courts at the far end of the park elvis stop that come back here cindy called as the dog chased after a jogger in a pair of lime green shorts who was puffing along the wellworn perimeter of the park an elderly chinese woman who was exercising with meticulous deliberation near a set of concrete stairs that led to a nearby ravine stopped to give elvis a pat on the head im sorry if he bothered you cindy said just as she was hit in the leg by a wellchewed mis aimed rubber ball immediately a large white poodle was at her feet grabbing the ball in his teeth then taking off for the middle of the park elvis in quick pursuit to where a group of pet owners were clustered together quite the scene neil remarked as elvis raced circles around the other dogs elvis a woman shouted warmly in greeting how are you boy sorry about that ball a middleaged man apologized as cindy approached the group didnt realize i could throw that far how you doin elvis you know my dog oh sure another woman answered easily we all know elvis you want a treat boy the woman her short pixie hair peeking out from under a blue jays baseball cap reached into the side pocket of her baggy olive green pants and pulled out a biscuit sit she instructed elvis promptly did as he was told amazing cindy said immediately six other dogs rushed the woman begging for treats along with the white poodle there was a smaller red one a big german shepherd a bigger golden lab and two mediumsized black dogs whose breeds cindy couldntidentify wheres julia a young girl asked as elvis chewed on his treat the girl was about twelve years old with thin yellow hair and a mouthful of braces she stood beside a younger girl with the exact same face minus the hardware cindy hadnt expected to hear her daughters name it stabbed at her heart like a sharp stick instinctively her hand reached for neils she felt his fingers fold over her own you know julia shes so pretty the younger of the two sisters answered with a laugh havent seen her around in a while the woman with the treats said pushing graystreaked black hair away from her narrow face did she take off for hollywood did she cindy wondered when was the last time you saw her she asked trying to make the question sound as casual as possible im not sure about two weeks ago i guess o owas she with anyone the woman looked puzzled by the question she was with her new boyfriend the younger of the two sisters offered with a giggle her new boyfriend cindy felt her throat constricting as if a strangers hands were around her neck strangling further ato o c tempts at conversation do you know his name she whispered hoarsely kneeling down on the grass in front of the younger yellowhaired girl the child shook her head looked anxiously toward her sister can you tell me what julias boyfriend looked like please its very important the little girl shrugged backed against her older sisters side is there a problem someone asked from above her head julias been missing since thursday cindy said eyes focused on the two girls oh dear i saw her yesterday a man said instantly cindy was on her feet advancing toward him you saw her yesterday the man who was fortyish heavyset and balding took a step back she was sitting right over there he pointed toward a lone bench at the far end of the park she was crying crying that wasnt julia the mans wife corrected it was the other one heather is that her name such a nice girl heather was here yesterday about four oclock sitting right over there the man repeated crying her heart out youre sure that wasnt julia he asked his wife was she it was the other one his wife insisted what would heather be doing in the park crying i wanted to ask her if there was anything we could do to help but the woman shook her head in her husbands direction as if her failure to take action was his fault we decided it was none of our business her husband replied defensively have you called the police someone asked the voices beginning to blend together in cindys ears becoming indistinguishable one from the other the police have been contacted neil answered for her but if any of you can think of anything that might be of help cant think of a thing someone said im sure shell turn up im so sorry said someone else good luck their voices receded as their footsteps pulled away cindy stared at the trampled grass until it grew quiet when she looked up again she and neil were alone in the center of the park are you all right neil asked cindy shrugged realized she was still holding tightly onto neils hand sorry she said releasing his fingers from her viselike grip any time cindys eyes swept across the dry field the father and his young son were still struggling with their uncooperative kite the sunbathers were still stretched out on their blanket by the tennis courts the jogger in the lime green shorts was still running in hapless circles around the track the elderly chinese woman was still doing her exercises wheres elvis cindy asked spinning around elvis she ran to the edge of the hill looked down saw a bunch of other dogs playing at the bottom no elvis oh no she raced to the other side of the park elvis where is he elvis where are you neil was right beside her take it easy cindy well find him i cant believe it i cant believe i lost julias dog well find him neil repeated she was crying now julia will never forgive me shell never forgive me neil took her arm deliberately slowed her pace led her to ward the tennis courts elvis he called out his voice racing ahead of them as they walked around the side of the double row of courts to the front part of the park they passed a group of young men playing soccer dodged between two teenage boys tossing a bright orange frisbee back and forth hes not here cindy said eyes scanning the crowded childrens playground by the front row of tennis courts she approached a group of young mothers pushing their children on the swings excuse me have you seen a wheaten terrier about this big she held her hand about two feet off the ground hes apricotcolored she continued even as the women were shaking their heads no cindy ran toward the tiny brick building that was the headquarters of the winston churchill tennis association i cant believe it first i lose julia now i lose her dog you havent lost anyone neil poked his head inside the mens washroom to the left of the small structure well find him he said elvis elvis elvis cindy echoed is this your dog someone called from inside the main room cindy poked her head into the open door of the tennis associations headquarters the single room was long and casually furnished with a large desk to one side a soft drink machine at the back and several rows of blue chairs positioned around a small tv that was tuned to the us open two young men in tennis whites were lounging across a dark blue couch propped against one wall a large pizza box open between them elvis was sitting on the floor in front of them his eyes glued to what remained of the pizza elvis cindy cried falling to her knees and hugging the dog to her chest feeling his wet tongue on the underside of her chin you scared me half to death your dog sure loves pizza one of the boys said as elvis barked his desire for more im very sorry he bothered you cindy quickly attached elviss leash to his collar and pulled at the stubborn dog come on you elvis has left the building she heard one of the young men say as they stepped outside the sun smacked cindy full in the face so she didnt see the two young sisters in her path until she was almost on top of them im so sorry she apologized how many times had she said that in the last several days does julia have a baby the younger of the two girls asked what come on the older girl urged pulling on her sisters arm wait cindy said please what makes you think julia has a baby cause i saw her with one come on annemarie we have to go home you saw julia with a baby cindy pressed she was pushing it in a carriage i asked her if it was her baby and she laughed cindy took a long deep breath tried to digest this latest piece of information what did it mean did it mean anything at all damn it she muttered as once again ryans face imposed itself on her consciousness that miserable son of a bitch annemarie gasped you said a bad word im sorry i didnt mean cindy began but the two girls were already fleeing the park what is it neil asked cindy stared blankly at the horizon somewhere above her head the old childrens rhyme kept circling first comes love then comes marriage then comes julia with a baby carnage cindy hi faith sellick said pulling open her front door seemingly oblivious to the streak of green bile staining the front of her white shirt can i speak to ryan for a minute hes not home where is he golfing somewhere up north could you have him call me as soon as he gets back sure is something wrong i just need to talk to him he might be pretty late that doesnt matter from upstairs a babys cry pierced the air faiths eyes closed as her shoulders slumped we had such a nice day yesterday she said wistfully do you need some help cindy asked glancing down the front steps to where neil stood waiting no you go ill be fine but when cindy reached her own front door she saw that faith was still standing in her doorway not moving eyes tightly closed maybe its better to wait until tuesday let the police talk to ryan neil advised later that night they were sitting at cindys kitchen table finishing off the last of a bottle of red zinfandel it was almost midnight heather and duncan were out her mother was upstairs asleep her sister had gone home ryan still hadnt phoned bastard cindy said where is he she checked her watch do you think im overreacting tom would have said she was overreacting no i mean the kid could be mistaken it might not have been julia she saw with the baby and the baby doesnt have to be ryans even if it was that doesnt necessarily mean that ryan is julias mystery boyfriend do you think im jumping to conclusions tom would have said she was jumping to conclusions i think you have good instincts you should trust them cindy smiled across the table at a tired looking neil macfarlane i think i could love this man she thought out loud she said its late you should probably go at eight o c l o c k the next morning cindy was knocking on ryan sellicks front door hold your horses ryan called groggily from inside cindy heard him shuffling toward the door braced herself for the encounter to follow easy does it you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar she could almost hear her mother advise shed been up most of the night preparing what she was going to say rehearsing exactly how she was going to say it shed even spent twenty minutes doing deepbreathing exercises to help her relax and she was determined to stay calm but the minute she saw ryan standing in the doorway black shirt unbuttoned light khaki pants hanging low on his hips a line of short black hairs twisting down from his belly button and disappearing under his waistband feet bare long hair falling into sleepy eyes the scratch beneath his right eye still prominent it took all her resolve to keep from hurling herself at his throat you lying motherfucking son of a bitch she wanted to shout i need to talk to you she said instead ryan wiped some sleep from the corner of his right eye is something wrong im not sure is this about faith he glanced warily over his shoulder toward the stairs no he looked confused its about julia julia shes been missing since thursday missing have you seen her not since i saw her arguing with duncan in the driveway was that thursday you havent seen her since then ryan shook his head he was wide awake now she didnt say anything to you about maybe going away for the long weekend the same stubborn shake of his head nothing has she confided in you lately about being depressed or upset why would she confide in me i dont know cindy answered simply maybe because the two of you were sleeping together the words tumbled from her mouth before she could stop them trust your instincts she heard neil say remembering he had also suggested waiting until tuesday letting the police question ryan why hadnt she listened she thought now watching the summer tan drain from ryans complexion why was she always barreling off halfcocked ryan raised the fingers of his left hand to his lips his eyes shooting toward his upstairs bedroom look maybe we should take this outside i dont want to wake faith she was up half the night with the baby they stepped onto the front landing what the hell are you talking about where were you yesterday where was i he repeated as if trying to make sense of the question where were you cindy repeated i was golfing up at rocky crest why what was julia with you of course not where did you get that scratch under your eye what did julia do that to you no of course not i walked into a branch in the backyard ryan pressed down on the scratch as if trying to make it disappear look i think you better tell me whats going on he lowered his voice to a whisper why would you think im involved with julia julia recently broke up with her boyfriend he says she was seeing someone else what would make you think that someone is me you were seen together in the park with the baby ryans face was a road map of confusing wrinkles i dont know wait okay yes i did run into julia in the park a few weeks ago i think it was i was there with kyle julia was walking the dog we talked for a few minutes is that what this is about cindy quickly digested this new information could she be mistaken had ryan and julia simply bumped into each other in the park was that all there was to it i found the phone number for granger mcallister among julias things she said with renewed determination so so what would julia be doing with the number for granger mcallister i have no idea hadnt tom once told her that innocent people rarely embellish that only the guilty feel compelled to provide answers or excuses was she wrong about ryan being the new mystery man in julias life was he as innocent as he appeared to be the door swung open as if by itself and a ghostly apparition suddenly materialized in the front hall that probably my fault faith said her voice seeming to emanate from somewhere outside her body im so sorry cindy i forgot to tell ryan you wanted him to call ryan rushed toward his wife who was looking pale and glassy eyed in her long white cotton nightgown he snaked his arm protectively around her waist what do you mean whats your fault about a month ago faith recited without emotion i locked myself out of the house i didnt know what to dothe baby was insideand then i saw julia coming down the street so i asked her to please call ryan at work but then i remembered we keep a spare set of keys under the mat so there was no need to call him after all im so sorry cindy shook her head feeling both foolish and dejected theres nothing for you to be sorry about if anything im the one who should be apologizing to both of you is something wrong faith asked julias missing her husband told her missing since thursday morning cindy said i was hoping ryan might know something anything i wish i could help you ryan said we havent seen her faith added okay well if you think of anything anything at all well call you the sellicks said together cindy walked down the outside steps hearing their front door close behind her fifteen the police arrived at just after ten oclock tuesday morning cindy had been up since three when shed jumped out of bed in a sweat certain shed forgotten to take the pills that were keeping her alive shed let out a long chain of expletives and climbed back under the covers but of course sleep was now impossible too many thoughts too much fear too many possibilities too much anger how could she have confronted ryan that way what was the matter with her at five shed given up on sleep and turned on the tv hoping for something suitably mindnumbing to lull her back into unconsciousness something like blind date shed hoped thoughts drifting to neil she doubted shed hear from him again despite his promises to call later she recognized there was only so much unsolicited drama a man could take there was a point when intrigue degenerated into irritant cindy suspected shed already passed that point at seven she was walking elvis around the block at seventhirty tom called to say hed just driven back from muskoka had she heard from their daughter she told him julia was still missing and he should get his ass over to her house as soon as possible he told her he didnt appreciate the profanity she told him to fuck off an hour and a half later resplendent in a dark blue suit a lighter blue shirt and a blueandgoldstriped tie tom arrived with the cookie who was wearing black pants and a pink silk shirt she took one look at cindy in her baggy jeans and old mauve tshirt and shook her head as if she couldnt quite believe her husband had once actually shared a bed with this woman let alone produced a child as beautiful and fashionsavvy as julia at ninethirty cindy called the police a few minutes after ten oclock detectives bartolli and gill were at her door cindy ushered them into the living room introducing the policemen to her mother and her younger daughter as elvis ran around in excited circles convinced they were all there to see him cindy remained in the entranceway as everyone arranged themselves around the room the two policemen pulling out their notepads and perching on the ends of their chairs what was your daughter wearing when you saw her last detective gill asked his voice carrying traces of a soft jamaican lilt a towel cindy realized looking to heather for help heather was sitting on the sofa between her father and her grandmother norma appleton had insisted she wasnt going anywhere until julia was found what im going to leave with you fainting all over the place shed asked thank god leigh had gone home although she was threatening to come back later she was wearing her red leather pants and that white top she has with the vneck and short sleeves heather said detective bartolli jotted that down then held up the photol s tgraph cindy had given him friday and this is the most recent t picture you have of her cindy looked from her husband to the cookie who was standing in front of the fireplace as if afraid she might crease her pants were she to sit down yes cindy tried not to picture the other photographs of her daughter in varying stages of undress can you describe julias mood on thursday morning detective bartolli asked as he had asked last friday she was screaming at everyone banging on doors being totally unreasonable cindy thought what she said was she was excited a little nervous she had a big audition coming up she was being julia cindy thought listening as tom explained the nature of julias audition ill need an address for this michael kinsolver detective gill said kinsolving tom corrected spelling the name slowly threetwozero yorkville suite twozerofour i can get you his phone number that wont be necessary thank you so you last saw julia at what time mrs carver i havent seen her since last tuesday the cookie replied he was talking to me cindy said icily the cookie raised her eyebrows arranged her lips in a stubborn pout it was a little after ten cindy said i was going out so i went to her room to say goodbye and wish her good luck on her audition and she yelled at me not to come in because she was naked said i was slowing her down i just peeked my head in the door wished her good luck she repeated and then you went out the cookie asked accusingly yes im allowed out every now and then i was here heather volunteered you were here when julia left yes it was around eleven oclock apparently julia had a fight with heathers boyfriend just before she went out cindy interjected it was nothing heather glared at her mother she was yelling at me too detective gill looked up from his notepad exchanged looks with his partner your boyfriends name is duncan duncan rossi address he lives here again the partners exchanged glances while cindys mother shifted uncomfortably in her seat and the cookie rolled her eyes tom gave a look that said it wasnt my idea where is duncan now out heather said i dont know where she added when the look on everyones faces made it clear more information was expected well have to talk to him detective bartolli said heather nodded turned away well need a list of all julias friends detective gill said cindy felt a wave of guilt so strong it nearly knocked her off her feet what kind of mother was she that she didnt know her daughters friends i can probably be of help to you in that regard tom said as if reading cindys mind until quite recently julia lived with me the officers nodded as if this was something they heard every day but cindy knew what they were thinking they were questioning what kind of mother she was that her daughter had chosen to live with her father she couldnt blame them how many times had she asked herself that same question but she was living with you now yes cindy said for almost a year do you mind my asking why she was no longer living with you mr carver detective bartolli asked tom smiled although cindy could tell from the tight set of his jaw that he most certainly did mind he was uncomfortable with being questioned unused to being put on the spot that was his job after all tom and i moved into a new condo after we got married the cookie answered for him theres only so much room five thousand square feet cindy said just loud enough to be heard how did julia feel about your remarriage detective gill asked tom was she upset about it the marriage was almost two years ago and no julia wasnt the least bit upset she loves fiona the cookie smiled and tossed her hair proudly from one shoulder to the other and where were you on thursday mr carver i beg your pardon we have to ask detective gill apologized are you insinuating i had anything to do with my daughters disappearance my husband is a very important attorney the cookie said cindy rolled her eyes amazed that people actually said things like my husband is a very important attorney except on television i was at my office tom replied testily you can check with my colleagues if you honestly think thats necessary detective bartolli nodded jotted this information in his notepad and turned toward cindy whod been discreetly enjoying her exhusbands discomfort how often after all did she get to see tom squirm was your daughter on any kind of medication he asked medication painkillers antidepressants julia wasnt depressed cindy told the two officers as she had told them at least half a dozen times already why do you keep insisting she was depressed mrs carver detective bartolli explained patiently you have to understand that we get missing persons reports like this every day and half the time the person in question turns out to be someone who was feeling a little down and just decided to take off for a few days and the other half detective bartolli looked toward his partner detective gill closed his notepad leaned forward sympathetically to be frank with people your daughters age suicide is our biggest worry suicide cindy repeated numbly julia would never commit suicide heather protested suicide is not an option cindy said recalling her conversation with faith sellick what else do you worry about well of course there exists the possibility of foul play cindy put her hand across her mouth stifled the cry pushing against her lips but were getting way ahead of ourselves here mrs carver theres nothing to suggest any harm has come to your daughter except that nobodys heard from her for five days cindy reminded him and thats unusual of course its unusual cindy tom said in the voice he used whenever he sensed she was about to lose control shed heard that voice often during their marriage there was something perversely comforting in hearing it now does she have any friends who live outoftown she has several acquaintances in new york tom said cindy stared blankly out the back window this whole conversation was ridiculous dont you think she would have told me if she were planning a trip to new york maybe she told you and you forgot the cookie said is it possible she told you and you forgot tom repeated as if the cookie had never spoken flashback julia at thirteen gets up from the kitchen table after dinner and walks out of the room her mother calls her back reminds her to put her dishes in the dishwasher her father immediately echoes that request julia put your dishes in the dishwasher he repeats julia reluctantly saunters back to the table does as her father says why do you always do that cindy demands after julia has retreated to her room do what i tell her to do something then you repeat it as if my word doesnt carry enough weight im supporting you damn it no youre undermining me nice to see some things never change even if wives do cindy thought now smiling in spite of herself she didnt tell me she told her exhusband i didnt forget youre sure she didnt cindy repeated biting off each word i didnt fine no need to get upset no need to get upset cindy countered nobody has seen or heard from julia since thursday morning id say theres plenty of reason to get upset tom glanced at the detectives as if to say you see what i have to deal with you understand now why i left so you were of the understanding that julia was coming home directly after her audition detective bartolli asked i wasnt sure what her plans were but she was supposed to be at a dress fitting at four oclock my granddaughter bianca is getting married norma appleton interjected julia and heather are bridesmaids so she didnt show up for her fitting detective gill scribbled this fact in his notepad was it common for julia not to show up for appointments no cindy said yes tom corrected julia can be very willful in what way in the way of most twentyoneyearold women tom smiled knowingly at the two detectives but you cant think of any reason your daughter might take off for a few days without telling anyone no cindy said yes the cookie disagreed excuse me why is that mrs carver because shes a moron cindy answered i believe detective gill was talking to me the cookie said o pointedly you think julia might have taken off without telling anyone i think its possible why is that because she was always complaining that she didnt have any privacy that her mother was always on her case you are so full of shit cindy said cindy please tom warned what exactly is this birdbrain trying to do here tom what did you call me is she trying to sabotage this investigation is she trying to make it seem less urgent than it is excuse me but im right here the cookie said waving her hand in the air the huge diamond sparkler on her ring finger flashing like a strobe light in cindys eyes maybe it is less urgent than it seems tom said very clever cindy admitted despising his easy glibness our daughter has been missing for five days i know that then whats the matter with you why arent you more concerned why arent you tearing your hair out because you wont let me tom jumped to his feet began pacing back and forth elvis barking beside him because youre frantic enough for everybody somebody has to stay calm somebody has to behave like a rational human being shut up elvis oh god are you going to faint again cindys mother demanded rushing to her daughters side you fainted heather asked when the other day her grandmother said good thing her sister was here to catch her im fine cindy assured everyone im not going to faint ill make some coffee norma appleton offered heading for the kitchen you sit down i dont want to sit down dont be so stubborn tom said dont tell me what to do again tom looked at the detectives as if to say you see what i have put up with you see why i had to leave mrs carver detective bartolli said yes said cindy yes said the cookie cindy gritted her teeth took a deep breath grabbed one hand with the other to keep from wrapping them around the cookies neck can we go over the events of last thursday morning one more time detective bartolli asked theres nothing to go over cindy insisted julia was getting ready for her audition she was excited nervous i went out about tenfifteen to buy some wine apparently she was running late so she asked duncan to give her a lift they had a fight cindy said a fight so intense it spilled out into the street so loud it attracted the attention of the neighbors what was the fight about julia got angry when duncan said he didnt have time to take her to her audition heather explained patiently and she threw her usual tantrum she was fighting with everyone that morning she looked guiltily toward her mother you had a fight with your daughter mrs carver detective gill asked it was hardly a fight what were you fighting about tom asked it was nothing cindy motioned toward the dog i wanted her to take elvis for a walk she said she had to take a shower she was banging on the bathroom door trying to get duncan to hurry up i told her to stop stuff like that nothing important nothing else she didnt want to go to the fitting heather said she would have gone cindy insisted she wouldnt just not show up she wouldnt not come home for five days she wouldnt not call take it easy tom cautioned i dont want to take it easy i want these policemen to stop asking questions and go out and find my daughter have you talked to sean banack whats sean got to do with this norma appleton asked coming back into the living room coffeell be ready in just a minute we talked to him briefly on friday and well be talking to him again this morning what about cindys mother asked mom please ill tell you later i understand this is a very difficult time for you mrs carver detective gill said staring directly at cindy leaving no doubt whom he was talking to but the more we know about julia the better our chances are of finding her can you tell me anything else about her her hobbies what she likes to do places she frequents she likes the rivoli the cookie answered before cindy had a chance to formulate a response the rivoli comedy club on queen street heather said i didnt know that cindy thought why didnt i know that what about the dance clubs tom smiled she gave that scene up years ago does your daughter drink no cindy said occasionally tom corrected what about drugs what about them cindy asked she went through the usual phase all young people do tom said she did cindy wondered why wasnt i told why didnt i know but i sat her down tom continued had a long talk with her told her that if she wanted to be a successful actress she had to get serious that id help her as much as i could but only if she stopped goofing around and started focusing luckily she listened you sat her down cindy thought you talked to her you told her she had to get serious that youd help her as much as you could you pompous ass cindy rubbed her forehead what happens now she asked we go back to the station file a missing persons report the reportersll be all over this one detective gill held up julias picture a pretty girl like this actress daughter of a prominent attorney itll be front page news is that good or bad cindy asked a bit of both the public can be very helpful but dont be surprised if once this news gets out you start getting a lot of crank calls if necessary well put a tap on your phone try weeding out the crazies try not to worry mrs carver detective bartolli said shell turn up cindy stared at the detectives through eyes rapidly filling with tears thank you she said in the meantime if you think of anything else there is something cindy said seeing ryans face in the blur of her tears wondering again if he was really as innocent as he claimed whats that my neighbor ryan sellick you might want to have a talk with him sixteen okay cindy whats going on why havent you returned any of our messages meg was asking cindy cindy are you there cindy brushed her lips against the receiver pictured meg and trish huddled together on the other end of the line julias missing she whispered what i didnt hear you julias missing cindy repeated louder this time what do you mean shes missing cindy said nothing what more was there to say well be right over cindy replaced the receiver shifted her gaze to the floor she didnt look up if she did she knew shed see her mother and daughter watching her from their seats at the kitchen table and shed have to contend with the worry in their eyes and she didnt want to have to deal with their worry she didnt want to have to deal with their fears she didnt want to have to deal with anybody elses problems damn it she just wanted julia to come home wasnt that all shed ever wanted who was that her mother asked meg she and trish are coming over cindys voice wobbled like a tire running out of air i better make some more coffee cindy continued staring at the floor mom heather asked are you okay i cant move cindy thought i cant think i cant breathe im okay she said youre not going to faint again are you her mother asked im not going to faint is there anything you want me to do heather asked you can take the dog for a walk sure come on elvis lets go to the park elvis was immediately up and at the front door his tail wagging in blissful abandon i saw her yesterday cindy heard a man say she was sitting right over there he pointed at the park bench she was crying her heart out heather wait what cindy watched her daughters feet cut across her line of vision she needs new sneakers cindy thought idly and some new clothes for school didnt classes start this week cindy shook her head she couldnt remember why were you crying in the park what a man saw you there last week crying your eyes out he said heather shrugged shook her head wasnt me heather be back soon she headed for the front door why dont you sit down cindys mother advised after heather was gone i dont want to sit down youll make yourself sick by standing her mother approached put gentle arms around cindys shoulders led her to the nearest chair sat her down youve done everything you can sweetheart now you have to let the police handle things what if they cant what if they never find her theyll find her young women disappear all the time sometimes they never come home shell come home her mother insisted as cindy sucked the words into her lungs as if she were running out of air suddenly she was back on her feet i cant just sit here and do nothing you have to stay calm you have to stay hopeful the police will call as soon as they have any information i cant wait i have to do something cindy ran to the front door and opened it wait cindy what are you doing where are you going i have to get out of here cindy ran down the steps to her driveway climbed inside her car darling please your friends will be here any minute where are you cindy backed her car onto the street shot toward avenue road less than five minutes later she was running along yorkville almost colliding with several cameratoting tourists on the popular boutiquelined street im sorry she shouted as she ran her eyes scanning the numbers of the tony twostory buildings until she found number she pulled open the front door took a deep breath then waited until she was confident shed regained her composure before slowly walking up the stairs to suite seconds later she was standing in a small waiting area in front of a pencil thing young man with pointy black hair im here to see joy fielding michael kinsolving she told him surprised her the young man raised his fingers left hand resting against the tip of his desk to check his datebook cindy appleton she clumsy on her tongue like a im with the film festival im with the film festival do you have an appointment of course of course cindy on time the young man calendar im sorry seem to have you down it very important with regard to mr scheduling kinsolving can cindy able fit the the skin popped his now than waiting for cares theyre all waiting for festivals director what makes a star theyre at chair worn studying his manicured fingernails say you are youre certainly not from breath of air eyes flitting across the bare is cindy carver carver michael repeated still not looking at her why is that name familiar my husband my exhusband is tom carver a smile forced its way onto her lips still no sign the hollywood director had any idea who she was my daughter is julia carver she had an audition with you last thursday morning at eleven oclock michael kinsolving glanced questioningly at the skinny spiky haired young man hovering in the doorway yes the young man replied drawing out the word into several syllables i believe someone from mr carvers office called to ask whether shed kept that appointment and had she michael kinsolvings voice was strong and clear the voice of a man used to giving orders yes so whats the problem the director asked shes missing cindy told him watching his brow crease his green eyes narrow the same color eyes as julia she thought missing nobody has seen or heard from her since she left this office what are you saying that she walked out of here and vanished into thin air we dont know whats happened to her cindy admitted her voice filling with tears i guess i was hoping you might be able to shed some light on the situation if you know anything at all that might help us find her michael kinsolving stood up slowly and walked to cindys side the top of his head in line with the tip of her nose and what would i know exactly i guess i was hoping that she might have said something to you about her plans why would she do that i dont know already cindy regretted her decision to come here had she really thought michael kinsolving might be able to help her she probably took off with some guy she knew you wouldnt approve of he offered with a smirk trust me i know whereof i speak i have three daughters myself cindy vaguely recalled having read that michael kinsolving had five children from four different marriages of course they live with their mothers of course cindy acknowledged with a nod didnt all daughters choose to live with their mothers after their parents divorced all except julia im sorry but i dont see how i can help you the director pulled a tissue from his jean pocket and offered it to cindy cindy noted how muscular his arms were despite his diminuitive size did she give a good audition talent is the least of it did you say anything to her that might have upset her your eyes are too small your lips are too thin did she seem depressed to you when she left did women look at her and think lost soul did men look at her and think dear god i wish there was something i could tell you to put your mind at ease michael kinsolving was saying but to be perfectly frank i dont even remember the girl oh youd remember julia shes twentyone very beautiful slim blond cindy stopped looked at the television screen understanding that for the past week michael kinsolvings office had been inundated with slim blond beautiful women the director looked to his assistant for help do we have a tape on her the assistant nodded ill get it he backed out of the room michael kinsolving guided cindy around his desk to his chair would you like some bottled water or maybe an espresso water would be great l s twith gas or without cindy shook her head unable to choose philip michael kinsolving called toward the next room some perrier for mrs carver can i call you cindy of course cindy the director smiled extended his hand michael she took his hand felt the strength in his fingers suddenly understood why women found him so attractive my hands are cold she apologized cold hands warm heart he said with a smile was he flirting with her cindy wondered quickly returning her hand to her lap disconcerted by the thought was it possible hed come on to julia philip reentered the room carrying a glass of sparkling water and a tape cassette he handed the glass to cindy then crossed to the television against the far wall i believe shes on this tape shall i put it on please michael directed as his assistant removed the existing tape and replaced it with another cindy took a small sip of water felt the bubbles bursting against her nose like smelling salts she watched the tape flicker on held her breath as a young womans face filled the screen like the woman before her this woman was blond and beautiful cindy found herself focusing on her lips were they too thin she wondered i believe shes number eight philip lastforwarded the tape a parade of lovely young women flew across the largescreen tv their arms jerking up and down like marionettes their heads turning this way and that as if controlled by invisible strings their blond hair shaking from one shoulder to the other as the tape raced to find her daughter so many women so little time michael mused out loud sorry didnt mean to sound glib cindy shook her head in truth shed barely heard him and it was only his apology that gave the words weight allowed them to sink in she winced as the tape came to an abrupt halt julias face filling the screen philip pressed another button and the image froze julia sat across the room staring at her mother from inside a large rectangular box her bright smile frozen on her face oh yes michael said i remember her now her fathers a lawyer he does some work for our company thats the one philip confirmed once more receding into the background yes she gave a very nice reading michael continued absently leaning back against the front of his desk are you sure you want to see this please he signaled to his assistant who pressed the appropriate button unfreezing the frame and bringing julia to life julias audition a beautiful young woman sits on a small wooden chair crosses one spectacular leg over the other she is wearing red leather pant sand a white blouse which glares slightly under the harsh light the camera slowly moves in on her face as she states her name julia carver she pronounces clearly then gives the name of her agent she lowers her head her hair falling across her face several seconds pass before she raises her head again and when she does it is almost as if julia has disappeared and another girl has taken her place this girl is tougher angrier sexier and there is something else something her defiant posture tries to hide behind the anger the toughness the undeniable sexuality there is a sadness a hunger a raw need julia leans back throws one elbow over the back of her chair her eyes moving up and down an j or invisible visitor the eyes of a lost soul well well look whos here she says what happened forget your cigarettes i came back to see you an offcamera voice replies julias eyebrows arch in a gesture that is achingly familiar is that supposed to make me go all weak in the knees she asks is it because if it is its not working see my knees arent weak at all she recrosses her legs with provocative slowness then leans forward speaks directly into the camera lens whats the matter baby disappointed surprised thought you could just waltz back into my life and everything would be the same as it was before you ran off with my best friend how is amy by the way no dont tell me the fact youre back is all the answer i need caroline the offcamera voice interrupts i could have told you she was a lousy lay the words roll off julias tongue like a stray caress i could have spared you the time and trouble i was her roommate for how many years i saw the men come and go i heard the phony groans the fake orgasms she thought were fooling them but none of them were the fool you turned out to be julia throws her head back laughs unpleasantly whats the matter baby you come back for a real woman someone who doesnt have to fake it when you touch her someone who loves the feel of you pounding away inside her night and day day and night julia begins fidgeting in her seat moving her hips in time to some distant obscene rhythm any time all the time is that what you miss baby is that why youve come home caroline the voice says flatly amy and i got married last night the hard mask covering julias face melts away as tears overwhelm her eyes you got married last night julia says nothing she simply stares into the camera her tears spilling down her cheeks washing away all traces of pride her face an open wound the push of a button the scene ended julias anguished face stared at her mother from inside her fiftytwoinch prison i had no idea cindy began how good she is michael asked quietly yes yes shes very good michael agreed would you like to see it again cindy shook her head another viewing of the tape and theyd have to scrape her off the floor i could have a copy made if youd like thank you there was the sound of footsteps on the stairs philip stepped into the waiting room returned seconds later his pale face ashen its the police you called the police michael asked clearly more amused than annoyed cindy shook her head as the two detectives strode purposefully into the room michael kinsolving detective bartolli asked his partner right behind both men stopped abruptly when they saw julias face on the large tv screen slowly they pivoted in cindys direction mrs carver what are you doing here detective gill asked accusingly michael kinsolving shook the officers hands mrs carver was hoping i might be able to be of some help in finding her daughter and were you im afraid i have no idea where her daughter might be we were just showing mrs carver a tape of julias audition philip volunteered from the doorway can i get anyone some bottled water or an espresso perhaps detective bartolli shook his head detective gill will drive you home mrs carver he said his voice bristling with annoyance at her unexpected presence thats all right i have my car ill walk you to it detective gill said leaving no room for discussion ill get a copy of the audition tape over to you as soon as possible michael said thank you cindy rose slowly from the chair depositing her barely touched glass of perrier on the directors desk then shuffling toward the door her feet numb unable to feel the floor she paused in the doorway good luck at the festival thank you good luck finding your daughter julia nodded aware of detective gills firm grasp on her elbow id like to have a look at that tape she heard detective bartolli say as the door to the inner office closed and detective gill led her toward the stairs seventeen d i j r k clouds were gathering overhead as cindy pulled into her driveway she recognized megs red mercedes on the street as she ran up the front stairs to her house fumbling in her purse for her key the front door opened just as she was reaching for it where have you been trish asked pulling her inside elvis leaping toward her thighs yourmothers been frantic just like old times meg said joining trish in the hallway and taking cindy into her arms are you all right cindy nodded against her friends shoulder im okay where have you been trish asked again where did you go norma appleton demanded joining the women in the front hall i went to see michael kinsolving michael kinsolving the director trish asked whyd you go see him meg asked does he know where julia is cindys mother asked at the same time cindy shook her head he says he doesnt you dont believe him i dont know would you like to fuck her she heard the director ask wondering if hed posed the same question to others regarding julia he claimed he didnt even remember her that hes seen so many girls her voice faded disappeared but then he acknowledged how very good she was and how could anyone forget julia have some lunch norma appleton urged ushering the women into the kitchen im not hungry your mothers been filling us in meg said i cant imagine what youre going through what do the police think trish asked cindy shrugged that its too early to panic theyre right i know doesnt help does it no trish hugged her sat down beside her as meg pulled up another chair wrapped her arms around cindy wheres heather cindy asked out said shed be back later norma appleton swayed from one foot to the other as if weighing her options i think ill go upstairs and watch tv she announced finally come on elvis you can keep me company meg she called from the top of the stairs make sure she eats something will do meg called back then is she driving you nuts only a little i remember when my mother came to help out after jeremy was born trish began what a time that was trish meg said that was twenty years ago trust me im still reeling cindy laughed a tentative trickle that wobbled through the still air joy fielding j she flew in from florida arrived in the middle of a giant snowstorm the plane was like three hours late arriving and she was angry because no one could get to the airport to pick her up and god forbid she had to take a limo and she marched into the apartment complaining about all things canadian especially her oldest daughter who was inconsiderate enough to have given birth in february of all months i can still hear her say that february of all months anyway she proceeded to wreak havoc for the next several weeks i couldnt do anything right why had i allowed myself to gain so much weight during my pregnancy why was i nursing when i probably didnt have enough milk i was going to have one awfully spoiled baby on my hands if i insisted on feeding him each time he cried i could literally hear her gasp with horror every time i picked him up his head watch his head like i was this total moron of course i couldnt yell at her so i took it out on bill almost ended the marriage right then and there no wonder jeremys an only child families meg shook her head you gotta love em do you trish asked in the end what else is there friends cindy said reaching for their hands entwining her fingers with theirs trying to ignore the echo of toms distant voice in her ear friends hed said dismissively friends come and go which probably accounted for julias revolving door approach to friendship so tell your friends exactly whats going on trish said cindy immediately recounted the details of last thursday morning the chaos surrounding her final moments with julia so youd been arguing trish said in summation we werent arguing all right you werent arguing you were upset i wasnt upset okay you werent upset i s tmaybe her audition didnt go well meg offered as others had offered before maybe she just needed some space could there be a new guy trish asked its been five days cindy interrupted her friends verbally italicizing each word yes but but what this is julia were talking about trish reminded her you know how she can be meg said do you honestly think shes that inconsiderate that shed disappear for this long without a word to anyone had trish always been this obtuse cindy found herself wondering tom hasnt heard from her either meg asked tom hasnt heard from her either cindy repeated sliding her hands into her lap as a tight smile froze on her lips she imagined her body melting into liquid and spilling off her chair forming an unwieldy puddle on the floor much like the wicked witch of the west who dissolved when dorothy threw water at her head megs question was like that water cindy thought seemingly innocent on the surface but capable of great damage like acid it seeped painfully between cindys ears burning the words into delicate tissue tom hasnt heard from her either fcindy felt strangely insubstantial a feeling shed often experienced during her marriage and then again immediately after her divorce as if she were somehow less solid without tom at her side as if his presence was necessary to give hers relevance as if her opinions her worries her observations werent enough without his acknowledgment and approval tom hasnt heard from her either cindy knew that meg would be both alarmed and horrified to think her words had been interpreted in such a manner so cindy tried hard to give the question context assign it its proper perspective still the words lingered small thorns tearing at her already bruised flesh she smiled at her oldest and closest friend understanding that despite megs obvious sympathy for her plight she had absolutely no idea of the turmoil raging inside her brain how little we know of what really goes on in peoples minds cindy was thinking her eyes traveling back and forth between the two women the smile slowly sliding from her lips how little we j o r know one another at all are you all right meg asked her hand reaching over to smooth some fine hairs from cindys forehead cindy shrugged stared toward the backyard so tell us about michael kinsolving trish said is he as sexy as people say cindy recognized trishs question for the diversionary tactic it was still it felt strange to be talking about michael kinsolvings sexuality under the circumstances bankable is fuck able she heard him say his face is all pockmarked she answered deciding to go with the flow and hes short how short tom cruiseshort why are all the men in hollywood so little trish asked and he didnt remember julia meg asked incredulously cindys heartbeat quickened at the mention of her daughters name not at first but after we watched the tape what tape julias audition you should see it shes amazing im not surprised meg said shes so talented trish concurred although neither woman had ever seen julia act cindy recalled the directors face at the conclusion of the viewing i think he was impressed i think hed forgotten how good she was talent talent is the least of it do you want to fuck her well thats great then meg enthused it means hell rel s tmember her when she comes home she added her voice trailing away disappearing into the air like smoke from a cigarette when she comes home cindy repeated clinging to the words as if they were life buoys in a choppy sea when she comes home ill buy her those miss sixty jeans shes been coveting ill take her to new york for a holiday weekend just the two of us shes okay cindy trish was saying shell turn up safe and sound youll see how can that be cindy demanded hearing her voice rise how can someone disappear for almost a week and then just show up safe and sound how is that possible julias not a child she didnt wander off and get lost and she didnt run away from home because she had a fight with her mother had she shes not a silly romantic like i was she didnt elope with some guy to niagara falls had she shes not flighty or naive shes had disappointing auditions before she knows the odds of getting cast in a major hollywood movie did she i know you both think shes selfish and selfabsorbed no we dont think that its okay sweetie meg said soothingly its okay its not okay cindy shot back angrily julia wouldnt just take off without telling me she certainly wouldnt take off without telling her father i didnt mean trish began i was just trying meg continued she knows her actions have consequences she knows id be worried sick she wouldnt put me through this of course she wouldnt the two friends agreed so where is she cindy wailed the sound of her voice bringing elvis galloping back down the stairs his barking mixing with her cries underlining and surrounding her anguish where is she cindy was lying in her bed watching a peppy young woman named ricki lake interviewing a bunch of alternately sullen and giggly teenage girls why do you think your friend dresses like a slut ricki asked sprightly pushing the phallicshaped microphone into a girls face her lips arent too thin cindy flipped the channel before the girl could reply watched as a handsome man named montel williams cast overly earnest eyes toward a trembling young woman in the seat beside him how old were you when your father first molested you he asked i want women to look at this girl and think lost soul i want men to look at her and think blowjob another press of the button and montel was replaced by oprah then jenny then maury then someone named judge judy a thoroughly unpleasant woman who seemed to think that justice could best be served by insulting all those who stood before her did she ask for your advice judge judy demanded angrily of the hapless middleaged woman in front of her just because shes your daughter doesnt mean you can tell her how to run her life my daughter is julia carver cindy flipped to comedy central hoping for a laugh my mothers from another planet a young female comic was espousing she paused actually shes from hell cindy turned off the tv tossing the remote to the end of the bed just missing elvis who glanced at her with accusing eyes before jumping to the floor and skulking from the room downstairs she could hear her mother in the kitchen preparing dinner probably she should get out of bed go down and help out but she was too tired to move too drained to offer even token assistance the phone rang hello cindy prayed for the sound of her daughters voice braced herself for the inevitable disappointment are you okay meg asked on the other end of the line im fine i felt terrible after we left meg continued like we failed you somehow you didnt i just wish there was something we could say or do there isnt i could come over later no thats all right im pretty tired you need your rest i need julia awkward silence try to think positive sure why not why didnt i think of that im trying i love you meg said i know cindy told her i love you too cindy replaced the receiver buried her face in her hands think positively she corrected feeling her breath warm inside her cupped palms she lifted her head glared at the phone did i ask for your advice she demanded in judge judys strident voice she knew she was being unfair that meg was only saying what she herself would probably say if their situations were reversed she knew her friends concern was genuine her love and support unwavering she understood that both meg and trish wanted to be there for her to comfort and protect her but she also recognized that despite their best intentions they could never really understand what she was going through just as theyd never wholly comprehended the sorrow shed lived with all those years julia spent living with her dad trish with her husband and perfect son meg with two wonderful boys of her own mothers of just sons her own mother had once told her theyre a different breed they have no idea it wasnt that her friends were insensitive cindy thought in fact they were kind and considerate and thoughtful and everything true friends should be they just didnt get it how could they they had no idea this is julia were talking about you know how she can be defining moment tom across from her at the breakfast table fingers digging into the morning paper he holds high in front of his face nothings ever enough for you he says between tightly gritted teeth theyve been fighting since last night cindy can barely remember what the argument is about thats not true she counters weakly lifting her glass of orange juice to her lips wishing he would put the paper down so that she could see his face of course its true face it cindy i just dont measure up to your lofty standards what are you talking about i never said that you said i stabbed leo marshall in the back i said i was surprised you badmouthed the man in front of his client his client is worth four hundred million dollars he wasnt getting his moneys worth with leo he will with me i thought leo marshall was your friend friends tom sniffs friends come and cindy feels the glass of orange juice tremble in her hands so the end justifies the means in most cases yes can you get off your high horse now can you put the paper down i dont know what more you want from me i want you to put the paper down please he lowers the paper glowers at her from across the table there you happy papers down you got your way this isnt about getting my way papers down isnt it thats not the issue tom glances impatiently at his watch look its eightthirty much as id love to sit here arguing issues with you all morning some of us have to go to work he pushes back his chair i have a meeting tonight dont count on me for dinner who is she this time cindy asks tom gets to his feet says nothing tom she says her grip on her glass tightening he looks at her shakes his head what now he says probably it is the now and not the fact of another woman that gets her this she says simply then hurls the contents of the glass at his face that moment was the end of her marriage although she and tom remained together for several more years the minute that orange juice left her glass divorce was inevitable it became strictly a matter of time a gathering of energy it was the same with meg and trish cindy realized now an ineffable sadness seeping through her pores settling into her bones this is julia were talking about you know how she can be maybe it hadnt been as dramatic as a tossed glass of juice but another defining moment had quietly yet inexorably slipped by yes meg and trish were her dearest friends yes she loved them o and they loved her but unforeseen circumstance had intervened and their friendship had been subtly and forever altered try as the three friends might to pretend otherwise cindy understood that their relationship would never quite be the same again another woman had come between them her name was julia eighteen cindy opened her eyes to find julia staring at her from across the room she pushed herself away from her pillow holding her breath watching as the familiar photo of her daughter enlarged to fill the entire tv screen cindy lunged toward it straining to hear the announcers voice but the words failed to register she reached for the remote control to raise the volume but it wasnt beside her where are you damn it she said frantic hands pawing at the folds of the blueandwhite flowered comforter she vaguely remembered having tossed it toward the end of the bed earlier in the day how long ago she wondered glancing at the clock noting that it was just minutes after pm that despite the bleakness of the sky darkness was still several hours away she must have fallen asleep she realized as the back of her hand slapped against the remote knocking it from the bed it shot into the air and plummeted to the floor landing with a dull thud on the carpet before bouncing out of sight instantly cindy was off the bed and on her hands and knees the carpets stale scent pushing into her nostrils as she pressed her cheek against its soft pile she lifted the white dust ruffle and poked her head under the bed her hands fumbling around in the dark until they connected with the stubborn object damn it she said bumping her head as she struggled to her feet aiming the remote at the television screen as if it were a gun increasing the volume until the announcers voice was all but shouting in her ear except that he was no longer talking about julia her daughters picture had been replaced by an aerial view of canadas wonderland where the announcer intoned solemnly a little boy of eight had been sexually molested only hours before cindy changed the channel a farmers field popped into view it took cindyseveral seconds to realize she was looking at an old dilapidated barn in a sea of swaying cornstalks oh no cindy clasped her hand across her mouth to still the screams building in her throat theyd found julias body in an abandoned barn off the king sideroad seans story had led them to her tom and battered remains no no no cindy her mother was yelling as elvis began barking from somewhere beside her cindy whats wrong her mother was suddenly beside her sliding the remote control unit from her daughters hands returning the tvs volume to a normal level it was only then that cindy was able to digest the announcers words to understand that the cornfield in question wasnt anywhere near the king sideroad but rather somewhere outside midland that the story concerned bumper crops of corn and had absolutely nothing to do with julia i thought what darling julia was there something about julia her mother began flipping through the channels i saw her picture they were talking about her were they or had she just dreamed it and then there she was again the tilted head the dazzling eyes the straight blond hair falling toward her shoulder the knowing smile turn it up turn it up police are searching for clues in the disappearance of twentyoneyearold julia carver daughter of prominent entertainment lawyer tom carver the aspiring actress was last seen thursday morning august twentyninth after leaving an audition with noted hollywood director michael kinsolving julias photo was instantly replaced by one of michael kinsolving his arms around two voluptuous blond starlets police have questioned the famed director in town to preview his latest film at the toronto international film festival and to scout locations for his next movie but insist he is not a suspect in the young womans disappearance the newscasters bland face replaced michael kinsolvings while julias picture reappeared in a small square at the right top of the screen anyone with any information regarding julia carvers whereabouts is urged to contact local police i guess that makes it official norma appleton said collapsing on the end of the bed her face ashen her eyes wide and blank immediately cindy was at her mothers side oh mom she said im so sorry ive been so consumed with my own worry i havent even thought about how this might be affecting you the last thing i want is for you to start worrying about me youre her grandmother her mother lowered her head my first grandchild she whispered oh mom what if she doesnt come home what if we never find out what happened to her shell come home her mother said her voice strong as if the sheer force of her will could keep her granddaughter safe bring her back home cindy nodded afraid to question her further the two women sat at the foot of the bed holding tightly onto one another waiting f r more news of julia it was almost ten oclock when cindy heard the front door open and close she leaned forward in her bed pressed the mute button on the tv and waited as footsteps filled the upstairs hall heather she called heather had phoned to say she wouldnt be home for dinner that she was meeting up with friends but wouldnt be late elvis jumped from the bed ran out of the room heather cindy called again its me duncan answered his face appearing in the doorway elvis leaping against his legs with such enthusiasm he almost knocked him over duncan cindy acknowledged is heather with you duncan shook his head dark hair fell across his forehead he looked tired as if he hadnt slept in days his normally smooth skin was splotchy and pale the stale odor of too many cigarettes wafted from his clothes im sure shell be back soon he said swaying he leaned his shoulder against the wall as if to steady himself are you okay then are you drunk duncans eyebrows drew together at the bridge of his nose as if he were giving the question serious consideration no well maybe just a bit why why he repeated why were you drinking he laughed an annoyingly girlish giggle cindy hadnt heard before does there have to be a reason i dont think ive ever seen you drunk before yeah well when did you start smoking cindy pressed what smoking and drinkingits just not you i dont do it very often duncan said defensively just every now and then you know i dont know mrs carver youre making me a little nervous here what are you nervous about are you upset with me about something why would i be upset with you i dont know you just seem upset yeah you dont think i have good reason to be upset duncan glanced down the hall toward the bedroom he shared with heather i didnt say that he paused pushed himself away from the wall wobbled on his heels he took two steps then stopped stared hard at cindy has there been any news he asked carefully about julia no duncan cindy called as he was about to turn away yes whats going on with you and heather duncan swallowed rubbed the side of his nose i dont know what you mean somethings obviously not right between the two of you were just going through a bit of a rough patch mrs carver thats all i really dont feel comfortable talking about it youd tell me wouldnt you if there was anything i should know i dont understand you know something dont you i know im drunker than i thought i was he tried to laugh coughed instead you know something about julia cindy said over the sound of his hacking blood drained from the young mans already pale face he seemed to sober up on the spot about julia no of course not you were fighting with her yeah but and then she disappeared mrs carver you cant think i had anything to do with julias disappearance did you no cindy fell back against her pillow did she really think the boy shed welcomed into her home this young man who was her younger daughters lover was in any way responsible for her older daughters disappearance could she really think that she shook her head she didnt know what to think anymore duncan stood silently in the doorway his arms hanging limply at his sides maybe i should spend the night at macs he said finally youd probably feel more comfortable if i werent around cindy said nothing ill just get a few of my things cindy listened as he shuffled down the hall she thought of running after him wrestling him to the ground beating a confession out of him then she thought of her mother asleep in julias bed what was the point in waking her up by creating a scene duncan wasnt about to confess to anything did she really think he had anything to confess cindy heard him rummaging around in the closet a few seconds later she caught sight of his shadow as it hurried by her room he left without saying goodbye how have you been holding out mrs carver the doctor was asking his face drifting in and out of focus he was a big man o c o with a full beard bushy eyebrows and thinning gray hair ive been better cindy said adjusting the white sheet tucked around her breasts remembering to take your pills cindy rubbed her eyes watching the doctors features flatten and slide across his face what pills its very important that you take your pills mrs carver he was saying if you dont take your pills youll die oh no cindy shot up in bed i forgot i forgot she was halfway to the bathroom her heart pounding against her chest when she stopped what pills she asked out loud glancing toward the television set realizing it was still on that shed fallen asleep sometime before midnight during a rerun of law order and that she was standing naked in the middle of her room in the middle of the night in the middle of the recurring nightmare that was her life what pills she asked again collapsing on the floor and staring at a handsome man in an orange jumpsuit walking glumly across her tv screen the camera lowered to reveal the mans hands in shackles as his head of curly brown hair was pushed roughly inside a waiting police car it took cindy a minute to realize that the man she was watching was ted bundy notorious killer of dozens possibly even hundreds of young women she shuddered unable to turn away transfixed by the announcers deep voice and the killers bottomless stare stay tuned as ted bundy makes a daring escape the announcer intoned solemnly american justice continues after these messages was that what happened to julia cindy couldnt stop herself from wondering had she run into a man whose boyishly handsome exterior belied the heart and soul of a deranged killer had he tricked her into getting into his car charmed her into going back to his place had she tried to fight him off had he used drugs or chains to subdue her was he keeping her prisoner in some dank underground cave so many madmen out there cindy was thinking so many mad men had one of them taken out his rage on her little girl she pushed herself to her feet just as ted bundys smiling face once again filled the screen his crazed eyes quickly settling on her own daring her to confront him the boy next door the announcer proclaimed as cindy groped for the remote control for a station that was ostensibly about art and entertainment it seemed to spend an awful lot of time detailing grisly murders she clicked it off watching the room go instantly dark as if the tv itself had swallowed the light eating its young she thought walking to the window pushing aside the curtains to stare at the backyard there was only a sliver of moon and it was pretty much hidden by the tall maple tree that sat in the center of the sellicks unruly and overgrown lawn she should really do something about the cedar fence that divided their property she thought absently it was starting to cave in at the far end buckling under the extended pressure of a nearby sumac tree all it would take was one good snowfall and that fence would collapse altogether and good fences make good neighbors she thought recalling the lines by robert frost projecting ahead to the coming winter trying to imagine herself in three months time would she still be standing by her bedroom window staring into the darkness waiting for her daughter to come home it was then she saw her she was sitting on the bottom step leading from the patio off the kitchen to the backyard and while cindy couldnt see her face she knew immediately it was julia julia my godjulia she pulled on her terrycloth robe and raced down the stairs elvis at her heels she ran into the kitchen unlocked and opened the sliding glass door in one fluid gesture and vaulted outside the cool night air whipping against her face like a wet towel julia she cried as the girl on the bottom step jumped to her feet and backed into the night mom no its me heather you scared me what are you doing what am doing what are you doing cindy demanded its after three in the morning i couldnt sleep i saw you from my bedroom window i thought you were julia sorry heather said its only me there was a strange gargled quality to heathers voice are you crying cindy inched her way down the steps as if her daughter were a stray kitten who might run away if she moved too fast heather shook her head the sliver of moonlight catching her cheek revealing a path of stillwet tears what is it sweetheart and please dont tell me nothing she added just as the word was leaving heathers lips does it have something to do with duncan heather turned away we split up she acknowledged after a long pause you split up when tonight why cindy asked her voice low i dont know heather released a deep breath of air lifted her palms into the air weve been fighting a lot lately about julia heather looked confused about julia no whats julia got to do with this what were you fighting about sweetheart cindy asked ignoring the question heather shook her head i dont know everything nothing its just so stupid what is we were at this party a few weeks ago heather began slowly and i was talking to this guy i was just talking to him it was perfectly innocent but duncan said i was flirting and we had this whole big argument i thought wed patched it up but then it started up again last week id gone to this club with sheri and jessica and duncan was really upset about it he said i shouldnt be going places like that without him and i said why shouldnt i im not doing anything wrong why cant i just hang out with my girlfriends and have a good time and he said if thats what i wanted i could hang out with my girlfriends every night then tonight we had another big fight and duncan got pretty drunk and i got mad and left with jessica and when i got home i saw his stuff wasnt here so i called him at macs and he said he wasnt coming back that it was over between us oh sweetie he doesnt mean that yes he does he said he doesnt want anything more to do with any of us that were all crazy why would he say that i dont know cindy lied thinking of their earlier confrontation did you see him when he came home yes cindy admitted and he was pretty drunk what did you say to him nothing i just asked him a few questions what sort of questions i just asked him if there was anything he thought i should know about what about julia about julia why would you ask him about her i dont know why does everything always have to be about julia heather demanded suddenly i am so sick and tired of everything always being about julia this isnt about her its about me heather your other daughter remember me heather please your sister is missing o julias not missing what heather looked toward the ground what are you talking about are you saying you know where she is no what are you saying heather reluctantly met her mothers gaze i didnt think she was serious i didnt think shed actually do it what are you saying cindy repeated her voice a low growl tell me the whole thing is just so stupid heather began julia was mad at duncan because he wouldnt give her a lift she was calling him names accusing him of being selfish and ungrateful she said if he was going to live here free of charge the least he could do was make himself useful he told her he wasnt her chauffeur she told him to get the hell out of the house i told her to get the hell out that everyone was sick and tired of her stupid tantrums and she said she couldnt wait to get out that she hated me that i was the bane of her existence and then she said that maybe she wouldnt wait until shed saved up enough money to get her own place maybe shed move out right away today she said maybe she wouldnt even bother coming home after her audition the words pounded against cindys consciousness like a boxers fists what l s ti didnt think she really meant it why didnt you tell me this before when when the police were here you got so angry when fiona suggested julia might want some time to herself you said she was trying to sabotage the investigation i didnt want i mean just in case i didnt know cindy fought to make sense of her daughters words was it possible julia had simply taken off in a fit of pique that she could be so vengeful so thoughtless so cruel that she could disappear as a way of making a point no it wasnt possible no matter how angry julia was at her sister no matter how selfish and selfabsorbed she might be she would never put her family through this kind of prolonged torture she might have stayed away a few hours to teach her sister a lesson possibly even overnight but not this long not this long no cindy said out loud julia would never pull a stunt like this she knows how worried wed all be mom wake up heather said forcefully the only person julia has ever worried about is julia she whatever else heather was about to say was lost as the palm of cindys hand came crashing down against the side of her daughters face heather gasped fell back staggered to the ground oh my baby im so sorry cindy cried immediately reaching for her daughter in the darkness the sliver of moon spotlighting the trickle of blood slowly spreading across heathers mouth like lipstick carelessly applied heather recoiled from her mothers touch no youre not she pushed herself to her feet and ran up the back steps to the patio face it mom she said clinging to the sliding glass door the only thing youre sorry about is that im standing here and julia isnt the simple sentence tumbled down the steps then ricocheted off the damp grass to hit cindy right between the eyes cindy stood at the bottom of the outside steps too weak to move too numb to fall this must be what it feels like to be shot she thought as heather disappeared inside the house the moment right before you collapse cindy looked up at the moons thin arc searching for stars in the cloud carpeted sky but if there were stars they were hiding she thought her eyes drifting toward the house next door faith was at her bedroom window staring down at her it was too dark to read the expression on her face nineteen the phone rang at seven oclock the next morning abruptly pulling cindy out of a boxing ring in the middle of a close match with a faceless opponent blood seeped from her bandaged fingers as she stretched her hand toward the phone the dream receding as she opened her eyes disappearing altogether at the sound of her voice hello she said trying to sound as if shed been up for hours and not as was the case as if shed just fallen asleep cindy carver cindy pushed herself into a sitting position as elvis adjusted his position at her feet who is this its elizabeth kapiza from the national post first let me say how very sorry i am about your daughter whats happened cindy grabbed for the remote control and turned on the television rapidly flipping through the channels her heart pounding wildly against her chest as if trying to escape before the dreadful news descended nothing elizabeth kapiza assured her quickly theres nothing new cindy fell back against her pillows fighting the urge to throw up her forehead clammy and bathed in sweat i dont know if youre familiar with my work elizabeth kapiza was saying cindy pictured the thirtyfiveyearold woman with the pixie haircut and gold loop earrings that were her trademark smiling at her from the side of newspaper boxes across the city i know who you are everyone knew elizabeth kapiza cindy thought even if they didnt read her columns her increasingly high profile was the result of a canny mixture of talent and selfpromotion achieved by carefully injecting herself into the middle of every tragedy she covered be it a local case of child abuse or a case of international terrorism in theory she wrote human interest stories in actual fact she wrote about herself i was wondering if i could come by and talk to you its seven oclock in the morning cindy reminded her glancing at the clock whenever its convenient for you what is it you want to talk about about julia of course elizabeth answered the name sliding easily off her tongue as if shed known julia all her life and you me what youre going through you have no idea what im going through cindy brushed an unwanted tear away from her cheek felt another one rush to take its place thats what i need you to tell me the woman urged gently cindy shook her head as if elizabeth kapiza could see her i dont think so please the reporter said softly i can help you by exploiting my daughter cindy elizabeth kapiza said the name wrapping itself around cindys shoulder like a lovers arm the more publicity there is in cases like this the more chance there is of a happy ending a happy ending cindy repeated silently how long had it been since shed believed in happy endings im sorry i dont think theres anything i can tell you that would help youre her mother elizabeth said simply yes cindy agreed unable to find the strength to say more would you at least think about it and call me if you change your mind elizabeth kapiza relayed her office telephone number her home number and the number of her cell phone then repeated them all again as cindy obligingly scribbled them across the bottom of a kleenex box although she had no intention of calling the woman back she barely had one foot out of bed when the phone rang again this time it was a reporter from the globe and mail calling for a quote cindy mumbled something about just wanting her daughter back home safe and sound then mumbled roughly the same sentiments to the reporters from the star and the sun both of whom phoned just after shed emerged from the shower how long has your daughter been acting they asked what are some of her credits cindy combed her wet hair away from her face then pulled on a pair of blue jeans and a white tshirt and went downstairs elvis running along ahead of her impatiently pacing back and forth in front of the door as she opened it julias face stared up at her from the front pages of both the globe and the star actress missing days read the copy beneath the familiar black andwhite photograph from the kitchen the phone started ringing cindy ignored it as she walked into the room and spread the papers across the table police are investigating the disappearance of beautiful aspiring actress julia carver missing since last thursday ms carver daughter of prominent entertainment lawyer tom carver vanished without a trace after a meeting with renowned hollywood director michael kinsolving cindy read the paragraph once then read it again out loud as the phone continued its stubborn ringing police are investigating the disappearance of beautiful aspiring actress julia carver missing since last thursday ms carver daughter of prominent entertainment lawyer tom carver cindy smiled pushing the globe out of the way and reaching for the star the phone stopped ringing started up again almost immediately actress goes missing after audition with hollywood director read the caption underneath julias picture julia carver the beautiful actressdaughter of entertainment lawyer tom carver has been missing from her toronto home since thursday august no cindy said reading it again and then again beautiful actressdaughter of entertainment lawyer tom carver daughter of prominent entertainment lawyer tom carver as if julia has only one parent cindy thought a feeling of outrage growing inside her stomach like a malignant tumor when had she become nonexistent when had she ceased to matter it was almost as if like her daughter cindy carver had suddenly and without notice vanished from the face of the earth the newspapers with a couple of careless phrases had erased her from the landscape swept her from her daughters life once again tom had stolen julia from her this time without even trying the press had made it official julia was tom carvers daughter her mother was nowhere in sight the phone stopped ringing i dont exist cindy told elvis whose response was to lift his leg and pee against the side of her chair cindy stared at her daughters scruffy terrier torn between crying and laughing out loud its okay she said grabbing some paper towels from the counter and soaking up the mess quietly accepting the blame for the dogs errant behavior it was her fault after all she should have taken him out everything was her fault she was as lousy a mother to elvis as shed been to julia julia carver she whispered staring at her daughters picture on the front pages of the papers daughter of cindy daughter of cindy damn it and i will not be brushed aside again she added silently i will not just disappear i dont think theres anything i can tell you that would help shed told elizabeth kapiza youre her mother yes i am cindy said pushing herself to her feet and walking to the phone quickly punching in the last of the numbers shed scribbled on the bottom of the kleenex box earlier and had no trouble recalling now elizabeth kapiza she asked the woman who answered on the first ring as if shed been waiting for cindy to call this is cindy carver when can i see you the reporter asked hows nine oclock by eightthirty cindy had changed her clothes three times and was on her fourth cup of coffee you look nice her mother told her coming into the kitchen neatly dressed in varying shades of blue is that a new blouse cindy smoothed the front of a pink silk shirt shed bought on impulse at andrews the previous summer but had never worn because it wasnt really her was it her now that she was no longer a person of substance she wondered securing the button at the top you want some breakfast coffees fine for now her mother said helping herself whos been phoning so early in the morning who hasnt her mother shrugged i take it nothings new cindy pushed the morning papers toward her see for yourself norma appleton scanned the front pages of both papers oh my she said sinking into one of the kitchen chairs elizabeth kapizas coming to the house in half an hour to interview me you think thats wise i phoned the police cindy told her mother they said they dont have a problem with it as long as i dont talk about the investigation they said it might even help her mother sipped her coffee slowly ran shaking fingers along her granddaughters grainy cheek wheres heather off to so early cindy regarded her mother quizzically what was she talking about wheres heather going norma appleton asked again i dont understand it was her mothers turn to look confused when i got up she was packing packing what are you talking about cindy ran into the front hall just as heather appeared at the top of the stairs an overnight bag in her hands what are you doing i thought id stay over at daddys for a few days heather said proceeding slowly down the steps dropping the black leather overnight bag to the floor as she reached the bottom hi grandma she waved to the woman watching from the kitchen doorway hi sweetheart why are you doing this cindy asked whats going on norma appletons eyes darted back and forth between her daughter and her grandchild things are pretty intense around here i thought mom could use a little space heather explained and its been a while since i spent any serious time at dads its just for a few days she said again heather please if this is about last night what happened last night her mother asked ive already called dad heather said hes picking me up in a few minutes you know how sorry i am you know i didnt mean to slap you you slapped her her mother said its not that heather said then why are you going heather hesitated her eyes filling with tears i just think itll be better for everyone if we take a small break cindy shook her head not for me heather hesitated her body swaying toward her mother ive already called dad call him back the doorbell rang please darling cindy continued following heather to the front door tell him you changed your mind hell understand heather took a deep breath opened the door i take it youve seen the morning papers leigh said her hair a war zone of conflicting curls she dropped a small suitcase to the floor at heathers feet whats this cindy eyed the beatup brown leather suitcase suspiciously ive been calling you for over an hour either the phone is busy or nobody answers i finally got fed up and told warren thats it i cant stand not knowing whats going on hell have to manage without me for a while im moving in with you guys until we know whats what no cindy said quickly then thats really not necessary l s theather and duncan can sleep downstairs im sure they wont mind my backs too fragile for sofa beds actually ill be staying at my fathers for a few days well then that worked out perfectly didnt it leigh said no cindy protested again as outside a car horn honked twice thatll be dad heather glanced out the open door as toms dark green jaguar pulled into view please heather cindy tried one last time dont worry mom itll be okay ill call you later heathers lips brushed against her mothers cheek then she ran down the front steps throwing her overnight bag into the backseat of her fathers car and climbing into the front seat beside him flashback julia carries her new louis vuitton luggage to toms waiting bmw waits while he puts it inside the trunk then slides into the front seat next to him cindy watched as toms car pulled away from the curb she was still standing at the front door staring down the empty street when elizabeth kapiza showed up at precisely nine oclock tape recorder in hand photographer in tow the national post thursday september a mothers anguish by elizabeth kapiza toronto september she sits in the living room of her spacious artfilled home in midtown toronto a woman whose pale face is ravaged by uncertainty and fear tears are never far from her expressive blue eyes they stain the front of her stylish pink silk blouse im sorry she apologizes repeatedly twisting an already shredded tissue in her lap she offers me coffee and a bagel inquires after my health asks if im comfortable a typical mother i find myself thinking except sadly cindy carver is anything but typical because cindy carver is the mother of julia carver the stunning twentyone yearold actress who went missing a week ago and whose father is wellknown entertainment lawyer tom carver from whom cindy has been divorced for seven years cindy smiles at the mention of her exhusbands name and it is obvious that whatever their past differences their daughters disappearance has brought them closer together it is also obvious that beauty runs in the family for cindy carver despite the anguish of her situation is still at fortytwo a very beautiful woman as she perches on the end of one of two exquisitely appointed tan leather sofas one can see traces of julia in her face in the tilt of her head in the soft fullness of her lips in the determination of her gaze my daughter will be coming home she says and i ache to believe her the odds of course arent good young women who go missing rarely come home once lost they are rarely found and if they are it is usually in shallow graves after weeks months even years of souldestroying searching one has only to think of the grisly discoveries on that infamous pig farm in british columbia or the recent rash of kidnappings south of the border one has only to mention the names amber and chandra one has to pray that the name julia will not be added to the list what do you think has happened to your daughter i ask gently thinking of my own daughter age five safe at home cindy shakes her head dislodging several fresh tears unable to formulate aresponse to say twenty on saturday morning another girl was reported missing like julia she was described as tall blond and beautiful although the photograph that ran on the front page of all four major toronto papers revealed a slight cast in her left eye that made her appear slightly crosseyed her name was sally hanson and she was three years older than julia and maybe ten pounds heavier since her graduation from queens university two years earlier shed been working in the editorial department of toronto life magazine and according to the hastily assembled remarks from a number of her coworkers she was outgoing and popular like julia sally hanson had recently broken up with her boyfriend whom police were reportedly most anxious to contact apparently hed taken off on his motorcycle around the same time sallys worried parents were letting themselves into their daughters empty apartment like julia sally had disappeared on a thursday and like julia sally was a movie buff having planned her vacation to coincide with the film festival shed bought thirty coupons and according to her mother shed been looking forward to seeing three films a day every day for the ten days of the festivals duration among those films for which she had tickets was michael kinsolvings highly anticipated new movie lost and yet police were downplaying the speculation that there was any connection between the two disappearances we have no reason at all to suspect these two cases are related someone named lieutenant petersen was quoted as saying the globe and the post largely echoed that sentiment while the star printed a lengthy article comparing and contrasting the lives of the two young women and the events leading up to their disappearances only the sun asked the obvious question serial killer stalking toronto film festival it queried in headline type dont read that garbage leigh said wresting the tabloid from cindys hands hey give that back cindy jumped up from her seat at the kitchen table and reclaimed the paper before her sister could stuff it into the trash container under the sink really cindy whats the point leigh assumed their mothers oncefamiliar stance legs spread shoulderlength apart hands on her hips chin lowered eyes raised as if she were peering up over the top of a pair of reading glasses she was wearing an unflattering sky blue track suit that flattened her bosom and widened her hips and a matching blue headband that pulled her eyebrows into her forehead and made her look vaguely deranged the point is i want to read it cindy said what for itll only upset you cindy shrugged what else is new the shrug said its all just speculation anyway leigh told her i know that im sure that if the police thought there was any connection between the two cases theyd say so cindy stared at her sister trying to digest leighs latest pronouncement when had julia lost her humanity become merely a case the phone rang ill get it leigh was instantly at the phone hello immediately her face darkened who is this who is it cindy echoed you sick fuck leigh slammed the phone into its carriage who was that cindy asked more amused than alarmed by her sisters outburst who was that she asked again although she already knew the answer what difference does it make theyre all the same whatd this one say the usual crap such as have your daughter im going to cut her up into little pieces yada yada cindy shook her head amazed though no longer surprised by the cruelty of others the police had warned her about all the twisted minds out there the perverts who feasted on other peoples suffering who wallowed in their misery hang up theyd told her better still dont answer your phone sometimes cindy heeded their advice other times she didnt ten minutes later the phone rang again ill get it cindy said this time beating her sister to the phone honestly cindy you almost knocked me down hello cindy said hi yourself the voice answered the voice was both husky and light soothing and creepy alien and familiar an obvious attempt at disguise why was it someone she knew who is this have you seen the morning papers who is this cindy repeated they think julia might be the victim of a serial killer who is it leigh asked impatiently whats he saying it would serve her right the voice continued your daughters a slut cindy shes nothing but a cheap whore a sharp cry suddenly stabbed at the air tore through the phone wires pierced cindys ear my god cindy said feeling her face drain of blood as she identified the sound for heavens sake cindy leigh said hang up the damn phone cindy held her breath listened for the sound again it didnt come but it didnt matter cindy knew exactly what it was the sound of a baby crying faith cindy whispered the phone went dead in the next second cindy was out of the kitchen and at her front door leigh following right behind where are you going what are you doing her sister shouted after her as cindy ran down the steps and cut through the bushes into her neighbors front yard cindy felt leighs hand on her arm tried shaking it away but leighs fingers were like stubborn vines refusing to be severed with a simple shrug let go cindy hissed between tightly gritted teeth as she yanked her arm away cindy she heard leigh shout as she raced up the front steps of the sellick home not looking back the door opened just as cindy reached the top step cindy faith exclaimed clearly surprised to see her she closed the door behind her and adjusted the green corduroy snuggly at her breasts inside it kyle was sleeping soundly his eyes tightly closed his lips sucking contentedly at his pacifier whats happened has there been any news did you just call me cindy asked what did you just call me call you no why you didnt just phone me whats going on faith glanced past cindy to leigh who was now standing at the bottom of the stairs leigh lifted her hands into the air as if to say you tell me somebody just phoned my house i heard a baby crying in the background well no wonder you thought it was me faith smiled tenderly stroking the top of her babys head it wasnt kyle believe it or not hes been sleeping like an angel all morning i really think weve turned a corner are you okay you dont look so hot come on cindy leigh was saying well let the police handle it the police faith asked theyre tapping the phone the police are tapping your phone why weve been getting a lot of crank calls leigh explained which wouldnt happen so often she continued reaching for cindys hand if my sister would get caller id she guided cindy down the stairs toward the sidewalk well take the long way home if you dont mind im sorry i yanked your arm like that cindy said dont give it another thought she almost broke my arm she yanked it so hard leigh told her mother as soon as she returned from walking the dog you yanked your sisters arm their mother asked cindy incredulously following the dog into the kitchen hmm what smells so good im making a lemon cake leigh said i v tyou shouldnt fight with your sister her mother said with a shake of her head honestly i cant leave you girls alone for a minute the phone rang dont answer it leigh instructed maybe its julia cindy said hopefully this wouldnt happen if you had caller id her mother said cindy picked up the phone braced herself for the worst it was meg howre you doing her voice sounded rushed as if she were talking while running which of course was exactly what she was doing cindy realized picturing meg racing along bloor street trying to get from one movie to the next as quickly as she could desperate not to miss anything the festival had been up and running for two days now and although neither meg nor trish had so much as mentioned the festival cindy knew they were going without her life goes on she understood wishing she could press a button freeze time as easily as she could freeze an image on her television screen she knew she shouldnt judge meg and trish harshly her friends couldnt be expected to drop everything abandon all their plans put their lives on hold because of something that didnt directly concern them she shouldnt resent them for enjoying themselves for laughing for forgetting about her for hours at a stretch she shouldnt she thought but she did i read in the paper about that other missing girl meg said as a car honked in the background what do the police really think cindy shook her head said nothing look you must be going stircrazy over there why dont you come to a movie with us a movie i know it sounds frivolous and i dont mean to sound insensitive i just think it might be a good idea for you to get out of the house for a while get some fresh air get away from your mother take your mind off everything you think its that easy meg sighed the sigh of the deliberately misunderstood of course its not that easy i didnt mean to imply i know im sorry will you think about it sure cindy said although she had no intention of doing so call me on my cell ill keep it on all day cindy smiled recalling how enraged festival patrons got whenever anyones cell phone rang during a screening i love you meg said i love you too her mother and sister were staring at her from across the room their bodies tensed to take action at the first sign of distress ever since cindy had fainted their eyes were on constant vigil never allowing her far out of their reach she wondered whether anyone would ever look at her the way they used towithout pity without sadness without fear cindy shook her head trying to rid her brain of such depressing thoughts meg was rightshe was going stircrazy she needed air im going upstairs to shower her mother said why dont you lie down for awhile because im not tired cindy said youre sure leigh asked as their mother left the room cindy sank into one of the kitchen chairs watched as her sister began preparing the icing for the cake you dont have to do this you know i know have you spoken to warren today of course im sure hes wondering when youre coming home hes fine hell be over later cindy nodded is everything all right what do you mean between the two of you of course its all right leigh said why wouldnt it be all right i dont know im just asking everythings fine good warrens a good man not the most exciting man in the world maybe not like tom thank goodness but hes sweet and hes decent and hed never cheat on me i didnt mean to imply i dont understand why youd ask me something like that im sorry i honestly didnt mean its just this damn wedding you know people get tense im sure its a huge expense and were not getting any help from the grooms parents ive told you yes so theres bound to be tension especially now with julia missing and everything so up in the air im sorry theres nothing to be sorry for were fine good the doorbell rang ill get it cindy said walking briskly to the front door trying to sort out in her mind what had just happened check who it is before you open the door leigh called after her it was the police cindy held her breath as she tried reading the expressions on their faces can we come in detective bartolli asked oh god cindy fell back into the house covered her mouth with her hand as leigh rushed to her side whats happened leigh asked as cindy struggled to stay upright its all right detective gill assured the two women quickly weve just come to fill you in on whats been happening julia theres nothing new can we come in detective bartolli asked again as elvis bounded down the stairs to jump against his thighs cindy led the two men into the living room motioned for them to sit down above her head cindy could hear the water from the shower running through the pipes i assume youve heard about the hanson girl detective gill stated as he lowered himself onto one of the tan leather sofas do you think theres any connection cindy asked we have no reason at this time to assume the two incidents are related came the automatic response from detective bartolli but you think theres a chance its a possibility detective gill admitted were looking into it how exactly are you doing that leigh asked the detectives exchanged glances ignored the question weve had several conversations with sean banack detective bartolli said and were still checking out his alibi for last thursday unfortunately because we dont know the exact time your daughter disappeared we know it was between elevenfifteen and fourthirty cindy said yes but thats a lot of time to account for sean can account for his whereabouts for part of the day but not all then arrest him we need evidence to arrest him mrs carver that story he wrote not enough weve had someone watching him detective gill said and so far nothing have you talked to lindsey krauss detective bartolli checked his notes yes and to the other names on the list your husband gave us exhusband cindy said exhusband yes sorry about that the detective smiled sheepishly scratched at his ear the consensus among several of julias friends is that she was involved with a married man thats ridiculous leigh said cindy said nothing cindy her sister said have you talked to ryan sellick cindy asked he denies any romantic involvement with your daughter do you believe him is there some reason we shouldnt cindy shrugged filling the policemen in on everything that had taken place in the last week between herself and the sellicks she watched detective gill dutifully jot this information down and wondered whether she really believed ryan and julia were having an affair whether faith had phoned her earlier whether either one could have played a part in her daughters disappearance what about michael kinsolving she asked we have no evidence to suggest he was in any way involved he left town right after he saw julia cindy reminded them he claims he was in the country scouting locations and was he were still checking into that cindy lowered her head so basically what youre telling me is that were no farther ahead than we were last week except no y another girl has disappeared mrs carver i know theres no reason to assume the two cases are connected an hour later cindy was lying on her bed looking through her festival catalog in the section marked masters she found a photograph of what appeared to be an ambulance or a police car racing along a dark metropolitan street the deliberately blurred image bathed in an eerie orangered light a womans darkened silhouette in the foreground the notes underneath it read lost michael kinsolvings sensational new film deals with the underside of contemporary society with disaffected youth and the appalling generation who created and raised them we meet catherine age twentytwo and already a seasoned con artist and her sister sarah jive years her junior addicted to cocaine and men old enough to he her father cindy closed the book rifled through the envelope of movie coupons meg had left for her then scanned the volkswagen guide to the festival official film schedule booklet locating the listing for lost tonight at sevenfifteen at the uptown i she read reaching for the phone hello meg answered her voice a hoarse whisper cindy cindy pictured meg crouching down in her seat in the darkened theater felt the angry glares of the people sitting around her ill meet you inside the theater at seven cindy said then hung up before she had a chance to change her mind twentyone the uptown was already filled to capacity by the time cindy arrived at just after seven oclock that evening she searched through the dim light of the large oldfashioned auditorium for her friends praying she wouldnt run into anyone else she knew she could only imagine what they might say can you believe it her daughters been missing for over a week god only knows whatshappened to her and shes out galavanting around shes going to the movies and theyd be right cindy thought wondering what the hell she was doing here did she seriously think shed glean anything of significance from michael kinsolvings new film that thered be hidden clues pointing to her daughters whereabouts that shed gain insight into the directors tortured psyche or had she merely been desperate to get out of the house away from her mother her sister the dog what is my objective she asked herself twisting sharply around fleeing the crowded auditorium for the equally crowded lobby coming to an abrupt halt in front of a long table covered with sushi and exotic sandwiches can i help you a young woman stared at her expectantly from behind the foodladen table cindy suddenly realized she was ravenously hungry not having eaten anything since breakfast despite leighs constant efforts to stuff food down her throat shed pleaded exhaustion when warren invited them all out for dinner insisting her mother and sister go without her then vaulted from the house the minute they were gone shed left them a noteneeded some air back by ten shed scribbledso they wouldnt worry although theyd worry anyway she knew guilt sitting heavy in her chest like heartburn shed grab a sandwich and head straight for home she decided now coming here had been a mistake what had she been thinking what kind of sandwich is that she asked the palefaced young woman whose name tag identified her as a festival volunteer tomato havarti cheese and avocado on whole wheat cindy nodded her approval her mouth watering as she reached inside her purse for some money ill get that a man said from somewhere behind her and cindy turned to see neil macfarlane where did you come from cindy said startled by his unexpected presence what was he doing here neil motioned toward the inside auditorium were sitting near the back meg was just about to call you when you went running out i didnt realize youd be here trish had an extra ticket dimples creased the skin around neils mouth as his lips flirted with a smile she called me told me you were coming i hope you dont mind if it makes you at all uncomfortable it doesnt good he took her elbow led her toward a relatively quiet corner of the old lobby whose walls were the color of dark blood ive called a few times yes i know im really sorry i havent returned your messages i wanted to call you she thought so many times its been so crazy she said you dont have to explain thank you cindy smiled fought the urge to caress his cheek had his eyes always been so blue she wondered before deliberately looking away are you ready to go back inside cindy straightened her shoulders took a deep breath ready or not it was completely dark in the auditorium as neil led cindy up the steep rows of stairs to where meg and trish were sitting near the back of the theater the two friends greeted her with prolonged hugs and kisses you okay meg grabbed cindys hand and held it tightly in her lip im so glad you came we were afraid youd bolted trish said i thought about it you dont mind about neil she whispered i dont mind ssh said several nearby voices as a large spotlight jumped across the stage ultimately coming to rest on a solitary figure standing to the left of the giant screen hello im richard pearlman and im one of the organizers of this yearsfestival the casually dressed young man announced to a smattering of light applause first i want to thank our sponsors he said gamely naming each one in turn tonight we are extremely privileged to be hosting the north american premiere of michael kinsolvings amazing new movie lost a film of astonishing power and resonance we are also honored to have michael kinsolving here with us this evening a pleased gasp trickled through the audience like a breeze through a wheat field ladies and gentlemen michael kinsolving the applause was heartfelt and enthusiastic as the famed hollywood director in his trademark black tshirt and tight jeans hopped onto the stage and waved then he cupped his right hand over his eyes and stared out at the audience can he see me cindy wondered torn between leaning forward and sinking low in her seat i hope you still feel like clapping after you see the film michael said to much laughter anyway what can i say i love this festival i love this city as you may know im planning to film my next movie here another burst of applause we tried to do something a little different with lost so i hope you dont mind anyway ill be available for a q a after the film more applause enjoy he jumped from the stage and the spotlight promptly evaporated enjoy cindy repeated silently as a haunting musical refrain began swirling about her head and the screen filled with a group of ghostly seminude dancers whose arms and legs were painted in the blackandwhite stripes of a movie clapboard an arresting series of images that were part of this years festivals logo after several more promos the movie began cindy sank back in her chair as meg squeezed her hand what am i doing here she wondered again as the credits rolled across a deserted innercity street what do i hope to achieve what is my objective documentary footage cindy in the bedroom of the house on balmoral avenuethe month before tom packs his bags and moves out its a few minutes after pm and hes just come home cindy has been waiting for him all night intent on putting their marriage back on track ready to accept at least part of the blame for its derailment its possible shes been too demanding too critical too angry all the time as tom is always saying theyve been married for seventeen years nearly half her life they were children when they eloped her entire adult life has been interlocked with his could she survive without him and what of their two beautiful daughters daughters who would be devastated should she fail to make things right between them while she finally recognizes that she cant change her husbands behavior she can certainly change her own she can show tom the love and respect he needs even if he is not always deserving of either to that end she is wearing a new short red satin nightgown and pointytoed shoes with skinny stiletto heels the kind hes always admired on other women he pleads exhaustion as she burrows into his arms and tugs at his tie she can smell another womans perfume on his skin stubbornly even recklessly cindy closes her eyes covers her husbands lips with her own she tastes another womans lipstick and fights the urge to gag determined to ignore the bile rising in her throat as toms body slowly reluctantly begins to respond to her ministrations soon they are on the bed and he is unzipping his pants lifting up her nightgown although he doesnt look at her has barely looked at her since he walked into the room as if she no longer exists for him as if she no longer exists at all can you see me cindy wonders feeling herself shrink beneath his weight become less visible less viable with each mindless thrust of his hips look at me she demands suddenly grabbing his chin in her hands forcing his eyes to hers the fierceness in her voice catching them both by surprise immediately she feels him grow soft he pulls away from her in disgust she tries to apologize to explain but apologies and explanations lead only to recriminations recriminations to accusations accusations to more accusations they end up fighting the same fight theyve been having for weeks months years what do you hope to achieve when you say things like that he asks i mean really cindy what is your objective i dont know cindy acknowledged now watching as a young womans face overtook the screen light bouncing off her long black hair so that it sparkled like diamonds against the night sky her full lips were open and trembling huge coffeecolored eyes scanned the desolate street i dont know anything anymore cindy thought following the young woman on the screen into a rundown diner noticing the hungry looks from the men and boys already inside has anyone here seen julia the girl asked the decidedly motley crew cindy gasped clutched her stomach the sandwich in her lap dropping to the floor whats wrong neil leaned forward as megs hand tightened its grip on cindys fingers jimmy doesnt come around much these days someone answered jimmy cindy realized collapsing forward in her seat the air rushing from her lungs as if shed been suckerpunched jimmy not julia are you okay trish asked cindy nodded unable to find her voice ill get you another sandwich neil offered no cindy whispered hoarsely her appetite gone its all right ssh someone said from the row behind the rest of the movie passed in a merciful blur cindy saw a succession of faces a panorama of flesh raised voices loud sighs long silences sex drugs and rock n roll love and pain and the whole damn thing when it was over the entire audience jumped to its feet hooting and hollering its prolonged approval i think he finally has another hit meg exclaimed sitting back down clapping wildly cindy realized that although her eyes had never left the screen she hadnt absorbed a single frame although shed heard each word she couldnt recall a single one if thered been anything of value to be gleaned by being here shed missed it shed missed everything as usual the lights came up richard pearlman vaulted back to the stage ladies and gentlemen once again i give you michael kinsolving the director acknowledged the deafening ovation with a modest bow does that mean you approve the audience roared loud whistles pierced the air thank you michael said clearly reveling in the sound youre very kind the applause abated as richard pearlman leaned his lanky torso into the microphone michaels generously agreed to answer some questions he peered into the audience can he see me cindy thought can anybody see me yes richard pearlman said you there in the middle a heavyset woman in stretch leopardprint pants scrambled to her feet first i want to congratulate you on a brilliant film and i couldnt help but be struck by the parallels to dante showoff trish muttered what parallels to dante meg asked and i wondered whether you were consciously going after something more literary with this film the woman continued more literary the director repeated obviously tickled by the question first time ive ever been accused of that the audience laughed richard pearlman pointed to a man in the second row yes how long did it take you to shoot the film a little over three months where did you find the lead actress a woman shouted not bothering to wait her turn monica mason yes she was great wasnt she more applause i wish i could say that i discovered her sitting at the soda i s tfountain at schwabs or tell you one of those apocryphal holly wood stories you always hear about but the truth is that she was just one of dozens of very talented young actresses who auditioned for the part her agent sent her over one afternoon she read for us and that was that nothing very dramatic im afraid richard pearlman pointed to a middleaged woman in the upper right corner of the theater yes speaking of dramatic stories the woman began do you know anything about whats happening with the police investigation into the two missing girls oh my god cindy whispered was this what shed been waiting for was this the reason she was here no michael answered curtly i dont know any more than you do i understand one of the girls is an actress the woman continued yes i believe thats true didnt she audition for you the morning she disappeared i believe she did yes michael scratched uncomfortably at the tip of his nose looked to richard pearlman for help could we confine your questions to the wonderful movie weve just seen richard asked thank you he pointed to another woman on his left how does it feel to be the subject of a police investigation do you feel like youre in the middle of one of your own movies michael laughed but the laugh was strained a bit yes any more questions about lost if they find her you should give her the part a man shouted out from the last row then youd have that apocryphal hollywood story to tell us next time thats true michael conceded as the audience laughed an apocryphal hollywood story cindy thought feeling sick to her stomach her daughters disappearance reduced to an arousing anecdote for the film cognoscenti i have to get out of here she said jumping to her feet neil right beside her are you all right meg asked i have to go well come too trish offered no ill take her home neil said well come with you meg insisted following after them down the stairs no cindy said forcefully spinning around please meg stopped tears filling her eyes youre sure cindy nodded ill call you tomorrow the gentleman in the third row richard pearlman was saying as cindy and neil clambered down the steps and into the lobby the mans voice trailed after her has being questioned by the police changed your opinion about toronto an hour later cindy was quietly ushering neil inside her front hall i think everyones asleep she whispered can i get you anything something to drink im fine he whispered back follow me cindy tiptoed down the stairs leading to the bottom floor cringing at each creak of the floor beneath her feet feeling like a teenager sneaking home after curfew can you see okay she asked relying on the halfmoon peeking through the windows to guide them reluctant to turn on any lights im fine he said again settling in beside her on the family room sofa thanks for dinner cindy was glad it was too dark to make out the stains on the old brown corduroy couch a couch that pulled out into a queensize bed cindy thought and felt her face flush i was hungrier than i realized l stand suddenly she was moving toward him taking his face in her hands and drawing his lips toward hers then kissing him full on the mouth her tongue seeking his her arms wrapping around him crushing him tightly against her her hands burying themselves in his hair pulling him closer as if there were still too much space between them her legs curling around his hips as if she i could somehow manage to climb out of her own body and escape i into his as it she needed the air in his lungs to breathe i oh god she cried abruptly pulling away and pushing herself toward the far end of the sofa what am i doing whats the matter with me i its all right cindy its all right its not all right i was all over you m cindy neil said trying to calm her you didnt do anything wrong what you must think of me neil stared at her through the semidarkness i think youre the most beautiful most courageous woman i know he said softly courageous cindy swiped at the tears now falling the length of her cheeks courage implies choice i didnt choose any of this which makes you all the more courageous in my book cindy stared wistfully at the man beside her where had he come from were there really men like this in the world make love to me she said then more forcefully i really need for you to make love to me neil said nothing he simply reached for her strong arms surrounding her like a cape he kissed her once then again and again tender kisses like the gentle flutter of a butterflys wings against her skin then deeper his touch sure unhurried deliberate as he began to caress and undress her she felt the warmth of his fingers the cool wetness of his tongue and cried out with joy when he entered her urgency replacing delicacy as he rocked inside her gradually almost reluctantly she felt her body building to a climax and tried hard to fight it to prolong the moment as long as humanly possible until it was no longer something she could control and she cried out again her nails digging into the flesh of his back her fingers clinging to him as if he were a lite preserver in a treacherous ocean seconds later they collapsed against one another their bodies bathed in a thin coating of sweat are you all right neil asked after a silence of several seconds are you kidding cindy asked in return then laughed out loud neil laughed with her kissed her forehead gathered her inside his arms thank you cindy said now whos kidding he kissed her again drawing her back against the wellstuffed pillows their bodies folding comfortably together their breathing steady and rhythmic and then there were footsteps shuffling above their heads and upstairs lights being turned on and familiar voices sliding down the banister i told you theres no one here cindys mother was saying as elvis began barking beside her and im telling you i heard something leigh argued hello hello hello norma appleton echoed is someone there the dog raced down the steps bounded into the family room oh for petes sake cindy said fending off elviss eager paws as she scrambled into her clothes cindy cindy is that you its me mom cindy called out pulling her head as elvis jumped against neils thighs its all right have to come down footsteps headed what are you doing downstairs two sets for the stairs please dont come down cindy urged pulling her slacks over her hips knowing such exhortations were futile that it was only a matter of seconds before her mother and sister peeked their heads into the room i cant believe this she whispered to neil who was hurriedly tucking his shirt inside his pants its like when i was fifteen and she caught me making out with martin crawley what do you mean dont come down leigh was asking her voice edging closer what are you doing down here in the dark her hand reached into the room flipped on the switch for the overhead light her eyes taking a second to adjust to the sudden brightness another second to adjust to the fact that cindy wasnt alone oh whats going on down here norma appleton asked i think maybe we should go back upstairs leigh ventured trying to back out of the room but her mother was already blocking her exit dont be silly whats oh she stared at neil macfarlane im sorry cindy i didnt realize you had company you remember neil cindy ventured meekly yes of course her mother said how are you neil im fine thank you mrs appleton hi leigh offered weakly nice to see you again neil said nobody moved i guess i should probably go neil said finally please dont leave on our account norma appleton said its late i really should get going ill walk you to the door cindy followed him up the stairs she in turn was trailed by her mother her sister and the dog cindy closed the front door behind her as she walked neil to his car i dont suppose ill hear from you again she said smiling as he leaned over to kiss her good night was martin crawley so easily deterred cindy smiled waited until his car disappeared down the street before turning back to the house the front door opened just as she was reaching for it her mother and sister waiting on the other side elvis between them sort of like old times her mother said with a smile ill make us some tea said leigh twentytwo have you seen a copy of this mornings sun meg asked cindy at barely seven oclock monday morning it had been eleven days since julia went missing cindy lowered the phone in her hand and stared at elvis who was waiting for her by the front door no i havent been out yet i was just about to take the dog for a walk when you called maybe you should let someone else take him meg suggested why what are you getting at whats in the sun that you dont think i should see i just think you should be prepared for what has another girl disappeared thered been nothing in the other papers about any more disappearances theres a picture of julia on the front page meg said again its a different picture shes well its pretty suggestive and there are more pictures inside i dont know where they got them cindy dropped the receiver ran for the door cindy she heard megs voice call after her cindy are you there elvis barked in angry protest as cindy slammed the door behind her and ran down the street what was meg talking about what picture shed only given the police that one head shot of julia where could they have gotten more what pictures damn it she asked out loud hurling herself at the newspaper box on the corner recoiling in horror at the fullpage photograph of her daughter that stared back at her with almost deliberate provocation julia was staring directly into the camera lens her eyes challenging the viewer she was wearing only the bottom half of a black string bikini her hands cupped coyly over high bare breasts julias lost jewels the caption beside the picture read cindy stumbled back on her heels as if shed been struck it was one of the photographs shed found in seans apartment photographs tom had stuffed inside the pocket of his beige linen pants how had the paper gotten its hands on it and what of the other pictures inside were they part of the same collection she reached into her pocket for some change realized shed forgotten to bring any and slammed her fist on the top of the red metal box in frustration she cast a wary glance over each shoulder to make sure no one was watching then kicked at the side of the box and jiggled its handle trying to force it open the damn thing refused to budge shit she yelled spinning around in helpless circles a woman walking a small white dog rounded the corner at lynwood excuse me cindy called to her i dont suppose you have some spare change for the paper i could pay you back later the womans eyes narrowed as if shed just been approached by a foulsmelling panhandler and she promptly picked up her dog and crossed to the other side of the street great cindy muttered racing back down balmoral toward her house hearing elvis barking all the way down the street okay okay she said opening her door and trying to keep the dog from knocking her down as she rifled through her purse for some change okay you can come she told the dog grabbing his leash heading back out the door whats all the commotion her mother called from the top of the stairs im just getting the paper cindy said go back to sleep she hurried down the steps and along balmoral to avenue road but elvis refused to be rushed stopping repeatedly to sniff at the grass and lift his leg come on come on we havent got all day cindy stopped abruptly the absurdity of what shed just said hitting her square in the forehead as if shed just walked into a brick wall we havent got all day all day was exactly what she had and the day after that and the day after that how many days she wondered importuning the cloudless sky how many more awful blank days waiting to be filled how many more endless days spent in aimless if frantic pursuit of her daughter how many more useless meetings with police wellmeaning conversations with friends sadistic phone calls from strangers how many more such days could she tolerate how many more could she survive as many as it takes cindy understood continuing toward the corner what choice did she have no choice no control she told the dog as he lifted his rump into the air and dropped several steaming turds into the middle of the sidewalk thats just great she said realizing shed forgotten to bring a plastic bag she looked helplessly up and down the street wondering what to do what could she do she wasnt about to pick it up with her hands ill come back later she apologized to the empty street stepping around the unsightly pile pulling elvis after her before he could do more damage she reached the newspaper box at the same time as an immaculately dressed middleaged man who nodded hello as he dropped the appropriate coinage into the slot and pulled out a paper his fingers unconsciously folding across her daughters partially exposed breasts cindy felt a scream rising in her throat and turned away have a nice day the man said in parting cindys eyes trailed after him did he know anything about her daughters disappearance he obviously lived in the area had probably seen julia around he was neatly dressed to the point of fastidiousness nattily bland unnecessarily polite middleaged repressed probably lived alone or with his mother exactly the type you always read about the quiet ones the ones with smiles on their lips and mayhem in their hearts men like him were everywhere cindy thought as she dropped her money in the slot and reached inside the box for the paper she couldnt look at a man anymore without wondering whether he knew something about julia whether hed seen her or talked to her or plotted her harm every stranger was a possible friend every friend a possible foe how well do we really know anybody how well do we know ourselves cindys thoughts drifted to neil to the events of last saturday night again she felt his arms around her his lips on hers his hands in her hair on her breasts between her legs she felt him moving inside her and even now it felt wonderful to lose herself so completely in the moment to forget for a brief spasm of time what else she might have lost followed by the dogs paws on her bare thighs the priceless looks on the faces of her mother and sister the reassuring smile in neils eyes as he kissed her good night the lordgiveth she found herself thinking as she stared at the picture of her daughter in the morning paper trying to make sense of what she was seeing and the lord taketh away more pictures page cindy flipped the page over gasped when she saw two more familiar photos one of julia wearing a pushup bra and matching thong the other of julia in profile her elbow pressing against the curve of her naked breast the bare cheeks of her round bottom playing peekaboo with the camera how did the sun get these pictures was it possible sean had duplicates that hed sold the negatives to the tabloid she stuffed more coins into the box pulling out the last remaining copies of the paper and running with them along the street feeling one of her sandals suddenly connect with something squishy oh shit she yelled sliding to a stop knowing exactly what shedstepped in serves me right she shouted serves me goddamn right she ripped off her sandal the bottom of which was covered in dog poop and hurled it into the middle of the road wheres your sandal her mother asked as cindy limped into the kitchen several minutes later on only one shoe cindy waved the question aside as she spread the papers across the kitchen table then walked to the phone asked information for the number of the toronto sun oh my her mother whispered staring at the pictures then again oh my i need to speak to frank landau cindy said checking the name under the article that accompanied the racy pictures of her daughter this is frank landau a man answered seconds later where did you get those pictures of my daughter excuse me the pictures of julia carver where did you get them mrs carver i will sue your goddamn paper i will sue you personally mrs carver wait wait calm down please dont tell me to calm down tell me how you got those pictures there was a long pause by the time the reporter answered cindy knew what he was going to say i got them from your exhusband he told her evenly tom carver handdelivered them to me in person yesterday afternoon where is he cindy demanded as she pushed through the door to toms office at just after one oclock that afternoon irena ruskin jumped to her feet behind her appropriately cluttered desk hes not here wait she called scrambling after cindy into toms inner office mrs carver cindy cindy spun around absorbing the faithful secretary in a single glance her hair was still the same unsubtle shade of blond although a few inches longer than cindy last remembered it possibly to hide the scars of her most recent plastic surgery cindy thought unkindly wondering whether the woman chose her wardrobe to coordinate with the dark blue of the two chairs infront of the massive oak desk where is he hes in a meeting hes been in that meeting since nine oclock this morning i gave him all your messages i need to speak to him irena its pretty urgent or i wouldnt be here cindy could you get him for me please was that cindy carver i just saw walk by a mans voice asked from the doorway cindy took a deep breath forced herself to smile as she extended her hand to one of her exhusbands law partners hello alan how are you im well how are you holding up today isnt a great day cindy marveled at her use of understatement she might even have laughed had alan reynolds not looked quite so earnest im sure you saw the pictures in the sun alan reynolds nodded youre waiting for tom i take it apparently hes stuck in one of those allday meetings cindy glanced at irena who nodded uncomfortably really well they must be taking a break i just saw him talking to mitchell pritchard let me see if i can get him for you id appreciate that can i get you anything in the meantime a cup of coffee some water perhaps nothing thank you has there been any news about julia irena asked when he was gone you didnt see the spread in the surf i saw it quite impressive dont you think irena shuffled from one foot to the other looked as if she were seriously considering jumping out the twentyfifthfloor window if theres anything i can do for you during this difficult time youre the first person ill call cindy thought aloud she said thank you she turned toward the floortoceiling window with its magnificent view of the waterfront saw her own pathetic image reflected back she was wearing her standard uniform of blue jeans and faded tshirt and her hair was greasy from constantly tugging at it take your hands away from your hair she could hear tom scold how many partners are there in the firm now she asked irena in an effort to silence him sixteen partners fortyeight associates wow cindy said without enthusiasm half a dozen students irena continued cindy wondered if irena was still sleeping with tom she folded her arms across her chest as if to keep her heart from falling out are you sure you wouldnt like a cup of coffee quite sure thank you well i could certainly use one tom said sweeping into the room resplendent in a gray suit and red print tie if you wouldnt mind no problem irena obediently slipped from the room drawing the door closed behind her then leaving it open a small crack so what brings you all the way down here tom asked examining his exwife as if she were an unpleasant document cindy walked to the door pushed it shut all the way then turned back to her exhusband you miserable son of a bitch she began okay ground rules tom stated retreating behind his heavy oak desk no swearing no name calling no yelling no shit cindy said tom shook his head you look like crap tears stung cindys eyes seven years after hed left and still his words had the power to wound what the hell is wrong with you whats wrong with me he countered how could you do it do what dont play games with me i take it youre upset about the pictures in the sun pictures you handdelivered yourself you son of a bitch dont try to deny it why would i deny it why would you do it think about it a minute think about what whats to think about think about the best way to keep julia front and center on everyones minds tom said evenly sitting down and leaning forward elbows on his desk shes been missing for eleven days i know exactly how long shes been missing then you also know her disappearance is old news another girls already taken her place not to mention the city is filled with visiting celebrities and movie stars eager for a good photoop i had to do something to make sure julia wouldnt be forgotten those pictures will more than accomplish that so the end still justifies the means cindy said aware there was a grain of truth to what tom was saying not wanting to acknowledge it cindy be reasonable how long do you think the police are going to keep julias case a priority how seriously do you think theyre going to treat her disappearance after seeing these pictures theyll dismiss her as flighty and foolish maybe even flighty and foolish enough to take off without telling anyone or worse they think shes a little tramp who got what she deserved theyll think they better get off their asses and solve this case before it gets international exposure tom snapped im already fielding calls from associated press and people magazine oh god cindy felt her body crumpling like tissue paper and collapsed into one of the two blue chairs in front of toms desk tom stood up warily approached his former wife cindy you have to calm down you cant keep flying off halfcocked its not good for you you mean its not good for you she said refusing to look at him look at you he smoothed some hairs away from her face cindy slapped his hand aside i know i look like crap you already told me im just worried about you cindy pushed herself out of the chair and walked to the window stared toward lake ontario if youre so damn worried about me why didnt you tell me what you were planning to do with the pictures why didnt you warn me because i knew you wouldnt approve and i didnt feel like going through this exactly coward tom shook his head okay look i think weve said all we have to say i havent of course he said with an audible sigh okay im ready give it your best shot cindy looked at her former husband his feet spread shoulder distance apart his arms hanging limply at his sides handsome face void of all expression shed once loved this man she found herself thinking loved him from the time she was seventeen loved him so much shed eloped with him at eighteen had two children with him two children she reminded herself her lower lip quivering as once again tears clouded her eyes hows heather she asked realizing shed barely thought about heather since she left shes fine did she tell you what happened just that the house was getting a little crowded tom paused you know im right about the pictures dont you cindy pushed her hair impatiently behind her ears i hate it when youre right you hate everything about me he said softly going to her side pretty much cindy acknowledged allowing him to gather her into his arms and pull her toward him she cried softly against his chest his silk tie serving as a blotter for her tears how had she ever allowed herself to fall in love with someone shed never really liked cindy what everything will be all right he said as the door to his office opened and irena stepped inside a coffee mug shaking in her hands the color drained from her face something the matter tom asked as detectives bartolli and gill strode into the room what is it has something happened detective bartolli stepped forward his gaze shifting uneasily from tom to cindy weve found a body he said slowly wed like you to come with us twentythree the regional office of the chief coroner for the province of ontario is located at grenville street at the corner of yonge next to the large credit union bank in the heart of downtown toronto it is a squat twostory structure fashioned in brown stucco and glass that manages to be both bland and ominous a giant governmentoperated funeral parlor cindy found herself thinking as the police car pulled to a stop in the adjacent parking lot which is exactly what the damn thing is she thought suppressing the panic that was bubbling inside her body like water boiling in a pot you have to stay calm she admonished herself scratching painfully at her arms her skin on fire as if shed just slipped into a burning sweater she wanted to jump from the car strip off all her clothes accost total strangers laugh hysterically in their faces scream at them until she was hoarse but she couldnt do any of those things because tom would tell her she was behaving inappropriately and hed be right of course he was always right she did behave inappropriately she yelled when whispers would suffice laughed when others might cry lashed out when what she wanted most was the comfort of someones arms how was it that tom managed to stay so focused so in control cindy wondered glancing over at her exhusband who was sitting beside her in the backseat of the police car staring out the side window how was it that his feathers never seemed to ruffle that even faced with the loss of his daughter he remained stoic and cool was it possible such composure was all an act that underneath the deceptively placid surface a smoldering geyser was waiting to erupt that behind the pat phrases the condescending nods the maddening reserve he was every bit as panicky as she was do you remember how much julia used to talk when she was a little girl cindy asked tom who either didnt hear her question or chose to ignore it you couldnt shut her up cindy continued undeterred shed start talking the minute she opened her eyes in the morning and she didnt stop until she closed them again at night and sometimes shed even talk in her sleep it was so cute remember tom toms shoulders stiffened cindy youd keep waiting for her to take a breath so you could get a word in but it would never come youd think surely she has to come up for air at some point but she just breezed from one topic into the next isnt that right tom toms head turned slowly toward her cindy and you didnt dare interrupt her cindy continued chuckling at the memory if you did shed just start all over again from the beginning and youd have to listen to the whole thing again until she got to the part where youd cut her off and then shed give you this little look remember that look tom you used to say it could cut glass cindy what cindy snapped understanding now how julia must have felt at being interrupted why had she always interrupted her why couldnt she just have let her speak i think we should go inside now tom said quietly why whats the rush is she going anywhere cindy caught the look of horror on her exhusbands face oh im sorry was that inappropriate mrs carver are you all right detective gill asked from the front seat im fine cindy told him i mean why wouldnt i be fine were just here to identify my daughters body right nothing to get upset about mrs carver detective bartolli said she always wanted to be an actress you know cindy told the two detectives trying to prolong her time in the car to postpone the inevitable she used to prance around the house in my high heels and nightgowns like a fairy princessyou should have seen herand shed make up these cute little plays and act out all the parts shed sing and dance she was really very good wasnt she tom cindy i remember one afternoon when julia was maybe four years old i was busy with heather and julia was playing with her barbies she had at least fifty of them and i suddenly realized it was awfully quiet in julias room so i put heather in her crib and went to see what was going on and there was julia standing naked in the middle of her bedroom in front of all her barbies whom shed arranged in this kind of freefloating semicircle and she was holding up this pencil and she was saying and now audience were going to operate on my vagina cindy laughed out loud cindy for gods sake tom said the smile slid from cindys face as if rubbed off by a harsh abrasive what not appropriate mrs carver detective bartolli said gently maybe detective l o s tgill should take you home mr carver can make the identification no cindy said quickly im fine youre not fine tom said there is no way youre going to go into that room without me cindy shes my daughter too nobody disputes that we recognize how difficult this is for you detective gill said then you also recognize theres no way youre keeping me from her mrs carver detective bartolli continued its very important that if you go inside you stay calm why cindy asked genuinely curious are you afraid ill upset the other corpses okay thats enough tom said clearly my wife is hysterical im not your wife cindy reminded him curtly but you are hysterical im fine cindy assured the two detectives ill be okay i promise illbe a good girl the child in her protested pulling back her shoulders and taking a deep breath determined to prove she could be as rational as grownup as they were ill be as cool as a cucumber she decided puzzling over the origin of that expression why a cucumber why not cool as a carrot or cool as a cabbage how about cool as a corpse now thats appropriate she thought almost laughing as she pushed open the car door and stepped onto the pavement the unseasonably hot september air descending on her head like a collapsing parachute better to keep such musings to herself she decided any more outbursts and they wouldnt let her into the building let alone into the viewing room they wouldnt let her see her daughter or what was left of her oh god she said trying not to picture julia lying battered and lifeless on a cold steel slab she felt her knees buckle her legs give way as if someone had kicked at them from behind the reality shed worked so hard to keep at bay pushing itself on top of her holding her down tearing through her body like a rapist cindy tom said catching her by the elbow before she could collapse im all right she told him regaining her composure putting one tenuous foot in front of the other mrs carver im fine they walked slowly around to the front of the building detective gill rushing ahead to open the heavy glass door then stepping back to allow them entry cindy crossed into the main lobby a cold but efficient use of space that was typical of most government buildings detective bartolli checked in with the dispatcher a middleaged man whose lush black beard was in stark contrast to his shiny bald head then quickly ushered the small group toward a room to the right of the lobby whats in here cindy asked pulling back as they reached the door its just a room detective gill assured her as they stepped over the threshold this is mark evert detective bartolli introduced the surprisingly robustlooking morgue attendant who was waiting for them inside mr evert tom said shaking the mans hand what is this some sort of bereavement room cindy we call it the comfort room mark evert replied really what kind of comfort are you offering mark evert smiled sadly as if he understood her pain like to sit down he pointed toward a grouping of recently refurbished sofa and chairs and theres a bathroom if youd like to freshen up cindy asked cindy toms voice warned from somewhere beside her she looked around the small room its dim lights meant to be soothing the smell of new carpeting permeating the cool air i think i would like to use the bathroom she said disappearing into the tiny room and locking the door after her she turned on the tap splashed several handfuls of cold water at her face stay calm she whispered at her reflection in the mirror over the sink the face in the glass stared back at her through hopelessly dazed eyes cindy noted the greenishyellow of the womans cheeks the dark circles under her eyes the circles spreading out in ripples like a still lake disturbed by a stone you can do this her reflection admonished silently you can do this no i cant cindy said out loud i cant there was a gentle knock on the bathroom door cindy tom called are you all right in there im fine in here she wanted to answer its out there i have a problem instead she said ill just be half a minute she took a deep breath then reached for the door stopped walked back to the toilet and flushed it watching as the water swirled aimlessly around the bowl before being sucked down the drain gone just like that okay she said coming back into the socalled comfort room noting how quiet it was this is what they mean by the term deathly quiet she thought knowing it would be inappropriate to voice such an observation out loud what happens now we go inside mark evert indicated the door directly behind him well show you the body of a young woman shes been strangled cindy drew in a sharp intake of air automatically reached for toms hand felt his fingers close around hers i thought you had closedcircuit tvs for this tom said his body stiffening along with his voice the morgue attendant nodded we do and generally speaking we prefer to make identifications that way especially in cases wheres theres been significant trauma to the face theres been trauma to her face cindy repeated struggling to understand the mans words there are a few bruises along with some swelling and discoloration oh no you cant just show us a photograph tom pressed unfortunately in cases of homicide this isnt an option we require a direct identification but on tv people usually stand behind a window or something procedures vary in every jurisdiction mark evert explained patiently if you need a few more minutes mr carver are you all right cindy asked her exhusband surprised to find their roles suddenly reversed just tell us what to expect tom said tersely the young woman youre going to see was strangled some time in the last fortyeight hours we havent done an autopsy yet to determine the exact time of death but decomposition has started decomposition the terrible word assaulted cindys ears like an ice pick to the brain well try to spare you as much as we can im afraid we arent allowed to clean up the body in any way is there a lot of blood tom asked no a prolonged sigh leaked from cindys lungs youll be asked to make a formal identification in the presence of these detectives myself and the pathologist what if were not sure tom asked cindy moaned the prospect of not being able to recognize her own child almost too much to bear then well ask you to supply us with julias dental records or her hairbrush can we go in now cindy interrupted knowing that if they waited any longer if she had to listen to any more malignant words like decomposition and discoloration or even to formerly benign words like dental records and hairbrush she would go mad mark everts hand hesitated on the doorknob youre sure youre ready cindy marveled at the question how could anyone ever be ready for something like this im ready she said feeling toms fingers digging into her own as the door opened and they stepped into the morgue it was like a huge operating room cindys eyes bounced from the creamcolored tiles on the walls to the darker tiles at her feet in the center of the room and running its entire width was a big stainless steel refrigerator at least ten feet high containing three rows of compartments there must be room for a hundred bodies in there cindy thought with a shudder wondering how the attendants removed those bodies from the lockers without straining their backs becoming only slowly aware of the narrow table directly in front of her of the white vinyl body bag stretched out across its smooth surface this is dr jong the pathologist mark evert said of the disconcertingly younglooking man doing his best to look invisible the doctor responding with an almost imperceptible nod of his head hes here to cut her up cindy realized a sudden loud buzzing filling her ears as if a thousand bees were trapped there remember mark evert was saying you have to be one hundred percent sure cindy turned to tom do you remember when julia was a little girl and she was showing off on that new bicycle you bought her and she fell off and broke both her arms i remember tom said clutching tightly to her hands and i rushed her to the hospital and of course we had to wait about four hours till somebody saw us and she kept saying why doesnt god like me mommy why doesnt he like me and i told her dont be silly of course god likes you he loves you but she was adamant no he doesnt love me or he wouldnt have broken my arms and we laughed about that later do you remember how we laughed about that later i remember tom said again and then the poor thing couldnt feed herself or go to the bathroom with both her arms in casts it didnt take her long to get the knack and she was embarrassed to go to school the teachers probably thought she was an abused child and then you got that rock n roll band you represented who were they again rush yeah rush i remember such nice guys they all signed her casts then she couldnt wait to get to school to show everybody and when it came time to take the casts off she cried and carried on we had to keep those damn smelly things for years i remember that just after the doctor removed them julia fainted and the doctor who was standing on the other side of the room came flying back and caught her before she fell off the table she might have cracked her head open on the floor and there i was standing right beside her and i didnt realize what was happening cindy tom said softly dont do this if id watched her more closely she would never have fallen off her bicycle kids fall off their bicycles every day if id paid closer attention mrs carver the morgue attendant said gently do you think youre ready now do you think she had any idea how much i love her cindy asked her former husband tears filling her eyes and spilling down her cheeks she knows tom said i yelled at her the morning of her audition i yelled at her about the dog i yelled at her for banging on the bathroom door i insisted she come to the bridal fitting that afternoon when i knew she didnt want to come this didnt happen because you yelled at her what if she was kidnapped on her way to the fitting what if whoever did this to her saw her as she was getting on the subway and followed her cindy i should have been paying more attention youre a great mother cindy tom told her she must have been so scared mrs carver detective bartolli ventured then stopped cindy confronted the younglooking pathologist how long does it take to strangle someone cindy please dr jong tell me how long it takes to strangle someone approximately two minutes the doctor answered two minutes cindy repeated such a long time the buzzing in her ears grew louder well get through this she thought she heard tom say words jumped out at her only to retreat are ready mrs cindy noticed the police shield on the front of the body bag as a mans hand reached for the zipper the sound of the zipper cutting through the buzzing in her ears like a chainsaw through a chunk of wood one sound magnifying the other until cindy felt her head about to burst hands parted the zipper a head emerged as if from the womb cindy saw the straight blond hair plastered against the ghostly white skin tried not to absorb the unsightly blotches of purple blue and red that stained the colorless cheeks like paint on canvas oh god she thought recognizing the oncelovely face and then the room filled with the sound of angry bees and cindy fell unconscious to the floor twentyfour are you all right tom was asking cindy opened her eyes lifted her head from the soft beige andivoryprint silk of the sofa stared at the man looming over her i dont know maybe this will help he pushed a tall glass of something cold into her hands what is it vodka and cranberry juice cindy pushed herself into a sitting position took a long sip its good tom sank down beside her he stretched his long legs across the woodand glass coffee table in front of him laid his head back against one of the pillows that was quite the ordeal he leaned sideways toward her clicked his glass against hers to better days he promptly downed half his glass in a single gulp better days cindy agreed taking another sip of her drink the presence of the vodka both flattening and emphasizing the tartness of the cranberries she looked around the large expensively appointed room with its muted furniture and bright needlepoint rugs its bold splashes of modern art against pale ecru walls its south wall of floortoceiling windows providing a magnificent view of lake ontario this is some place youve got here youve seen it before havent you first time she reminded him its beautiful i didnt realize the cookie had such good taste the cookie tom looked genuinely perplexed cindy turned her head to hide an unexpected blush sorry fiona a slow smile crept across toms handsome face you call my wife the cookie term of endearment cindy took another sip of her drink what am i doing here you fainted remember yes i seem to be doing that a lot lately but then i woke up and said you couldnt face going home that your mother and sister were driving you nuts they mean well yes he said cryptically i remember so you brought me to your condominium cindy stated choosing not to explore his last remark marveling at everything that had transpired in the last hour wheres the fiona she asked listening for the click of the womans highheeled shoes on the marble floors muskoka shes at the cottage we decided it was probably a good idea for her to stay up there this week what with everything thats going on and heather being here cindy glanced toward the long hall that ran the length of the huge apartment is heather at school i think she said she has classes till six cindy checked her watch it was barely four tom brought his feet to the floor leaned forward rested his elbows on his knees shes planning to go back home this weekend cindy nodded gratefully and julia she asked speaking the name that had gone unvoiced since that awful moment in the morgue when the attendant had unzipped the white vinyl bag its not her she heard tom whisper its not julia we wait he said now what else can we do cindy jumped to her feet her drink sloshing around in her glass spilling onto her hand i feel so guilty she said wiping the back of her hand on her jeans guilty why on earth would you feel guilty because when i saw that poor girls face and realized it wasnt julia i was so relieved so grateful so happy of course youd feel that way i think its sally hanson cindy said who the girl who disappeared the week after julia her poor parents at least theyll know tom swallowed the last of his drink then deposited his glass on the coffee table with an authority that was missing from his voice cindy nodded would it be better to know she wondered at least there wasnt any blood tom said his eyes returning to the morgue still clearly haunted by what hed seen as we were leaving i heard the dispatcher talking to detective gill about some couple who were killed in a car accident this morning cindy said remembering he said the car exploded and the people were badly burned he called them crispy critters cindy stared at her former husband in disbelief did he really say that or did i just imagine it tom shook his head i heard the same thing i cant believe they talk that way i guess youd have to develop a pretty thick skin in order to survive in that kind of environment still cindy shuddered crispy critters think theyre anything like krispy kremes tom asked a bubble of laughter suddenly burst inside cindys throat then tumbled into the air like a child tossed from a toboggan immediately toms laughter somersaulted after hers the disparate sounds becoming hopelessly enmeshed impossible to separate one from the other i cant believe were laughing cindy said laughing harder ill have an order of crispy critters please tom said hold the mayo cindy embellished oh thats hurts tom said doubling over from the waist holding his sides whats wrong with us we could use another drink tom took cindys almost empty glass from her outstretched hand retrieved his own glass from the coffee table and marched out of the room cindy followed after him as if afraid to be left alone even for an instant she ran her hand along the dark oak finish of the long dining room table as she walked purposefully toward the kitchen stopping to stare at the impressive wine cabinet built into the wall between the two rooms each bottle of wine neatly labeled behind the thick layer of glass the bottles secured in metal berths stacked one on top of the other like bodies in a morgue cindythought fresh giggles gathering in her throat thats quite a collection she said coming into the gleaming marbleandtile kitchen watching as tom refilled their glasses how many bodies are there what bottles she corrected i meant to say bottles tom smiled theres room for four hundred you always wanted a wine cellar l s ti always wanted a wine cellar he agreed it was cindys turn to smile so what shall we toast this time how about no more visits to the morgue tom offered sounds good to me cindy took a long swallow this time the vodka overwhelmed the subtle hint of cranberries she noticed that a pleasant tingle was beginning to settle around the back of her neck any minute her head would separate from the rest of her body and float into the air like aheliumfilled balloon so how many bodies do you think that thing at the morgue holds tom laughed once again finishing half his drink in a single swallow you asked that question on the drive home i did what was the answer detective bartolli said ninety apparently its at three quarters of its capacity right now and most bodies are in and out within fortyeight hours and they use a forklift to take the bodies from the top row i remember now you were very concerned about their backs cindy laughed shook her head grabbed the side of the island in the middle of the room to steady herself you all right feeling better every minute cindy took another swallow so are you going to show me around this dump my pleasure tom made a sweeping gesture with his hands this is the kitchen we can skip the kitchen still dont like to cook hate it which is a real shame because if memory serves me correctly you were a very good cook really how would you know you were never home whats down this way she asked before he could protest she let go of the island skipped from the kitchen turned left at the hall this is the library tom said of the woodpaneled room they came to first except for the southern expanse of window overlooking the waterfront the room was essentially wallpapered with hardcover books very impressive the view helps and i didnt even realize the cookie could read fiona is a very prolific reader tom said curtly although there was laughter in his eyes a woman of many talents yes indeed tom led cindy into the next room its east wall completely taken up by an enormous flatscreen tv this is the media room still like leather i see cindy gave the dark red leather sofa a seductive squeeze where are the bedrooms down this way tom led her back down the hall past the marble powder room to the right of the marble entrance youre sure youre okay im fine cindy followed after him like a puppy at his heels she thought recognizing she was way beyond fine and teetering into plastered it didnt take much she thought a dead body a couple of vodkaspretty soon she was sailing this is the guest room cindy peeked inside the greenandwhite bedroom saw a pair of heathers jeans draped over a small floweredprint chair several of her blouses strewn across the white bedspread covering the queensize bed its lovely it has its own bathroom of course just like the comfort room cindy giggled amazing how they think of everything isnt it amazing tom agreed you think granger mcallister designed it whos granger mcallister our neighbors the sellicks my neighbors she corrected leaning against a wall to keep from lying down on the floor hes an architect with granger mcallister you think he designed the morgue tom asked one word sliding into the next as he directed her toward the master bedroom suite no cindy giggled youre so silly youre so drunk i certainly hope so cindy kicked off her shoes burying her toes in the plush white carpeting wow she said her eyes sweeping across the enormous room taking in the fulllength sofa and chairs that were grouped in front of the southern wall of windows the ornate credenza that sat against the wall opposite the bed the bed itself a kingsize extravaganza complete with tall pillars swathed in yards of creamcolored satin looks like something out of the arabian nights spend much time in it she asked pointedly cindy cindy tom said coming up behind her his hands falling heavily on her shoulders his slender hips pressing into her backside what am i going to do with you cindy felt his breath on the back of her neck recognized the oncefamiliar tingle creeping between her legs whats in here she asked extricating herself from his grasp and diving toward a small area off the main bedroom wow do you actually use all this equipment tom moved easily between the treadmill the stair master and the stationary bicycle there was also a large red exercise ball in one corner and an impressive selection of free weights stacked against one wall a mediumsized tv sat on a high shelf across from the treadmill i work out most days for about an hour what about you i do yoga cindy told him recalling her one visit to the yoga studio really i wouldnt have pegged you for the yoga type why is that i wouldnt have thought you had the patience he laughed i can just see you lying there thinking can we please speed this up a bit he shook his head what do i know anyway it obviously agrees with you you told me before that i look like crap i did when in your office ah yes but that was before our little trip to the morgue youre saying i look great in comparison to that girl on the table im saying you look great period so you lied before when you said i looked like crap i lied youre a liar she pressed giddily im a lawyer he agreed and they both laughed and the bathroom cindy asked as he leaned toward her this way she ducked out of his reach tripped past the two walkin closets toward the en suite master bathroom it was a big room its walls the same beige marble as the floor with a double jacuzzi a large open shower stall hisandhers counters and sinks and enough mirrors to satisfy even the most dedicated narcissist oh jeez cindy said seeing her reflection bounce from one mirror to the next the old tshirt the sloppy jeans the stringy hair the zombielike eyes i do look like crap you look beautiful tom said leaving his glass on the counter and coming up behind her lawyer cindy said falling back against his chest his arms wrapping around hers and the side of his cheek pressing against her own as he removed the glass from her hand and placed it on the other counter was he really going to kiss her she wondered as he slowly spun her around was she really going to let him flashback cindy stands in front of her bathroom mirror removing the makeup she painstakingly applied only an hour earlier replaying toms phone call in her mind sorry babe i cant make the movie weve got something of an emergency going on here and im going to be tied up for at least a few more hours give the sitter an extra couple of bucks and see if you can line her up for next week he tasted of vodka and cranberries cindy thought now luxuriating in the softness of his lips feeling his tongue slide gently across hers not too much not too little just the right amount just like old times she thought recalling her mothers words what about neil she thought seeing his reflection in the mirror behind toms head you re the most courageous woman i know she heard him say it was always so good with you tom was whispering his hands tugging at her tshirt expert fingers disappearing beneath it unhooking her bra god real breasts id almost forgotten how good they feel flashback cindy lying in bed her pillow moist with her tears as tom crawls in beside her reaches under her nightgown cups her breasts in his hands sorry im so late he says kissing her neck she smells the wine on his breath as his fingers reach between her legs client wouldnt stop talking i thought dinner would never end he buries his face in the side of her neck cindy inhales another womans perfume as he enters her from behind come here tom said now guiding her between the treadmill and the stationary bicycle toward the bedroom pulling her tshirt over her head as he pushed the layers of satin aside her bra falling from her shoulders disappearing into the white carpet like a childs mitten into snow you always had such beautiful breasts he marveled pushing her back on the bed and unbuttoning his shirt what am i doing cindy wondered again thinking of neil three years of being a nun and suddenly im the town slut i dont feel so great she thought as toms tongue found her nipples and his fingers struggled with the button of her jeans flashback cindy in bed chilled and nauseous sipping herbal tea and fighting the urge to throw up when she hears the front door open and the sound of a womans laugh she crawls out of bed and staggers to the top of the stairs can i get you a drink she hears tom ask from the kitchen hello tom she calls watching as tom emerges at the bottom of the steps clearly surprised to see her what are you doing home isnt this your day to help out at heathers school i wasnt feeling well i had to cancel whats going on forgot my briefcase tom says breezily look who i ran into coming down the street he adds almost as an afterthought a womans head pops into view cindy recognizes her as the mother of one of heathers friends what on earth was she doing cindy wondered now shaking her head in an effort to clear it the motion making her dizzy and nauseous we had some pretty good times together tom was saying clearly oblivious to her discomfort as always cindy thought when you werent cheating on me she said flatly a nervous chuckle you took all that much too seriously you know it meant nothing to me was that supposed to make her feel better it meant something to me silence his hand froze on her bare skin youre killing the mood here babe youd really make love to me in this apartment in this bed jesus tom said sitting up and lifting his hands into the air as if there were a gun pointing at his head you cant just relax and let things happen can you damn it cindy you havent changed at all damn it tom neither have you cindy pushed herself off the bed re zipped her jeans her eyes searching through the white carpet for her bra probably not a good idea to move so fast she decided falling to her knees and locating the bra with her fingers already back on her feet when she heard the voice from the doorway dad what are you doing home so early it was too late to do anything but turn around oh wow heathers eyes opened wide with disbelief moving from her barechested father to her halfcrouching halfnaked mother its not what you think tom said lamely fiddling with the buttons of his shirt nothing happened cindy said pulling her bra into position securing the clasp at the back first her mother and sister walk in on her and neil now her daughter finds her with tom thats what i get for not having sex in three years cindy thought sure okay wow it was a momentary lapse in judgment cindy explained i thought you had classes till six does this mean youre getting back together absolutely not tom said forcefully god no cindy echoed okay well wow okay heather said backing out of the room i think i should probably get going sweetie cindy called im fine dont worry about me ill phone you later the front door closed after her tom looked at cindy i hope youre proud of yourself he said twentyfive wwednesday september cindy stayed in bed watching tv as the country relived the agony of the previous years terrorist attacks on the world trade center like everyone else she knew cindy could recall the exact time and the place shed been when shed learned the devastating news it was during the film festival and she and meg had just emerged from the uptown after a screening of the british film last orders starring michael caine and bob hoskins it was around am and they were heading up yonge street to meet trish and grab a sandwich before their next movie where is everyone cindy asked wondering at the lack of a lineup for the next movie somethings happening at the corner meg said when they reached the intersection of yonge and bloor they joined a crowd of several hundred people standing in stunned silence watching the gigantic tv screen on top of the lowrise building on the southeast corner as the two hijacked planes flew repeatedly and from a multitude of sickening angles into the giant twin towers she and meg had watched in openmouthed horror as the buildings collapsed peeling downward from top to bottom like the skin of a banana the resultant debris spilling over onto the streets of new york covering everything in its path in a sickening gray dust at the time cindy thought nothing could be worse leigh walked into the bedroom youve got to talk to mom she was saying dimpled knees peeking out from under light khaki shorts her white sleeveless blouse in sharp contrast to her deeply tanned arms she canceled the fitting with marcel what are you watching she reached toward the bed and pressed the off button on the remote what are you doing cindy grabbed the remote flipped the tv back on leigh wrestled the unit from cindys hands switched the tv off youshouldnt be watching this what do you mean i shouldnt be watching it what are you talking about itll only upset you give me that cindy told her younger sister whose response was to hide the remote behind her back cindy jumped off the bed tried reaching around her sister leigh im warning you give it back no leigh i wont oh for petes sake cindy marched back to the television and triumphantly pressed the manual on switch her sister was right behind her pressing it off what the hell do you think youre doing im protecting you protecting me from what from yourself from myself cindy repeated incredulously your judgment isnt the best lately my judgment isnt the best cindy shook her head what are you talking about im talking about the fact that first you slept with your accountant then you went to bed with your exhusband cindy rolled her eyes neil is not my accountant and i didnt go to bed with tom only because heather walked in on you it was over by the time she walked in what was over you said nothing happened nothing did happen but it almost did which is my point exactly cindy sank down on the bed this conversation makes no sense whatsoever you need to get dressed leigh said cindy glanced down at her yellow cotton nightshirt im fine its almost noon and youre still in your pajamas cindy gave her sister a look that said so leigh marched into cindys closet where are you going what are you doing leigh returned seconds later carrying a pair of black capri pants and a gree nandwhitestriped jersey she threw them on the bed along with some freshly washed underwear here wear this i dont want to wear that im not leaving this room till you get dressed well then you might as well make yourself comfortable because im not wearing that for petes sake cindy youre worse than my kids for petes sake leigh youre worse than our mother cindy leigh stalemate cindy thought so whats it going to be leigh asked the remote seemingly attached to the palm of her right hand both hands on her hips cindy shook her head okay okay you win youll get dressed ill need some help with this cindy pulled at the front of her nightgown leigh approached warily what kind of help in the next second cindy lunged at her sister knocking her to the floor as she grabbed for the remote what are you doing leigh gasped as cindy collapsed on top of her whats wrong with you give me that thing no give it to me mom give me the goddamn remote mom coming their mother called from downstairs is something wrong youre such a baby cindy told her sister scratching at her arm youre such a brat norma appleton ran into the room took one look at her daughters rolling around on the floor and threw her hands up into the air what on earth is going on in here she scratched my arm she took my remote stop this the two of you right now the girls stopped struggling sat on the floor glaring at one another its my remote cindy said petulantly give her back her remote their mother instructed leigh tossed the unit to the floor cindy promptly scooped it up look what she did to my arm leigh extended her forearm displaying a thin red scratch running above her elbow apologize to your sister norma appleton said cindy shook her head looked the other way apologize to your sister her mother repeated sorry cindy mumbled under her breath what did you say leigh asked i didnt hear you mother cindy warned dont press your luck their mother said helping her younger daughter to her feet oh sure take her side im not taking sides dont press your luck what would you call that leigh practically shook with indignation oh darling your hi helens norma appleton pointed with her chin toward the underside of leighs arms maybe a different blouse cindy started laughing youre both nuttier than fruitcakes you know that leigh said cindy scrambled to her feet laughed harder whats so funny you are youre being ridiculous im being ridiculous im being ridiculous youre being ridiculous girls please am i the one whos refusing to get dressed am i the one whose daughter walked in on her halfnaked with her former husband heather was not halfnaked cindy said sure make jokes correct my grammar its easier than facing the truth the truth being girls their mother warned the truth being that youre behaving irresponsibly what youre always flying out of this house without telling anyone where youre going or what time youll be back its my house im an adult i didnt realize i had to report to anyone its not a matter of reporting its a matter of consideration what if i dont know where im going or when ill be back thats exactly what im saying you go off halfcocked youre starting to sound like tom you know that well maybe hes right sorry if im not behaving completely rationally these days since when has it ever been any different leigh scoffed cindy does exactly what cindy wants to do just as she always has where do you think julia gets it from whoa cindy warned if cindy wants to get married when shes eighteen and her parents are dead set against it no problem leigh continued undeterred shell just elope to niagara falls doesnt matter if her parents go crazy with worry for two days wondering where the hell she is doesnt matter that they miss their younger daughters performance in our town so what if shes the lead and shes been rehearsing for months hell its only a school play therell be plenty of other opportunities isnt that what you said mom sweetheart their mother demurred where is all this coming from our town cindy marveled youve got to be kidding why because it was important to me leigh darling please please what mother please dont make a fuss please dont be upset because you still cant find any time for me if this is about the fitting i had to cancel this afternoon you didnt have to cancel the fitting mother you chose to cancel the fitting l s tit just seemed like there were other things that were more important more important than your granddaughters wedding i didnt say that why is cindys daughter any more important than mine in case you hadnt noticed cindy interrupted my daughter is missing she burst into a flood of angry confused tears cindy her mother said rushing to her side leave her alone will you stop babying her whats the matter with you norma appleton demanded of her younger daughter why are you acting this way because i am sick and tired of being ignored whos ignoring you i all but abandon my family to come over here i cook for you i clean up after you nobody asked you to do any of that ive been doing it all your life leigh snapped after you got married who was there for you who made sure things got patched up between you and mom and dad who was there after that wonderful husband of yours walked out who sat beside you and listened to that damn message he left on the answering machine over and over again who rushed over after julia decided she wanted to live with her father who sat up all night with you while you cried your heart out you cindy shouted punching her fists into the air like a boxer flailing at an invincible opponent you you you always the first one at the scene of an accident always available in times of crisis tell me when else do you ever come around silence when else do you ever let me in the two sisters stared at one another the doorbell rang shit cindy said shit echoed leigh shit said their mother nobody moved the doorbell rang again ill get it norma appleton said finally walking slowly toward the hall can i leave you two alone she asked turning back the doorbell rang a third time coming norma appleton hurried down the stairs im coming hold your horses are you expecting anyone leigh asked cindy shook her head listening for the sound of voices i know its stupid she said but every time it rings i think it might be julia me too leigh said in the next instant cindy was in her sisters arms crying on her shoulder oh cindy leigh whispered crying too im so sorry you know i didnt mean any of those things i said no youre right ive treated you very badly no you havent i havent thanked you for any of the things youve done i dont need thanks yes you do cindy told her you need to be thanked you deserve to be valued leigh smiled sadly hugged her sister tighter to her chest it probably wasnt the best time to bring up our town im sure you were terrific i love you i love you too cindy brushed an errant curl away from her sisters face did i tell you how much i like your hair this color really cause i was thinking of maybe adding a couple of darker streaks that would be nice too i tcindy her mother called from the front hall come look at what just arrived for you what is it looks like a plant of some kind norma appleton was already tearing at the cellophane by the time cindy and leigh reached the bottom of the stairs cindy unpinned the small white envelope from the side of the wrapping as her mother extricated a lovely arrangement of african violets thinking of you the card read martin crawley cindy laughed tucked the card into the pocket of her nightshirt felt it warm against her breast whos it from cindy smiled my accountant she said he seems like a very nice man leigh acknowledged lifting the plant from her mothers hands and carrying it into the kitchen so i was thinking of making my famous lemon chicken that julia loves so much maybe freezing it she called back so that she can have some when she comes home what do you think i think shed like that very much cindy said following her sister into the kitchen good then thats what ill do leigh hmm cindy paused took a deep breath thank you she said twentysix what did you say to get them to leave neil was asking i said please cindy answered something i havent been saying nearly enough these days it was almost midnight and she and neil were sitting naked in her bed having finished making love for the third time since his arrival some two hours earlier elvis lay on the floor beside them as if hed sensed their need for privacy or maybe hed just gotten tired of the constant motion of having to adjust his position to accommodate their fevered acrobatics actually i think they were quite happy for the break my brotherinlaws been pretty patient but im sure hes glad to have his wife back even if its only for a day or two and my mothers been here since cindy stopped reluctant to say julias name out loud to bring the continuing agony of her daughters disappearance into bed with them when being in bed with neil was the only respite shed had since julia went missing but it was already too late her pain which had gradually morphed from constant dagger like thrusts to her chest and abdomen into a steadier duller though no less constant ache that infused every fiber in her bodya chronic illness as opposed to a surprise attackhad already wormed its way under the sheets to insinuate itself between them what say we watch some tv cindy flipped on the television set began restlessly surfing through the channels whats that neil asked as cindys fingers froze on the remote the screen filled with the distorted image of edward munchs masterpiece the scream now reborn as a hideous mask hiding the face of a merciless killer as he stalked a group of nubile teenagers scream cindy said with authority shaking her head at the irony that such a breathtaking work of art had achieved its greatest fame via a series of teenage slasher movies then shaking her head again with the realization that shed seen the entire scream franchise no i wont see scream with you julia had protested when the film was first released its supposed to be terrible i cant believe youre going how can you like that garbage before julia went missing cindy had an easy answer similar to the one shed given neil on their first date she enjoyed such vicarious torment shed told julia precisely because it was vicarious she could relish the thrill of danger without experiencing its real threat the danger was entirely illusory she was perfectly safe except no one was safe she understood now it was the notion of safety not the threat of danger that was the real illusion the monsters were very real cindy flipped to another channel then another and another stop me if you see anything interesting neil gently removed the remote control unit from her hand turned the tv off its late why dont we just get some sleep did you ever cheat on your wife cindy asked suddenly carefully monitoring neils reaction no he said not my style tom cheated on me all the time toms an ass yes he is isnt he cindy smiled although this time the smile was genuine and not the stiff automatic reflex that normally accompanied each reference to her exhusband the divorce was seven years ago she heard julia say get over it amazing cindy thought her smile widening i am over it you hungry she asked neil suddenly energized thirsty just sleepy cindy felt her body tense to sleep she thought uneasily perchance to dream quick she said name all the seven dwarfs what from snow white you know sleepy bashful grumpy doc happy cindy whats wrong wrong why do you think somethings wrong because its midnight and were talking about snow white and the seven dwarfs what is it dont you want me to stay no of course i want you to stay youre sure because if youre not comfortable its not that cindy reached for her robe and climbed out of bed crossing to the window and opening the shutters staring past the backyard toward the roofs of the large homes along clarendon wondering absently what secrets were hidden beneath those roofs what is it neil asked coming up behind her surrounding her with his arms its just that im a bit of a restless sleeper these days thats understandable im not so sure how understanding youll be when my screaming wakes you up a couple of hours from now youve been having nightmares i dont know what youd call them theyre so stupid cindy told neil of waking up in a sweat night after night convinced she was dying because shed forgotten to take some nonexistent pills my mother says its hormonal my sister says its a natural byproduct of my anxiety either way its making me crazy i think i might be able to help you neil offered really how come here neil led her back to bed and sat her down then disappeared into the en suite bathroom seconds later cindy heard him rummaging around in her medicine cabinet heard the sound of water running from the taps i dont want any sleeping pills she said as he reentered the room a glass of water in his right hand you need to sleep cindy not everything can be cured by taking a pill try these neil perched on the side of the bed and opened the fist of his free hand cindy stared into his empty palm whats thisthe emperors new pills take as many as you need cindy smiled stared into the deep blue of his eyes you really think this is going to work cant hurt go on doctors orders cindys fingers hesitated over the invisible pills she took one raised it to her mouth then dropped it onto the tip of her tongue and swallowed it down with some water then she reached over took another one why dont you have one more for good luck for good luck cindy agreed swallowing the third invisible pill and returning the glass of water to neils waiting hand now what neil deposited the empty glass on the night table beside the bed then climbed into bed beside cindy sliding down under the covers and taking her in his arms good night cindy he said kissing her softly sleep well joy fielding when cindy woke up at seventhirty the next morning neil was already in the shower well what do you know the damn pills actually worked she laughed out loud was considering joining neil in the shower when the phone rang cindy its ryan sellick the voice boomed across the phone wires i know its early and im probably the last person in the world you want to be hearing from under the circumstances but neil emerged from the bathroom toweldrying his hair is something wrong cindy asked the expression on neils face asking the same thing my neighbor she whispered her hand over the mouthpiece believe me i wouldnt be calling you if i werent absolutely desperate what is it ryan neil crossed the room kissed cindys forehead began gathering up his clothes its just that youve always been so kind to faith and i dont know who else to turn to is faith all right shes had a really rough couple of days she was up most of the night and she just fell asleep about fifteen minutes ago unfortunately i have to be in hamilton all day you want me to look in on her i was wondering if you could take care of kyle until faith wakes up i know its a hell of a thing for me to be asking especially when you think i might have he paused its just that im being picked up in less than half an hour and okay cindy told him watching neil get dressed okay ill be over in fifteen minutes cindy said thank you cindy what silence then please believe i had nothing to do with julias disappearance ill be over soon cindy hung up the phone youre sure thats a good idea neil asked cindy shrugged she wasnt sure of anything anymore maybe immersing myself in someone elses problems for a few hours will take my mind off my own youre amazing neil said i had a good nights sleep neil kissed her gently on the lips his hair smelled of green apple shampoo i better go home get changed for work thank max for me for letting his father stay out all night cindy said as she was walking him to the front door minutes later ill call you later cindy watched neil drive off then hurried upstairs to get dressed realizing she was feeling better more positivethan she had in days was it because shed actually slept through the night for the first time in weeks because she was having sex for the first time in years because she thought she might be falling in love how can i even be thinking about falling in love at a time like this she asked the silent house discarding her terrycloth robe and standing naked in the upstairs hall knowing that she was completely alone that her mother wasnt here to warn her of the dangers of catching a draft her sister wasnt waiting to point out that she too could have a flat stomach if she had the time cindy had to work out that heather wasnt gasping in embarrassment and dismay at what the future held in store that julia wasnt here to tell her to please put something on that julia wasnt here im all alone cindy said as the dog rushed over to lick at her toes well maybe not all alone she amended surprisingly grateful for the animals presence she knelt to stroke his side watched l s thim roll over to offer his belly thank you for being here she told him obliging him with a few heartfelt scratches elvis groaned his pleasure stretched himself out to his full length pawed at the air for more dont stop he seemed to be saying dont stop dont stop she heard herself cry out in joyous abandon as neil buried his head between her thighs im doing it again she said out loud how can i be happy how can i be hopeful for the future when the present is so unsettled and yet hope was exactly what she was experiencing was it some kind of premonition cindy wondered as she showered and dressed was her intuition telling her that things were about to change that all was not lost that there was indeed reason to be optimistic maybe at this very instant julia was being rescued cindy projected racing down the stairs to the kitchen maybe any minute now the police would be turning up at her front door with the good news and i wont be here she said deciding to call detective bartolli tell him where shed be just in case she left the sellicks phone number with the officer who answered the phone then shut elvis in the kitchen and quickly exited the house she arrived at the sellicks door at the same time a black caprice was pulling into the driveway would you tell ryan his lift is here an attractive young woman called leaning out the window of the drivers seat cindy smiled at the woman whose long coralcolored ringlets hung past the shoulders of her lowcut floralprint blouse acknowledging the young womans request with a nod of her head as she rang the bell cindy thank god ryan said as he opened the door your lift is here cindy motioned toward the driveway stepped into the hall ryan signaled with his index finger to the young woman then closed the door the babys asleep he said straightening his dark blue tie speaking quickly faiths been expressing her milk so there are a few bottles in the fridge all you have to do is heat one up for a minute in the microwave ryan cindy interrupted gently its okay i know what to do of course you do his eyes swept across the floor like a broom damn it whered i put my briefcase is that it cindy pointed to a black leather briefcase propped against the wall next to the kitchen thats it he took two giant steps toward it scooped it into his hands held it tight against his gray suit his eyes shooting from the kitchen to the living room im sorry the place is such a mess ill try to straighten up a little oh no please you dont have to do that its fine gives me something to do outside a car horn honked ive got to go go i look okay you look great very important potential client or id send somebody else knock em dead youre a godsend cindy i dont know how to thank you you can find my little girl she thought your rides waiting she said ryan opened the door ive left my cell phone number on the kitchen counter in case there are any problems there wont be ill call you as soon as i get two minutes try not to worry ryan ran down the front steps to the car then stopped his hand on the door handle has there been any news he called back an obvious afterthought cindy shook her head drive carefully she advised the impatient young woman behind the wheel of the car ill phone you later cindy waved as the woman backed her car onto the street and turned west toward poplar plains not envying them the traffic they faced hamilton was almost close enough to be considered a suburb but rush hour traffic would add at least twenty minutes to the normally hourlong drive and that was providing there were no accidents along the way typical altercation it was an accident for gods sake julia age thirteen and already towering over her mother stares unapologetically at the broken lalique vase her careless hand has swept off the mantel above the fireplace i know it was an accident cindy says evenly i just said you should be more careful its just a damn vase i dont know what youre getting so bent out of shape about it was a birthday gift from meg and please watch your language whatd i say damn you call that language julia i hear you say much worse that doesnt mean it means youre a hypocrite julia mother stalemate cindy closed the front door leaned her head against it trying not to hear the echo of julias recriminations clawing at her through the years i have to stop doing this she thought i have to stop projecting julia into every scenario stop putting her inflection into every casual utterance how do i do that she asked pushing herself away from the door how do i stop thinking about my daughter how do i get used to living without her she walked into the living room the hope shed felt only moments earlier rapidly dissipating as she surveyed the chaos pillows from the living room sofa lay scattered on the hardwood floor there were used coffee cups everywhere something sticky grabbed at the soles of her shoes a plate of leftover pieces of kentucky fried chicken sat largely untouched on the water stained coffee table in the middle of the room cindy carried the plate into the kitchen swept the food into the garbage disposal under the sink the sink full of dirty dishes what a mess she stacked the dishes in the dishwasher then rinsed out by hand the half dozen wine glasses on the counter was faith drinking or was it ryan does your daughter drink detective gill had asked no cindy said occasionally tom corrected stop it cindy said out loud not everything is about julia julias reflection winked at her from the large window overlooking the backyard of course it is she said as upstairs a baby started to cry twentyseven cindy hurried up the stairs to the nursery glancing toward the closed doors of the master bedroom as she tiptoed past hoping the babys cries wouldnt disturb faith its okay its okay she cooed at the screaming infant his face scrunched into a tight wrinkled ball like a roll of bright pink yarn she reached into the crib and drew the baby gingerly to her chest kissing his soft sweet smelling forehead as she rocked him gently back and forth its okay baby dont cry dont cry amazingly the infant stopped howling almost immediately that was easy cindy thought standing by the side of the crib continuing her rhythmic rocking too easy she realized as seconds later the baby stiffened in her arms his hands and feet shooting from his body like the limbs of a leaping frog a fresh round of screams pierced the air my goodness cindymuttered tapping the door to the nursery closed with her foot had julia ever screamed this loudly do you need changing is that the problem cindy looked around the nursery noticing for the first time what a lovely room it was pale blue walls bleached wood crib and handpainted dresser a high shelf filled with soft colorful stuffed animals that ran along three of the walls a bentwood rocking chair by the small side window its curtains the same delicate blueandwhite gingham as the crib sheets a mobile of dancing elephants hung from the overhead light fixture another mobile this one of pastelcolored butterflies dangled over the crib everything you could ask for cindy told the crying infant lying him across the changing table against one wall and reaching for the giant box of disposable diapers at her feet well get you all cleaned up and then youll be happy youll see she unsnapped the babys clean white sleeper and removed his diaper with a sure and steady hand just like riding a bicycle she told the baby whose response was to scream even louder not too impressed i see and not wet either she realized replacing the dry diaper with another then leaning forward to secure the tabs just as a sudden arch of urine sprayed into the air narrowly missing her eye cindy pulled back startled oh my she said with her mothers voice well i only had girls they didnt do things like that she wiped off the top of the changing table and replaced the nowwet diaper with another clean one then gently maneuvered the babys wriggling feet back into the legs of his sleeper before carrying him out of the room ssh she cautioned hurrying past the master bedroom and down the stairs we dont want to wake mommy mommy needs her sleep mommy needs a psychiatrist cindy thought proceeding past the messy living room into the nowtidy kitchen or at the very least a housekeeper she reached into the fridge located one of the babys bottles and popped it into the microwave the baby screaming steadily in her ear its okay sweetheart well have you all fixed up in no time or not cindy thought when the infant refused to take the bottle come on sweetheart you can do it mmmm warm milk yummy delicious try some cindy carried the baby into the living room and sank down on the pillowless green velvet sofa cradling kyle the way she remembered cradling julia shed nursed julia for almost a year she remembered fondly as kyles lips bounced across her white tshirt searching for her breast oh sweetheart im so sorry i dont have any milk but i have this yummy bottle she slid the rubber nipple into his mouth even as kyle tried turning his head away in protest come on sweetheart give it a chance kyles lips suddenly locked around the rubber nipple his crying shuddering to a halt as he devoted all his energy to draining the liquid from the bottle thats a good boy yes thats it now youve got it julia used to suckle with that same ferocious determination cindy found herself thinking recalling the hard tug at her breast each time julia would settle in against her to be fed she kissed the top of kyles downcovered head tried remembering the same scene with heather but cindy had few memories of nursing heather and those few she did have revolved more around julia whod sit screaming at cindys feet her arms wrapped tightly around her mothers knees every time cindy tried breastfeeding her younger child ultimately everyone involved was a nervous wreck and cindy switched heather over to a bottle when she was barely two months old well well look at you go cindy watched the milk rapidly disappear from the bottle when the bottle was empty cindy lifted kyle over her shoulder and gently patted his back until she heard him burp what a guy cindy murmured rocking him back and forth in her arms until he drifted off to sleep shed always loved this part the baby part she knew a lot of women didnt that they had trouble relating to their children until their children started relating to them maybe faith was one of those women maybe once kyle started responding to her shed stop viewing his outbursts as evidence of her own failure maybe as the year progressed and kyle started sitting up trying to stand to walk to talk shed realize what a miracle she and her husband had created together the tremendous gift theyd been given and shed be happy except it wasnt as easy as that and cindy knew it postpartum depression if indeed thats what faith was suffering from couldnt be cured with simple platitudes or even common sense another case of hormones running amok cindy thought wondering if ryan had taken her earlier advice talked to faiths doctor about prescribing stronger medication i certainly cant keep running over here every time theres a problem she thought carrying kyle up the stairs to the nursery why not she wondered what else do i have to do cindy felt an unexpected tear wend its way down her cheek then drop onto the top of kyles head he stirred his little fist shooting instinctively into the air as if preparing to defend himself cindy pressed him tighter to her breast hunkered down in the chair began rocking back and forth within minutes she was fast asleep dream cindy is walking down the empty corridor of forest hill collegiate where she attended high school trying to locate the principals office its over there ryan tells her appearing out of nowhere to pass her in the hall suddenly cindy is standing in front of the long reception desk in the middle of the main office im looking for julia carver cindy tells irena who is too busy ironing a pair of mens slacks to look up room irena says curtly cindy races down the hall past a drinking fountain that is shooting water blindly into the air then bursts through the door to room her eyes sweeping across the rows of curious student faces wheres julia she demands of the dwarflike man at the head of the class michael kinsolving lowers the script he is holding to his sides and walks menacingly toward her whos julia he asks cindy woke with a start causing the infant in her arms to stiffen and cry out its okay she reassured him softly coming fully awake grateful when the babys body drifted back into sleep she took a deep breath carefully adjusted kyles position and checked her watch eleven oclock shed been asleep almost two hours she checked the time again to make sure then pushed herself out of the rocking chair her legs wobbly her shoulders and arms stiff those pills of neils were really something slowly with meticulous care cindy deposited kyle on his back in the crib then crept from the room closing the door after her she proceeded down the hall to the master bedroom each step a deliberate exaggeration then cocked her ear against the closed door wondering if faith was still asleep after several seconds she pushed open the door and stepped inside the room was dark and stuffy an ether like pall filtering through the air like a miasmal mist cindy inched her way across the clothesstrewn broadloom toward the huge castiron bed that sat against the far wall faith lay on her back in the middle of the bed one arm tossed carelessly above her head one foot peeking out from underneath a pile of heavy blankets her uncombed hair matted against her forehead her mouth open a series of snores emanating from between parched lips cindy smoothed the damp hair away from faiths face then replaced her foot beneath the covers how many times had she done the same thing for julia how many times had she tucked in errant toes and smoothed away stray hairs dont do that julia would protest slapping at her mothers hand even in her sleep cindy was halfway down the stairs when she heard the steady sound of barking and realized it was coming from next door elvis shed forgotten all about him had he been barking the whole time shed been away i should run home and let him out cindy said to an imaginary panel of judges itll just take two minutes except it wouldnt you just didnt let elvis out you escorted him around the block and waited while he sniffed each blade of grass until he found just the right one on which to do his business and then you went through the whole ritual again and again and again there was no such thing as two minutes with elvis twenty minutes was closer to the truth and she couldnt leave kyle alone for twenty minutes even with his mother sleeping in the next room faith was practically comatose she couldnt just take off who knew what might happen how many times had she read articles about children dying in fires while their caregivers were out of the house only left him alone for two minutes okay so what do i do cindy asked the empty hall shouldnt have been so quick to get rid of me she heard her mother say please her sister added you think this is a problem you should spend a day at my house the baby started crying well that settles that cindy scribbled a note for faith telling her she was taking kyle for a walk then left it on the floor outside her bedroom door well change you later she told the baby carrying him down the stairs and grabbing the house key hanging from a nail near the front door she located the large englishstyle carriage hidden along the side of the house and laid kyle inside it the babys fierce screams bracketing elviss angry barks leaving the carriage in her driveway she bounded up the out sidesteps and unlocked her front door elvis shot out at her as if from a cannon almost knocking her over how did you get out of the kitchen cindy asked in amazement watching as elvis ran down the front steps and peed against the wheel of the carriage great oh thats great okay wait let me get your leash cindy opened the hall closet her hand whipping across the floor in search of the dogs leash where is it damn it where are you where had she put the silly thing okay stay there she directed the dog whose response was to bark loudly four times then run toward the sidewalk wheres the leash cindy yelled at the empty house racing into the kitchen checking the countertops trying not to look too closely at the floor she finally located the leash in one of the drawers she reserved for old birthday cards and unsolicited stationary that had been sent by various charities trying to pressure her into making a donation elvis cindy called out carrying the leash outside seeing the dog disappear around the corner come back here cindy pushed the carriage to the sidewalk then stopped dead her heartbeat freezing in her chest the baby was gone she knew it even before she looked down shed left him alone for no more than sixty seconds and in those sixty seconds some lunatic had jumped out from behind a nearby maple tree and absconded with her neighbors child already the abductor was in his car speeding toward parts unknown shed lost another child the sellicks would never see their baby again no cindy pleaded fearfully lowering her eyes to the carriage her knees buckling as she saw kyles huge blue eyes staring up at her his tongue poking out between his lips a cascading bouquet of tiny bubbles balanced on its tip he was there he was safe cindy crumpled to the sidewalk as if her legs were made of paper her hear tall but exploding in her chest youre going to give yourself a heart attack if you keep this up she whispered into the sweaty palm of her hand and suddenly elvis was at her side licking her face and poking his head toward his leash his tail pounding eagerly against the side of the carriage what are you doing off down here he seemed to be asking cindy attached the leash to the dogs collar then pulled herself to her feet kyle lay on his back kicking his legs into the air and gurgling happily thank you god cindy whispered pushing the pram toward poplar plains then continuing south toward edmund so much construction going on she thought absently noting the new fence going up around a sprawling tudorstyle home on the corner of clarendon and a concrete porch being erected in front of a modern town house just across the street large trucks were everywhere workers in hard hats and tight jeans toted heavy rocks and tall ladders nodding as she walked by how long had they been in the neighborhood long enough to notice julia nobody struts a street quite like julia ryan had remarked on edmund street cindy turned left her eyes flitting warily between the large duplexes on the north side of the street and the singlefamily homes and large apartment buildings on the south was julia somewhere inside one of these structures cindy had always considered the area around avenue road and st clair to be so safe was it hadnt julia stepped onto these very streetssoon after eleven oclock in the morning almost the same time as nowand disappeared without a trace cindy shivered feeling cold despite the unseasonable heat and picked up her pace all but colliding with a frizzyhaired woman juggling an empty stroller while trying to maintain a grip on her squirming toddlers hand thats right cindy urged the woman silently hold on tight its not as safe as you think its not safe anywhere elvis balked when they rounded the corner back onto balmoral obviously sensing his brief walk was about to end sorry boy cindy told him dragging him up the outside steps of her home and pushing him through the front door clearly there was no point in trying to lock him in the kitchen ill take you for a really long walk when ryan gets home i promise please dont pee on the floor the baby started crying almost the second they were back inside the sellick house cindy carried him into the kitchen and retrieved another bottle of faiths breast milk from the fridge then popped it into the microwave oven she fed the baby took him back upstairs retrieved the untouched note shed left for faith and changed kyles diaper careful this time to stand well out of the line of fire after swaddling him tightly in a soft blue cotton receiving blanket she laid him on his back in the crib and stood over him gently rubbing his tummy until he fell asleep her own stomach started rumbling and she realized shed forgotten to have breakfast how many times in the last several weeks had she forgotten to eat despite the constant prodding of her mother and sister her face was starting to look thinner more drawn her bra was feeling a little roomy women gain weight from the bottom up and lose it from the top down julia had once remarked and julia would know julia knew about such things cindy checked on faith to see if she was awake and interested in lunch but she was still fast asleep her bare toes once again protruding outside their covers cindy closed the door found herself staring down the narrow upstairs hallway toward the bedroom at the front of the house what was in that room she wondered why was the door closed what if julia is inside she suddenly thought marching down the hall and reaching for the doorknob knowing she was being ridiculous but unable to keep such thoughts out of her head what if the sellicks were a couple of deranged perverts whod kidnapped julia and were deriving sadistic satisfaction from having both mother and daughter under the same roof at the same time image julia bound and gagged struggling against her restraints unable to give voice to her desperate cries while her mother oblivious to her daughters presence changes diapers in the next room was it possible shed read that murderers often attended their victims funerals prolonging their sick pleasure by luxuriating in the familys suffering was it possible such monsters lived right next door the door fell open and cindy stepped over the threshold both relieved and disappointed by the thoroughly ordinary room that greeted her eyes its furnishings utilitarian and undistinguished obviously ryans home office cindy realized noting the cluttered desk the stacks of books the architectural drawings spread across the large drafting table in front of the window blackandwhite photographs of local buildings adorned the walls cindys eyes swooped into each corner of the room seeing no trace of her daughter anywhere had she really expected to find anything the phone rang poking her in the back like an accusing finger cindy gasped grabbed for the phone on the desk before it could ring a second time hello cindy its ryan the voice said evenly im so sorry but this is the first chance ive had to call you all morning hows it going everythings fine cindy noticed a closet in the far corner of the room what did they keep in there faith and the baby are both asleep thats good look were almost finished here shouldnt take too much longer and then well head home think you can hold out another couple of hours cindy checked her watch a few more hours and it would be almost two oclock her eyes returned to the closet door no problem i cant tell you how much i appreciate this ill see you soon cindy hung up the phone walked to the closet pulled open the door image julia her mouth covered by duct tape her hands bound behind her back her feet tied at the ankles sits naked and shivering in a corner of the closet the closet was filled with winter clothes each item freshly cleaned and hanging inside a long plastic bag cindy examined each article of clothing a mans heavy brown coat a womans purple fleece jacket mens wool suits in brown gray and navy a womans black dress a long teal skirt she rifled through the builtin shelf full of sweaters extricating a strongsmelling bar of soap from inside the layers of soft wool by the time she realized someone was watching her it was too late cindy spun around the bar of soap flying from her hand and landing at faith sellicks feet faith looked from cindy to the closet then back to cindy her eyes as cold as steel what the hell are you doing she asked twentyeight i didnt hear you what are you doing here wheres ryan faith shifted from one foot to the other her toes disappearing into the soft pile of the beige broadloom she was wearing a pair of red tartan flannel pajamas that were too big for her body and too warm for the weather although she didnt seem to notice either several hairs drooped lazily into her eyes and she made no effort to push them aside he had to go to hamilton you were sleeping he didnt want to wake you so he asked you to come over and babysit his incompetent wife no of course not he just wanted you to catch up on your sleep what time was this around eight apparently he had an important meeting theyre always important faith looked toward the window what time is it now cindy glanced at her watch almost noon so ive been unconscious all morning faith noted dully obviously you were exhausted kyle sleeping like a baby cindy said hoping to elicit a smile failing ive fed him twice taken him for a walk around the block youve been very busy cindy cleared her throat coughed into her hand are you hungry i could make us some lunch you can tell me what you were doing snooping around in my closet im really sorry about that cindy said stalling trying desperately to come up with a believable excuse its just that i was feeling a little cold and i thought you might have a sweater i could throw on faiths shoulders relaxed as she rushed to embrace the lie it is cold in this house i keep telling ryan that but he insists the temperaturesjust right if it were up to me id do away with airconditioning altogether she pointed to a long yellow sweater hanging from a thick wooden hanger toward the back of the closet try that one cindy slipped the luxurious cashmere sweater from its hanger thats better she said the warm wool lying like a sunburn across her back color looks good on you thank you you should keep it what it looks better on you than it does on me you might as well have it oh no i couldnt do that why not because its yours faith shrugged ryans in hamilton you said actually he just called said he should be home in a few hours is marcy with him marcy orange hair big boobs lots of teeth sounds like the woman who picked him up faith nodded knowingly marcy granger the senior partners daughter and ryans close associate she verbally underlined the word close im pretty sure theyre having an affair she bent down and scooped up the bar of soap you think soap really keeps moths away i dont know ive never tried it your husband used to cheat on you all the time right faith asked cindy tried not to look too shocked by the question had she heard faith correctly sorry i guess its none of my business who told you my husband cheated on me you did i did it was faiths turn to look flustered last week when i had tea over at your place cindy fought to remember the conversation over tea she vaguely recalled talk of children of faiths concerns for the future her calm recitation of family suicides her concern that ryan no longer loved her she remembered clarifying that the cookie was toms wife but she had no memory of having mentioned anything about toms assorted infidelities im hungry faith announced did you say something about lunch cindy took the soap from faiths hands returned it to the middle of the pile of sweaters and closed the closet door her mind racing if she hadnt said anything to faith about toms affairs who had julia questions began racing around cindys brain like a dog chasing its tail was it possible julia had told faith about toms indiscretions even though the two women barely knew one another or was it more likely that julia had confided the information to ryan during a romantic encounter had ryan then carelessly passed the juicy tidbit along to his wife i think theres some leftover tuna in the fridge faith was saying already halfway down the hall she stopped in front of the nursery door i guess i should check on kyle she said with obvious reluctance making no attempt to go inside why dont we just let him sleep cindy led faith down the stairs hoping for more time alone with her there was no telling what she might say relief washed across faiths face did he give you a hard time she asked making herself comfortable at the kitchen table while cindy rifled through her fridge looking for the tuna no he was great although he did almost pee in my eye i think he does that on purpose cindy was about to laugh when it occurred to her that faith was actually serious there was a strange flatness to her voice that belied any attempt at humor disconcerted cindy did a final survey of the contents of the fridge ultimately abandoning the search for tuna and emerging with a handful of eggs she hoped were reasonably fresh how about i make us an omelet with cheese do you have any i love cheese faith said as if this were answer enough one cheese omelete coming up cindy located a large chunk of old cheddar at the very back of the fridge as well as several loose sticks of butter and a container of milk that had never been opened and was one day short of its expiration date the salt and pepper were in plain sight on the counter but she had to search through several cupboards for a mediumsized bowl and a frypan i think thats everything she told faith who said nothing nor did she say anything as cindy cracked open the eggs mixed them with the milk and stirred them in the frypan only when cindy was adding the cheddar did faith show any interest in what she was doing i love cheese she said again they ate in silence faith cutting her omelet into neat little bits then slowly chewing and swallowing each piece cindy watched her as she ate wishing she could pick the young woman up by her heels and shake her as if she were a branch on one of the outside maple trees how many loose acorns would fall out cindy wondered thinking does she know something something shes not telling me something about julia is there anything new with the investigation faith asked suddenly as if reading cindys mind she laid her fork down pushed her plate into the middle of the table sat back in her chair her knife in her right hand no cindy said nothing new it must be horrible for you it is so many horrible things in this world faith lifted the knife toward her face checked her reflection in the narrow sliver of stainless steel i look like shit she said no you dont do you ever wish you could just crawl into bed and never wake up faith cindy began not sure what to say next im tired faith pushed her chair away from the table struggled to her feet i think i should lie down for a while without another word she turned and walked purposefully from the room it was only when cindy heard her opening the door to the nursery that she realized faith still had the knife joy fielding cindy raced up the stairs the omelet sitting heavy in her stomach like a large stone impeding the flow of oxygen to her lungs why hadnt she been paying closer attention what if she was already too late too late for what faith cindy ran down the hall faiths sweater slipping from her shoulders and sliding off her back faith wait a babys screams filled the air followed by the sound of faiths tortured cries together they shook the floor beneath cindys feet like a powerful earthquake no cindy threw herself into the nursery stopping dead in her tracks at the horrifying sight that greeted her eyes faith sellick was standing over her sons crib one hand pulling at her hair her face a twisted mask of grief and fury the other hand on her babys chest his tiny body convulsing with outrage faith no what have you done cindy pushed faith out of the way with such force that faith lost her footing and fell back against the rocking chair before collapsing to the floor cindy scooped the baby from the crib her eyes frantically searching his white sleeper for blood but there was no blood on the babys sleeper just as there was no blood on the sheets no blood anywhere cindy realized with audible relief seeing the knife lying innocently at the foot of the crib what happened in here she demanded over kyle continuing howls what did you do to him tell me i didnt do anything faith cried helplessly i was just looking at him and he opened his eyes and started screaming did you poke him with the knife what knife faith asked her confusion palpable you didnt touch him faith shook her head covering her ears with her hands trying to block out the babys cries he hates me she whimpered he hates the sight of me he doesnt hate you cindy returned the screaming baby to his crib lowered herself to the floor beside faith listen to him babies cry faith its what they do i cant stand it when he cries i know cindy took faith in her arms rocked her back and forth as earlier she had rocked the womans infant son i know sometimes when he cries it feels like my head is going to explode i know cindy said again what else could she say it was the truth she did know there was nothing worse nothing more heartbreaking than the sound of your childs unhappiness you need to see a doctor she told faith gently ill talk to my friends find out the name of a good psychiatrist you think im crazy no i just think you need more help than i can give you faith shook her head you think im crazy she said ryan walked in the house at just after four oclock his arms full of bloodorange roses for you he told cindy laying them across her arms along with my heartfelt apologies for being so late your meeting went on longer than you thought cindy stated rather than asked this was familiar territory after all tom had long ago given her a tour of its terrain im really so sorry when i phoned you i honestly thought we had everything all worked out cindy did her best at a sympathetic smile we resolved everything eventually he said as if seeking to reassure her you got the commission just in time for the start of rush hour traffic it was brutal you must be exhausted im more than a little drained to tell you the truth i could use a drink how about you cindy thought she already detected a faint odor of booze on ryans breath i really should be getting home get these flowers in water one little drink to celebrate my success ryan disappeared into the dining room returned minutes later with a bottle of red wine and two glasses red okay with you fine he uncorked the bottle as cindy lowered the roses to the coffee table to you he said clicking his glass against hers with my undying gratitude to julias safe return cindy lifted the glass to her mouth took a long sip the taste of blackberries lingering on her tongue ryan winced how are you holding up just barely i wish there was something i could do me too honestly cindy i told the police everything i know ryan took another sip of his wine glanced toward the ceiling its so quiet everyones asleep amazing you obviously have the magic touch your wife thinks youre having an affair cindy said matter offactly what your wife my wifes imagination is working overtime these days ryan said testily cutting cindy off before she could say it again women are usually right about this sort of thing cindy watched the color drain from ryans face as effortlessly as he drained the wine from his glass my wife is depressed that doesnt mean shes delusional you know as well as i do how strange shes been acting lately cindy had to admit he was right what does her doctor say ryan shook his head ive been meaning to call him its just that ive been so damn busy your wife needs help ryan agreed ryan said briskly finishing the wine in his glass looking sorry hed ever suggested she stay for a drink ill call him first thing in the morning as if on cue the telephone rang cindy carried her glass to the kitchen and left it in the sink wondering how long it would be before someone got around to washing it i should get going she said waving goodbye as ryan picked up the phone dont forget your flowers he whispered hand over the mouthpiece oh right cindy returned to the living room scooped the two dozen roses off the coffee table pricking her finger on an unseen thorn she brought her injured finger to her mouth sucked at the blood thought it sweeter than the wine just a minute she heard ryan say then walking toward her extending the portable phone in his hand its for you for me cindy suddenly remembered shed left the sellicks phone number with the police in case they needed to reach her had something happened had her earlier premonition been correct had they found julia cindy lifted the phone to her ear as ryan moved a discreet distance away hello mrs carver its detective bartolli has something happened are you all right yes of course have you found julia no a pause then is ryan sellick in the room with you cindy felt her pulse quicken she stole a glance at ryan who was standing at the window pretending to be engrossed in the late afternoon sky yes okay i want you to listen to me and not do anything stupid do you understand yes but no buts i want you to make whatever excuses are necessary and get out of that house as quickly as possible were on our way what are you talking about just do what i tell you i dont understand we did a check on those crank calls youve been receiving several of them came from the sellick house what you heard me what does it mean we dont know what it means but we intend to find out now get the hell out of that house and let us handle it cindy clicked off the phone as ryan turned around problems he asked i have to go was that the police dont say anything cindy cautioned herself dont do anything stupid just listen to detective bartolli and get the hell out let the police handle things cindy cindy dropped the roses to the floor what have you done with my daughter she demanded hurling the portable phone at ryans head what have you done with julia twentynine the phone whizzed by ryans head like a bullet missing the side of his skull by mere centimeters and slamming into the piano taking a crescent shaped nick out of its ebony side it crashed to the floor then lay on its back its underside exposed and vulnerable like a dead turtle cindy jesuswhat the hell are you doing ryan swayed from one foot to the other as if not sure whether to bolt for the door or wrestle her to the ground cindy made the decision for him throwing herself at his chest and grabbing hold of his dark blue tie weaving it between her fingers and pulling it up and out like a noose where is she what have you done with her ryan tried wriggling out of her grasp but cindys grip on his tie was unyielding his complexion went from soft pink to angry red as his right hand reached for his throat and his left tried in vain to ward off the blows of her open palm a sudden jolt of pain shot through cindys arm like an electric shock as ryan succeeded in grabbing her wrist and twisting it back cindy responded with a sharp kick to his shin cindy what the hell wheres julia where is she i dont know cindy hauled back and slapped ryan hard across the face shit he yelled his cheek whitening with the imprint of her hand the slap seemed to knock him into action for suddenly he was all masculine strength and rage his arms extending and corralling and subduing in seconds he overpowered cindys intemperate flailings reducing them to an ineffectual montage of arms and legs hands and feet fingers and toes cindy cried out as she felt the point of his shoe crack against the back of her knees then watched helplessly as her body was propelled into the air before fallingass over teakettle as her mother might sayto the floor her elbow smacked against the top of the piano stool and she swore the word fuck flying from her mouth in a sudden rush of air as ryan fell on top of her pinning her arms to the floor above her head roses scattered in all directions as cindy tried to sit up to push him away to roll out from under him but she couldnt move shit fuck she sputtered sounding increasingly weak her words having lost their power to shield and protect after several more minutes of aimless show boating she gave up stopped struggling lay still okay now ryan began his voice that of the conqueror despite his shortness of breath cindy stared up at the man lying on top of her gravity pulling on his handsome face distorting his delicate features like a silk sweater thats been left too long on a hanger ryan was bruised and sweaty and his dark hair fell across his forehead like loosely shredded bits of carbon paper anger intensified the black of his eyes confusion softened it but something else was present in those eyes cindy recognized mingled with the anger and confusion was an unmistakable glint of excitement ryan sellick was enjoying himself tell me what the hell is going on he said in response cindy expelled a wad of saliva from her mouth aiming it directly at ryans face unfortunately the gesture proved more symbolic than successful with only a tiny fraction of the spittle reaching its intended target and the rest raining back across her lips are you crazy ryan was shouting now have you completely lost your mind let go of me ryan tightened his grip on her wrists not until you promise to calm down youre only making things worse for yourself what are you talking about the police will be here any minute ryan suddenly let go of her arms sank back on his hips the police they know all about your affair with julia cindy improvised ryan fell away from her then leaning back against the stubby front leg of the piano the color draining from his face in uneven bursts leaving jagged splotches of red on his cheeks like too much makeup haphazardly applied thats ridiculous he said but his words lacked the moral outrage necessary to sustain them and they burst upon contact with the air like soap bubbles cindy scooted along the floor on her rear end until she felt the sofa at her back she was too tired to stand up too spent to launch another attack just tell me where julia is she said softly when what she really wanted to say was just tell me julias alive i dont know where she is the police think you do the police are wrong just like theyre wrong about the crank calls ive been getting what crank calls the ones telling me my daughter is a tramp that she got what she deserved i dont understand the calls coming from this house what are the police wrong about that too ryan a shadow fell across ryans face like in the movies cindy thought when the screen slowly fades to black his eyes registered disbelief acceptance and alarm almost simultaneously and he shook his head muttering no its impossible it cant be what cant be cindy asked distracted by the sound of footsteps on the stairs she turned saw faith standing in the doorway she was wearing the same red tartan pajamas shed been wearing all day and the smell of sour milk emanated from her body like an unpleasant perfume whats going on in here faith asked her eyes flitting between cindy and her husband cindy remained on the floor as ryan struggled to his feet limped toward his wife what happened to your face faith touched her husbands cheek whats going on she asked again her voice flat and faraway as if she were talking in her sleep faith ryan began then stopped smoothed the hair away from his wifes forehead with a solicitous hand the police are on their way over cindy informed her the police why they think we know something about julia her husband explained but you already talked to them apparently some calls were made from this house what are you talking about the police have a tap on my phone cindy said her voice cold her sympathy spent apparently its not unusual in cases like this for the victims family to receive crank calls she continued bracing herself for faiths heated denials instead she heard you think julias the victim here what asked cindy rising quickly to her feet what echoed ryan his hands dropping to his sides trust me faith continued tugging at the bottom of her pajama top pulling it up and away from her leaking breasts julias no sweet innocent little victim faith ryan began warily i dont think you should say anything else yes youd like that wouldnt you youd like me to be the good little girl the quiet little mouse the perfect little wifey who stays home and cooks and cleans and looks after your demon seed all the while smiling and looking happy never saying a word about the fact that her husband is busy screwing everything that moves faith please what you think i dont know you think i dont know about brooke about ellen about marcy she paused briefly about julia what about julia cindy asked quietly almost reluctant to interrupt to interfere with the violent flow of words faith abruptly shifted her focus from ryan to cindy well i hate to be the bearer of bad tidings knowing how special you think your precious julia is but your little girl was just one of the crowd wasnt she ryan pick a numberthe line forms to the right faith her husband warned enough enough are you kidding whats ever been enough for you look youre upset youre exhausted you dont know what youre saying im saying youre a lying cheating piece of shit who sleeps with his clients wives his partners daughter and his neighbors pride and joy except theres not a whole lot to be proud of is there cindy trust me on this julias no innocent little victim she wasnt lured into the backseat of a strangers car by a piece of candy she was sleeping with a married man and in my book she deserves whatever happened to her faith cindy urged trying desperately to maintain control if you know where julia is have you checked the yellow pages under whores ryans hand suddenly sliced through the air came down hard across his wifes cheek shut up faith just shut up faith staggered back grabbed the side of her face i will not shut up she screamed i am not a silent partner in this relationship and i will not be quiet any longer if you have any idea any idea at all what happened to julia cindy pleaded faith squinted at cindy as if she were staring directly into the sun you think i had something to do with your daughters disappearance did you faith emitted a low guttural sound halfway between a scoff and a snarl then sank to the living room sofa above their heads a baby began to cry well what do you know another quarter heard from what took you so long she hollered at the ceiling did you have anything to do with julias disappearance cindy pressed aware that ryan was staring at his wife with equal intensity faith caught the question in her husbands eyes and made another sound this one more moan than defiance you think i actually did something to your golden girl she asked ignoring cindy directing the question at ryan tell me when was i supposed to have done this in between breastfeeding and changing diapers between putting your son down to sleep and trying to get some sleep myself how about between blowjobs faith for gods sake i didnt touch your precious julia faith told cindy i have absolutely no idea where she is or what happened to her she lowered her head into her hands spoke through slightly parted fingers yes i made those calls dont ask me why youve always been so nice to me my friend my only friend she lifted her legs off the floor and curled into a fetal position on the couch her arms wrapping around her head as if seeking to protect herself from further blows oh god would somebody please get that damn baby to stop screaming how long were you involved with my daughter cindy asked ryan her voice low her eyes locked on his wife cindy please dont insult me by continuing to deny it she turned slowly in his direction ryan nodded two months maybe a bit more why did you lie what else was i supposed to do tell me cindy what was i supposed to do you were supposed to tell the truth and what good would that have done what good does knowing about my relationship with julia do anyone is it going to help find her i dont know is it honestly cindy if i thought for one minute that telling the police about my affair with julia would have helped find her i would have done it i was just trying to protect her protect her the only person youve been trying to protect in this whole mess is yourself i dont know where julia is ryan said again yes i lied about my involvement with her and yes im a nogood piece of shit who cheats on his wife but do you have any idea what its like being married to someone whos constantly depressed who acts as if shes the only woman in the world who ever gave birth who looks at her own son as if hes some infectious disease so yes i tend to respond favorably when a beautiful woman looks at me with adoration instead of contempt but that only means im human it doesnt mean i had anything to do with julias disappearance please cindy you have to believe me i would never hurt julia do you love my daughter cindy asked hearing the police car pull into the driveway the sound of car doors slamming ryan looked away said nothing of all times not to lie cindy thought you really are a jerk she told him listening as heavy footsteps bounded up the outside steps and impatient hands pounded on the front door it was almost nine oclock that night when the police finally phoned cindy to say theyd concluded their questioning of the sellicks first at their home then at the police station and ultimately decided to release them what do you mean you released them we have nothing to hold them on detective gill explained what do you mean you have nothing how many times did she start sentences these days with the phrase what do you mean ryan sellick admitted he lied about his affair with julia his wife admitted calling my house yes and we questioned them for more than four hours thats all they admitted four hours my daughters been missing for two weeks mrs carver detective gill interrupted gently of course we will continue to investigate all angles here but ryan sellicks alibi checks out and its highly unlikely that faith sellick could have been involved in julias disappearance think of it logically it means she would have had to follow julia to her audition wait for her ambush her she wouldnt have had to ambush her cindy protested knowing she was grasping at straws all shed have to do was pretend to be in the area shopping and then casually offer julia a lift and the baby maybe she left him at home maybe he was in the backseat maybe she used him to lure julia into the car like offering a child a piece of candy cindy thought recalling faiths own words there was a seconds silence cindy could almost feel detective gill shrug are you going to get a search warrant that wont be necessary what do you mean it wont be necessary why not the sellicks have already given us their permission to search their cars and premises they have what does that mean it means were unlikely to find anything and thats what you think why was she asking him that it was obviously what he thought i think we have to wait and see if forensics can come up with any real evidence linking the sellicks to your daughter and if they cant cant you arrest them anyway we need evidence to arrest people mrs carver detective gill reminded her patiently we could charge mrs sellick with making those crank calls but im not sure theres any point to that given her delicate emotional state cindy took a deep breath swallowed the scream that was building in her throat elvis lying on the kitchen floor rolled to his feet and ambled over to where she was sitting then laid his chin in her lap cindy found herself smiling in spite of her distress and patted the top of his head appreciatively what about sean banack his alibis have pretty much checked out pretty much it seems unlikely he was involved in julias disappearance what about michael kinsolving duncan rossi any of julias friends so far nothing so youre no farther ahead than you were two weeks ago in fact if anything youre farther behind hadnt she read somewhere that the longer a case dragged on the colder its trail became what exactly are you people doing to find my daughter detective our job mrs carver the detective said simply and youre not making things any easier for us by barging into peoples homes and interfering with our investigation i didnt barge into the sellicks house i was asked to come over you know what i mean so im just supposed to sit back and do nothing thats exactly what youre supposed to do i dont think i can do that you have no choice here mrs carver cindy clenched her fists in her lap swallowed another scream elvis immediately poked his wet nose into the palm of her hand demanding to be stroked cindy absently obliged replaying detective gills words in her mind you have no choice here and wondering how many major events in her life had been decided without her approval there was no such thing as choice she was thinking it was an illusion a comforting yet basically specious concept that human beings had developed in order to fool themselves into believing they had some control over their lives controlanother illusion mrs carver detective gill was saying did you understand what i just said i understand detective gill im not an idiot then please stop acting like one he said a sudden sharpness l s tcutting through his soft jamaican lilt you could end up sabotaging this whole investigation he continued softening or worse you could get hurt and what good would that do anyone youre right cindy looked around the kitchen thinking that if she didnt get off this phone get out of this house she would go insane im sorry detective it wont happen again well keep in touch thank you cindy hung up the phone and jumped to her feet elvis leaping to attention beside her we have to get out of here cindy told the dog who promptly dragged his leash to the front door understanding her intent if not her words seconds later the two were running down the street toward avenue road they ran down the steep slope between edmund and cottingham even after nineoclock at night avenue road was still busy three lanes of traffic moved steadily in each direction and pedestrians ambled along both sides of the streetjoggers people walking their dogs couples out for an evening stroll such a nice night after all still warm summer hanging on more stubborn than usual a few more months and this hill would be as treacherous as a mountain of ice cindy remembered winters when this stretch of road became almost unnavigable when cars on the ascent stalled and faltered their wheels spinning aimlessly before succumbing to the pull of gravity and sliding back down the hill colliding with other automobiles powerless to get out of the way causing traffic tieups all the way to queens park cindy passed an elderly couple strolling hand in hand the wife using the handrail that ran along the side of the street to help her manage the incline then scooted past a jogger in bright orange shorts and the latest in running shoes what was she doing she asked herself she wasnt a jogger let alone a longdistance runner yet here she was running much too fast down a steep hill wearing jeans that were way too tight and sandals that offered no support at all a rambunctious and unpredictable terrier at her feet shed be stiff as a board in the morning she thought and laughed out loud the sound scraping at the darkness like a pick through ice oh well at least that would keep her from barging into peoples homes and offices from interfering with the police investigation hah she thought and laughed again at the bottom of the hill she turned right running along cottingham glancing at the semidetached brownstones that lined both sides of the wide street wondering what mayhem was being unleashed behind thin venetian blind sand antique lace curtains she slowed her pace as she drew near two young women who were talking beside a low white picket fence both were blond neither was julia whats your favorite film so far one was asking the other its between the magdelene sisters and lhomme du train they were awesome am i wrong but is the quality of films better this year cindy resumed her former pace passing the two young women then turning left then left again and running briskly down rathnelly a quirky little avenue whose even quirkier inhabitants had once declared their street a republic she turned left again elvis beside her somehow knowing not to stop to keep running to keep turning left then right then left again then right watching one familiar street blur into another cindy kept on going hoping to disappear to lose herself in the welcoming darkness she ran beside the railway tracks along dupont past the tiny tarragon theater on bridgeman where shed once had a subscription past majestic old casaloma where meg had held her wedding reception then across the bridge at spadina back up to st clair and finally back down poplar plains to balmoral she reached the corner in time to see ryan and faith sellick pulling into their driveway climbing out of their car and carrying their infant son up the front steps before disappearing inside their home home she thought coming to an abrupt halt all her running and where had it gotten her back where she started she couldnt get lost if she tried at just after two oclock in the morning cindys phone rang is this cindy carver a voice asked jolting her awake who is this its officer medavoy from fiftythird division we have your daughter mrs carver the officer began he was still speaking as cindy threw down the phone and raced for the door thirty the fiftythird division of the metropolitan police department is a vinecovered redbrick building with a dramatic glass atrium over its entranceway located on the southwest corner of eglinton and duplex across from the eglinton subway station cindy pulled her car into the narrow lot at the rear of the building parking it between two blackandwhite police cars and running along duplex to the front of the threestory structure her legs were cramping as she reached the glass double doors and she stopped to rub behind one knee taking several deep breaths in an effort to calm herself down theyd found julia she was alive im cindy carver she announced as she burst through the front door and threw herself at the long counter that cut across the middle of the large highceilinged room wheres my daughter a darkhaired woman with a wide forehead and a long pinched nose was sitting at one of four desks behind the counter she immediately jumped to her feet glancing anxiously over one shoulder before returning wary eyes to cindy im sorry she began absently smoothing the creases of her police uniform my daughter julia carver someone called me officer medavak medavoy the policewoman corrected where is he ill see if i can find him cindy nodded her eyes quickly scanning the bulletin board to her left crowded with pictures of missing children as the policewoman shuffled slowly toward a door at the back of the room cindy had to bite down on her tongue to keep from yelling move the officer suddenly stopped turned back to cindy im sorry your name again cindy carver whats the matter with her cindy thought doesnt she know who i am doesnt she read the papers hasnt she seen julias photograph plastered across the front pages for weeks now although thered been no pictures of her for several days not since the police arrested sally hansons boyfriend for her murder and eliminated the likelihood of a serial killer on the loose was it possible julia had already been forgotten that tom had been right out of sight out of mind tom she thought saying his name out loud was he here had anyone thought to phone him certainly she hadnt she realized guiltily although she hadnt been thinking too clearly when the police officer called it had been all she could do to remember to put on some clothes before tearing out the door she looked down at her black vneck sweatshirt hoped it was clean that she didnt smell she couldnt remember the last time shed done any laundry not since her sister left she thought thinking she should call leigh tell her the good news and her mother she should phone her and tom somebody should phone tom she reached for the cell phone in her purse felt her fist close around it then released it brought her hand back to her side she wanted some time alone with julia first time before tom arrived it was horribly selfish of her cindy knew but she also knew that once tom swept onto the scene she might as well disappear there was no question where julias first allegiance lay cindy wanted needed at least a few minutes alone with her daughter before tom effortlessly assumed control she needed those precious minutes alone with julia to touch her hold her tell her how much she loved her time to stake her claim unless it was already too late unless tom was already here unless theyd called him first of course theyd called him first and hed arrived before her a fiveminute drive for heavens sake especially at two in the morning with only a few cars on the road and it had taken her almost three times that long to get here imagine taking the wrong turn heading west on chaplin when she knew to go east getting stuck behind some joker doing five miles an hour where was the idiot going anyway why wasnt he home in bed what was he doing out at two in the morning this middleaged man with thinning hair and watery eyes who scowled when she passed him on the inside lane and then forgetting what side street was quickest getting lost now now when her daughter had finally been found tom had undoubtedly proceeded with appropriate calm had announced himself with the proper politeness to the officer behind the desk who of course had been totally charmed and whod immediately ushered him into the back room without unnecessary prompting hed probably asked for a few minutes alone with his daughter and thats what was taking so long now or maybe hed already taken julia home with him and that was why it was taking forever to find officer madavak or medicare or whatever his name was why wasnt he here and where were detectives bartolli and gill why hadnt they been the ones to phone her with the good news unless the news wasnt good cindy realized her stomach suddenly doing flipflops her already sore knees buckling unless there was something they werent telling her the front door opened and cindy spun toward the sound a uniformed policemansurprisingly short beefy standardissue bull neck crossed the room smiled and said hello officer medavoy cindy asked hopefully no sorry are you looking for him im cindy carver officer medavoy called my house to say you have my daughter had he cindy wondered or had it been just another crank call why hadnt she thought of that possibility before maybe there was no officer medavoy let me see if i can find him for you the policeman was saying his voice cheerily noncommittal his demeanor friendly and nonjudgmental as if she looked like a normal human being and not like some escapee from the clarke institute as if her skin wasnt ghostly white and her eyes werent swollen with worry and fatigue as if her hair wasnt sticking out in a variety of weird angles as if she didnt smell fetid and stale her breath heavy with sleep as if talking to halfcrazed mothers at two oclock in the morning was something he did every day and maybe he did cindy thought understanding there was a whole other world that operated between the hours of midnight and am an inverse world where people lived and worked and carried on relatively normal lives except what was normal cindy wondered watching the officer disappear into the stations inner sanctum almost immediately the policewoman reentered the main room from another door officer medavoy will be with you in a moment she told cindy before returning to her desk and pretending to busy herself with paperwork can i go in can i see my daughter it was taking all of cindys selfcontrol to keep from leaping over the counter officer medavoy would like to talk to you first why is something wrong is my daughter all right shes been throwing up throwing up theyre getting her cleaned up now i can do that pleasejust let me see her im sorry youll have to wait for officer medavoy the policewoman cautioned as the other officer reappeared officer medavoy will be right with you he said stooping to search for something behind the counter cindy watched in growing amazement as the two officers went about their business whats the matter with everybody she wondered again why are they so calm so blase so indifferent why wont they let me see my baby something isnt right here she decided why such a lack of concern especially if julia was sick and throwing up didnt they realize who she was where were detectives bartolli and gill why werent they here are detectives bartolli and gill here cindy asked louder than shed intended the two officers exchanged glances although neither head turned i dont believe so the woman officer responded no why not why hasnt anybody called them whats going on here both officers approached cautiously mrs carver are you all right no of course im not all right i want to see my daughter you have to calm down calm down you expect me to calm down whats the matter with you people had she dreamed the phone call after all was this whole episode nothing but a cruel hoax another door opened at the back of the room and a tall heavyset man stepped inside he was about forty with brown hair a square jaw and a nose that had been broken several times mrs carver wheres my daughter im officer medavoy the man answered coming around the counter extending his hand cindy shook his hand because it was obviously expected what she really wanted to do was swat it aside and push the imposing figure out of her way why all the formalities why couldnt they just take her to julia why the need to talk to her first what grim reality were they preparing her for please officer medavoy i need to see my daughter he nodded you understand shes not in the best of shape no i dont understand i dont understand anything where did you find her when did you find her we picked her up about an hour ago in an underground parking garage off queen street an underground parking garage shed been in a fight with some other girls they smacked her around a bit a fight apparently over some guy i dont understand well she was pretty drunk drunk shes been throwing up for the last ten minutes officer medavoy said matteroffactly leading cindy around the counter toward one of the back rooms maybe you should go easy on her at least until morning he opened the door julia cindy cried rushing toward the young girl who sat battered and wan on a gray plastic chair in front of a dull brown desk tearsoaked blue eyes stared back at cindy sorry mom heather replied her voice breaking as she wiped a thin line of spittle away from her bruised chin its only me sorry she said again heather my godheather cindy didnt know whether to laugh or cry so she did both heather not julia she hadnt even considered the possibility it might be heather oh my poor baby she said falling to her knees in front of her younger child what happened what did they do to you her fingers fluttered nervously in front of heathers trembling chin heather turned her head away revealing a large scratch on her left cheek its nothing im okay the police said you were in a fight with some girls it was so stupid i was at this club there were these girlsi thought we were getting along great they offered me a lift home we got to the garage and next thing i knew they were all over me saying i was flirting with one of their boyfriends it was so ridiculous he wasnt even cute did you arrest the girls cindy asked the officer they took off before we arrived your daughter claims she cant identify anyone heather it was dark its no big deal of course its a big deal look at you im okay mom its not important please can we just go home cindy looked to officer medavoy for help but he only shrugged maybe you should take her home let her sleep on it her memory might improve after a good nights sleep cindy put her arms around her daughter helped her to her feet are you okay to walk im fine heather insisted clinging to cindys side as mother and daughter staggered out into the night they drove home in silence several times cindy turned toward her younger child and tried to speak but the words froze on her tongue like pieces of dry ice flashback heather at eight months her cherubic little face aglow as she sits on her bedroom carpet watching her big sister dance around the room heather at thirteen months a proud smile filling her cheeks as she sits on the potty happily chanting pee pee pee pee heather three years old listening intently as cindy reads her a bedtime story the second and fourth fingers of her right hand stuffed inside her mouth her index finger rubbing a disintegrating pink blanket against the tip of her upturned nose heather at six dressed as an angel for halloween heather age twelve tears filling her eyes as she watches her mother watch julia drive away in her fathers carcan i get you anything cindy asked as they walked through the front door elvis jumping all over them some hot chocolate tea its three oclock in the morning heather reminded her mother as she bent down to let elvis lick the scratches on her cheek maybe you shouldnt let him do that cindy cautioned heather straightened her back headed for the stairs stopped is leigh still sleeping in my room she went home for a few days cindy told her grandma too heather looked relieved then i think ill take a bath if thats all right do you want me to get it started i can do it heather was already half out of her clothes by the time she reached the top of the stairs why dont you use my tub cindy offered normally heather jumped at the chance to use cindys bathtub with its extra leg room and highpowered jacuzzi tonight she just said okay maybe tomorrow you should see the doctor cindy said over the sound of running water make sure nothings broken nothings broken mom cindy watched her daughter shed the last of her clothing then climb into the stillfilling tub dont make it too hot i wont you want some privacy heather shook her head you can stay cindy lowered the lid on the toilet seat sat down gazed at her daughters wondrously slim body through her reflection in the mirror a million questions freefloating around in her brain what were you doing at that club alone what were you drinking how much were you drinking why were you drinking instead she asked still feeling sick no im okay now youre sure i dont usually get drunk you know i know i dont usually drink at all thats good are you going to tell dad i dont know have you seen him since heathers voice evaporated along with the steam rising from the tub no heather turned off the taps then pressed the button on the side of the tub to start the jacuzzi instantly water began flooding into the tub from several strategically placed openings what about your blind date have you seen him again cindy pictured neils handsome face tried not to picture it between her legs he was here last night yeah does that upset you why would it upset me because i know that children of divorce are always kind of hoping their parents will get back together one day i s tim not a child mom i know that i just want you to be happy heather said isnt that supposed to be my line you can use it too cindy smiled have you heard from duncan we had a long talk you were right were too young to be so settled we should be out sleeping around like you said dear god cindy thought of all times to start listening to me how about sleeping with me tonight it was heathers turn to smile about you and neil what about him just that i have a good feeling about the two of you heather closed her eyes didnt open them again until the automatic timer turned the jacuzzi off elvis was already asleep on cindys bed when cindy guided heather between the covers grudgingly the dog moved over to accommodate them eyeing them warily as if remembering the acrobatics of the other night cindy threw her arm across her daughters hip and hugged her close heathers round little bottom snug against the inverse curve of her mother they lay together in silence for several minutes like spoons in a drawer one breathing out as the other breathed in two parts of the same whole my baby cindy thought my beautiful beautiful little girl i love you she whispered and suddenly heather was sitting up and sobbing in her arms her slender body convulsing in unexpected anguish oh mom im so sorry please forgive me im so sorry what are you talking about sweetheart theres nothing to forgive ive been such a brat no you havent i wasnt thinking clearly when i gave the police your phone number i didntrealize youd assume it was julia they had in custody of course youd assume it was julia what else would you think and that awful look on your face when you saw it was only me how disappointed you were no sweetheart no you just caught me offguard i said such awful things to her that day mom i told her i never wanted to talk to her again that the sight of her made me sick cindy thought of her recent altercation with leigh we all say things in anger that we regret julia knows you didnt really mean them does she i told her i was sorry shed ever come home that i wanted her to get out and never come back mom heather wailed i told her i wished she was dead cindy slowly pushed heather away from her side held her at arms length stared deep into her eyes heather listen to me this is very important no matter what happens no matter where julia is or whats keeping her from us it has nothing to do with you do you understand you do not have that kind of power you are not to blame do you hear me you are not to blame once again cindy folded her daughter into her arms rocking her gently until eventually heather drifted into a restless sleep through a steady stream of tears cindy watched the minutes tick away on the digital clock radio on the nightstand beside the bed occasionally heather muttered something in her sleep and cindy strained to make out the words im not to blame she was saying im not to blame thirtyone at exactly seven oclock the next morning cindy got out of bed sliding up and out from between her daughter and the dog and tiptoeing into the bathroom where she showered brushed her teeth and hair put on a little makeup then headed for the closet where she dressed in a pair of coffee colored chinos and a crisp white blouse it had been a long time since she looked crisp she knew and it was important that she start keeping up appearances for heathers sake as well as her own she decided she had two daughters after all not just one heather was still sound asleep when cindy returned to the bedroom elvis had shifted his position and was now curled up on cindys pillow he lifted his head as cindy approached as if to question what she was doing up after so few hours sleep then lowered it again as she walked out of the room cindy also questioned what she was doing up so early but the truth was that shed never really fallen asleep and she was getting stiff just lying there in bed it was better to be up and moving to try behaving like a functioning adult to make a pretense at normalcy when heather woke up she would find her mother dressed and presentable fixing her pancakes and eager to hear her plans for the upcoming weekend but for now she would let her daughter sleep cindy walked down the stairs and into the kitchen prepared a pot of coffee then sank down at the kitchen table and stared out the sliding glass door outside was another perfect day leaning back in her chair cindy studied the earlymorning sky a large pink cloud backlit with just a hint of yellow hung heavy over the sellicks backyard its lilac underbelly exposed and friendly like a puppy sleeping on its back several wisps had broken free and were drifting to her right the drifts were purple and in the shape of a womans mouth imprinted on the air like a blot of lipstick on a tissue cindy watched the stray fragments gradually fade then get lost in the deepening blue of day everything disappears she was thinking clouds people entire civilizations human beings were as fragile as fleeting as cool wisps of air she stretched her legs out in front of her hearing her joints groan like hinges needing to be oiled yesterdays impromptu run had been a foolish venture especially since she hadnt worked out in weeks this is how the body slips into middle age she thought patting the slight rounding of her belly as she pushed off her chair feeling her thigh muscles cramp as she headed for the front door she needed to start exercising again she decided thinking shed ask leigh to join her at the gym one afternoon the globe and the star lay at her feet when she opened the door and cindy scanned the headlines noting that the unflattering picture of the prime minister was the same on both front pages well what do you know she asked him bending down to scoop up the papers its friday the thirteenth cradling both papers in her arms she backed into the house about to close the door when she heard another door opening beside her cindy froze as faith sellick emerged from her house and hurried down her front steps clutching kyle tightly to her chest and disappearing around the side of the house like cindy faith was neatly dressed for the first time in weeks the slovenly tartan pajamas replaced by a calflength blue cotton dress her hair pulled into a neat pony tail that pointed like an arrow down the center of her back seconds later faith reentered her line of vision pushing kyles carriage toward the street the baby crying loudly inside it where would they be headed this early in the morning cindy wondered straining to see where faith was going then abruptly pulling her head back inside her door like a startled turtle returning to its shell when faith suddenly spun around as if aware of cindys watchful eye cindy waited half a second then peeked back outside her eyes following faiths swift departure ryans car was still in the driveway and cindy wondered if he knew where his wife was going if he was even aware she was gone she thought of phoning him alerting him to his wifes absence then thought better of it knowing she was the last person in the world he would appreciate hearing from under the circumstances whatever had possessed julia to get involved with a married man she could have her pick of any man she wanted why choose this one cindy knew the answer even before shed finished asking herself the question julia had been attracted to ryan sellick because he was a younger version of the man she loved best in the world deliberately or subconsciously julia had picked a man just like dear old dad and so it goes cindy muttered watching faith push the carriage into the middle of the road from between two parked cars where is she going in such a hurry cindy asked herself dropping the newspapers to the floor and stepping onto her front landing watching faith turn left onto avenue road heading north almost without thinking cindy grabbed her purse from the hall closet and chased after her careful to stay in the shadows to keep a comfortable distance between them faith was moving quickly and cindys legs were stiff and hurting from last nights illconceived marathon they rebelled each time cindy tried to widen her stride pick up her pace she almost lost faith at the corner of avenue road and st clair when faith caught the traffic light and she didnt but she spotted her again several blocks later in front of granite place two large apartment complexes that sat well back from the main street faith stopped at the corner of st clair and yonge despite the green light that indicated she had the right of way once more she spun around as if suspicious she was being followed and cindy had to duck into the doorway of blacks onehour photo to keep from being spotted her breath was labored and audible a thin trickle of perspiration ran down the open v of her blouse and she flicked it away with her finger before it could reach inside her bra seventhirty in the morning and already the outside temperature was creeping toward eighty degrees already she was hot and sweaty the humidity twisting her hair into tight little curls that crept around her head like vines so much for keeping up appearances she thought hearing wary footsteps approach cindy took a deep breath braced herself for yet another unpleasant confrontation with her neighbor but the woman who hurried by cast only a furtive glance in her direction careful to keep a wide berth between them as if afraid cindy was one of those crazy ladies who wandered the streets asking for money and talking to themselves and maybe shes right cindy thought maybe i am crazy how else to explain what she was doing trailing after her neighbor like some middleaged nancy drew only a day after the police had ordered her to back off what was the matter with her why couldnt she just mind her own business so much for acting like a functioning adult go home cindy told herself go home now but even as she was saying the words she was running across the already busy intersection at yonge and st clair trying to locate faith where is she cindy muttered underneath her breath her eyes shooting back and forth across the four corners seeing no trace of her neighbor maybe she went into mcdonalds cindy thought glancing toward the tiny takeout restaurant that was squeezed between the bank of nova scotia and the st clair subway station it was then cindy saw the baby carriage it was standing outside the subways glass doors blocking the entranceway until a man in a hurry shoved it rudely to one side kyle cindy called rushing toward the carriage but the carriage was empty the baby was gone why would faith abandon an expensive carriage in the middle of the street had she spotted cindy decided it was faster and easier to proceed without it andwhere was she taking kyle so early in the morning did she have a plan or had she impulsively opted for an earlymorning subway ride much as cindy had opted for a latenight run did a woman with a baby just go through here she asked the boredlooking attendant who sat in a large glass booth inside the subway entrance it couldnt have been more than a few minutes ago cindy continued when the attendant failed to respond wasnt paying attention the man answered finally then youre holding up the line cindy tried to push through the turnstile but it refused to move you need a token the attendant reminded her i dont have a token then its two dollars and twentyfive cents cindy fished in her purse for the correct change as several disgruntled commuters wove past her impatiently while those forced to wait in line behind her groaned as one sorry she said the apology floating toward the ceiling like steam from a kettle as she offered the money to the attendant who rolled his eyes and pointed at the proper container cindy ran down the stairs on the other side of the turnstile trying to guess if faith had headed north or south she opted for south running down a second set of stairs to the subway platform her eyes panning the yellow tiles that lined the walls for any sign of faith and her baby had she missed them had the southbound train already come and gone it was then she heard a babys loud wail and saw faith standing at the other end of the platform on the opposite side of the station she was rocking kyle in her arms and smiling calmly she looks okay cindy thought and waved a broad gesture that caught faiths attention faith smiled as if seeing cindyin the subway at this hour of the morning was not unexpected then turned her attention back to the baby squirming in her arms somethings not right cindy thought walking briskly back toward the stairs pushing against the crowd surging in the other direction vaulting up one set of stairs and down the other seconds later she reached the north platform the tunnel stretched out before her like a long dark pipe careful a man cautioned as she ran beside the wide yellow stripe that ran along the edge of the platform shouldnt get so close to the edge cindy heeded his advice moving closer to the wall and proceeding quickly to the far end of the platform no need to run she heard someone say a train just left was he talking to her damn im going to be late another man replied how long till the next one couple of minutes cindy continued walking toward the far end of the platform watching faiths smile broaden as she approached as if she were genuinely pleased to see her cindy what are you doing here i was just about to ask you the same thing kyle has a doctors appointment so early it was the only time she could fit me in is the baby all right he has this rash rash cindy hadnt noticed any rash yesterday i called dr pitfield as soon as i saw it she said to bring kyle in first thing this morning and shed have a look at him isnt dr pitfields office on wellesley cindy had recommended dr pitfield to faith when faith first found out she was pregnant dr pitfield had been both julias and heathers pediatrician she moved really she was on wellesley forever where is she now lawrence well thats great we can go together youre going to lawrence yoga class cindy said quickly wondering why dr pitfield had suddenly uprooted her practice after more than thirty years in the same location and why wouldnt ryan have driven his wife to the doctors instead of letting her struggle with public transportation why was faith being so nice to her after what had happened yesterday was that kyles carriage i saw in front of the station faith shrugged never liked the stupid thing she said then you look nice as if this was the most natural of followups thank you you too new dress faith glanced briefly down as if she couldnt remember what she was wearing no its old its very pretty the color looks great on you you think so i do faith smiled another beautiful day she said yes it is they get kind of boring after a while all that sunshine i guess we could use some rain that would be nice i like the rain dont you sometimes cindy agreed theres nothing like a good thunderstorm were they actually talking about the weather lightning scares me faith confided me too have you ever seen a tornado a tornado no not a real one anyway i saw that movie though twister i think it was called i saw that faith said nodding it wasnt very good no the story was pretty lame the special effects were great though yes they were whats your favorite movie cindy asked faith raised her eyes pursed her lips as if giving the question serious consideration i dont think i have one really what about titanic did you see that or the godfather i saw that on television on bravo i think they were showing it over and over again you couldnt miss it did you see the sequel people say part two was even better than part one which is really rare in a sequel although part three was lousy i didnt see part three youre lucky the baby renewed his squirming faith began rocking him absently looking over her shoulder for the train my favorite movie is invasion of the body snatchers cindy continued a growing unease spreading through her joints although she wasnt sure why the original with kevin mccarthy and dana wynter not the remake i dont know that one i have a tape of it at home i could show it to you i dont know it sounds kind of scary i guess it is a little i could watch it with you if youd like faith shook her head began rocking back and forth on her heels i dont think so thanks anyway have you ever been to the film festival i go every year with a couple of friends lots and lots of fabulous films maybe next year youd like to go with us faith smiled said nothing the baby in her arms began whimpering ssh faith told him as several sharp cries pierced the air come on kyle be a good boy please dont cry would you like me to hold him for a few minutes he must be getting pretty heavy faith shook her head took a few steps back hes okay he sounds hungry no i just fed him maybe he needs changing hes fine faith began turning around in small circles each spin bringing her a little bit closer to the edge of the platform be careful cindy warned youre getting too close to the edge faith smiled said nothing in the distance cindy heard the rumble of an approaching train i have an idea she said why dont we go somewhere and have breakfast im not hungry coffee then theres a million places we could go for coffee i dont want coffee faith youre not thinking about doing anything foolish are you foolish you know what im talking about cindy felt the rush of air from a southbound train as it pulled into the station on the opposite track knew she didnt have much time before a northbound train came barreling along i think you should go now faith said im not leaving here without you faith looked confused why are you doing this because youre my friend because im worried about you theres nothing to worry about everythings all right now it is yes ive worked everything out worked what out what i have to do you have to move away from the edge of the platform cindy told her evenly please faith i know that whatever you think you have to do you wouldnt want to hurt kyle id never do anything to hurt kyle then move away from the edge of the platform im not the one whod hurt him faith said its you me faith glanced past cindy to the other people standing idly by all of you cindys eyes also scanned the waiting crowd trying to transmit her concern but no one was watching them nobody here would do anything to hurt kyle she said loudly trying to attract someones attention the world isnt a very nice place cindy you know that better than anyone yes i do cindy said wondering whether she should scream for help afraid such action might only make things worse i do know that but i also know that no matter how grim things may seem they always get better you really believe that i have to believe it and if things dont get better what then cindys eyes filled with tears then we have to go on really why cindy pictured heather asleep in her bed because there are other people who need us who would be devastated if we did something so final so irreversible she heard a low roar and realized with horror that it was the sound of an approaching train please faith listen to me things will get better honestly they will you promise faith whispered her eyes aching to believe i do i promise cindy repeated crossing her fingers for both of them balancing on the balls of her feet preparing to throw herself at the other woman to wrestle her to the ground if need be and then faith took a long deep breath and smiled her shoulders relaxing okay she said simply allowing cindy to wrap her in her arms thank god cindy said silently clinging tightly to the other woman slowly leading faith away from the edge of the platform toward the stairs oh faith said stopping suddenly what is it could you hold kyle a minute faith pushed the crying infant into cindys arms before cindy realized what was happening then she wriggled away from cindys grasp ran toward the end of the platform and threw herself in front of the oncoming train thirtytwo instant replay cindy hears a noise like distant thunder and realizes it is the sound of an approaching train she pleads with her neighbor please faith dont do anything foolish things will get better honestly they will you promise faith asks imploringly i promise faith takes a long deep breath her shoulders relaxing okay she says collapsing into cindys arms thank god cindy clings tightly to the other woman begins maneuvering her through the crowd toward the exit they are almost at the stairs oh faith says stopping abruptly as if shes forgotten something what is it could you hold kyle a minute cindy sat on one of the sofas in her living room staring at the far wall trying to keep her gaze from drifting to the window to keep the awful events of the morning from reflecting across the dark panes of glass but all it took was one flicker of the midnight moon peeking through the clouds and suddenly she was back on the northbound platform of the st clair subway station at the beginning of the earlymorning rush hour her arms gripping the shoulders of her seemingly acquiescent neighbor and one second they were walking peacefully toward the exit the crisis miraculously averted and the next second faith was pushing her baby into cindys arms then bolting from her side and throwing herself in front of the speeding train cindy heard the awful thud of flesh against metal the sickening squeal of brakes the horrified screams of onlookers and then chaos chaos people running in all directions passengers locked inside the subway cars banging on the doors to be let out the smell of vomit the ashenfaced conductor his forehead pressed against the glass of a side window yelling into his radio transmitter sirens wailing somewhere above their heads paramedics and police arriving the police demanding information someone pointing at cindy sitting on the dirty floor her back against the dull yellow tiles her feet stretched out in front of her like a lifeless rag doll cradling the nowsleeping baby in her arms and staring blankly into space can you tell us what happened a policeman asks kneeling down in front of cindy forcing his massive shoulders into her line of vision you knew this woman cindy stares at the young man whose face refuses to register beyond the deep brown of his eyes shes my neighbor an unfamiliar voice responds from what seems like a great distance away can you tell us her name faith sellick faith cindy repeats the irony of the name imploding against her lungs the strange voice floating to the ceiling like a moth to light is she dead silence silly question cindy thinks as the officers eyes close in confirmation is there someone we can notify her husband the voice supplies the officer with the necessary information cindy watches him jot it down in his notepad how many times has she seen that lately too many times way too many this is kyle the voice continues faiths baby well need you to tell us exactly what happened here the officer signals to a colleague for help can you do that the two uniformed officers take hold of cindys elbows help her up although the ground feels less than steady beneath her feet as if she is standing on a moving sidewalk cindy clings tightly to kyle resisting attempts to take him from her are you going to be all right the policeman with the brown eyes asks although his words are garbled as if someone is playing them at the wrong speed cindy nods walking slowly between the two officers as they guide her toward the exit well need your name the police officer is saying as cindys attention is diverted by a sudden movement on the subway track cindy the unfamiliar voice answers and for an instant cindy wishes this person would stop talking let her answer for herself cindy carver cindy carver the second officer repeats stopping in almost the exact spot as faith stopped only moments before the mother of that missing girl and then cindy sees the paramedics carefully lifting faiths hopelessly twisted body onto a stretcher and notices a tom fragment of faiths blue cotton dress lying across the tracks she turns back sees bits of human flesh dripping from the bloodsoaked front window of the train are you julia carvers mother the first officer is asking staring at cindy with his puppy dog brown eyes a persistent buzz fills cindys ears almost blocking out his words are julia carvers mother are you carvers mother are you julia mother and then the unfamiliar voice once again assumes control excuse me it says calmly as cindy hands kyle to the policeman with the puppy dog eyes in much the same way faith earlier handed him over to her i think im going to faint and then cindy feels her knees bend her hips sway her eyes roll back in her head everything happening in slow motion as her body begins folding in on itself like a collapsible chair im getting rather good at this she thinks as she falls toward the hard tile she saved that baby you know someone says as strange arms reach out to block her fall she should get a medal shes a hero im a hero cindy thinks and might have laughed but for the darkness that envelops her so according to the eleven oclock news im a hero cindy said now watching neil walk toward her with a freshly brewed cup of tea he was wearing khaki pants and a beige shirt and cindy thought he was the most welcome sight shed ever seen on either side of her sat her mother and sister leigh stood up as neil approached moved to the other sofa scooted in beside heather meg andtrish not feeling very heroic neil sat down beside her stroked the back of cindys neck as she gingerly sipped her tea elvis keeping close watch on everyone from the floor cindy smiled at the handsome man whod rushed to her side when shed regained consciousness and phoned him from the subway station i feel like such a fraud how are you a fraud meg asked because i didnt do anything you saved a babys life trish reminded her faith saved him not me its only because of you that theyre not both dead cindys mother said cindy shook her head this whole thing is my fault how can it possibly be your fault because im the one who drove her over the edge cindy said the words shed been trying to swallow all day spilling from her mouth in a sudden rush literally i did everything but push her over the side of that platform myself cindy im the one who rubbed her nose in her husbands affair with julia im the one who called the police who had her hauled off to the station for questioning when she was so tired she could barely stand up i knew how fragile she was i knew but that didnt stop me from flinging all sorts of ridiculous accusations in her face even after the police warned me to back off even after they ordered me to stop interfering with their investigation and now look whats happened cindy her mother said please dont tell me its not my fault do you really think you have that kind of power heather asked using the same words her mother had used the night before cindy smiled sadly holding open her arms as her daughter slid into them thanks for being here she said kissing the top of heathers head all of you where else would we be everyone answered almost in unison heather had been waiting for her when neil brought her home from the subway her mother and sister whod been at the dressmakers rushed over as soon as they heard the news as had meg and trish several hours ago only tom hadnt bothered to call probably halfway to muskoka when the reports were first broadcast normally subway suicides went unreported in the media lest it encourage others to take similar action but cindys presence at the scene had changed everything the fact that julia carvers mother had been instrumental in saving another womans child from certain death had been the lead story on every newscast on every radio and television station in the city and the fact that the victim was cindys nextdoor neighbor had only added to the intrigue reporters had been calling or knocking on her door since early this afternoon theorizing about a possible connection between julias disappearance and her neighbors attempted suicide the story was sure to make tomorrows headlines cindy understood sighing audibly especially once the press got wind of ryans affair with her daughter as surely they would are you okay neil asked i should have realized what was happening sooner then she might have jumped sooner taken kyle with her cindy looked toward the front door is the house still surrounded i thought i saw someone from citytv lurking in the bushes o cabout an hour ago but i think he finally gave up and went home what about you cindy asked reluctantly shouldnt you be heading home its almost midnight your son i can stay a little longer the phone rang everyone looked toward the sound no one made a move to get up you want me to answer that meg asked cindy shook her head let voicemail take it after four rings the phone went silent two minutes later it rang again and again two minutes after that persistent little devil trish said maybe its important leigh added it isnt how many crank calls had she received already today between the reporters and the kooks her phone had been ringing almost constantly although it had tapered off in the last several hours at one point things had gotten so disruptivethe phone ringing cameramen banging their equipment against the windows the dog barking each time someone came to the door cindy had briefly considered grabbing neil and taking refuge in a hotel but she knew her mother and sister would insist on coming along as would heather meg and trish and the thought of all of them crowded into a small hotel room had been enough to put the kibosh on that idea cindy pushed herself off the sofa and shuffled into the kitchen where she checked her voicemail for messages nothing she informed their eager faces upon her return whoever it was didnt leave a message next time it rings ill answer it her mother said why dont you go upstairs to bed neil suggested i dont think i could sleep every time i close my eyes i see even when i dont close them she thought as once again faith materialized to hurl herself in front of an oncoming train cindy heard the helpless squeal of brakes the gutwrenching thud of cold steel against warm flesh saw the tom sliver of babyblue cotton clinging to the coalblack of the subway tracks faiths blood splattered across the front window of the car like mud burning its way into the glass like acid rain branding itself into her soul i may have a few of those pills left neil whispered underneath his breath really what kind of pills are those leigh asked because i havent had a good nights sleep in months have you heard anything from detective bartolli trish asked cindy grimaced remembering how angry detectives bartolli and gill had been upon hearing the news of faiths suicide and cindys presence at the scene how detective bartolli had gone so far as to threaten to arrest her if there were any further incidents listen you guys you dont have to stay really do you want us to leave meg asked no cindy admitted i want you to stay forever okay they all said and cindy smiled they sat together for another hour exchanging idle chatter hugs and sighs until norma appleton announced she could no longer keep her eyes open and she and leigh went upstairs to bed as did heather ten minutes after that meg and trish reluctantly said goodbye several minutes later both promising to call the next day your turn cindy told neil standing by the open front door youre sure only if you promise to come back tomorrow hows breakfast ill bring bagels if memory serves my family loves your bagels neil smiled maybe ill bring max he likes bagels too id like that neil leaned over kissed cindy tenderly on the lips see you in the morning cindy watched him drive off before retreating back inside the house she was about to close the door when she stopped stepped back onto the landing her eyes staring through the darkness toward several cars parked at the far end of the street how long had they been there and were they empty or was someone sitting inside them cindy squinted trying to differentiate between flesh and shadow more reporters she wondered the police probably no one cindy locked the door and headed upstairs for bed trying to shake the uncomfortable feeling she was being watched thirtythree s l h e was almost asleep when she heard something outside her bedroom window cindy sat up in bed careful not to disturb heather who was curled up beside her elvis at their feet she waited the silence of the night swirling around her head like a potent perfume and then she heard it again a tap on the glass quick and sharp and then another cindys first thought was that it was a bird pecking on the glass to be letin but birds didnt fly at night she knew climbing out of bed and going to the window peeking through the shutters almost immediately something slapped against the windowpane and cindy gasped pulled away from the glass her heart pounding wildly convinced someone had fired a bullet at her head but the glass hadnt shattered it hadnt even cracked cindy inched back toward the window as once again something ricocheted off the glass a pebble she realized someone was throwing stones at her window cindy reached for her robe and raced down the stairs to the kitchen flipping on the light over the back patio a man dressed entirely in black was standing in the middle of her backyard cindy stifled a scream as he turned his head toward the light the scream freezing in her throat when she recognized the familiar look of consternation on his handsome face tom cindy unlocked the sliding glass door watched her exhusband toss a fistful of pebbles to the ground then bound up the stairs immediately the cookie also entirely in black stepped out of the darkness to follow after him what on earth are you doing here what are you doing trying to get your attention damn it why didnt you answer your goddamn phone what they stepped into the kitchen the cookie closing the door as tom flipped off the patio light the full moon falling into the space between them like an errant spotlight what was going on here tonight a party you were watching the house i need to talk to you i couldnt do it when everyone was here i dont understand has something happened a feeling of dread trickled into cindys veins like a transfusion of tainted blood she felt her body grow cold as if a hand had reached out to her from beyond the grave does this have something to do with julia tom pushed his fingers roughly through his hair okay listen i recognize this is going to be a shock but its very important that you stay calm i understand its already been one hell of a day for you but i need your assurances you arent going to freak out i think youd better tell me whats going on i came here to prepare you prepare me for what tom said nothing for several long seconds then he reached back to the sliding glass door and pulled it open okay he said to the surrounding darkness you can come in now the night air stirred as a shape began forming inside it gradually separating from it cindy held her breath as the shape assumed human form began its slow ascent up the patio steps its face hidden by the hood of a black sweatshirt and then there she was standing in the doorway the hood falling from her head to reveal the straight blond hair beneath looking as impossibly beautiful as she had the last time cindy saw her over two weeks ago julia julia cindy threw herself at the apparition casting an invisible net over its head and trapping it in her arms before it could fly away as if shed stumbled across a rare butterfly she knew her mind was playing tricks that the awful events of the day combined with her fatigue had disrupted the normal patterns of her brain so that not only was she seeing lost young women jumping from her side she was seeing other lost young women miraculously appearing to take their place julia she uttered staring at the vision in the black velour jumpsuit touching her face her shoulders her hair julia she said again as if the repetition of the name would be enough to give the ghost weight provide it with the substance needed to sustain it julia cindy cried bracing herself for her daughters sudden absence and then the mirage that was julia was folding herself inside cindys arms and cindy was hugging her and kissing her and her skinny frame felt solid and real and her soft smooth skin smelled of angel perfume cindy tasted her daughter on her tongue like tiny bubbles of champagne are you really here cindy cried squeezing julias broad shoulders her toned arms her slender hips are you really here im really here the apparition said sounding just like julia it is you youre here youre real julia laughed im real im here and now cindy was sobbing her whole body shaking as she pulled her daughter to her chest as if trying to solder them both together all the while smothering the side of julias face with kisses as if she couldnt get enough of her as if she intended to devour her julia was back she was in her mothers arms she was alive and well and she looked wonderful she looked rested and beautiful more beautiful than ever no bruises stained her flawless complexion no nameless terrors clouded her eyes youre here cindy kept repeating youre all right im here im all right despite the assurances cindy refused to relinquish her daughters hands if she did the dream would surely end shed wake up it would be over her daughter would be gone youre not hurt im fine julia said again youre fine cindy repeated unable to staunch the flood of tears streaming down her cheeks her daughter was alive and well and back home where she belonged she wasnt a ghost she was really here and no harm had befallen her how was that possible i dont understand where have you been julia looked from her mother to her father who nodded his silent encouragement you have to promise you wont be angry angry what was julia talking about why would i be angry promise me youll at least try to understand understand what whats going on tom cindy implored her eyes veering reluctantly from her daughter to her exhusband tom what is she talking about where did you find her dont you get it yet he asked looking at cindy with a mixture of pity and scorn get what a seconds hesitation before julias simple response i was never lost the words ripped through cindy as if fired from a gun she staggered back dropped her daughters hand what are you talking about where have you been there was a long pause a second exchange of glances between father and daughter before julia answered at the cottage what she insisted on coming back as soon as we heard the news about faith sellick the cookie interjected quickly is ryan okay julia asked the news reports barely mentioned him youve been in muskoka all this time cindys head was spinning her daughter was back she wasnt injured she hadnt been kidnapped or raped and murdered then buried in a shallow grave she was alive and well wasnt that all that mattered what difference did it make where shed been that it appeared shed been relaxing in the country while her mother was going crazy in the city that instead of being concerned about her sister her grandmother her aunt she was asking after ryan that even more astounding she seemed oblivious to the hell shed put her family through these awful last two weeks cindy turned toward tom another horrifying thought slowly crystallizing did you know about this did you know where julia was all along you promised you wouldnt get angry julia reminded her maybe you should sit down tom said without protest cindy lowered herself into a kitchen chair braced herself for whatever staggering revelations might follow this doesnt leave this room tom warned closing then locking the sliding glass door julia took a deep breath blew it out slowly as if she were savoring a forbidden cigarette as you know two weeks ago i had an audition with michael kinsolving for a part in his next movie dad said you saw the tape yes cindy acknowledged quietly you were wonderful julia smiled proudly thank you unfortunately wonderful auditions arent enough these days tom continued assuming control there are too many beautiful talented actresses out there and julia needed something that would give her an edge over the competition something that would get her the attention she deserves he paused dramatically and what better way to get noticed than to disappear the room went in and out of focus as cindy shook her head in disbelief surely shed misunderstood surely shed misinterpreted what her daughter and exhusband were trying to tell her youre saying this was a publicity stunt i just wanted a chance mom michael was auditioning so many girls he hasnt had a hit in a while and dad said the studio was pressuring him to give the part to a name hollywood actress we knew we had to do something to level the playing field so you concocted this scheme to make julia as recognizable as any of the famous actresses in town for the festival tom continued unable to disguise his enthusiasm cindy im an entertainment lawyer i know how this business works i knew we had to do something pretty drastic to get the results we needed and it worked hell julias practically a household name entertainment tonight did two whole minutes on michaels possible involvement in her disappearance the other night do you have any idea what that kind of exposure is worth michael would be a fool not to give her the part now and trust me michael kinsolving is nobodys fool he knows a good story so does the studio and they also know everybody likes a happy ending good story cindy repeated incredulously happy ending okay cindy its obvious youre upset but can you at least try to keep an open mind why didnt you tell me cindy looked at her daughter through wide disbelieving eyes could her daughter really be so unfeeling so monstrously selfabsorbed do you have any idea what ive been going through what weve all been going through why didnt you tell me we thought about it julia began you thought about it we couldnt tell you tom said curtly we knew that at the very least youd feel compelled to tell your mother and heather and then heather would tell duncan and your mother would tell leigh and then where would we be dont you see it wouldnt have worked if you didnt honestly believe that julia was missing your daughters the actress in the family cindy not you the police would have seen through you in a heartbeat besides the cookie added matteroffactly we knew youd never agree to it cindy felt suddenly sick to her stomach that afternoon at the morgue not my idea believe me tom waved his hands in front of his face as if to rid himself of the memory i wouldnt want to go through that again and what happened afterward in your apartment what happened in our apartment the cookie asked all the people the police questioned sean duncan ryan people whose lives have been turned upside down as a result of this little charade and faith my god poor faith again cindy saw the hapless young woman hurl herself in front of the speeding train heard the sickening thud of metal against flesh faith didnt kill herself because of me julia protested she was suffering from postpartum depression cindy struggled to stay calm to keep her voice down do you think it helped her to be hauled into the police station for questioning to find out youd been sleeping with her husband and exactly whose fault was it she found that out tom asked narrowing his eyes accusingly im really very sorry about what happened to faith julia said but she was loony tunes to begin with you cant blame me for what she did we had no way of knowing shed pull something like this you had no way of knowing that shed pull something like this cindy repeated incredulously kindly lower your voice tom instructed kindly go fuck yourself cindy shot back i told you it was a mistake coming here the cookie said throwing her hands into the air in defeat you didnt consider that there might be consequences to your actions cindy asked her daughter it never occurred to you that not everything works out exactly as planned that sometimes the things we set in motion have a way of spiraling out of control i just want to be famous julia said evenly as if this made everything understandable as if it made everything all right so the end justifies the means cindy stared at her daughter the young woman whom only moments before she would have given her life just to hold in her arms julia was her fathers daughter she realized in that instant she always had been flashback julia four years old shirley temple curls tamed into two long braids holding tightly to her fathers hand as they walk down the street julia age eight proudly sitting on the shiny red bicycle her father bought her for her birthday julia at thirteen wearing a fancy brownandbluestriped taffeta dress posing beside her father so handsome in his tuxedo before they leave for the annual havergal fatherdaughter dinnerdance julia the following year packing her clothes into the new louis vuitton suitcase her father bought her then carrying it outside to his waiting bmw leaving her childhoodand her motherbehind so what happens now cindy asked her energy sapped what exactly are you planning on telling people that julia was a victim of amnesia its simple tom said we tell them that julia was feeling down because she thought shed blown her audition so she wandered the countryside for a couple of weeks trying to clear her head didnt even look at a paper until today the police will never buy it are you kidding tom reminded her it was their idea and im just supposed to go along with this charade do you have any other choice did she i could tell them the truth you could yes tom agreed but then in all likelihood julia will be arrested a promising career will be nipped in the bud and ill be disbarred is that what you really want tom paused allowed his words the necessary time to sink in before continuing look cindy right now youre hurt and youre angry and thats completely understandable youve been through hell these last few weeks nobody knows that better than i do but i urge you to think this through and consider our daughters best interests our daughters best interests cindy repeated numbly please mom im so close to getting everything ive ever wanted you cant really want to see your daughter go to jail the cookie said i thought all you ever wanted was for julia to come home tom reminded cindy i thought so too she said there was a noise in the hallway and elvis suddenly galloped into the room elvis julia fell to her knees hugged her dog to her chest how are you boy heather appeared in the kitchen doorway i heard voices she said falling silent when she saw her sister whats going on norma appleton called from the top of the stairs julias home heather shouted back at her julia leigh wake up julias home in the next instant cindys mother and sister came flying into the room crying happily and gathered julia inside their arms smothering her face with kisses moments later the women sat huddled together at the kitchen table their bewildered faces heavy with anger relief and pain as they tried to recover from the shock of the earlymorning revelations im really sorry julia told them standing next to her father on the other side of the room i honestly didnt think everybody would be so upset you didnt think wed be upset her grandmothers head shook from side to side in disbelief you didnt think period leigh said bitterly how could you do this to mom heather asked i said i was sorry julia said testily okay the cookie chirped into the silence that followed i think weve said everything that needs to be said theres nothing to be gained from going over the whole thing ad nauseum ill call the newspapers first thing in the morning tom said tell them julias come home he squeezed julias hand that shes ready for her closeup julia smiled her free hand automatically reaching up to smooth the side of her hair cindy stared at her older daughter still just a child really despite her twentyone years maybe there was still hope maybe time would bring some measure of maturity or maybe not maybe julia would always be a bit of a monster maybe her single minded selfabsorption was the very quality that would make her a star her obvious contempt for the feelings of others resulting in her being adored by millions her fathers daughter all right but her daughter too cindy walked to the phone and punched in the number for the fiftythird division id like to speak to the officer in charge please what do you think youre doing tom demanded if you tell the police the truth ill deny it julia said quickly ill say you were in on the whole thing from the beginning this is ridiculous the cookie snapped youre just doing this to get back at tom and i tom and me heather said from her seat at the kitchen table what object of the preposition heather said i dont believe this tom do something mom please julia pleaded i just want to come home the words tugged at cindys heart officer medavoy a familiar voice announced in cindys ear officer medavoy its cindy carver we met the other night my daughter heather yes of course how is she shes wonderful wonderful cindy repeated her eyes absorbing the miracle that was her younger child all these years shed overlooked heathers quiet light because shed been so blinded by the raging fire that was julia all those years cindy had given short shrift to one daughter because she was so busy mourning the loss of the other and now julia was back and she was saying exactly what cindy had been waiting a lifetime to hear please mom i just want to come home and it was too late its my other daughter im calling about julia a collective intake of breath shes home cindy told the officer she closed her eyes shook her head a cry escaping her mouth as she tried to continue could she really tell the police the truth knowing that her daughter might go to jail her dreams of stardom over hadnt the last two weeks seen enough misery and shattered dreams to last a lifetime she waltzed in about an hour ago cindy announced totally unaware of everything thats been happening thank god she heard the cookie whisper as julia burst into a flood of grateful tears against her fathers chest cindy continued reading from the invisible script her exhusband and daughter had prepared surprised by how convincing she managed to sound tom was right when all was said and done what other choice did she have thank you she told the officer before hanging up the phone and facing the others he said hell let detectives bartolli and gill know whats happened that theyll probably contact us first thing in the morning thank you so much mom julia whispered you did the right thing tom said cindy glanced toward the kitchen table expecting to see at least a hint of recrimination in her mothers eyes a scowl of disapproval on her sisters lips a look of disappointment on heathers face but all three women were nodding their tearful support there were no judgments here cindy realized only love tom kissed julias forehead try to get some sleep sweetie you want to look good for the reporters in the morning he touched the cookies elbow began leading her toward the hall wait cindy called out what was she doing now cindy were all beat cant this wait until tomorrow julia cant stay here the words were out of cindys mouth almost before she realized they were in her head what tom stopped abruptly what julia echoed you cant stay here cindy said again the words sounding no less strange for having repeated them i dont understand cindy took a deep breath releasing the air slowly from her lungs feeling her heart about to burst i love you darling i always will you know that and im so sorry she glanced from julia to tom then back again its just that i cant spend any more time living with someone i dont really like julias eyes filled with unexpected tears she quickly lowered her head her hair falling across her face as it had during her audition for michael kinsolving fantasy julia raises her head tears falling the length of her cheeks im so sorry she says please forgive me i never meant to hurt you i love you more than anything in the world i promise ill change i promise things will be so different from now on julia remained in that posture for several seconds then a toss of her hair a shrug of her shoulders brought her head back up when her eyes next met her mothers the tears were gone whatever ill stay at dads the cookies eyes widened in alarm could she really do this cindy wondered could she really send her daughter away was she prepared to lose her again possibly forever cindy felt her body shudder as if finally absorbing the fact that julia had been lost to her a long time ago julia stood in the middle of the kitchen not moving as if giving her mother a few extra seconds to change her mind okay then if thats the way you want it come on elvis were going back to dads oh no the cookie wailed i will not have that mangy mutt peeing on my good carpets again come on elvis julia repeated as if the cookie hadnt spoken elvis slowly raised himself up from his position underneath the kitchen table and lumbered over to the middle of the room to where cindy was standing then he barked loudly three times and stretched himself across the top of cindys feet fine julia rolled her eyes in exasperation stay here if thats what you want thank god the cookie muttered shut up julia snapped you shut up ladies please tom implored ushering the two young women toward the front door without so much as a backward glance cindy followed her eyes trailing after them as they walked down the street she saw julia climb into her fathers car watched that car pull away from the curb then turn the corner onto avenue road and then she was gone flashback julia age fourteen her ponytail waving behind her carries her suitcase into her fathers waiting bmw leaving her childhood and her mother behind are you all right heather asked coming up behind her cindy nodded im okay she said realizing that she was maybe nothing would ever completely heal the wound in her heart maybe there would always be a part of her that wanted to run down the street after her older daughter and beg her to come home but it was too late for that julia wasnt fourteen anymore she was all grown up now an adult with a mind and a will of her own and thank god she was healthy and strong and safe hell she was indestructible they were the ones whod been battered and bruised and beaten these last few weeks cindy realized for fourteen days theyd been treading water and holding their breath struggling to keep their heads above the cruel current their lives had been turned upside down and inside out and now suddenly it was over just like that two weeks of slow torture resolved in mere seconds and yet those seconds would resonate with all of them for the rest of their lives how are you guys tired said her mother exhausted said leigh we should get to bed what do you think will happen tomorrow her mother asked i dont know neils coming over with bagels heather reminded them cindy smiled at the three women i love you she said simply we love you too they said in unison elvis lifted himself off cindys feet and stared at her expectantly dont worry cindy told the dog we love you too
