 chapter the snare there is a theory among scientists that the ancestors of the indians of north and south america came from asia this probably explained how saturday loo could don a brightcolored blanket poncho mingle with a crowd in antofagasta chile and pass himself off as a native son of the andes saturday loos poncho was not a disguise exclusively it concealed an object which resembled a singleshot pistol with a barrel large enough to accommodate shotgun cartridges the poncho also hid a long rope six pairs of handcuffs a gas mask and an assortment of teargas bombs safety first was a fetish with saturday loo the shotgunsized implement which was a very pistol firing a slug that would burst into a smoke puff high in the air should set machinery in motion to settle the business at hand but there was always the chance of a slipup hence the rope handcuffs and tear gas to fall back upon taking care not to bump into any one which might call attention to what he carried under his poncho saturday loo worked forward at least two hundred thousand chilean citizens were gathered on this hill outside antofagasta the center of attention was a high speakers rostrum of temporary construction everybody was pushing and elbowing to get closer to the rostrum although great loudspeakers of a publicaddress system were scattered everywhere and should guarantee all hearing what was to be said puerco gritted a man who had been elbowed pig why do you shove i want to see the bronze man at close range said the one who had done the elbowing unabashed that seemed to be the thought every one had they wanted to see the bronze man back of the speakers rostrum towered a structure which once it was completed would undoubtedly be the largest building in antofagasta it was possibly half finished its architecture was plain and substantial a great sign hanging over the freshly mortared bricks read el honor de doc savage in case there should be any one unable to read spanish the legend was elaborated below in english this free hospital erected in honor of doc savage the building was being dedicated the crowd was here for the ceremony and to see the bronze man the bronze man was doc savage that giant mysterious worker of miracles about whom all chile was agog in makeup the crowd ranged from austere grandees of castilian descent who had driven to the ceremony in shiny american limousines to stocky brown aymaran indians from far back in the andes mountains who probably had come to town driving a string of llamas the resemblance of these latter to asiatics was startling saturday loo was an asiatic so he passed among them without drawing attention to be exact saturday loo was a tibetan as many as one fourth of the tibetan men become monks or holy men with a very strict code of morals saturday loo had never been tempted in that direction a more thorough rogue than he could not be found between the himalaya mountains and the gobi desert saturday loo made directly for a cluster of ponchoclad men who hardly seemed to share the enthusiasm of the crowd about the bronze man these also resembled aymaran indians but were swart asiatics my children saturday loo hailed them grandly make less long the expressions on your faces one would think you were going to your respective funerals if there should be an error our fate may be exactly that mumbled a man aye agreed another i have beard that this bronze man this doc savage is very dangerous they say those who molest the bronze man disappear and are never heard from again offered a third he is indeed what yankees call hellonwheels look what he did here in chile two hundred thousand people have come to catch a glimpse of him that proves he is a great man and dangerous to molest the gun which makes the loudest report does not always shoot the hardest quoted saturday loo you are children scaring each other with ghost stories stop it this great crowd only makes our work the easier the conversation was carried on in a tibetan dialect which none of the surrounding chileans understood in addition voices were kept low saturday loo stared narrowly at his assistants he could see that his words had not relieved them a great deal several times the tobaccocolored men rolled uneasy glances upward they squirmed and tried not to let their chief see these overhead stares the skyward gazing came to saturday loos attention however he understood what was really making his helpers uneasy so that is it he snapped his voice however was a bit shrill the tibetans shifted their shoulders under the ponchos but said nothing you fear the blue meteor saturday loo accused aye one fellow mumbled admission we fear it suppose the blue meteor could not be controlled said another and shuddered visibly you all know what would happen to us in that case in the general exchange of looks which followed this statement saturday loo joined they were hardened rogues yet mention of the blue meteor had conjured up a stark terror within their souls whatever the mysterious blue meteor was these men obviously feared it more than they dreaded the possibility of being after death sent back to earth in the form of rabbits which in some tibetans is their idea of going to hell we will draw away a safe distance saturday loo said hoarsely inside this blanket of a thing which i am wearing is a signal gun when the bronze man appears i am to discharge the weapon into the sky and the blue meteor will come asked a man aye and the blue meteor will come they moved through the crowd not wishing to attract attention they curbed a natural inclination to elbow people out of their path and only jostled gently how far is a safe distance asked one tibetan a very great distance muttered another two hundred yards in this case said saturday loo but the blue meteor has been known to affect men for miles two hundred yards snapped saturday loo this time it is not powerful as the villainous saturday loo and his fellow miscreants worked out of the crowd and took up a position in the shade of a rickety stand selling beer fruit and empanadas or meat pies there was one person who watched them intently the observer was a young woman and in her gaze was fear loathing and a growing horror the young lady herself was in turn the focus of no little attention for she was possibly the most exquisite thing in femininity that antofagasta had seen recently once sure the tibetans would not see her she squeezed rapidly through the crowd toward the speaking rostrum desperation was in her brown eyes and she nibbled nervously at the inside of entrancing cupid lips she was taller than many of the chileans even the men and she gazed anxiously over heads toward the rostrum chilean senoritas those of pure castilian descent are noted for the comeliness of their figures but more than one envious eye followed the girl who was working her way feverishly toward the speaking stand the tall venus had hair about the hue of rich mahogany which was in marked contrast to the tresses of the surrounding senoritas she reached the vicinity of the rostrum and glanced anxiously about she was an american herself and apparently searching for yankee faces seeing none she accosted a chilean i must find doc savage she gasped its on a vitally important matter where can i locate him no sabe el ingles replied the chilean the young woman shook her head and nipped her lips in exasperation she did not speak spanish she supposed the fellow had told her that he did not understand english she continued her search for a yankee and found two of them a moment later they were such an incongruous pair that she stopped and stared one of the yanks looked as if an immediate ancestor had been a threehundredpound gorilla his great corded redbristled arms were nearly long enough to permit him to walk on all fours without stooping he had an enormous mouth a tuft of a nose which apparently had been pounded by many fists and little eyes almost lost in pits of gristle his ears were shapeless and one was perforated with a hole the size of a lead pencil an opening which could have been made by a bullet the hair on his nubbin of a head as coarse as rusty shingle nails and of about the same hue seemed an extension of his shaggy eyebrows this gave one the impression of a skull with no room provided for brains the girl looking on did not yet know it but this apish giant was andrew blodgett monk mayfair one of the worlds greatest chemists former lieutenant colonel in the u s army and at present one of a group of five men associated with doc savage in his worldwide adventures the anthropoidlike monk carried a large box under an arm one end of this was fitted with a screened ventilating hole from the box came grunting sounds monk was leering at his companion the other was a perfectly dressed wasp of a man by far the most impeccably clad personage in the crowd of two hundred thousand or so he had a prominent nose bright eyes and the large mobile mouth of a trained orator in both hands he gripped a slender black cane with this he seemed about to strike the human ape before him you fuzzy accident he snarled you hairy missing link some of the dapper gentlemans colleagues in new york might have been shocked at his performance for he was brigadier general theodore marley brooks considered one of the most astute lawyers harvard had ever turned out he was also commonly called ham and was one of doc savages group of five men hams cane which was harmless enough to the eye was actually a sword cane ham was also he probably would have died rather than admit it the best friend of the apish monk he would have freely sacrificed his own life for monks wellbeing should that be necessary monk would also do the same for ham an observer would have sworn the pair were perpetually on the point of slaughtering each other you bobble of nature ham continued vitriolically you overgrown bobtailed jungle denizen monk leered blissfully at ham from the box under the apish chemists arm came a series of piggy grunts and shrilling squeals you only brought that blasted pig along to get in my hair ham growled where dyou get that stuff you louddressin shyster monk grunted ill take habeas corpus wherever i daggone monk swallowed the rest his pleasantly ugly face became somewhat blank his little eyes glistened in their pits of gristle a vision whom monk would have taken oath was the prettiest girl in the world had confronted them can you gentlemen tell me where doc savage may be found asked the young woman monk and ham stared tonguetied the girls beauty had taken the wind from their sails darn it the young woman said disgustedly apparently addressing herself i thought you looked like men who could speak english i guess you cannot monk and ham hastily ceased staring and registered some embarrassment i hope you will overlook the bad manners of my hairy friend here ham told the beauty politely monk used to be the wild man in a circus and he got the habit of looking at everybody as if he wanted to eat them hes a liar miss monk put in hastily hes got a wife and thirteen children his offspring are all halfwitted like their father instead of smiling at what monk and ham intended to he humor that would break the ice the young lady seemed distressed when she spoke there was brittle fear in her voice if you know where i can find doc savage please tell me she pleaded in a strained voice monk and ham sobered is your business with doc important ham asked sharply extremely the chemist and the lawyer exchanged glances the girl sounded as if she were in earnest does doc savage know you monk queried rae stanley is my name my father is professor elmont stanley mr savage does not know me but he has probably heard of my father what do you want to see doc about attractive rae stanley shook her head that must be strictly between doc savage and myself in inquiring about doc how did you happen to pick on us monk asked curiously you were the first men i saw who looked as if they might be able to speak english rae explained then you didnt know were two of docs outfit the girls brown eyes widened her exquisite features showed delight this is a break she ejaculated i can give my warning to you then go back to my quarters i am in danger every minute that i am away this caused monk and ham to register intense curiosity and bewilderment youre risking something to come here and warn doc ham demanded my life said rae stanley what do you want to warn doc against the girl moistened her lips and glanced upward there was a nervousness in her manner which indicated that she would not have been surprised had some menace been lurking above the blue meteor she said rapidly i came to warn ohhhtheres shrops her words changed into a scream which put teeth on edge she clapped both hands over her mouth as if to make a lid that would keep the sound back stark horror had come suddenly into her eyes she spun and fled she saw some guy named shrops behind us ham barked both he and monk turned to scrutinize the crowd chapter the cockney within range of monks and hams eyes was a heterogeneous collection of humanity swart andean indians and cholag or mixed bloods made up the bulk of the crowd but there were also chileans as whiteskinned as swedes there were scores of yankees these for the most part being engineers connected with chiles great nitrate industry one man caught the attention of monk and ham this fellow did not stand many feet distant and he was facing directly toward them he was an apple of a man his body was a plump apple equipped with arms and legs and his head another ruddy apple he wore a fawncolored lapover vest striped trousers and a gray derby the derby was hardly a headgear for tropical wear he seemed rotund and amiable except for his mouth which was reminiscent of a bear trap he saw monk and ham centering their attention on him and promptly spoke he had a strong cockney accent wot appened thats what we want to know monk grunted the girl acted arf barmy said the cockney she must o seen somethin behind me to scare er bad the cockney turned lifted on tiptoe and peered over the heads of the crowd then he settled back on his feet and shook his head hi bloody well dont see nothin corkscrewey is your name shrops ham asked the cockney blimey no speaking from the corner of his enormous mouth so that only ham could hear monk said lets go get that girl ham gave the handle of his cane a slight twist an act which prepared the hidden sword for a quick draw o k come on the cockney watched them as they shoved through the crowd he even stood on tiptoe to keep them in sight gorillalike monk glancing back noted the cockneys curiosity he growled i wonder if he could be shrops what makes you wonder that ham demanded well hes gawking anybody would gawk after the way that girl acted ham shouldered lustily at ponchoclad indians and did not hesitate to whack an occasional son of the andes with the sword cane but he was not making much progress in the throng get behind me monk ordered let a guy go through this crowd who knows how to do it carrying the case containing his pet pig high over his head with one hand and using the other to move people out of the way as if they were stalks in a ripe grain field monk plowed through the assemblage ham kept close at monks heels craning his neck being taller than monk ham could peer over the crowd brown eyed mahoganyhaired rae stanley should have been easy to locate she was taller than the chileans her head however was not visible above the sea of mantiflas flat straw hats and colored knit caps blast it ham grunted shes ducked out of sight they veered to the right and when the young woman did not materialize worked in a circle nowhere did they see the attractive bit of femininity who had claimed she had a warning for doc savage lets go back and talk to that cockney monk growled there was somethin suspicious about that mug monk and ham furrowed their way back to the spot where they had left the cockney reaching the vicinity they halted to stare about disgustedly hes skipped monk grunted ill bet he really was shrops ham said thoughtfully a soft hissing came from the public address loudspeakers which were mounted atop poles the amplifiers had been switched on monk grasped hams elbow have you forgotten that doc sent you here to make a speech ham objected but that girl has something important we may be able to spot her from the rostrum monk interrupted come on the huge hairy chemist and the slender immaculate lawyer worked toward the speakers platform a stiffbacked officiallooking chilean gentleman marched up and positioned himself in front of the bank of microphones which fed the publicaddress system waving his arms in the animated fashion to which latins are addicted he began to speak we still hope that this bronze wonder man who is the hero of all chile will appear at our ceremony he said in flowery spanish as you all know however this heroic gentleman is not one who likes to accept public acclaim in person therefore he informed me he would not be present a profound silence settled over the crowd the human sea seemed to have frozen with the exception of one spot where monk and ham were elbowing a path while we wait hoping that he will come continued the chilean spellbinder i am going to give you a few facts about this mighty personage to whom chile owes more than can ever be repaid monk and ham exchanged glances and monk grinned i wonder how much this speechmaker really knows about doc the orator continued the bronze man doc savage is an individual the like of whom the world has never before seen he is a superman a colossus of brawn and brain who has been trained scientifically from the day of his birth to follow his present career the speaker paused to let that sink in then went on doc savage by a routine of daily exercise pursued each day since childhood has acquired an almost fantastic muscular development a physical strength beside which that of samson would pale in addition it is said that no one ever studied as intensively or as widely as has doc savage this has equipped him with a knowledge which borders on the profound on every subject doc savage is a rare combination of muscular strength and mental perfection hmmm monk grunted thoughtfully juggling his pet pigs box some of this crowd may think that bird is laying it on thick but hes not he isnt even exaggerating and thats probably something he dont suspect himself this unusual training was to fit doc savage for a unique profession the speaker went on he rights wrongs and punishes evildoers traveling to the far corners of the earth to accomplish these things his most recent accomplishment was here in chile when he wiped out a gang of fiends who were seeking to get control of the chilean nitrate industry in order to supply ingredients for explosives to a european nation which contemplates war monk and ham mounted the rostrum steps looking about in an endeavor to locate the cockney and pretty rae stanley doc savage refused remuneration for his services continued the chilean speaker but he requested that a hospital be erected to offer free medical and surgical service to the poor of chile and a trust fund established to insure its operation for many years the hospital construction has started and we are here now to dedicate it we hope doc savage will appear ham stepped forward indicated that he wished to address the crowd and the chilean orator stepped back politely i have an unpleasant duty to perform ham said in clear perfect spanish you good people have all heard that doc savage is one of those scarce individuals a genuinely modest man it embarrasses him to play the hero in public for that reason he will not appear on this platform today a disappointed murmur arose from the crowd as they understood they were not to glimpse the famous man of bronze look ham monk snapped over there by the hospital corner monks words impinged against the microphones and all of the two hundred thousand or so people present must have heard the ejaculation countless necks craned eyes seeking the corner of the hospital building a girl tall and exquisitely beautiful with hair the hue of mahogany was struggling with several swarthy broadfaced men its rae stanley ham barked monk was already lumbering across the speaking rostrum holding the box containing his pig over his head with both hands ham leaped after the hairy chemist they hammered heels down the rostrum steps monk put his head down hunched his shoulders and hit the crowd like a torpedo ham trod his wake fending off chileans who resented being shoved and showed it by lustily swinging their fists hands suddenly seized hams ankles and jerked he went down an avalanche of moonfaced stocky men piled up on the lawyer hey monk ham howled monk spun and saw what was happening he lowered his pig case carefully then leaped into the fight emitting a bawling roar monk was ordinarily quiet but his fights were howling bedlams monks hirsute hands clamped on the necks of two of hams assailants and banged their heads together the pair became magically limp their arms and legs hanging like strings ham managed to sit up his sword cane whipping about glinted like a sliver of solidified sunlight the steel leaped at a brown man the man threw himself madly backward but saw he was going to be too late his eyes protruded and a scream ripped past his teeth mentally he could feel that glittering steel blade already fixed in his pumping heart ham turned the blade aside however doc savage and his men had a policy of never directly taking human life the blade merely opened a a small gash in the squat mans shoulder but a surprising thing happened his eyes closed slowly and his arms dropped to his sides the man seemed to go to sleep on his feet he fell heavily blindly to the ground the tip of hams sword cane was covered with a drug a tiny quantity of which in a wound was sufficient to produce instant unconsciousness the dark attackers cursed viciously in their native tongue and rattled orders at each other monk and ham spoke many languages and could recognize others tibetans ham snapped monk opened his mouth to make some reply there was a sharp report not unlike a handclap monk closed his mouth and a vacant expression came into his eyes his legs hinged at the knees a tibetan had struck him from behind with a heavy revolver ham staring at the fallen monk saw a gun clubbing for his own head he tried to dodge but too late and cartwheels of colored fire spun in his eyeballs as the weapon landed ham sank in what seemed like a pleasantly warm sea of black ink the tibetans gathered up monk ham and their own unconscious companions they even took the case holding the pig habeas corpus then they moved through the crowd their menacing guns opened a path at the corner of the hospital building the seizure of pretty rae stanley had been effected as thoroughly as had the downfall of monk and ham the young woman apparently had no weapon except her small fists and the sharp toes of her slippers but she managed to draw several roars of pain from her assailants before they overpowered her saturday loo was in personal charge of the gang you were warned to stay away from here he told the girl angrily it is a foolish bird which pecks the friendly cat tell your men to take their filthy hands off me snapped the young woman saturday loo favored her with a vicious smile and accused her you came here to warn doc savage instead of replying rae stanley kicked her captors on the shins they made gobbling sounds which were tibetan exclamations of pain come saturday loo ordered bring the shetiger drawing the rope from under his gaudy poncho saturday loo looped it over the girls arms flourishing revolvers in a threatening manner the tibetans made for the outskirts of the throng with their prisoner it chanced that their course led them directly toward an antofagasta policeman the officer confronted them que hay he barked what is the matter saturday loo did not attempt to palaver he did not even give the officer a chance to get out of their path with murderous intent the tibetan leader leveled his revolver the spanish race is one quick to show emotion but it was doubtful if a son of castile ever changed expression quicker than did that chilean policeman he was looking at death his eyes glazed and his sagging jaw made his mouth a round hole no senor he screamed but saturday loo only leered and tightened his finger on the trigger chapter the bronze man saturday loo never did quite comprehend what happened next he remembered a weird trilling sound which he first heard at that instant however he remembered that to the last minute of his life it was uncanny that sound it defied description except that it might have been the song of some fantastic jungle bird or the sound of a wind filtering among the ice pinnacles of a polar waste most incredible of all though was the way the note seemed to come from everywhere and yet nowhere more than one aymaran indian onlooker discussed what next occurred over his camp fire of yareta when he returned to his andean retreat a few imaginative souls maintained that a great condor dropped from the sky and hit the earth with a terrific explosion and that it magically became the figure of a giant man of bronze but the aymarans are a race addicted to concocting myths they were right about the coming of the mighty man of bronze but he did not drop from the sky he came from the crowd with a swiftness which almost defied the eye the weird trilling which had sounded was part of doc savage a small unconscious thing which he did in moments of stress sometimes the note came before a stroke of action and often it meant that he was puzzled always it signified the presence of the giant man of bronze doc savages hands had tendons nearly as thick as an ordinary mans fingers one of these hands clamped upon saturday loos gun wrist pain caused saturday loo to fire the revolver its ear splitting roar was what led the aymarans to think an explosion had materialized the bronze man from a condor saturday loo dropped the revolver and clawed out his very signal pistol but he did not fire it he seemed to remember the horror which it would summon the mysterious blue meteor he let the signal gun fall not wishing to bring the blue meteor while he was himself present then saturday loo saw the bronze mans eyes he tried to recoil for there was something about the orbs that made his hair want to stand on end the eyes bore a resemblance to pools of flake gold being swirled by tiny unending whirlwinds the other tibetans leaped to the aid of their chief one struck down with a pistol barrel the policeman whose life doc had saved the others sprang at doc what occurred now was something else of which aymaran indians talked around andean camp fires they told of the fabulous giant of bronze who overpowered with his bare hands almost a dozen heavily armed men they discussed how the great man of metal shifted here and there so swiftly that he could hardly be seen striking great blows with his fists saturday loo was among the first to go down pretty rae stanley managed to twist her arms out of the poorly tied ropes which held them she landed an uppercut on a tibetans jaw her punch was potent the man staggered hands pawing foolishly at the air another brown man swung his gun muzzle toward the young woman there was not the slightest doubt but that he intended to shoot her doc savages weird golden eyes apparently kept track of everything even in the heated combat he saw the tibetans intention to kill the girl the bronze man veered over and his fist drifting out with an eyedefying speed seemed to caress the chin of the tibetan there was a distinctly audible crunch and the mans jaw slewed around almost under an ear he dropped doc grasped the girls arm and turned her away from the fight get clear he said and shoved her into the crowd the bronze mans voice was as amazing as his appearance a tone of vitality and controlled power a cyclonic nemesis doc descended upon such tibetans as were still on their feet swarthy sons of the himalayas dropped in succession until not one remained erect doc towering head and shoulders above the crowd searched for the girl and located her mahoganytressed head a hundred feet distant for the time being she was safe doc savage now waded into the crowd he presented a striking figure as he made a path for himself the crowd thickened ahead of doc an excited milling started doc swung sharply to the left he reached one of the posts which supported one of the loudspeakers of the publicaddress system he climbed to the top of this doc savage had seen the other group of tibetans seize his two men monk and ham he had been watching proceedings from an upper window of the partially finished hospital when this excitement started doc had been sincere in his intention not to show himself at the hospital dedication for it was true that the one thing he disliked was playing the public hero he had sent ham to make apologies doc had come to remain in the background because he wanted to be present when the hospital construction got its final impetus that hospital would save the lives of many people in the course of its existence and such projects were close to docs heart because the young womans captors had been handiest doc had employed his hand first against them very little time had elapsed monk and ham could hardly yet have been carried away from the top of the loud speaker support doc soon discovered them the tibetans were carrying monk ham and their own senseless comrades toward rows of parked cars the crowd was between doc and the gang to work through that pond of humanity would take time even for docs prodigious strength conductors of the publicaddress system were telephone wire probably originally intended for use in the andes where storms are terrific and snowfall great the wire was of a heavy gauge the metal strands would hold docs weight he glided outward over the throng most tightwire artists use long balancing poles only a few highly expert maintain equilibrium by manipulating their arms doc savage however used his arms hardly at all which showed remarkable skill the throng ceased its milling in a few seconds almost all eyes were upon the bronze giant who moved so easily upon the wires overhead doc reached the edge of the crowd the distance to the ground was a drop which most men would have balked at taking doc took it easily enormous leg sinews absorbing the jar he ran for the parked cars doubling low and traveling swiftly he could hear the cursing of the captors of monk and ham doc understood their language the tibetans were hunting a car which was not locked doc had a plan he kept moving at tremendous speed endeavoring to get ahead of his quarry car thieves operated in antofagasta just as they did in kansas city or denver the majority of these parked cars were probably locked the tibetans would have trouble finding a conveyance doc angled to the left and due to his great speed got ahead of the gang his eyes roved and soon found the type of car which he wanted one with an extremely large trunk on the rear it was an open phaeton most machines in these tropic lands were of the open variety doc made a mental note of the license number in case the car met destruction in the plan which was contemplated he intended to reimburse the owner for its full value the bronze man went to the trunk it was locked he caught the fastener tugged and there was a snapping sound as it broke the trunk held dried llama hides old ponchos fishing tackle and a tent doc lifted the stuff and dumped it in the handiest adjacent car then he ran around in front the phaeton was secured with a lock which controlled not only the ignition but the gear shift as well doc went to work upon it with a semiflexible bit of steel hardly larger than a needle which he took from a seam in his vest doc was a wizard with locks as with countless other things within a few moments he had the motor running he whipped around to the rear of the car inserted himself in the trunk lowered the lid and waited chapter the blue glare the mutter of the car motor was the bait in the trap that doc had set he hoped the tibetans would be drawn by the sound it was not a vain hope for soon running feet spatted the gunbaked ground a jar and a squeak from the springs indicated some one had leaped upon the running board a voice barked in tibetan our ancestors are smiling upon us here is a car ready and running who among you can drive i can said a voice then take the wheel o gifted one ordered the leader place the two prisoners in the rear seat and retain tight holds upon them what is in that box from which grunting sounds come a pig o master a pig truly the things white men do are beyond understanding but bring the pig along it may be of a great deal more importance than any of us think another tibetan muttered a wise man does not carry a musk deer which he has shot in the forbidden forest aye another agreed why take the two prisoners you talk too much offspring of a wild donkey growled their leader the masters orders were that they were to be taken prisoners but not slain hurry fools load our wounded also this settled the argument in getting under way the car seemed to shake itself and spring into the air it careened over ruts skidded onto the road and took itself away amid a great roaring and rattling raising the trunk lid slightly doc savage got an idea of the route the car seemed to be headed for a thinly settled hill district near the city doc lowered the lid satisfied back among the parked cars he could have rescued his two men in passing up that chance he had been adhering to a deliberate plan desiring to learn what was behind the trouble doc was seeking to trick the tibetans into taking him with them he wanted to get his hands on their chief me was curious to know what was back of the trouble the headlong rush of the car slackened after a time and it pitched over bumps boulders gnashing at the under side of the chassis habeas corpus the pig was squealing disgustedly in the car the phaeton turned several times it seemed to be following a narrow lane then it stopped the engine became silent habeas corpus promptly stopped squealing it is said that the wisest fox has the deepest den one of the tibetans remarked complacently this retreat of ours is the equivalent of a deep den true words agreed the leader we will carry the two yankees up to our retreat i note that our ancestors who see all actions have favored us with a trunk on the back of the car look in it my sons see if it does not hold something of which we may fashion a sling the more easily to carry our captives doc savage heard a man walk around the car hands settled upon the trunk lid and lifted it the tibetan who opened the trunk was a squat fellow who thanks to a tibetan national custom of consuming thirty to fifty cups of buttered tea a day was extremely fat he did not look like a man who had received many great shocks but he got one now doc savages metallic hands fixed on the fellow one set of fingers encircling his neck the others covering his mouth the bronze digits sank in the tibetans soft flesh until they threatened to become lost to view the agony of that awful clutch completely paralyzed the tibetan not only was he unable to cry out but his limbs trembled as if palsied retaining a grip on the fellow doc savage slid out of the trunk unfortunately he was discovered the devil man of bronze a tibetan shrieked the other tibetans engaged in hauling monk and ham out of the car whirled and stared they still wore their poncho disguises not needing their guns they had holstered them under the flowing ponchos they clawed frantically for the weapons long before the first gun could be drawn however doc savage flung his prisoner at the tibetans the human projectile hit two men squarely and with terrific force these men carried down a third as they fell only two men remained on their feet dancing away they sought to draw their guns they grossly underestimated docs speed blinding blows from great fists dropped them in feebly squirming heaps it had happened with explosive suddenness snapping fingers could hardly have kept pace with the blows which rendered the men senseless with gusto doc gave further attention to the men squirming on the ground he swooped upon each in succession fists driving short terrific punches in each case he struck just hard enough to produce ten or fifteen minutes of unconsciousness something his vast knowledge of surgery enabled him to do it was at surgery that doc savage was skilled above all things the worlds masters in that profession crossed oceans and continents to look on when the man of bronze gave ills periodic demonstrations of newly discovered technique when the last tibetan was limpmuscled and senseless doc turned to the car monk sprawled half out of the door motionless and ham was behind him unmoving draped across the pigs carrying case also lying in the car were the tibetans who had been victims of monk and ham these had not recovered consciousness and had been dumped carelessly on the floor boards by their fellows doc hauled monk and ham out his nostrils caught an odor which told him why the chemist and the lawyer were so limp it was chloroform smell and the handkerchief by which the stuff had been applied lay on the floorboards of the car doc held monks furry wrist then hams fineskinned one in both he found a pulse they should awaken eventually unharmed doc studied ills surroundings the car had stopped in a bleak valley the rocky slopes of which slanted up steeply on either side scattered among the rocks were thorny desert shrubs nowhere was there discernible as much as a blade of grass perhaps three hundred yards distant clinging high on the valley walls was a small box of a house the roof was of brightred tile to one side of the structure a stone pen held several llamas these woolly beasts heads held high and facing the valley floor were not unlike humpless camels a narrow path angled to the house there was no other habitation near this then must have been the destination of the tibetans doc savage strode toward the habitation the bronze man did not follow the path for that would invite lead from any rifleman who might be lurking in the house boulders were plentiful on the slope he kept behind them veering slightly he approached the house from the side opposite the llama pen he did not want the longnecked sheeplike beasts to betray his presence by staring inquisitively windows of south american homes are usually fitted with stout iron bars after the fashion of jails in the united states but this dwelling being situated in a remote region was an exception the windows were unbarred moreover they boasted no glass being simply square holes in the walls doc whipped silently across the nearest sill he sank to all fours on the floor and crouched there a twohour ritual of exercise which doc savage had taken daily since childhood included not only muscular development but also work with sound waves above and below the frequencies audible to a normal ear which had equipped him to hear sounds that escaped other ears also among the exercising devices was an array of small vials containing various odors by identifying these and concentrating intently on the act the bronze man had perfected his olfactory senses to an abnormal degree just as a hunting dog can test a brush pile and tell whether there is game inside so did docs superior senses inform him that the house was empty he went through the rooms rapidly searching he found a number of things of interest for instance there was a box holding a churn lumps of yak butter and tea leaves this was equipment for making the buttered tea to which tibetans are addicted in a corner suitcases were heaped all of these looked new they were plastered with steamship labels these according to custom were dated doc noted the dates thereby learning that the tibetans had arrived from their native land only a few days before doc found nothing pointing to the identity of the chief of the tibetans nor did he find anything which clarified the mystery back of their actions faint sounds a weak shout and squealing noises came to docs ears he vaulted outdoors through the window it was monk who had shouted the homely chemist had recovered from the stupefying chloroform and had freed the pig he was working over ham even as doc watched ham got shakily to his feet the lawyer looked around then stumbled to the car and fumbled inside even at that distance doc knew the barrister was seeking his sword cane ham was lost without the weapon suddenly docs eyes switched to the right far away on a mountain top two miles at least he had caught a movement the air was clear and docs eyes were sharp he distinguished a man the fellow must have been watching the place from the distant mans hand a puff of smoke jumped a dot of blue fire climbed into the sky a very signal pistol had been fired docs weird trilling note came into being vague flaunting description the eerie sound ran up and down the musical scale then ebbed into nothingness doc stared steadily into the west the sky in answer to that rocket signal it seemed had taken on a weird faint blue color this was not the blue of infinite stellar space but more like the arc of an electric welding torch the fantastic radiance grew steadily brighter doc savage brought an arm in front of his face for the glitter was becoming blinding a whistling noise reached his ears very faint at first it grew slowly louder beyond a doubt the piping wail was accompanying the steadily intensifying blue glare there was a devilish quality in the whistling note it seemed to cut at the eardrums with razor sharpness it actually caused docs head to ache down on the valley floor monk and ham were facing the west they had arms thrown across their faces it would have been easier to stare nakedeyed into the incandescent orb of the sun than to look at this weird phenomenon doc savage lifted his voice in a call to monk and ham ўget under cover they did not hear him due to the deafening whistle from the western heavens doc picked up a weatherrounded rock the size of a baseball and hurled it the rock did not carry all the distance but it collided with boulders and started a small avalanche monk and ham heard the rattle of rock they reacted as doc thought they would they looked up and saw the bronze man doc gestured with an arm monk and ham rapidly mounted the opposite side of the canyon the bronze man began to climb his own side of the defile he mounted with every ounce of speed that he could muster at the same lime he kept behind the boulders his leaps were prodigious and very seldom did he show himself reaching the top of the hill he continued his wild progress down the other side he did not look back but gave all of his attention to where he was going finally selecting a crevice between two housesized boulders he dropped in he waited there motionless the whistling had grown infinitely louder the horrible shriek of it was unlike anything doc had ever heard this phantasm out of the western skies whatever it was seemed to be coming down the valley just above the floor its noise mounted and mounted until its scream made awful agony in his eardrums a few yards from doc a harmless snake had been sunning itself on a rock but now the reptile was behaving strangely under the influence of the titanic whistle and the tremendous blue glare it was twisting writhing biting itself repeatedly then like the snap of a whip the uncanny blue transient from the sky was gone it receded dimming its unearthly blue glitter and sucking away its weirdly earhurting whistle springing erect doc savage sought to stare after the thing but the blue glare defeated him he could not tell what was making the glittering azure luster doc glided back over the hill twice he stumbled and fell once he found himself veering off to one side this seemed to worry the bronze giant whose powers were usually dependable it was as if the whistling blue thing had done something to him had dulled his senses once over the hill he searched with his eyes for monk and ham the two were not in sight he went on and came to the valley floor where the car stood with the unconscious tibetans scattered about none of these had as yet awakened from the effects of docs fists or the chemical on hams sword cane monk doc called there was no answer the bronze man climbed the opposite side of the valley freshly overturned rocks showed him the route monk and ham had taken in their flight ham docs powerful voice rattled in echoes off the valley walls after the echoes there was only quiet except for the ringing effect which persisted in tortured eardrums a result of the piercing noise of the blue visitant hey you fellows doc boomed whats wrong then doc saw the pig habeas corpus the pig had legs like a dog and ears so large that they could nearly double for wings and ordinarily was quite comical to look at but there was something hideously wrong with it now doc called softly and the pig did not come it was the first time habeas had ever failed to respond the pig stood on rigid legs its eyes ears tail nothing moved doc reached down to touch the animal the pig pitched straight forward in flight it ran blindly and with a weirdly erratic movement chancing to be headed for a rock the small porker did not turn aside but smashed at full speed into the stone then it whirled and charged doc and when he stepped aside went senselessly on and hit another boulder monk ham doc yelled loudly he mounted on up the valley slope and called again for the chemist and the lawyer then he heard it the sound there was something in it some quality that curdled the blood it was mansound hut it was not articulated interrupted or otherwise possessed of syllables it was just a product of vocal cords doc did not voice names again but advanced quietly he found monk and ham they were horrible doc savage mighty man of bronze had schooled himself until few things really appalled him to a point beyond acceptance but there had been a few instances when he had felt utter horror one long ago was when he learned his own father had been murdered he had that same awful sensation now monk and ram were men without brains not however that there had been a physical operation but the evidence of an entirely dormant mentality was apparent the instant doc saw them they stood perfectly motionless no muscle stirring and when doc spoke they plunged away pitifully like wild creatures in flight when they crashed into rocks they seemed to feel no pain and at the same time they emitted those hideous unarticulated sounds which doc had first heard it was ham who was the most unnerving to watch possibly because of his intellectual appearance he smashed blindly facefirst into a boulder and dropped back making low bleating sounds pain from his hurt scarlet streams began to creep down his face and dangle off his lips and chin like red yarns seemed to affect him not in the least bit gibbering he rushed madly at doc his arms were thrust straight out but he tried to strike no blow doc caught him they struggled in his embrace all of docs men were experts at wrestling and jujutsu the bronze man having taught them and in the teaching he had come to know exactly how much strength each of his five aides possessed ham now showed a far greater muscular power than doc knew was his normal strength stop it doc rapped if he comprehended the weirdly afflicted lawyer gave no heed there was no intelligence to his assault however his blows were blind he tried to bite like an animal and emitted snarlings and hissings to doc who had seen the astute lawyer comprehend and expound the most complex legal problems the effect was gruesome in the extreme suddenly ham quieted there had been no reason for his attack there was equally no reason for its ending he became still and mute and in his eyes was an absolute lack of expression while his lips crimsonstreaked hung slack and vacant ham doc said sharply the lawyer picked foolishly at his ears as if he had heard sound for the first time and thought it was something wrong with that part of his head doc touched him ham struck savagely at the spot which had been touched and seemed to show no pain from the effects of his own blow which broke skin and started scarlet droplets running reaching out doc placed a finger tip gently against the lawyers eye there was no automatic reaction of drooping lids and after the contact between finger and eyeball ham made a convulsive gesture and might have torn his own eye out except that doc gripped his arms and held them immovable brain functioning suspended doc said slowly ham cackled giddy unintelligible sounds something hideous something totally new on the face of the earth had happened to monk and ham with the passage of the screaming blue visitor of the skies doc went back to the car k a fender tool box he found wire towing rope and tire tape with these articles he managed to secure ham monk and all of the tibetans it was apparent as one of the tibetans sat up that they also were now men unguided by brains doc completed the binding with the pig habeas corpus he loaded all in the car dropping behind the wheel he sent the machine hurtling in the direction of antofagasta the whistling blue luminary had caused the grisly affliction which gripped docs cargo that was certain doc himself had escaped a like fate simply because he had crossed over the hill and had been farther from the weird thing than had the others at no time while it was close had its unearthly blue glitter shone directly upon him doc drove fast and watched the road chapter terrors hand the road mounted numerous hills from the tops of some of these it was possible to see the faroff hospital distance made the crowd there look like varicolored grains of sand the throng had not yet dispersed a few persons had noticed the weird blue glare in the western sky even above the mumbling noise of the crowd some had caught the shrill whistle faint though distance made it which accompanied the iridescent display a meteor muttered a man but no said another whoever saw a meteor of that blue color si si it is strange for a meteor the light of it blinds the eye even at this distance and did you hear the terrible sound it made one individual a young woman was showing no interest in these discussions she was working her way out of the crowd casting nervous glances about her brown eyes were pools of fear rae stanley had deemed it safer to remain in the crowd accordingly she had seated herself on a pile of lumber in the middle of the throng and waited she had seen her captors whom doc had overpowered regain their senses and flee from the vicinity rae stanley nearing the outskirts of the crowd lifted on tiptoe to look about for a moment it seemed as if she would scream she turned to flee but she was too late a man stepped forward swiftly and grasped her arm not arf glad t see me are you he asked his manner was preoccupied and he glanced frequently toward the hills where the blue glare had appeared shrops the girl gasped hi been watchin you shrops told her harshly rae stanley gave him a stare of loathing and said nothing bloomin well tried t warn the bronze bloke didnt you shrops asked sarcastically you ran when you saw me watchin you talk to that gorilla of a mug and the one with the black cane yes i did the girl retorted defiantly i overheard you making your plans last night owd you get out of your room she did not answer shrops eyed the distant hills as if puzzled then scowled at the girl dont you recollect what hi can do by way of payin you back fer this little trick suppose i send a cable t tibet at the words the girl whitened visibly her lips tightened and her eyes showed more horror than at any previous time ithoughtof that she said each word seeming a torture hi oughta keep my promise but if you dont pull any more foolishness hi may let you off come on the cockney tapped a coat pocket meaningly a bulge under the cloth hinted strongly at a gun the young woman instead of complying glanced about as if seeking a policeman hill blow your pretty ead off if you let out a beller shrops warned dont think hive got any qualms about shootin a bloomin woman cause hi aint youre comin with me the girl made no move to obey she seemed entirely desperate ready to risk getting shot rather than accompany the cockney shrops realized her state of mind inside his coat pocket his gun cocked with a distinct click dont be a little fool he gritted hill send that cable to tibet sure after shootin you play my game and youll come out ahead the girl seemed to be fighting a terrific battle with herself debating whether to follow shrops or not her face showed loathing for the cockney but also apprehension of some awful vengeance above the threat to shoot her which he apparently had power to wreak a vengeance obviously connected with his repeated threat to send a cable to distant tibet youyou the girl choked hoarsely but she accompanied the cockney the cockney and rae stanley turned up some thirty minutes later at a small roadside posada a few miles from the city the posada was a structure of mud and stone uninviting to the eye there was no bar for dispensing drinkables within and there had never been a shooting stabbing or like affray on the premises outwardly this roadside tavern was quite decorous actually the place was one of the most notorious thief harbors in chile but criminals tarrying there conducted themselves with sedateness and were accordingly free of police notice the proprietor charged skyhigh rates and allowed no rowdyism several tibetans loafing about the inn stuck out their tongues as far as they would go the instant they sighted shrops shrops and rae did not seem to consider this tongue protruding performance anything unusual these tibetans came from a tribe near the mongolian border a region where the customary greeting is the sticking out of the tongue did some o you tonguehangin blokes ave somethin to do with that blue meteor appearin shrops demanded no master one replied shrops seemed greatly worried at this eres opin somebody comes around that does know why it showed itself he growled the thing wasnt to appear at all saturday loo now stumbled from the posada there was a purple smear as dark as an ink blot on his jaw where docs fist had landed from his manner he did not seem even yet to have recovered fully from his illfavored battle with the bronze giant other tibetans showed themselves they were the fellows who with saturday loo had attempted to seize the girl and who had fallen victims of doc savages might you managed t accomplish somethin anyway shrops said sarcastically you got your bloomin selves back out ere safely he darkened with rage at the memory of how doc savage had vanquished saturday loo and nearly a dozen other tibetans the lowly dog who has never seen a lion is prone to make the mistake of biting one saturday loo murmured is that a slam at me for sickin you on the bronze bloke shrops snarled a thousand pardons o master saturday loo mumbled hastily i meant not to belittle you shrops growled youd better not get sassy and if you ears why that blue meteor appeared hi wants to know about it right off i hope the blue meteor has turned against you snapped rae stanley entering the conversation hive arf a mind to scrag you my beauty shrops yelled at her and yanked a revolver from his pocket the girl blanched realizing she had pushed the cockney a trifle too far the fellow was almost distraught over the blue glow which he had seen in the sky and his temper accordingly short saturday loo wheeled and fled unashamedly you pipe down or youll get it plenty shrops snarled at the girl walk to your bloomin room i wanta see how you got out they made their way to a small dark chamber in the rear the single small window of this was crisscrossed with metal bars shrops tested the bars and seemed surprised to find them firm he continued his search and his attention came finally to the door so you pulled the pins out of the hinges he growled ўwell for that hill just post a guard outside shrops had hardly made certain the girl was a prisoner and returned to the front room when a car drove up springing from the machine the newcomer raced to shrops ave you got some dope on why the blue meteor showed up shrops demanded no master shouted the man i am he who was sent to destroy the plane of the bronze devil dont hi know it shrops said sarcastically if you cant explain why the blue meteor appeared whats ailin you whats appened i was almost killed the tibetan yelled calm you bloody swine shrops snapped did you destroy the plane i did said the tibetan but a very tall skeleton of a man chased me he would have caught me except that i had waiting nearby the car which i stole last night blimme but you destroyed the plane i did o master it was a metal plane but i punched holes in the fuel tanks so that gasoline ran out then i applied a match the manmade bird was entirely consumed shrops made a growling noise of satisfaction with is plane out of commission doc savage will ave to start ome by boat the logical tub fer im is the chilean senorita the chilean senorita the tibetan asked puzzled what boat is that o master the name chilean senorita was painted on er bows an stern only last night shrops explained dryly this dumb one still does not comprehend hi mean that the bloomin boat is the same one you came to these shores on ah now my ignorance disappears but do you think doc savage will now take passage on this newly named chilean senorita o master there aint nothin t make the bronze bloke suspicious leered shrops it aint unusual for the crew of a steamer in the pacific t be chinese or such anyway the boat as got papers showin shes a coastwise tub shes a bloomin fast scow that last moren anythin will persuade this doc savage t take er it was perhaps ten minutes later when another tibetan arrived at the roadside posada he was wildeyed with excitement and breathing rapidly from a long run i bring bad news o master he gulped wot shrops demanded is it about the blue meteor the bronze man exclaimed the excited tibetan he concealed himself in a trunk on the rear of the car which carried the two prisoners in the valley he leaped from the trunk it shames me to admit it but he overpowered those in the car without great labor didnt you try t elp shrops growled this one was but the lookout stationed on a distant hill o master the other explained i could not reach the scene but i did the next best thing i summoned the blue meteor so thats why the bloody thing showed itself the blue meteor took a course down the valley but the bronze mans ancestors were watching over him and he got far enough away to evade its power said the tibetan weres the bronze bloke now the last i saw of his unworthy person he had loaded his two men and my own countrymen into the car and headed toward town shrops began to curse he swore in tibetan until he evidently used up all of the profane words of that tongue that he knew then launched into limehouse expletives this bronze bloke is a bloomin lot worse customer than hi thought he snarled when he could speak with a trace of calmness the cockney glowered for a time thinking then muttering to himself he went outdoors and called loudly for a car him gonna go see doc savage in person he growled hive got a neat plan up my sleeve chapter the cockney visitor the taberna frio downtown antofagasta hotel which doc savage had made his headquarters was not the most pretentious structure in town however its walls were thick its rooms cool and the chambers boasted certain comforts much to be desired in this blistering clime namely running ice water and electric fans an alley gave access to a service entrance in the rear doc savage arriving with his cargo of awfully afflicted men from the valley over which the blue horror had passed drove the car up to this back door carrying the tightly bound forms of monk and ham over his mighty shoulders doc mounted the stairs he used the rear stairway and it chanced that no one saw him the bronze man shoved open the door of the suite of rooms occupied by himself and his men and stalked inside with his pitiful burdens two men occupying the living room leaped to their feet and stared holy cow gulped one of the pair in a voice which resembled the roaring of a disgruntled lion in its den the speaker was tall angular and would weigh in the neighborhood of two hundred and fifty pounds large as his frame was however it was somewhat stunted by the size of his fists the fists blocked would make cubes of bone and gristle larger than many anothers head he had a face which was very long and which bore an expression of profound gloom he looked as if he were contemplating attending a funeral the man with the fists and the gloom was renny colonel john renwick an engineer whose work was known on many continents and a gentleman whose boast was that he could knock the panel out of any wooden door with either fist whats happened doc demanded the man beside renny this latter individual was not tall and only fairly set up judging by his pallid complexion his past life had been spent where there was not enough sunlight he had an astoundingly high forehead he was long tom major thomas j roberts he was far from being the weakling he appeared and his forte was electricity a wizard of the juice men of his profession called him renny and long tom were two more of the group of five who worked with doc savage doc carried his burden into a bedroom my instruments he said sharply renny and long tom both dived into an adjacent room and came back hearing metal cases which held docs hospitalization apparatus the equipment ranged from endoscopes for scrutinizing the lungs to complete skiagraphy apparatus for surveying the various parts of the body by x ray with the instruments doc went to work upon monk and ham the bronze man was trying to ascertain what manner of spell the dazzling sky transient had cast upon his aides there is a car at the back door doc told renny and long tom you will find men in it tied securely bring them up will you and monks pig too but do not untie any of them johnny and long tom went out looking puzzled they were soon back carrying the tibetans the puzzled look on their faces had given way to expressions of horror it had dawned upon them that these men had lost the use of their brain cells all of the victims were placed in the inner room johnny and long tom stood by as doc savage went to work they maintained silence for they could see that doc was battling with some profound mystery some culminating horror neither man asked what had happened to monk and ham and the rest although curiosity was consuming them doc was working now and would tell them the story in his own time they knew from experience that the bronze man spoke only when he so desired time dragged some fifteen minutes passing then docs weird trilling came into being the singular sound drifted up and down the range of musical notes for perhaps a fourth part of a minute then sank away as if the walls of the bedroom had absorbed it renny and long tom shifted uneasily aware that the trilling meant something momentous what is it doc long tom asked the nerves and brain centers are in practically a state of suspended animation doc replied they cant use their brains long tom ejaculated exactly they are so much living flesh and bone with no power to think or guide their movements have the brains been destroyed renny demanded in hoarse horror doc did not reply long tom clenched his pale fists and his lips writhed but he could not frame whatever words he was trying to say so great was his emotion they do not respond to restoratives or stimulants doc said at last the bronze man applied hypodermic needles to the bound men after this they became quieter sleeping opiates doc said indicating the hypo needle just living bodies renny muttered his long puritanical face bewildered but what caused it speaking rapidly and using sentences with a descriptive power that would have been envied by a novelist doc told the story he began with the appearance of nervous excited rae stanley at the dedication ceremony and finished with the coming of the fantastic blue screaming mystery of the skies in the valley outside the city but what was the whistling thing that made the blue light and ruined the brains of these men renny asked you have heard exactly what occurred doc replied sounds like some kind of blue meteor said long tom renny went over and inspected the bound men he touched them then he shuddered violently and retreated living dead men he muttered the discussion was interrupted by the thump of excited feet in the hallway the door of the living room burst open the man who entered found it necessary to duck slightly in order to keep his head from colliding with the top of the door frame he was unnaturally tall and so thin that he seemed merely a frame of bones padded with a little gristle his coat resembled a sack hanging over a form of broomsticks no tailor could have fashioned a respectably fitting garment on that bony physique this man was william harper littlejohn former head of the natural science research department of a famous university and one of the greatest living authorities on archaeology and geology dangling from a silver chain affixed to his lapel was a monocle johnny did not look like the type who would condescend to wear a monocle nor was he for the glass was in reality a powerful magnifier an article which he needed in his profession johnny was the fifth member of docs group of five somebody burned your plane doc he barked doc savages bronze countenance did not alter at this news but the tiny whirlwinds which seemed to stir continuously the flakegold of his eyes quickened a little in speed howd it happen johnny he demanded i was servicing the plane for flight back to new york johnny replied there is a shack at the edge of the field where gasoline and tools are stored i was in there heard a roaring looked out and saw the plane blazing it was an allmetal plane renny thumped i know but the fellow must have punched holes in the fuel tank what fellow doc questioned the bird i saw running away the gaunt johnny explained fingering his magnifying monocle he was a squat monkey i chased him but he had a car waiting and got away johnny now changed his position slightly and one of the array of securely bound men came into his range of vision for crying out loud he gasped whats going on here without waiting for an answer johnny leaped into the other room he grasped the forms of monk and ham as if to shake them into some semblance of normalcy he listened to the sounds they made horrible rattling howls as vocal cords simply fluttered with the income and outgo of breath at times these sounds resembled the baying noises made by bloodhounds he studied the expressions of consummate vacancy on their countenances he became very pale what happened to them he asked hoarsely their brains have stopped functioning completely doc told him johnny dragged his tongue over dry lips he mopped a sudden sheen of perspiration from his forehead i never heard of such a thing he muttered nor has any one else doc replied its mysterious and without exaggerating in the slightest its the most horrible thing we have ever been up against johnny nodded slowly stiffly it attacks the brain and not the body somehow or other that to me makes it a lot worse what caused it doc went back to to the initial appearance of rae stanley and told the story the blue whistling projectile which passed over the valley simply rendered their brains completely dormant he finished it did not nail me because i managed to get over the hill and farther away johnny fingered his monocle then used it to indicate one of the tibetans the fellow who burned our plane belonged to the same race as that man he said but why should anybody destroy our plane renny grumbled knotting and unknotting his huge fists there are two logical reasons doc told him some one either wants us to stay here in chile or desires us to take another method of transportation northward a steamer is the logical second choice renny hazarded doc strode to the telephone spoke briefly to the office of a travel agency then replaced the instrument on its stand the next northbound boat with passenger accommodations available is a small but fast tramp steamer named the chilean senorita he explained renny you investigate the chilean senorita the cockney shrops would have been astounded to hear this for he had thought his plan to lead doc to book passage on the chilean senorita to be quite clever and beyond suspicion renny departed to investigate the chilean senorita long tom doc said heres a job for you shoot it the electrical wizard replied i want you to telephone the new york headquarters of the american society of physical scientists doc directed better make the call from the local phone company office its only a few blocks away and you can get quicker service by talking to the wire chiefs there what am i to check up on long tom asked find out where professor elmont stanley is at the present time doc directed learn if there is anything shady in professor stanleys record also learn what you can about his daughter rae who is professor stanley an astronomer one of the most skilled men in the world in telling the composition of planetoids ive never met him personally but have read his scientific works you mean that hes a guy who makes a business of telling what kind of stuff the stars are made out of that is it where does he come in on this long tom questioned it was his daughter rae stanley who accosted monk and ham both long tom and johnny looked greatly surprised at this did you know the girl by sight long tom questioned doc shook his head never saw her before by way of answering the questions doc drew a pair of small powerful binoculars from a coat pocket indicated them then replaced them no more was needed to tell long tom and johnny how he had learned raes identity doc was an expert lip reader watching the attractive girl when she accosted monk and ham doc probably had understood every word she had said she told monk and ham that her father was professor stanley doc explained looking vastly enlightened long tom took his departure headed for the phone office to employ a longdistance telephone to check on professor stanley doc continued his examination of monk and ham he administered more restoratives and concoctions calculated to stimulate normal brain activity but results were nil no known treatment had the slightest effect on their mental condition the phone jangled gaunt johnny went to the instrument a man named john mark shrops to see you he advised doc doc savage was entirely motionless for several seconds then he said shrops is the name of the man who frightened the girl away from monk and ham johnny stared at his giant chief and began how the girl cried out his name when she saw him doc explained the guy has got nerve coming here tell them to send mr shrops up doc said grimly john mark shrops arrived some seconds later the cockneys flashy clothing was immaculate and his face had never been ruddier he showed large white teeth in an expansive smile not arf bad o you t let me come hup he said effusively a lot o toffs as famous as you wouldnt see a stranger doc nodded politely but did not offer to take the hand which shrops extended in order that the gesture might not he construed as impolite however he made a pretense of wiping chemicals off his fingers what can i do for you he asked a bloomin lot if you will shrops said hive eard that you make a business o settlin other peoples troubles ave i been hearin the truth possibly doc admitted are you in trouble in plenty o it muttered shrops but it aint me alone theres a lot more poor devils sufferin suppose you speak more concretely doc requested ave you ever eard of mogwei queried shrops mogwei doc repeated as if he had not caught the name mogwei the devilfaced one shrops elaborated never heard of him doc replied es a bad un muttered shrops es fixed thousands of poor devils but the world aint card of it because es been workin is deviltry in tibet the world never ears much o what happens over there but the world is gonna ear of mogwei if e aint stomped on just who is mogwei doc queried the bloodiest criminal that ever walked the earth and you can take my word for that shrops said earnestly at aint arf either es got the devils own tool in is power nobody knows hexactly what it is but they call it the blue meteor johnny the bony archeologist fingered his magnifying monocle absently striding swiftly to the bedroom door doc opened it and waved an arm does the blue meteor affect its victims in this fashion he asked in an expressionless tone shrops came to the door and looked in he gave every indication of having received a deep shock his hands clenched his jaw dropped and air left his lungs in a horrified rush blimme he gulped mogwei is ere in chile does the blue meteor produce a condition of complete brain inactivity such as this doc demanded shrops nodded solemnly you said it exactly what is the nature of the affliction nobody as any idea shrops muttered do they ever recover sometimes yes sometimes no depends on ow close they was t the bleedin blue meteor doc savage considered for a time you came from tibet to get me to combat this mogwei he queried sharply you ave it right shrops agreed in a way him an emissary o the tibetan government the rightand man o the dalai lama who rules the country sent me and is payin my expenses docs flakegold eyes remained unwaveringly upon shrops he was studying the cockney judging him outwardly the applelike fellow seemed a shallow overdressed dunce the cockney dialect enhanced this impression but underneath doc discerned subtlety and cunning he suspected this cockney was one of the cleverest rogues he had encountered in some time doc was suspicious of the fellow since mere sight of him had driven the girl to flight doc decided to drag the dead cat out in the open who is the girl rae stanley he asked shrops looked properly surprised but came out with a glib explanation shes a young lady who came from tibet on er own ook to get your elp he said this was hardly the reply doc had expected he asked why does she want my help hi avent any idea why is rae stanley scared of you doc persisted promptly shrops explained she knows i came from tibet and she mistakenly thinks mogwei sent me to stop er any one watching docs face would have thought he was believing every word actually he was coming to the realization that he was face to face with one of the smoothest customers he had ever encountered the cockney was so slick that doc was not even sure the fellow was telling falsehoods and doc was an expert at spotting liars why does the tibetan government not send a detachment of soldiers to get this mogwei doc questioned that is the manner in which they usually handle such customers over there no bloke as ever seen mogweis face the cockney replied es like the irishmans flea they cant put ands on im thats why were wantin your elp in tibet doc savage nodded as if a situation such as this was an everyday occurrence and not one worth getting excited over i prefer to think this matter over he said if you will tell me where i may get in touch with you ow long dyou think itll take to make up your mind shrops asked doc glanced at the window the sun was low on the horizon in twenty minutes there would be darkness you can depend on my answer before midnight he told the cockney that aint arf bad govnor smiled shrops hill call for your answer at that hour the applelike little cockney now placed his gray derby at a jaunty angle and departed the taberna frio was not equipped with an elevator so shrops had to walk down the stairs near the bottom of the staircase he gave himself a verbal pat on the back as a schemer him quite a bloke he chuckled chapter the disappearance in tibet doc savage gave john mark shrops sufficient time to get well on his way downstairs then he addressed bony johnny you stay here and watch monk and ham and the others he directed there does not seem to be a thing that can be done for them weve got to find the exact cause of this devilish condition before we can get a cure johnny nodded juggling his monocle doc produced the hypodermic needle which he had employed to quiet the victims earlier use this if they get violent its an opiate and above all do not untie them they must be kept tied for they are men without brains to all intents and purposes doc went to the window eased through and descended by using cracks in the wall for fingertip purchase these cracks were not large nor were they plentiful but they seemed as serviceable as ladder rungs to the remarkable bronze giant a singlestory building was below and he ran across its roof the structures were placed one abutting another for a distance then came what amounted to a narrow vacant lot the span to the next roof was a prodigious leap yet the bronze man took it without unusual effort never had the gigantic muscles in docs great body functioned with greater efficiency at the end of the block he dropped to the sidewalk he went to the corner but did not round it from a pocket doc drew a metal tube which was but little larger than a darning needle it was fitted at one end with an eyepiece he drew the contrivance to a length of nearly two feet telescope fashion and projected it around the corner he looked into the eyepiece the device was an ingenious periscope reflected in its mirrors and magnifying lenses doc could see john mark shrops the cockney was walking down the street away from the taberna frio so swiftly had doc come from the hotel room that shrops had not had time to get out of sight even as doc watched shrops ducked into a recessed door he waited there bobbing his head out frequently turtlewise he was obviously watching the hotel to see whether he was being followed it had not occurred to him that a shadow might now be ahead of him doc waited shrops seemed in no hurry he lighted a cigarette and flipped the match out into the street to use the periscope continuously might draw notice hence doc employed the device only often enough to keep tab on shrops the rest of the time he leaned casually against the wall as if loafing there were few people on the streets such pedestrians as were in sight were ponchoswathed indians inspecting store display windows with the avidity of those who do not come to town often the sun had almost deposited itself behind the pacific feet came clapping down the opposite side of the street it was long tom returning from his visit to the telephone office the electrical wizard would have passed without noting docs presence except for the fact that the bronze mans trilling note suddenly filtered through the twilight although not loud the sound possessed a phenomenal carrying quality it impinged upon long toms ears long tom was clever enough not to betray excitement at the weird note his eyes roved alertly under his hat brim and he located doc when he crossed the street it was done naturally as if he had contemplated that very thing all along the electrical magician joined doc professor stanley went to tibet to investigate a mysterious blue meteor he said grimly doc nodded as if he had expected information of this nature to result from long toms longdistance phone call to new york city professor stanley had headed several expeditions sent to investigate meteors doc told long tom studying the composition of aerolites is his specialty professor stanley has vanished in tibet long tom explained further vanished they were keeping their voices down in order that the lurking shrops might not hear them long tom elaborated the society which sent professor stanley and his daughter to tibet has ceased to hear from them the daughter went along eh yes she was official photographer on the expedition what efforts have been made to locate them the usual sort consular investigations and the like and heres an unusual one doc the scientific society which sent professor stanley to tibet wants you to hunt him doc used his periscope to make sure shrops had not moved but did not comment on long toms last statement the society was preparing to call on you the electrical expert continued when my phone call reached them they thought it quite a coincidence any detailed dope on stanleys disappearance they took a caravan into the desert from lhasa the capital of tibet that was the last any one heard of them they had heard that the blue meteor had hit in the desert yep the society in new york told me a little about that meteor they admitted though that the information was largely rumor it seems that the blue meteor passed over parts of tibet and struck somewhere several years ago fantastic stories came out of tibet about the meteor tales of people whose brains were dead after the thing went by what happened to monk and ham proves the yarns are not so fantastic doc said grimly the superstitious natives claimed the thing was a big blue devil coming to dwell on the earth finished long tom doc employed his periscope again he saw shrops showing signs of moving on ill get more details about this blue meteor story later doc said were getting a line on what happened to monk and ham its something that has to do with the mysterious blue meteor its just about the most weird thing i ever ran into long tom muttered you go back to the hotel doc directed this bird shrops is hiding in a door down the street but hes getting ready to move on when you pass him dont pay him particular attention we dont want him to become alarmed long tom reluctant to lose out on possible excitement began doc i might be of some help if i went along with you can assist johnny in his efforts to revive monk and ham doc replied one of you work on monk the other on ham i showed johnny what resuscitation methods to use two of you will be better than one at that work o k long tom agreed concern for monk and ham overspreading his pallid face listen doc do you think that cockney had something to do with whats happened to monk and ham looks like it doc replied then why dont you grab him hes the kind of a fellow who could not be made to talk doc explained grimly if he knows a cure for the effects of the blue meteor he could not be scared into revealing it our best bet is to trail him and see what can be learned thats logic long tom agreed did renny get back with a report on the chilean senorita not before my departure youd better beat it there goes shrops doc was looking into his periscopic device again long tom strode off shrops swung away from the vicinity at a rapid pace keeping to the shadows he glanced back often hunting for a possible pursuer he used numerous ruses to lose a shadow taking short cuts across lots entering stores and leaving by the rear door and pausing frequently to watch his behavior would have made trailing by ordinary methods an impossibility but docs methods were not prosaic he took to rooftops for the most part negotiating ascents of walls with the ease of a great bronze cat and taking tremendous leaps between buildings in silent batlike fashion long tom although his agility was a bit above the average could not have managed the pace knowing this doc had refused him on his offer of assistance long toms disappointment must have been great love of excitement was one of the main bonds which held long tom and the other four to doc savage they were men who had reached the top in their respective professions and hence no longer obtained a kick from more prosaic business lives the zest of business competition was gone for they no longer had competition possessed of a desire for excitement they found it aplenty in their association with doc savage antofagasta being a modern town had telephones pay booths were installed in hotels and all the drinking places shrops entered a booth took down a receiver and called a number in order to make sure that no one was close enough to overhear what he was saying he faced the glass door speaking from the side of his mouth an electric light spread brilliance in front of the booth this permitted doc using his periscope device from a side window to read lips saturday loo is the bloke hi want t speak wit shrops said into the transmitter evidently the straw boss of the tibetans was not long reaching the other instrument and the cockney asked whats appened since hi left if anythin the apple of a man listened intently elation overspread his face in the form of a grin that threatened to dislodge his cheeks you say the bloody bigfisted un named renny was investigatin the chilean senorita and your boys ad the luck to capture im he seemed to get a confirmation of this from saturday loo not arf bad for us he chortled finally old im you tell your boys if renny gets away hili fix you so your ancestors wont know you you son of a spavined yak hill be right down he started to hang up but did not and listened to more words coming over the phone what am hi comin down for why t give this renny bloke a taste of the bloomin blue meteor maybe thatll persuade doc savage to lose no time goin after this mogwei devil he kept the receiver to his ear for a moment why after we treat renny hill take im to doc savage an say hi found im wanderin in the hills or somewhere hanging up shrops left the booth he headed straight for the steamer chilean senorita doc trailed him the chilean senorita was not large as ocean steamers go but she had lines of beauty and speed the craft was almost a yacht in appearance with black hull white superstructure and much brightly polished brasswork the lifeboats were capped with newlooking covers and a lazy curl of smoke drifted steadily from her rakish funnel she was anchored just inside the breakwater numerous individuals of asiatic extraction moved upon the chilean senoritas decks this was not strange on the face of it for asiatic labor was common on ships plying the pacific trade it was cheaper darkness had almost fallen when john mark shrops reached the water front he produced a flashlight from a pocket and blinked it several times a small boat manned by tibetans put off from the chilean senorita and was rowed to where he stood saturday loo himself occupied the stern sheets so you come from the posada in the country t take personal charge o things on the boat eh shrops asked the moonfaced tibetan you do show good sense about arf the time saturday loo accepted this as a compliment and said even the lowest and most stupid of men have a brain which sometimes functions this seemed to strike shrops as inordinately comical he laughed harshly uproariously hi can tell you a lot of em who aye brains that dont work any more he whooped words of wisdom saturday loo agreed men who saw the blue meteor wheres the bloomin girl rae stanley a canary is safest from the cat while in its cage said saturday loo no doubt in this case the bird greatly desires to be gotten by the cat we left her at the posada o master there is a strong guard thats unkydory shrops admitted is the bloody ooker ready to sail as ready as the barheaded goose of my native land which is always prepared to flee its nest the boat now pulled out to the chilean senorita with shrops holding the position of honor in the stem sheets would you consider the cup of this lowly ones ear a fit receptacle in which to pour your thoughts saturday loo queried meanin you wanta know my plans eh aye master sure hill tell you what my scheme is hive just been to see this doc savage toff an hi fed im a smooth line with just enough truth t make it sound right i gather o master that you told him he was needed to smash mogwei queried saturday loo hi sure did an bless your ancestors you slanteyed scut e took it in like a bear lappin up oney him to go back an get is final word around midnight you think he will take the job of destroying the allfrightful mogwei sure e will aint is life work moppin up on such blokes as mogwei the dory reached the landing stage suspended beside the hull of the chilean senorita john mark shrops and saturday loo mounted to the deck shrops glancing around chuckled twas an appy idea of mine buyin this boat in china an puttin my own crew on er he declared with evil pride that way the whole slew o us could come over without attractin too much attention if doc savage believes your story o master and goes of his own accord to tibet to seek mogwei the boat will be of no great use to us said saturday loo hi wont grudge the money it cost in that case grunted shrops if e dont believe me the chilean senorita may come in andy it is indeed a wise squirrel who does not store all his nuts in one tree saturday loo agreed nuts shrops snorted and burst out in rattling laughter hill bet doc savage is wonderin ow es gonna fix up is nutty friends saturday loo folded his arms in the fashion of the orient his face was entirely expressionless did you not say o greatest one that you were going to use the blue meteor upon the bigfisted man named renny righto shrops agreed him gonna fix im up an send im back to doc savage thatll persuade the bronze toff to light out after mogwei without delay and what of our fair flower you mean the stanley girl well old onto her a while we may need er saturday loo headed for a companionway amidships why did you bring the fair flower along in the first place he asked shrops leered to ave er vamp the bronze man if necessary it is said that wise men are not affected by women this brought a laugh from shrops then there aint no wise men in this appy world chapter blue madness several tibetans gave john mark shrops and saturday loo their tribal form of greeting as the pair went below decks they stuck out their tongues as far as these organs of taste would go saturday loo and shrops found bigfisted renny in a stateroom the chamber was an inside room without portholes and supplied with air piped from the big ventilators protruding from the decks a man could yell his loudest in the cabin and never be heard out on the harbor renny knew this he had tried it it calls for terrific effort to break the links of a handcuff chain which is fastened upon the wrists of the one making the fracturing attempt renny knew this also he had attempted it and succeeded the steel circlets had scraped skin off his wrists deep grooves had been cut in the pads of corded sinew indeed the cuts were almost bone deep crimson was creeping from these cuts renny was lying on his enormous hands to hide the scarlet drippage and to conceal the fact that he had accomplished the almost incredible feat of breaking the shackles shrops eyed renny the engineers size was ordinarily dwarfed by the proportions of his great fists but now he was reposing upon the hands in the white electric light of the cabin renny looked gigantic es sure a whoppin big bloke shrops muttered yet he has but the stature of a youth when beside the bronze man whom he calls leader murmured saturday loo shrops drank in rennys bulk with his eyes for a time then wiped an ooze of sweat off his forehead owd you get im he asked saturday loo renny took it on himself to answer this your brown hyenas had some blind luck he growled and his voice was like the thump and rumble of a distant earthquake saturday loo smirked it is as the bigfisted one says honorable ancestors poured much luck upon the shoulders of one of my men he came upon this man of the fists in the twilight as the bigfisted one prowled our decks my man had an iron bar he swung it well the bigfisted one awakened in this cabin securely handcuffed perhaps saturday loo intended to roll renny over to show the handcuffs possibly he intended to give renny a kick in the ribs by way of celebration at any rate he stepped forward renny heaved up from the floor with blinding speed one huge fist hurled out and met saturday loos head fist and head seemed almost of an equal size saturday loo was knocked backward the entire width of the cabin the shock of hitting the wall expelled breath from his lungs causing him to spout teeth bits of pulped tongue and lips and a spray of scarlet he fell forward upon the floor in the future saturday loos ancestors would have to look closely and long to recognize him blimme squawked shrops and fled he chanced to be near the door so he got out before rennys great mauls of fists could reach him shrops did not even attempt to draw a gun several armed tibetans were in the passage outside the wily saturday loo had ordered their presence just in case there should he an emergency elp shrops bellowed and sought refuge among his henchmen renny charged his monster hands popped two men over as if they had been dummies he grasped an arm which was drawing a gun twisted and the bone crunched the corridor chocked with a great wad of fighting humanity expletives arose from the fighting cluster profanity couched in palskad or low tibetan it was saturday loo who brought the fray to a conclusion he weaved out of the cabin halfblinded with pain his pawing hands encountered a cabinet holding a fire ax for emergency use in breaking down stateroom doors should the chilean senorita sink seizing the big ax saturday loo sprang forward he lifted the ax high and brought it down with a hideous bubbling sound renny collapsed shrops and the tibetans such of them as were conscious picked themselves up from the floor and felt for injuries for a few seconds the passage crackled with palskad profanity then they looked at the prone form of renny and began to feel better dead chortled one man blessed be an ax said another they gathered around exchanging condolences and reviving those who had been knocked senseless in the fight no one was seriously damaged the man whose arm renny had broken being the greatest sufferer shrops standing aside and wrinkling his apple face in thought seemed to become rather unhappy bad he muttered the worst that could ave appened no o master saturday loo said through almost ruined lips the bigfisted one could have escaped that wouldnt ave been as bad shrops said gloomily this lowly ones brain must be in a fog o master for i do not see how it could have been a lesser evil you dont know doc savages reputation you arf crocked scut snarled shrops suddenly becoming enraged at saturday loo for wielding the ax why didnt you use your ead doc savage will bust the bloody world wide open to punish us for killin is man renny es the kind of a bloke that can get us too saturday loo squirmed uneasily well did he remember his own disastrous experience with doc savage when the bronze man had rescued rae stanley at the hospital dedication ceremony a butterylooking perspiration appeared on saturday loos asiatic countenance he mopped at his scarletrunning mouth and nose ni kan he howled suddenly look shrops stared at renny glory be he chortled the bigfisted bloke aint dead saturday loo folded his arms piously some kind ancestor watching over me must have turned the ax so that it struck flatwise they pounced upon renny and tied him securely using inchthick hawser which they carried down from the deck and literally swathing him in the manila cable then they felt to see if his skull was fractured it was not go get the bloomin launch ready shrops ordered tibetans stumbled out to comply with this command like most asiatics they showed a marked lack of mechanical ability as they lowered the launch the task took them some moments the launch was long and slender ornamented with brasswork and equipped with a powerful engine forward was a small covered cabin the sides of which were fitted with long lidded boxes which served as seats and storage receptacles the lowering was accomplished with the aid of flashlights for it was now quite dark the tibetans returned below decks saturday loo was guarding renny but shrops was not in sight where is the master he has gone to the radio cabin saturday loo replied whatever shrops was doing in the radio cabin the undertaking occupied him some ten minutes he rejoined his men in a great hurry urry up lads he barked grab this bigfisted bloke an clap im in the launch the tibetans hastily complied with the order four of them grunting and stumbling carried renny out on deck tie im on top shrops directed this was accomplished by the simple process of lashing renny to the riding lights atop the cabin while not extraordinarily solid the bindings would nevertheless keep renny from rolling off shut the gas off at the bleedin fuel tank shrops ordered an hurry you thumbfingered scuts the launch will run but little more than half a mile upon the gas which is in the fuel lines and the carburetor o master reminded saturday loo dont hi know it shrops growled ump it you poor blokes get a move on the launch engine was started the valve at the fuel tank was closed a tibetan headed the craft toward the open sea threw the throttle wide then sprang overboard the launch streaked ahead bows lifted propeller throwing foam the lights of the craft had been turned oil the little cabin however was dark inside the gloomy cabin the lid of the long box which formed a seat lifted swiftly doc savage arose from the recess renny lashed to the roof was conscious he sat up feebly as docs corded fingers plucked the ropes from his arms and legs holy cow he rumbled thickly i woke up tied onto this thing howd you get here followed shrops doc replied stripping off the remainder of the ropes swam out to the ship and as a consequence did not get below in time to help you out on your fight you were down and they were bewailing your death it was a simple matter to hang around keep out of sight and stow away in the launch doc whipped inside the instant he had renny free he clicked off the lights then stopped the engine from the notsodistant chilean senorita a volley of palskad profanity came they sound mad renny muttered and with reason doc replied they obviously sent the launch away from the ship so that it would be in the path of their infernal blue meteor were they gonna expose me to that thing renny gulped they were doc told him shrops summoned the thing in some manner probably by radio doc turned the launch engine over got it running opened the valve at the fuel tank which the tibetans had closed and sent the craft knifing toward shore they covered less than a hundred feet before renny emitted a thumping cry holy cow he gulped the blue meteor it came up awfully out of the east it might have been a thing spawned by the andean mountain fastnesses only the faintest of ultramarine flushes marked its first appearance but the balefire brightened with appalling swiftness and there became audible the tiniest of whistling noises which might have been the note of some distant harpy piper the sibilant note loudened doc snapped switches a searchlight sprang out on the launch snout this waved as doc jockeyed the rudder and picked up the breakwater then the shore the water front ahead was a particularly bleak stretch there were no large warehouses and only a few shacks doc suddenly swerved the launch toward the chilean senorita we can get to shore before that blue thing arrives renny yelled but theres nowhere to conceal ourselves doc told him its dark they couldnt find renny left the rest unsaid and clutched for the gunwale as the launch heeled far over in making a quarter turn it was now driving in under the chilean senoritas bows rifle muzzles lipped flame at them from the steamer decks the slugs scooped splinters off the launch or made whupping noises in the water they were not wanted in the vicinity then the shooting slackened off men began to yell palskad words first with a vague uneasiness then with a growing terror shriller and shriller became the shouts until they were a maddened bedlam around the chilean senorita around the launch the blackness of night took on a corpseblue tinge this turned slowly to azure renny looked at doc holy cow he gulped and his pet expression was a double thump of horror rennys enormous hands drifted up and made lids over his ears the screaming whistle was beginning to cut there was something about it that made men want to open their mouths and shriek up on the chilean senoritas deck men were doing just that they parted jaws to their utter widest and drove shriek after shriek that ripped at vocal cords and threatened to tear the very lining from throat passages they knew the full horror of what was coming did these men they could not have vented louder or more awful shrieks had fiendish animals been consuming them by slow mouthfuls doc and renny exchanged glances for they could now see each other clearly in the unearthly blue glitter you figured the blue meteor would not come close to the steamer renny questioned that was reasonable to believe doc told him they sent you away in the launch to make it unnecessary for the thing to come near while it was affecting you the cobalt horror of the skies seemed to be headed directly for the chilean senorita overhead against the rail of the boat a man appeared the fellow was a tibetan and he backed against the rail facing the whistling blue meteor the fellows arms were rigid trembling and he crossed them in front of his eyes as if to fend off some monster his jaws were distended wide contorted no doubt he was screaming but no words came down to doc and renny in the launch renny stared there had come into his eyes a weird awful glitter a glassy hardness he made vague gestures with his huge hands and showed his teeth in a snarling grimace which was sinister and animallike he opened his mouth his words doc leaned close to catch them over the meteor crescendo were without articulation they were an unintelligible babbling the blue meteors spell was gripping him doc savage leaped for the cabin there was an uncertainty about his movements which contrasted greatly with his usual smooth agility once he all but fell his corded supple hands seemed all thumbs as he picked up the rope which had secured renny coming back with a weaving unsureness doc looped the stout hemp over rennys angular shoulders and jerked it snug renny did a strange thing he struck himself foolishly where the rope touched he bent over teeth bared as if to bite himself utterly appalling was the thing which had happened to the splendid physical specimen and great engineer his brain seemed no longer to function doc savage kept at his tying time after time he encircled renny with rope for he had knowledge of the terrific strength which came with the suspension of mental power monk and ham had been unnaturally powerful when renny was bound doc savage looped the rope about himself he began at his ankles and worked up then using his hands he managed to tie his arms down perspiration shimmered in the unholy blue luminance it soaked through his clothing he kept his eyes closed tightly as if to cover the gruesome effects of the blue meteor which were mirrored there he finished the last knot and drew the rope end tight he was tied now as securely as he could manage for he had used all of the rope it might restrain his mighty muscles after the blue meteor accomplished its gruesome work or it might not there was no way of forecasting what would happen with no possible escape from this unholy blue thing of the skies at hand doc had used his last vestige of mental firmness to tie renny and himself that they might be helpless to do harm to themselves when fully afflicted the meteor scream by now had grown so frightfully loud that ears registered no sound only pain renny fell over he had succumbed his brain had suspended its functioning the blue light was hurting docs eyes the frightful irradiation seemed in its power to penetrate through solids to pierce the very bull of the chilean senorita as if it were not there or as if it were transparent glass doc savage closed his bronze eyes more tightly than ever his lips seemed to weld so firmly did he press them together and there was hardly a visible line to show where they met the bronze man bowed his head as though a monster bullwhip had been popped overhead the blue meteor passed the wind of its going caused a violent flapping of the limp flag on the chilean senoritas stern the bronze man toppled slowly over his gigantic muscles were drawn so rigidly that the sound as he crashed upon the launch floorboards was that of a great metal statue falling the blue meteor after it had passed swept a whistling semicircle in the sky few living beings looked at it and remembered the act in the hours immediately following it was a path of awful ruin that the blue meteor left behind as it streaked over antofagasta physical injury torn bodies broken legs rent flesh men knew how to combat but the spell of the blue meteor being new and affecting only the minds of its victims mystified those who sought to help the afflicted the blue meteor swooped low over the taberna frio then shrieked a glittering way on toward its western lair it was certain that the men in the taberna frio had fallen a victim to its inhuman power chapter the awakening somewhere temple gongs were banging voices were chanting singsonging four words over and over unceasingly om mani padme hum weird musical instruments wailed torturing the eardrums with their dissonance and the air shuddered to the coughing roll of drums men shrieked howled like maddened creatures but their banshee outcries were submerged beneath the monotonous roll of voices chanting the four words which never varied om mani padme hum om mani padme hum it rose and fell that interminable mouthing it became shriller as the voices making it grew preponderantly tenor and it turned deep as bass tones outnumbered the uncanny sounds throbbed through low mortared stone rooms seeming at times to come with such power as to stir heavy draperies and tapestries somewhere in the rooms a pig squealed then made a rapid succession of grunting noises holy cow said a hollow voice which might have been a disturbed lion in a deep den huh muttered another voice surprisingly wee and childlike that sounded like our habeas corpus squealing monk sat up slowly and inspected his own hairy hands they seemed to puzzle him for he flexed the furry fingers then felt of his short bowed legs his barrel of a chest and his homely features he acted as if he were checking up on his gorillalike body he saw that he was on a bed once more he inspected his apish frame its all there said a faint sarcastic voice and its uglier than ever monk turned his head beside him was another bed on this ham sat both men wore pajamas monks garment was bursting at the seams hams was greatly oversize purplestriped and entirely unlovely ham glanced down at the awful raiment the pajamas prove it he said thickly in my normal mind id never be caught in such horrors im crazy monk neglected this wideopen chance for a pointed crack about ham being late in making the discovery the fact that he did so showed something momentous was in his thoughts where are we he asked ham peered at monk hopefully maybe im not crazy after all i just woke up monk i have no idea where i am same here monk said slowly the last thing i remember we were in that valley in south america and some devilish blue thing was coming through the sky we were running from it but we couldnt get away ham stood up he flexed his arms stretched and seemed to be sound enough he listened to the chanting and gouging sounds what is that infernal racket he asked theyre hollering something over and over sounds like oh monty pad me home monk grunted om mani padme hum corrected ham huh exploded monk thats a buddhist religious chant you hear it in the asiatic countries two doors led out of the room both were closed suddenly there was a loud explosion of splintered wood from one panel shattered pieces jumped away to permit a colossal rustcolored knot of a human fist to project through the door opened under another great blow and bigfisted renny appeared on the threshold did you guys just wake up he asked anger in his great voice susure monk replied wonderingly so did i renny thumped the last thing i remember is being in a launch with doc alongside a steamer named the chilean senorita and a whistling blue thing was coming through the sky the blue meteor of a thing is our last memory too said ham renny held out his corded wrists look he rumbled they seem all right monk told him sure they do renny agreed thats the strange thing about it just before i passed out from the effects of the blue meteor i broke a pair of handcuffs apart on my wrists the steel cut deep into my arms so what so theres no trace of the gashes now renny boomed they were so deep it would take more than a month for them to heal take a close look and you can barely see the scars weve been unconscious more than a month monk howled unbelievingly from an adjacent room a voice called listen you guys come in here and tell us that we arent batty the three men stumbled to the other room it held a slender pale long tom and tall bony johnny johnny had his monoclemagnifier in one hand he made vague gestures with it i just awakened he began and darned if darned if you aint concluded youve been asleep more than a month interrupted monk johnny looked somewhat stunned i was hoping i was wrong we must be nuts monk muttered it aint reasonable johnny drew out a watch this was a costly timepiece and in addition to the hour minute and second it registered the day the month and the year over a month is correct he said you fellows inspect each other closely and youll see something else too the men complied with this suggestion holy cow gulped renny weve all lost some weight monks eyes rolled in their little pits of gristle hey guys he said dont you catch another thing the others stared uncomprehending monk made an elaborate shivering gesture kinda frosty right ham rapped the air is very cold we hadnt noticed it in our excitement and it was hot in south america monk pointed out was ham choked you mean you think not finishing the ejaculation ham dashed to the handiest window for the love of mike he yelled we aint in south america any more the men jammed heads together to peer through the small aperture the window itself was not fitted with glass but with a panel of oiled paper in a hinged frame this was open for ventilation before them was a strange spectacle a panorama altogether startling and weird considering that they had until a moment before thought themselves to be in moderately civilized south america the uproar the gonging and shrieking came from a structure some distance away this seemed to be a shrine of sorts and around it a queue of fantastically masked men were winding they kept going steadily and their chanting was unending a lamasery declared gaunt johnny who knew much of the races of the world thanks to his work in archaeology they march like that and chant appeals to the departed spirits brothers were in tibet in tibet monk gulped for some minutes the five men stood there staring at the lamas and their convolutions listening to the interminable om mani padme hum and exchanging stunned looks the pig habeas corpus entered the room trotted up to monk and sniffed a trouser cuff as if it were some strange animal habeas youre in tibet monk said slowly renny waved his great fists like clubs and thundered i dont see how we got here tibet is a plateau averaging around twelve thousand feet above sea level its the highest country in the world and its surrounded by the tallest known mountain ranges its a hard place to get into is it hard to get out of monk muttered this beats me ham yelled waving his arms in baffled disgust he went into the room where he had awakened and came back bearing his sword cane he flourished the weapon howd i bring my sword cane here without knowing anything about it he asked the last i saw of it was in that crowd in antofagasta chile at the dedication of docs hospital and say what about doc the men looked at each other uneasily their bronze chief had been in their thoughts but they had been slow to speak hoping doc would put in an appearance bringing an explanation of this fantastic mystery the last i saw of doc was in that launch alongside the chilean senorita rumbled renny he was with me he had the foresight to tie me and tie himself before the blue meteor came why was it necessary to do the tying monk asked if you could have seen yourself after the blue meteor got you you wouldnt ask that renny told him you cut up terribly he does that without seeing meteors ham said sarcastically the situation rarely got so tense but that ham seized every chance to stick verbal thorns into monk you werent so meek yourself renny told ham lets go hunt doc snapped long tom the somewhat unhealthyappearing electrical wizard led the way to a door covered by an elaborate and gaudily colored curtain they filed down a corridor long tom halted and said say i noticed stuff that looked like our baggage in our rooms dyou reckon our weapons are still with the junk not a chance snorted bigfisted renny we were obviously overpowered by the devils controlling that blue meteor theyd have taken our guns we were overpowered over a month ago long tom reminded him im going to look they retraced their steps with eager fingers they opened bags huh gulped monk theyre here from the bags they drew weapons which were slightly larger than ordinary automatics but which were infinitely more intricate these were guns of docs own invention tiny machine guns with a superrapid rate of fire in action they sounded like the moan of gigantic bull fiddles the weapons were charged with drums holding what big game hunters term mercy bullets slugs producing unconsciousness in lieu of death due to a potent drug and shelllike construction which collapsed against instead of penetrating flesh the men slung the rapidfirers under their coats and left the room they advanced down the hall opening doors to other rooms they shoved through the fourth door and came to a startled halt holy cow exploded renny entrancingly pretty rae stanley asked what is it gentlemen what would you like she stood in the center of the crudely furnished room and she was dressed much differently than when they had last seen her she wore typical garb of a tibetan woman her robe was long highcollared gaudily hued with a wide sash of contrasting color about her slender waist her feet were encased in brocaded tibetan boots kneelength affairs with a slit in the back and garterlike tyings three or four feet long on her forehead was a band studded with what appeared to be gold nuggets and she wore earrings which did not match the one on the left being long and narrow with a pendant string of turquoise for several seconds the five men said nothing they almost held their breaths for rae stanleys beauty was made even more exquisite by her unusual raiment what do you want she repeated sharply monk swallowed to loosen his tongue wheres doc the entrancingly pretty girl pointed to a door down the corridor my fiance has that room she said monks bulging chest seemed all that kept his jaw from falling entirely off his face so far down did surprise make it sag your what he gulped doc savage my future husband rae stanley retorted sharply what ails you anyway you look as if you had just heard of our engagement instead of knowing about it for more than a month monk swallowed several times but it did not free his surprisefrozen tongue monk was probably as astounded as he had ever been awakening to find they had been unconscious for more than a month was a shock learning they had gone to sleep in south america and awakened in mysterious and forbidden tibet on the other side of the world was more disquieting still the thunderclap though was this word that big bronze doc savage had indulged in the preliminaries of taking himself a wife it was unbelievable never had there been provision for feminine partnership in docs perilous career doc strictly abstained from anything smacking of an affair of the heart some amazingly pretty and intelligent young women smitten by the bronze mans undeniable handsomeness had openly sought to captivate him but always with results strictly nil doc had a good reason for this attitude he could not allow a woman to share the dangers which accrued from his career of punishing evildoers in the far corners of the earth his enemies would not hesitate to strike at him through a wife or sweetheart so doc was careful to fall for none of the feminine charmers at least he had been careful rae stanley surveyed docs five astounded aides she seemed puzzled at the unbelief and stupefaction on their countenances gentlemen she queried are you ill i dunno what ails us monk said thickly renny suddenly lifted his two huge fists eyed them intently then spread them wide and banged them together they met with a loud report it seemed a miracle that no hones were broken rae stanley raised her attractive brows what was the idea of that just to wake myself up in case i was dreaming renny said entire sobriety on his long puritanical face gaunt johnny fumbling with his monocle stared at rae stanley doc proposed marriage to you he questioned solemnly rae wrinkled her petite nose how else could we become engaged you dont think i popped the question do you johnny said gloomily doc must have been caught in a long nap too well i like that rae stanley snapped coloring uncomfortably johnny said hastily im sorry i didnt mean what he meant was that we want to see doc interposed ham rae stanley glanced at ham her eyes twinkled and she hastily averted her face over her shoulder drifted stifled laughter it was hams turn to grow red as he realized he was parading the corridor in the atrocious purplestriped pajamas in his excitement over going to sleep in south america and awakening in the center of asia he had forgotten his garb ham was very touchy about his clothing it seems strange that you dont know where to locate docs room rae stanley said youve been in there often enough but ill show you why are you acting so strangely is it some kind of a game the five men exchanged thoughtful boles it was slender frailappearing long tom who voiced the general thought i wonder said the electrical wizard rae stanley moved down the corridor and rapped on a door yes said doc savages powerful controlled voice rae stanley opened the door she crossed rapidly to doc the giant bronze man stood in the middle of the room an impressive and inspiring figure in the pale light which penetrated through the small window of oiled paper rae stanley went straight to doc lifted on tiptoe and gave him a resounding and amorous kiss your friends wanted me to show them your room darling she said they are acting very strangely wheezing the young woman skipped outside she drew the door shut behind her docs flakegold pools of eyes rested upon his five men do me a favor he requested what kind of a favor monk queried in a tiny voice haul off and sock me one doc directed this must be a dream and im entirely ready to be awakened chapter some unremembered promises so it happened to you too renny asked doc if you mean lapsing into unconsciousness in south america and awakening here in tibet doc said that is exactly what occurred for a few moments nobody seemed to have anything further to say their faculties were employed in trying to delve into the past few weeks none of them could remember a thing we seem to come out of it better than doc at that monk said slyly monk seldom lost his sense of humor how dyou figure that renny asked doc seems to have about collected himself a wife in his sleep monk replied we didnt you better not crow too soon ham told the homely chemist gathering his gaudy pajama coat tighter about his slender frame all of us may have collected sweethearts or even wives we may have seven or eight wives a piece offered the bony johnny a man can have more than one wife over here every one but monk looked very gloomy at this possibility monk grinned widely at the idea of several wives however the thought seemed to appeal to him in case we have turned brigham youngs in our sleep he snorted i only hope we picked as nifty lookers as doc did this is a terrible situation brothers doc announced strangely enough this statement on docs part caused every one to smile docs announcement that he considered the situation dire in the face of the recent kiss by such a dazzling beauty as rae stanley was so foreign to the reaction another man would have displayed that it was comical doc was appalled another would have been elated i notice you didnt duck when she planted that kiss said the sharptongued ham i got more of the same thing a little earlier doc said gloomily huh my awakening came about an hour ago doc explained shortly after that i went out in the corridor to look around the girl collared me there how many times ham asked times what doc queried times did she kiss you we dont discuss that doc said there was something so uncommon about the mighty bronze mans pronounced sheepishness of expression that his five friends could not restrain their mirth the weirdness of their situation the memory of a mysterious monster known as mogwei and a devilish whistling blue dig of the skies were all forgotten as they gave way to uproarious laughter doc savage heard them through without cracking a smile go ahead and get it out of your systems he said you can afford to cackle you didnt as far as we know promise to marry anybody in your sleep sobriety came finally the blue meteor must have made us go around in a daze for weeks bigfisted renny said thoughtfully could it have had that effect doc the affliction caused by the blue meteor is something entirely new to my experience doc replied evasively it is hard to say exactly what might happen wonder what town were in said the skeletonthin johnny we might go out and see doc declared the bronze man moved for the door trailed by the others wait ham said hastily let me get out of these awful pajamas he departed and was back shortly clad with neatness even to a necktie which he was knotting all of our baggage and equipment seems to be here he remarked some of my clothes are crumpled and soiled as if they had been worn the pajamas and some shirts are strange though our scientific equipment is practically intact doc added the apparatus to which doc referred consisted of a compact and extremely complete chemical laboratory belonging to monk a set of electrical devices and materials for making almost any known electrical contrivance that was the property of long tom and to various mechanisms and chemical concoctions which the bronze man himself always carried they stepped outside into air that was filled with a biting cold their breath steamed before their eyes buildings around them were of crude stones set in mud roofs were flat or nearly so and seemed to consist of dried mud upon poles and sticks with a thin layer of flat stones to break the violence of falling rain white and gray was the predominating color scheme window glass was conspicuously absent streets were narrow paved with dirt and ruts houses were a single story in height with here and there a building towering two stories big fierce dogs prowled by the dozens several long barracklike structures stood near the center of the small settlement they look kinda like plane hangars offered long tom the electrical expert theyre chanting halls used by the lamas doc explained that the bronze man should identify the structures at a glance caused only a flicker of surprise among his five men they knew that docs fund of knowledge was incalculable covering the remotest ends of the earth practically all spare moments of his life doc had spent in intensive study in order to acquire his fabulous lore they encountered a tibetan in huge boots gaudy gown and tremendous fur headgear he carried a longbarreled flintlock rifle of ancient vintage doc addressed the tibetan what village is this o knowing one the tibetan showed surprise at having a white man speak perfect rjesa the respectful speech used by educated tibetans too some of his astonishment was probably caused by the nature of the question it is the village of tonyi he replied where is that doc long tom asked in the konkaling sector in eastern tibet the tibetan was eying the five men curiously he was a stalwart fellow cleareyed and polite without being cringing he looks kinda like daniel boone with that fur cap and squirrel rifle monk grunted i wonder what you look like to him ham said unkindly doc now put another question to the tibetan in rjesa have you o knowing one ever heard aught of a sky visitor called the blue meteor he asked a marked change swept the tibetan his eyes protruded his olivebrown face blanched and he gripped his flintlock tightly he opened and shut his mouth and seemed unable to speak hes heard of the blue meteor bigfisted renny thumped doc addressed one more query to the tibetan o knowing one can you tell me aught of a man called mogwei this had an even more astounding effect on their source of information he emitted a cracked yell at mention of the name of mogwei then he spun and fled terrorstricken monk promptly started after the retreating tibetan but docs bronze hand coming to rest upon his shoulder stopped the homely chemist as if he had run against a stone wall im only gonna grab that squirrel hunter and make im answer our questions monk explained look doc directed about them scores of gowned tibetans had popped magically from low doorways all were heavily armed bearing weapons ranging from swords and spears to extremely modern highpowered rifles they bent dark scowls upon doc and his men and stared questioningly at the running tibetan whose yell had drawn them try to grab the fellow and you would have a riot on your hands doc pointed out yeah youre right monk admitted eying the plainly hostile tibetans what makes these fellows so touchy they dont take to white men doc explained it was only a little over ten years ago that the tibetan government invited the first white man to visit the capital lhasa and a couple of years later they permitted a telegraph line to be strung to lhasa from india the crowd ahead of them increased grew more threatening we had better go back doc advised theres no point in fighting these fellows just because they dont like the looks of white men the group of adventurers retreated for the house in which they had awakened after their long siesta the tibetans made no gestures actually hostile their hands evidently being stayed by the huge size of doc renny and monk and the determination of the other three the blue meteor and mogwei are both known here monk muttered thats a cinch lets collar that rae stanley girl and see if shell cough up the truth about this mess suggested ham waving his sword cane for emphasis well talk to her doc agreed but well not let on that we have just come back to our senses you fellows didnt tell her you had just awakened did you nope said ham the hussy shes docs fiance monk reminded the faintest suggestion of a red tinge showed under the bronze hue of docs neck the bronze mans five aides stared at this faint flush in astonishment they would hardly have been more amazed had the sun changed color to their recollection doc had never before shown embarrassment well let on like weve been in our right minds all of the time doc said if shes tricking us a knowall air will worry her monk emitted a low grunt look he ejaculated there she is in the door waitin for us rae stanley eyed doc and his five men severely when they came up if she was acting she was doing a perfect job you courted a riot going out in american clothing she said reproof in her pure voice why did you do it you knew better until today you always wore tibetan garb we saw a fellow doc told her we were anxious to talk to him the young woman stiffened in the doorway her hand drifted up into the vicinity of her heart was it some on connected with mogwei she asked he got away doc explained were not certain about him oh said rae stanley and walked ahead of them into the rather dark tibetan residence docs five men kept in the background they intended to let doc carry on the conversation let us discuss your father doc told rae stanley at this blunt statement the girl stumbled had doc not reached out swiftly and caught her she might have fallen he could feel her tremble under his hands oh she gasped youve found some trace of him no doc said but will you please repeat the whole story from the first i have told you before the girl said swiftly we may have overlooked some details lets make sure the attractive young woman seemed to consider then nodded we might have missed something at that she admitted where shall i start with the beginning of the expedition in search of the blue meteor doc directed the other five men exchanged glances and microscopic nods doc was acquitting himself handsomely his voice held perfect assurance and he was using the few facts in his possession to give the impression that he knew a great deal more rae stanley took a full breath and launched into her story nothing of importance happened until we reached this village of tonyi she said we did not know where the blue meteor had landed so we had traced the fantastic stories of its striking to their strongest point which was here in tonyi the blue horror went directly over tonyi and the whole population lost the use of their brains for months even yet some of them are irresponsible the last sentence about mental irresponsibility moved all five of docs men to squirm uneasily they were wondering what they had done while under the blue meteor spell professor stanley concluded the meteor struck near this village doc queried to the north rae stanley replied it is a very wild region of desert and mountains infested by outlaw tribesmen father did not wish to take me into danger so he forced me to remain here with a missionary and his wife he took a caravan into the north to search for the meteor that was the last i ever saw of him you do not know his exact destination doc asked no he was only going to hunt the meteor he was wild to find it and examine it he took an enormous quantity of scientific apparatus and chemicals along he had heard enough to know this meteor was unlike any other ever to hit the earth where is the missionary and wife with whom you were left rae stanley hesitated the briefest instant they have returned to england they were english missionaries doc did not change expression go ahead he directed include the mogwei angle in your story mogwei is the strange chief of the outlaw tribesmen in the region where father vanished rae stanley replied in the pause which followed the interminable chanting of the lamas assumed greater loudness seemingly and the squeak of an occasional portable prayer wheel was audible i tried to hunt for father rae stanley continued but i was driven back by mogweis followers so i hit on the idea of appealing to you for help i learned from the newspapers in india that you were in south america so i went to antofagasta detail your meeting with shrops doc requested and with saturday leo the young woman ii she was surprised at docs order to repeat something he was supposed to have heard previously did not show any emotion shrops and saturday leo were mogweis men she replied they were sent by mogwei to prevent my reaching you doc nodded the small whirlwinds that perpetually stirred the flake gold of his eyes seemed to slacken their pace the bronze mans five aides looking on realized that doc was debating the best manner of drawing out the rest of the story rae stanley solved that problem by continuing speaking it was very fortunate that the blue meteor had only a temporary effect on you in antofagasta she said had you not killed shrops and saturday leo they would certainly have slain you the tiny whirls in docs flaky eyes almost came to a stop at the information that he had slain shrops and saturday leo it was against docs creed to take human life directly i shall never be able to repay you for rescuing me said the entrancing young woman shrops and saturday loo were holding me prisoner in that tavern on the outskirts of antofagasta where you found me and i owe you a lot for coming over here to hunt father too she hesitated colored in a way that enhanced her beauty and added as i said i cannot repay you even if our marriage lasts forever doc took this without a flicker of emotion in fact a marked change had settled upon the mighty bronze man he was no longer embarrassed he seemed sure of himself it was as if something in the conversation had brought doc to his old self as if he had read the girls true mind anything about mogwei will help he said the girl spread her hands to indicate futility i have told you all that i have been able to learn she said im sorry it is so precious little mogwei as far as i can ascertain has never been seen face to face even by his outlaw tribesmen how long has he held sway not very long in fact he was unheard of at the time father vanished he has a very potent weapon in the blue meteor doc said in a low voice rae stanley shuddered as i told you he is using it to extort money from tibetan villages she said when a settlement refuses to pay a tremendous sum of money the blue meteor passes over and all are stripped of the use of their brains and it is reported that he intends to extend his sway to cities in more civilized sections of the world doc did not inform her that she had told him nothing of the grisly story to his present memory instead his handsome bronze face remained impassive i think we had better advance our marriage date he said unexpectedly rae stanley looked startled but we were planning to wait until we found father we will have the ceremony this evening doc announced this plainly shocked the young beauty she put her hands over her lips took them away and blushed as red as the proverbial beet ill have to think that over she gasped wheeling she fled the room the door banged loudly behind her chapter schemers doc savages five aides stared at their bronze leader in a stunned fashion holy cow doc gulped renny supposin she had taken you up that wouldnt be such a calamity chuckled the homely monk shes a pippin i believe shes the prettiest girl i ever saw docs powerful voice interrupted what promised to be a wordy discussion of his matrimonial prospects you fellows get into tibetan garments he directed from what that girl said there are probably some here that will fit us she claimed we had been wearing them the men scattered searching within a few moments they reassembled the duds are here all right monk muttered don them doc repeated johnny you speak the best tibetan thanks to your experience as an archeologist or are you up on it i conducted an expedition into northern tibet to bunt dinosaur eggs once johnny said sure i remember the language drift around over town doc directed make inquiries about this blue meteor and about mogwei in other words check up on the girls story and see what else you can learn c another thing look into that missionary yarn see if there ever was a missionary couple here with whom rae stanley stayed and who returned to england righto said johnny the rest of you fellows trail along and guard johnny doc directed these tibetans are not savages or anything of the kind but they do like to bait a foreigner and that starts fights avoid trouble if you can the fact that we are in native garb will simplify matterssaid johnny the men hastily donned the tibetan robes high boots with great garters and fur caps ham was fortunate enough to have an outfit which fit him it was also flashier than the others he strutted proudly nifty eh he asked monk sure monk said unkindly you look like a canary that fell into a paint bucket ham frowned critically at monks habiliments which were many sites too small an ape in a sausage skin he snorted bless me ejaculated bony johnny where did doc go the men glanced around in surprise unnoticed in the bustle of dressing doc had left their midst after the first astonishment the five men showed no great anxiety the giant bronze man often departed in this ghostly fashion usually he did it when going upon some secret and allimportant mission of his own the homely monk had an expression which fitted the situation docs got a hen on he said monk gathered up habeas corpus the pet pig tucked the laughably ugly specimen of a porker under an arm and trailed johnny outside the five of them rambled off hunting an information mine in the person of a tibetan loafer intent brown eyes watched the party out of sight from one of the small windows rae stanley had employed a pin to jab a tiny hole in the oiledpaper pane and to this she kept an eye pressed she exhibited an expression of relief when the crooked village street swallowed docs men walking swiftly she went to one room after another peering behind curtains and into recesses when she had examine the last room she nibbled her lips uncertainly doc savage she called at last doc savage no reply came from the gloomy rooms rae nodded as if satisfied that doc was not in the house she drew a small but businesslike revolver from one ample sleeve of her tibetan gown examined it to make certain it was charged with cartridges then replaced it she stepped outside the air was appreciably colder than it had been less than an hour ago this was due to the fact that the sun had been speared by one of the high mountain peaks to the westward the lamas encircling the shrine were moving faster probably to keep warm the shadows of tibetan twilight were fattening blackly in the cramped streets rae stanley kept in the murk and went furtively not many wayfarers were abroad but she took great pains to avoid meeting even those the hue of her garments being deep of color blended with the night much more effectively than would lighter yellows and blues once the young woman clamped herself against the wall of a compound and permitted a file of tibetans to pass weapons aclatter so close that she could have touched them rae stanleys stealthy way led to the outskirts of town here hillmen and desert nomads who were paying a visit to tonyi for the trading season had pitched their yurts the yurts a type of structure which housed practically all tibetans who were not village dwellers were like inverted bowls varying from a dozen to twenty feet in diameter they consisted of a light wooden framework which could be taken down in a hurry for transportation over this was fastened large sheets of felt or mumdahs fourfoot holes in the center of the domes permitted the escape of smoke and fumes and provided ventilation the young woman approached one of the yurts and made a tapping signal on the mumdah covering a moment later she repeated it two short taps a pause then three single taps widely spaced the flap of a door was lifted and a voice said cmon in rae stanley bending low entered the place was not possessed of an inviting odor a fire of leyzak burned blue in the center of the floor over this a kettle of tea bubbled near by stood a churn and other ingredients for making the national drink of tibet buttered tea great yellowandbrown spotted robes of tibetan leopard lay on the floor several dukor or hill partridges hung from the roof and bowls of yak milk stood in a corner near containers holding raisins dried apricots and kernels of apricot stones rae stanley peered at the man who admitted her squinting in the paleblue light it was saturday loo another man arose from beside the teyzak fire his face was greasy sootsmeared and his tibetan garments were devoid of decoration and none too clean his appearance was that of a beggar a close observer might have recognized john mark shrops did you tell the bronze bloke we are dead shrops demanded anxiety in his whanging cockney tones i told him rae stanley replied coldly i told him everything just as you directed then what as brought you ere shrops snapped youre takin a chance i want more instructions said the girl i dont think doc savage believed a single one of the string of fibs that i told hi outside the yurt dogs set up a terrific barking saturday loo sprang nervously for a rifle then scuttled outside the weapon cocked and ready in his hands rae stanley and shrops waited nervously silent perhaps two minutes later saturday loo returned the asiatic shrugged it has been said that the creator of the world and the things upon it had an appetite and a barking noise left over so he made the dog he said sheepishly verily that must be true i found naught perhaps the dogs were barking at a yak sure that was it shrops said as if reassuring himself more than the others nobody in tonyi suspects that we aint traders who brought in a load of yak tails and fleece from the shawlwool goat for a chinabound caravan i dont think my story fooled doc savage said rae stanley why shrops demanded he made no mention of the fact that he had just awakened rae explained uneasily and he seems to know a great deal about the situation several times i wondered if he had actually been under the influence of the blue meteor all the way from south america e was shrops granted aint no livin man proof against the blue meteor theres another thing murmured the young woman doc savage suggested that the marriage be performed tonight shrops snorted so what that shows he was playing with me he knew very well that the engagement story was not true he called my bluff what am i going to do marry im said shrops you cad gritted the girl shrops chuckled heartily dont go pretendin you dont fancy the idea me darlin hive been watchin you make sheep eyes in is direction while we was bringin im from south america along with is men go ahead an marry ins youd be collectin a bloomin famous usband young lady rae bit her lips angrily i wont do it she snapped not under conditions like this shrops suddenly shed his mirth he jutted his head forward his face was evil in the blue glow from the fire in the center of the yurt are you forgettin what hi can do if you dont play along with me he growled the girl paled you mean hi mean that were ere in tibet now an hi dont ave to send no cable to ave the little job done rae stanley shuddered all right she said ill go through with it but youve got to keep your part of the bargain hi will shrops grunted you just keep on tellin that bronze bloke that es been conscious an doin things all the time you can make ins believe it very well rae stanley agreed reluctantly but i wish this was over havent you got some clew to mogweis whereabouts not yet shrops told her the bloody swab is like a ghost nobody knows anything about ins but hive got saturday loos men workin an snoopin for information when hi gets any hill give it t you an you can pass it along t doc savage this terminated the interview rae stanley left the yurt with its stifling atmosphere and its two evil tenants as she walked off a bedlam of dog barking arose to her right the yipping uproar subsided quickly however haunting shadows the young woman retraced her way toward the stone house in which doc savage and his men had awakened at the precise moment that entrancingly pretty rae stanley quitted the yurt doc savages five men were reentering the stone dwelling they glanced about in search of their bronze chief doc isnt back yet renny rumbled if as monk said doc has a hen on i hope it hatches out something long tom grunted its little enough information that we collected the unhealthylooking electrical genius went to the room in which he had awakened from his stacked baggage he extracted a rather bulky case opening this he brought to light a compact and remarkably powerful shortwave radio transmitter and receiver he set this up clipped the receivers over his ears and rattled the key whatre you tryin to do monk asked shut up long tom suggested for some minutes long tom alternately transmitted and received a satisfied expression on his pallid countenance he finally doffed the receivers i got in touch with a newspaper radio station in calcutta he reported first i asked him for dope on the appearance of the blue meteor in antofagasta chile more than a month ago he had it that meteor spread havoc in south america passing over the town it made thousands of people mentally sterile and here is the surprising part none of the victims have recovered that brothers is an important point said doc savages remarkable voice from the door the five men spun in astonishment none had heard docs return just as they had not detected sounds of his departure the giant bronze man had the ability to move about with ghostly silence the fact that we have recovered and those in south america have not doc continued strengthens a suspicion which had already occurred to me what asked long tom didnt the fact that we all regained consciousness at about the same time strike you as strange doc countered ill tell a man rumbled bigfisted renny that was almost as strange as our long sleep it seems that those of us with the strongest physiques would have recovered first such as you or monk or myself thats the point doc agreed all indications are that we were given a cure for the effects of the blue meteor otherwise it is highly unlikely that we would have revived at the same time long tom nodded i learned something else too that steamer the chilean senorita was found abandoned near one of the mouths of the ganges river the spot was about south of here no trace was found of the crew and investigation disclosed that the recent purchasers of the boat had given fictitious names that probably indicates bow we came across the pacific doc offered shrops saturday loo and rae stanley brought us over the five men gaped at doc how dyou know the girl is in with those two thugs asked renny i just followed the young lady on a visit to shrops and saturday loo doc advised them when the first surprise subsided renny straightened out his long puritanical face and said so thats where you were shrops is masquerading as a tibetan and he and saturday loo are occupying a yurt on the outskirts of town doc explained i had a little trouble overhearing all that was said because all of the dogs that passed insisted on barking at me doc made a slight gesture and the five men ringed in close doc dropped his voice to a wispy note that only the five could hear the girl will be back soon the bronze man announced i came on ahead for she was going slowly in order not to be seen have you any idea what is behind all this long tom asked saturday loo and shrops seem to want me to wipe out this mogwei doc replied they are forcing the girl to aid them they seem to have some hold over her whenever she becomes rebellious shrops threatens to do something and the threat brings the girl to terms huli granted the homely monk its about time we persuaded that young lady to talk thats exactly what were going to do when she shows up doc replied now what dope did you fellows pick up about mogwei ham took it upon himself to answer this question he punctuated his statements with jabs of his innocentlooking black sword cane we found a talkative tibetan very soon after you sent us out he explained the fellow could tell us little except for one point that explains why the residents of this village are particularly hostile to all white men they meet what is that doc asked sharply they consider the blue meteor a curse sent by white men where did that belief originate our source of information didnt know doc considered what about the missionary with whom rae stanley said she stayed the missionary part of her yarn was true ham replied the bronze man was silent he seemed to be listening the girl should be arriving he said thoughtfully clapping thunderously on the heels of his words came the reports of four shots fired rapidly then a fivecount later two more banged mixed with the pitching echoes of the gunfire was a long piping wail of terror it was rae stanleys voice chapter the phantom mogwei the low stone room in which doc savage and his men stood was lighted by a crude chimneyless copper lamp during the first thumping uproar of shots doc extinguished the lamp with a wave of his hand that stirred a breeze ham and the others started a simultaneous charge for the door wait docs powerful voice commanded but the girl it may be a trick long tom stand by your radio obediently the electrical expert found his apparatus in the darkness switched the circuit on and clamped the receivers to his ears doc savage did not quit the house immediately instead he whipped to the chamber which held his own equipment using a flashlight which played a white cordlike beam he extracted several devices from boxes and bags and stowed them within his garments he did not depart by door or window leaping upward he accomplished the extremely difficult feat of grasping a ceiling beam with one band and clinging to it while his corded metallic fist drove a series of terrific blows against the roof sunbaked mud and rocks were loosened doc opened an aperture large enough to pass his mighty frame enemies might be watching the doors gliding lightly across the rooftop doc came to the edge and dropped to the rutted dirt street from many parts of the village excited howls came men had been aroused by the shots being of a fighting race not at all loath to join a fray for the pure love of a scrap they popped into the streets with weapons in hand from among these sounds doc picked certain significant scufflings and low commands he advanced making no more noise than the darkness itself he distinguished several men all were tibetans they were fellows whom doc had never glimpsed before this he realized when he was very close to them shrops and mogwei were not among them three of them held rae stanley another had thrust a wad of felt torn from a mumdah between the young womans jaws and was industriously tying it in place beside them stood a coffinshaped wooden box the lid of this was open apparently to receive the girl rae kicked at them tried to strike them with her fists an evilfaced tibetan bounced around with the girls revolver it was evidently this weapon which had been fired for two of the men were nursing minor bullet wounds kwi sheeay hissed the man with the gun hurry up rae stanley managed to spit out the gag by flailing her head help she screamed the shriek rang in docs ears conveying genuine horror it told him what he had been waiting to ascertain this was not play acting mao grated the asiatic with the gun cat he prepared to knock the young woman senseless instead of bringing the gun against the girls temple however the asiatics arm was all but jerked from his body as a corded bronze hand seized it the gun flew away clattering against a stone house the man shrieked the other tibetans howled and sprang into the fray they dropped rae stanley to have their hands free doc savage the young woman gasped she leaped erect and closed with the nearest tibetan swinging her fists and kicking the tibetans had nerve and they piled into the combat with the greatest of confidence doc was one man against several this will be simple howled a brown man docs fingers drifted out and seemed barely to flick the fellows cheek an astounding thing happened lids closed over the mans glittering eyes his jaw sagged he seemed to go to sleep on his feet he fell over slowly and crashed his full length on the ground an instant later docs finger tips touched the skin of another tibetan and that individual also gave an excellent imitation of going to sleep in the midst of the fight a third moonfaced villain met an identical fate confidence seeped out of the yelling tibetans and horrified surprise took its place the manner in which their fellows dropped at the bronze mans mere touch smacked of black magic only two of the gang were now on their feet this pair sought to flee but they might have been sluggish yak calves striving to escape a mountain leopard doc was upon them instantly one tibetan collapsed from the fantastic magic in docs touch a great bronze beam of an arm gathered in the second runner the fellow screeched and struck but the blows only bruised his knuckles on the metallic mans muscles his yelling became one long peal of terror he felt as if he were imprisoned in a nest of steel girders dang hsin he screamed be careful you will crush my bones ease the pressure with many words rapidly spoken doc advised in the flowery native tongue what kind of words wailed the prisoner words giving the name of your master and his whereabouts doc directed pretty rae stanley came close thats it make him talk she gasped hes one of mogweis men he may be able to lead us to mogwei the tibetan apparently did not fancy the idea of telling tales on his sinister master mogwei he threw back his head and voiced one of the most earsplitting screams doc had ever heard that sound covered the oncoming of disaster through it even docs supersensitive ears failed to detect the approach of a man a rifle barrel levered downward in the darkness it struck docs head and the bronze giant dropped his captive and sagged prone fully a dozen other tibetans charged out of the night they bristled with guns two of them grasped the girl and held her tightly the fellow who had struck doc raised his rifle for a second blow listen to his skull burst he grated and struck his rifle barrel struck the hard ground for doc was magically not there when it fell the barrel broke free of the stock with a crunching of rending mechanism and splintering wood the tibetan moaned probably more from grief over the mishap to his rifle than regret because doc had escaped rifles were scarce and costly in tibet chung feng he bellowed charge seize the bronze devil that however proved an impossible deed doc savage mighty man of bronze had obviously been but slightly stunned by the rifle blow he had drifted like a bat into the surrounding night pursue him not commanded the straw boss of the gang we have the fair flower which is all we were ordered to get rae stanley was now gagged dumped in the coffin of a box and the lid fastened four men shouldered the receptacle other men lifted the thugs who had succumbed to docs fantastic touch from their grunted opinions of their comrades ability it was apparent that all belonged to the same gang the late arrivals had been posted in the background one would think you were worms in a chicken coop growled the leader the bronze man has devilmagic in his hands groaned the man whom doc had started to question indeed this man was the only one of the first party to seize the young woman who was now conscious how did he overcome you o inefficient one i do not know replied the other at his touch my companions went to sleep kwai hsie snapped the man in charge hurry up let us remove ourselves from this accursed spot the party hurried off bearing the coffinbox holding the girl and carrying their unconscious and injured fellows a tibetan citizen thrust his head out of a door and yelled a palskad equivalent of whats going on here his answer was a shot but the curious one held his ground he carried a gun a monstrosity of a thing with a hewed stock and a crude octagonalbored barrel this weapon was accompanied by a pitchforklike supporting stick the tibetan dispensed with the rest planting his weapon against the side of a door he struck a match and applied it to a bit of tinder which protruded from a small breech hole in the fashion of ancient cannons there was time enough between the application of the flame and the explosion to permit taking an aim the blunderbuss filled the street full of smoke and deafening noise the bullet a handhammered lump of lead missed its target at least fifty feet the men bearing the coffinshaped box swore their best paiskad oaths we are followers of mogwei howled their chief at this the fellow with the portable cannon whirled and fled terrified mere mention of the name of mogwei had been sufficient to puncture his balloon of courage as he ran he bellowed the alarm men of mogwei the devilfaced one he broadcast they number a thousand and the blue meteor is coming this last was stark exaggeration induced by the fellows fear of mogwei such was the awe in which the mysterious master of the blue meteor was held that tibetans disappeared from the streets crannies and doorways seemed to absorb them in the fashion that droughtridden earth soaks up the first drops of rain the mogwei henchmen advanced rapidly making for the edge of the settlement it is well said the man in charge we shall leave the village without difficulty then we will hurry with the fair flower to mogwei master of masters who wears the mask of bron the halfking of hell bolting about in the coffinlike box rae stanley wondered why doc was making no attempt to rescue her she did not believe the bronze man had been wounded and after the terrific effort which doc had made at freeing her it did not seem reasonable that he would give up suddenly her heart leaped to her ears came a note like a gigantic bullfiddle the sound one short roar was deafening men screeched rae sustained minor bruises as her prison box was dropped from the bearers shoulders three tibetans were down they were not moving but a close observer might have noted that their breath was coming freely they were victims of the mercy bullets with which docs men had charged their small superfiring machine pistols it was these weapons which had made the bullfiddle roarings monk came charging out of the night disdaining the use of his rapidfirer he clutched with hairy hands for a foe an ape bawled the prospective victim he managed to evade monk and fled calling upon his ancestors to forgive his numerous sins monk veered left and collared another man he lifted the fellow without apparent difficulty and slammed him among his companions renny monster fists sledging tremendous blows bounded in from the side ham trailed him his sword cane unsheathed and making sounds not unlike a plucked banjo string johnny an animated skeleton and long tom his pale face a gray blur in the night trailed into the scrap their guns emitted deafening hoots and more tibetans caved down the attack was too sudden too violent for the men of mogwei they retreated wildly monk and the others followed the frightened tibetans the tiny machine guns continued to moan but strangely enough all of the shots seemed to miss no more tibetans were dropping the unearthly roaring of the weapons a sound totally new to the ears of the roundfaced asiatics brought great fear however they raced down a gloomy alley of a street intent on getting away from the fearsome little guns after covering a hundred yards their leader awakened to the fact that they had slightly outdistanced the pursuit lih ding he barked halt we dare not run away in this fashion mogweis band falls heavily upon cowards the others came to a stop now that the first surprise was over they realized they feared mogwei more than the amazing guns wielded by docs aides they unlimbered their own pistols and rifles and opened fire powder flame flushed the street a gory red sounds of the shots rolled over the town and came bouncing back from the nearby hills in chains of echoes docs aides returned only scattering shots none of the bullets hit human targets the rapidfirers did not blast out their appalling noise they have exhausted the ammunition for their strange guns shouted a tibetan charge them before they can reload the stocky men rushed firing recklessly resistance melted away magically in front of them they flee howled a moonfaced man delightedly they are dogs who lose courage after one loud bark screeched another it was noticeable however that the men of mogwei refrained from pursuing docs five aides whose retreat was so surprising considering their fierce attack the tibetans ran to the coffinlike box the ropes were still about it one man started to undo these intending to learn if their captive was still inside shoving his comrade aside another fellow grasped the end of the box and lifted he grunted under the weight it is heavy hence the fair flower is still within he stated the men shouldered the coffin box gathered up the victims of conflict they numbered quite a few by now and quitted the confines of tonyi in great haste this ones small wisdom fails to fathom why our unworthy attackers fled so hastily puzzled a tibetan when the last house was left behind cowards have white skins occasionally he was reminded they mounted a narrow rutted road the going here was difficult and there was much complaining about the weight of the unconscious men what manner of magic brought senselessness at the bronze mans touch muttered a man that is truly a mystery said another they seem only to sleep yet they cannot be awakened stuff thy mouths with mumdah felt snapped the leader such an act would bring on silence which is much to be desired after this there was a general conserving of breath for the climb they came at last to a thicket of larch trees here waited an arabas upon this cumbersome twowheeled cart the coffinshaped box was lashed clambering upon the wheels which were nearly six feet high the tibetans piled their strangely unconscious comrades atop the case the arabas was drawn by five horse three at the wheel and two in tandem a tibetan loaded the bloused upper portion of his robe with small rocks then mounted the arabas the vehicle set off at a great pace the charioteer employing his supply of rocks to keep his five horses in fast motion here in the open country there was ample moonlight to disclose the trail the driver glanced frequently at his sleeping cohorts strange this sleep which has gripped them he mumbled chapter professor stanley daylight saw the arabas and the cavalcade of tibetans far to the northward they had been traveling steadily traversing a mountain pass they had encountered a snow flurry for at this great altitude no month was entirely free of a wintry touch white flakes stuck to their clothing and to the shaggy fur of the ponies pulling the arabas they were crossing a sai a great stretch of sand and boulders horsehair which with the first appearance of the morning sun they had hung down over their eyes as a precaution against snow blindness was still in place my legs have become as dead yaks groaned a man who was having difficulty lifting one foot and putting it ahead of the other they were all on the point of exhaustion for there had been few halts for rest due to their haste and the necessity of untying and removing wounded men from atop it the coffinshaped box had not been opened nor had any of the strangelysleeping men awakened the leader now advanced and rapped on the box are you comfortable o fairest flower he demanded of course not replied a muffled angry voice from within the box let me out the tibetan smiled and dropped back among his men the voice in the box he had recognized as rae stanleys he had in fact tapped on the box numerous times during the night he wanted to make sure their prisoner did not freeze to death for it was very cold the little caravan reached the edge of the sai below in a valley was a small ramshackle village in architecture this settlement was not unlike the pueblos of certain american indian tribes the roofs however were of the sweeping asiatic style it was evident the village had been long abandoned and that the present tenants abided there only temporarily shaggy ponies were picketed near by and riding yaks were to be seen men came from the decrepit pueblo and stuck out their tongues at the newcomers by way of extending a polite greeting more substantial welcome appeared in the form of yak horn goblets full of kumis having downed this beverage of fermented mares milk the late arrivals immediately felt better is the allwise mogwei present one asked he is was the reply and he will see the fair flower at once the coffin of a box was hurriedly unlashed from the twowheeled cart the wounded thugs were hauled off together with the men who were strangely asleep what evil magic has befallen these slumbering sticks growled a tibetan that omanwhoasksquestions is a mystery the weirdly quiescent fellows were dragged away to their quarters among the injured men broken arms were the worst hurts come grunted a man mogwei awaits you the casketlike box was carried toward the door of this village which was so remindful of one manyroomed house a particularly cold blast of morning wind came squealing across the sai and down into the canyon blessed be mogwei for selecting this abandoned village of the mad ones for our temporary headquarters muttered a man i have no liking for the cold of these high places they bore the box down a narrow passage one tibetan going ahead lighted the way with a flaming bundle of tushkin or mountain sage there were no windows here in the depths of the dead town and the way was inky the air smelled of the inevitable buttered tea fermenting barley beer and of men badly in need of a bath an aroma of incense became noticeable and grew stronger until it entirely overcame the less pleasant scents the cavalcade descended crude stairs and wheeled into a room which was very large and lighted by two guttering copper lamps the chamber had been hewn from solid stone there were no windows or other doors no rugs padded the floor no tapestries blanketed the walls the incense odor was almost overpoweringly strong here in this bare room lower the box offspring of silly partridges rattled a shrill quarrelsome voice no one had appeared the piping voice was very loud however it penetrated to all corners of the room the men lowered the coffinshaped case is the fair flower in that box asked the strident voice yes allwise mogwei goats shrilled the weird voice address me as mogwei the devilfaced master of the blue meteor and future master of all mankind it is the fair flower in the box o mogwei the devilfaced master of the blue meteor and master of all mankind to be the tibetan repeated obediently the disagreeable voice rang out in laughter somehow it sounded as if a guinea hen were cackling its owner was unseen that has a sweet sound my sons mogwei said when his mirth subsided i will be master of all that lives and i will share richly with you who have cast your lot with me the tibetans licked lips and looked greedy and pleased at this emptyheaded ones shrieked the voice suddenly changing from delight to squawking rage do not stand there tell me did you find any trace of those offspring of fishing worms shrops and saturday loo no trace o master an irate screeching filled the room it was not a guinea hen sound this time but more of the racket which might be expected from a shrewish parrot i should give you to the blue meteor it squawked such dotards are of no use to one who will soon be master of all the world the tibetans blanched at this evidently mogwei was in the habit of carrying out such threats they fell to their knees each man protruded his tongue as far as he possibly could although ludicrous to an unknowing onlooker such an exhibition was the most abject form of humility to these tribesmen we searched industriously o future master of mankind whined a frightened villain but of shrops and saturday loo we could find no trace at all they are in tonyi asserted mogwei the fact that the girl was in town proves shrops and saturday loo were also present they brought her they are concealing themselves cleverly then o master i will dispatch more intelligent men to search for them declared mogwei now dullards open the box which holds the fair flower the tibetans pounced upon the coffin case while untying the bindings one man dared to look upward mogwei crouched on a bedlike platform which was suspended from the ceiling by four chains the platform was obviously of modern bulletproof steel above it was a square opening through which mogwei no doubt clambered to reach his hanging perch the ceiling aerie was a simple device but it guarded against attack by knife or rifle of the master fiend himself only a hideous purple mask was visible the mask had a red clot of a nose villainous yellow eyes and two great upturned horns it was intended to represent the yak demon an ogre tibetans consider among the worst here is the fair flower o master a tibetan opened the box had surprise possessed the power to kill every disciple of mogwei in the chamber would have dropped dead instead of rae stanley the mighty frame of doc savage raised from the coffin container his bronze hand lashed out the finger tips brushing the jowl of the man who had opened the box the fellow collapsed a second tibetan chancing to have in his hand the sharp dao with which he had cut the bindings of the box hurtled forward he struck fiercely it seemed to the moonfaced fiend that nothing could prevent the steel thorn of his dao from finding the bronze mans heart he had knifed other men and he had whetted his blade to a razor edge on his boots of yak hide experience and a sharp knife he felt sure would finish the bronze giant he even started a yell of triumph ni kani look watch him die the blade gashed thin air in a manner that seemed beyond human ability the bronze man had moved aside the yell still pumping from his throat the knifeman fell across the coffin of a box but as he went down docs fingers stroked his exposed skin the wielder of the dao did not arise from his sprawled posture across the case but lay perfectly motionless a rather windy snore fluttered his lips the first man to fall also seemed asleep both men had succumbed instantaneously to the magic in docs touch consternation gripped the other tibetans they fell backward pawing for weapons two bolted unashamedly for the door overhead mogwei cackled like a guinea hen being forced to watch a hawk gobble up its chicks doc scooped up the knife which had missed its mark in his heart his goldflake eyes drove a glance upward but mogwei had prudently drawn all parts of his person from view doc threw the knife at a copper lamp and the lamp hopped end over end and extinguished stripping the bulky fur cap off the second unconscious man doc flung it at the other lamp that too went out a monster of blackness seemed to swallow the room silence fell the tibetans with their guns drawn were waiting for some sound from doc no doubt they were wondering as well how doc had managed to take the girls place in the box in the excitement in tonyi of course they had not noted the change in weight not knowing of the tiny portable radio transmitter which the bronze man carried and with which he had directed his men to stage the attack in tonyi the tibetans had reason to be puzzled eventually it would dawn upon them that the assault had been made to draw them away from the casketlike box so that the substitution of doc for rae stanley might be accomplished without detection for a long time probably they would ponder bow the voice of rae stanley or a voice sufficiently like it to fool them had spoken to them from the box the mystery would be clarified however to those who learned that doc savage through unremitting practice had developed an ability to imitate any voice including even the thriller feminine tones doc savage positioning himself silently under the banging bulletproof steel bed of mogwei crouched low and leaped upward his arms were extended high above his head he hoped to reach mogweis bower the distance was too great dropping back to the floor doc made no sound he heard mogwei stirring the master of villainy seemed to be clambering up through the hole in the ceiling doc pushed a hand inside his clothing and brought out an object of metal approximately the size of a pigeon egg he wrapped an arm around his head in such a manner that his ears were covered he flipped the metallic egg across the room the entire earth seemed to jar apart so terrific was the report which followed the object had exploded in midair and its blast while doing no damage to walls or ceiling almost ruptured eardrums the flash of the blast was blinding as well doc removed his arm from his ears his eardrums were singing the tibetans with no protection over their aural organs would be deaf to ordinary sound for some seconds seizing upon the coffin box doc upended it under mogweis platform he mounted the case then used his flashlight briefly to locate the hanging bed of steel he leaped caught the contraption and swung atop it the deafened tibetans did not hear him mogwei however had long since retreated through the ceiling hole doc followed after him he found himself on a level floor his flash beam waving like a whitehot wire picked up mortared stone walls and a door doc whipped through the aperture ahead he caught a scuttling sound he spiked his flash beam at the noise ugly flame licked at him and he doused his tight and weaved aside barely in time to let lead whistle past the bronze man went forward he twisted through another low door the feet ahead were running obviously it was mogwei in flight then came a grinding of rusty metals and a thump noises which indicated a door was closing an instant later doc encountered the panel it was solid ponderous and fastened on the opposite side he rammed it with a herculean shoulder the cumbersome door only squeaked from his finger tips doc stripped tiny bronze caps these were thimblelike and so cleverly constructed that only closest scrutiny would reveal their presence the thimbles held tiny hypodermic needles containing a drug which induced instant unconsciousness these devices held the secret of docs magic touch with his finger tips freed of the caps doc drew another of the pigeon eggs of metal he wedged this in a cranny in the coarse timbers of the door released the timetrigger and leaped back hands covering his ears there was a flash an earsplitting roar parts of the ceiling came down the door was turned into a cloud of flying beams and massive cedar planks doc waded through the subsiding storm of wreckage and glided down the black corridor beyond stairs led him downward he listened as he descended there was silence he went on more rapidly the passage zigzagged right then left and dropped in a twentyfoot flight of stairs once more doc halted to listen there came a shriek hideous with terror it was followed by a slipslapslup of a sound this terminated in a louder thump doc ran forward his flashlight gorging the gloomy subterranean corridor with light he passed numerous closed doors help cried a feeble voice from behind one of these doors the word was in english doc went on more stairs dropped away steeply he scooted his flash beam down these a man sprawled at the bottom of the steep stone staircase he was folded in the middle jackknifed backward in a fashion that meant a broken spine a repulsive mask of bron the yak demon lay beside the awfully hinged body doc descended swiftly using his flash long before he reached the sprawled figure he saw steam curling from the mouth and nostrils from distended eyeballs and from various oozing strings of crimson where skin had been broken in the fall it was very cold even in these depths and the steam was formed simply because the body was moist and warm the man was dead killed in the fall down the stairs doc turned him over to get a look at the face the features were altogether unlovely being round and cheese yellow with black pencil dots for eyes and a tiny puncture for a mouth the dead mans jaw sagged as doc turned him over and the small mouth came open to its greatest extent doc cast his light within he sank to a knee and examined the interior of the lifeless ones mouth then arising he went back to the door at the top of the stairs the door from behind which a voice had called in english for help the panel was secured on the outside by a stout bar shouldering the bar back doc prepared to open the door but delayed the movement while he called out a question who is in there he demanded stanley quavered the voice professor elmont stanley chapter the stanley story doc savage planted his flashlight upon professor elmont stanley stanley hardly looked like the leading world authority on the composition of planetoids and the scientist who went to the ends of the globe to investigate meteors his frame had never been robust probably and now it was virtually fleshless his skin was a sickly hue as if it might have been washed with a pale solution of nicotine his eyes were sunken far back in their sockets as if the supporting substance had leaked away from behind them not a hair grew on his head he had no trace of beard eyebrows or cranial hirsuteness the effect was that of a big yellow skull doc savage had seen professor stanleys picture in a scientific journal more than two years before this was the same man but doc was barely able to recognize the fact stanley had apparently undergone great suffering the wreck of a man clasped his hands together in hysterical delight as he stared at doc take me out of here he screamed weakly save me calm doc advised quietly can you move about a little stanley mumbled the devils have fed me well its only the accursed blue meteor that has sapped my strength come on doc directed professor stanley seemed anxious to explain just what horror he had been undergoing theyve been using me as a subject for experiments he wailed they expose me to the blue meteor then try out different cures on me then they have a cure doc asked yes otherwise i would be a stark raving maniac they moved into the corridor when were you seized doc asked shortly after my caravan left tonyi replied the wasted scientist that must have been months ago maybe years i have lost all track of time my confinement has been hideous what is the blue meteor doc persisted after listening professor stanley shook his head it seems incredible but i do not know it is some horrible glittering thing and it produces an absolute suspension of brain activity what about the cure for its effects i do not know what that is either they gave it to me when i was under the spell of their hideous blue thing doc led the way toward the stairs at the foot of which lay the body of the man with the broken back i was pursuing mogwei he said have you ever seen his face professor stanley shuddered nnever and few of his men have seen it i understand doc reached the head of the staircase and trickled his light down to the body is that the mask mogwei wears he asked yes yelled stanley is he dead broken back doc replied mogwei dead stanley mumbled the world has been rid of an incredible monster that is not mogwei doc advised not mogwei had a voice explained doc that fellow down there is a mute his tongue was cut out some time in the past working rapidly doc began opening rickety doors and whipping his flashlight around the rooms beyond the dead man was probably mogweis bodyguard he decided being a mute and possibly unable to write he could not spread tales of his masters doings professor stanley offered hoarsely mogwei had a shrill parrot voice perhaps this tongueless man could speak of not a chance doc retorted mogwei gave his bodyguard the mask somewhere along this passage and ducked into a door the guard went ahead being unaccustomed to the mask he stumbled and fell going down the stairs listen stanley gulped the devils men are coming the gloomy passage was starting to throb with running feet to echo with distorted yells at the far end a gray flush of light appeared and danced it was a torch of tushkin doc extinguished his own light he was a trifle slow to the accompaniment of coughing thunder a bullet snapped down the rocky corridor well have to neglect mogwei for the moment he advised stanley im afraid well never gget out of here as it is the wasted scientist quavered they descended the stairs and came to the brokenbacked body of the mute man doc scooped up the mask of the yak demon then he carried the corpse itself into the handiest room and placed it in a remote nook where it was unlikely to be discovered the pursuers were much closer now quiet doc warned and set out down the passage professor stanley seemed too feeble to travel silently for his feet made faint scuffings doc lifted the scientist bodily and carried him juggling the yak mask under his free arm stanley felt like an armload of bones at the first opportunity doc mounted he turned to the left his going was without noise and the pursuers soon lost the trail they spread like hounds baying to each other in voices that rattled through the underground passages ahead of doc daylight appeared it came through a ragged hole in the ceiling wind whistled in the opening and a sugary stream of snow poured down doc lowered stanley then he leaped caught the rim of the hole with his hands and looked outside rooftops were around him holes gaped where more than one roof had fallen in snow was drifted behind parapets doc dropped back he grasped stanley and tossed him up until the thin scientists hands clamped the roof edge and the fellow could wriggle outside catch doc directed and flung up the purple yak mask doc followed he guided stanley across the roofs leaping from spot to spot to avoid the snow why bring the mask stanley quavered doc did not answer instead he selected a spot behind a chimney where snow was drifted waistdeep im going to leave you in hiding and do some reconnoitering he told the gaunt expert on meteors stay exactly where i place you understand is that necessary why can i not go getting out of this place is not going to be a simple matter doc advised the sides of the valley are without cover and these fellows have modern rifles you stick here while i look around very well the cadaverous man muttered unwillingly lifting stanley doc skidded him feetfirst into the snowdrift back of the chimney then using his tibetan gown which he removed doc fanned the snowdrift smooth no casual eye could detect evidence that it had been disturbed keeping low and moving with furtive speed doc crossed the snowspotted rooftops in surmising that the slopes of the valley were being watched by tibetans with modern rifles doc had been correct the guards were on all sides the shouts of their comrades within the pueblolike structure had alarmed them every man was alert the watchmen overlooking the pens holding yaks and shaggy ponies were especially surveillant could the bronze one but reach the ponies he might conceivably escape said a rifleman your words come from the well of deep wisdom agreed another we will watch closely a highpitched querulous voice came from behind them it would seem the sons of mogwei were wise men it said the riflemen whirled and found themselves confronted by an unlovely purple mask of bron the yak demon they could distinguish little of the personage wearing the mask because he was peering around a door jamb they recognized the squawking voice as belonging to mogwei the watchmen instantly sank to their knees protruding their tongues as they did so thy will o mogwei master of the blue meteor and future master of all mankind one muttered keep a sharp lookout ordered the unpleasant tones back of the mask the bronze man has seized upon professor stanley and will attempt to rescue him they may come this way in that case i will call out a guard sprang to his feet likdieng he shrieked look out this man is not mogwei he discharged his rifle at the hideous mask of the yak demon only the fact that the mask wrenched back with lightening speed kept the bullet from lodging in it doc savage it was he who had been imitating mogwei wrenched off the mask and discarded it he retreated swiftly docs idea had been to lead the guards to think mogwei was in the vicinity then to call out for assistance causing them to desert their posts long enough to permit an escape that they had seen through his trickery had profoundly surprised doc his voice imitation of mogwei had been as perfect as he could with all of his consummate skill make it the guards had not been able to see enough of his person to discern that mogwei was not behind the mask yet the ruse had been fathomed doc bounded out on the roof he intended to get professor stanley but he had hardly faced the snowdrift where he had left the gaunt scientist when he came to an abrupt halt stanley was now in the grip of half a dozen moonfaced tibetans they were hauling him to a roof opening doc started toward them a storm of rifle and revolver lead drove him down fiat on the rooftop seeking shelter professor stanley it was mortally certain had disobeyed docs admonition to remain hidden in the snowdrift otherwise he would hardly have been discovered doc was sure that no tibetan had seen him conceal stanley he had kept a close watch against such a possibility on all fours doc worked away from the vicinity men swarmed upon the roof a moment later a group discovered the bronze man rifles set up a clapping uproar and bullets kicked up snow gouged rocks and dried mud and made screaming ricocheting whines two slugs actually opened rips across the back of the robe doc wore although he was half buried in the snow which spotted the rooftop he hastily scrambled to the nearest hole in the roof and dropped through red flame plunged at him from a doorway he had all but fallen into the arms of a party of tibetans another door was a black rectangle across the gloomy room doc moving with a speed that kept rifle sights from finding him ducked through three times in the next five minutes he was shot at the pursuit became hotter and hotter spreading in a great semicircle the man hunters worked toward him getting professor stanley out of the pueblolike village was an impossibility now the place was swarming with the satellites of mogwei there must be at least two hundred of them doc halted discovering a small door to one side he entered the room thirty seconds later he was out again moving with great caution so as not to be seen he left the vicinity he had covered perhaps two hundred feet when a loud report sounded behind him there came a second one tibetans yelled discharged their rifles and rushed the spot they were met by a deafening bang from inside the room in which doc had tarried it sounded like a shot the roundfaced men began pumping bullets into the chamber they kept up the shooting for fully two minutes loud reports answered them from within the room then a man stared at a bit of reddish scorched paper which had flown out of the room and landed at his feet ni kan he shrieked look it is paper off a firecracker the men dashed into the room they found remnants of many exploded firecrackers and others with longtime fuses still fizzing a lowly donkey has a learned brain compared to the sand which fills our own heads wailed a man we have been tricked they scattered to hunt doc savage they did not find him all had been interested in the uproar which had resulted when the men fired upon the exploding firecrackers and no eyes had kept watch on the valley sides by the time the search started doc was over the hill and whipping across the sandy rag the bronze giant ran with a distanceeating stride although he had been carried from tonyi in the box he had thanks to an excellent sense of direction and a small wrist compass a good idea of where the village lay he set a course for it he had been fortunate to escape from the pueblolike village infested by mogweis thugs to rescue professor stanley at this time was beyond even the fabulous abilities of doc savage doc was a veteran of many campaigns and well did he know that retreat under certain circumstances is desirable he had moreover certain highly important ideas which he wanted to work out chapter rae confesses tibetan citizens of the town of tonyi were consuming their midday meal when doc savage appeared in the settlement the meals were very alike for rich and poor consisting of yak steaks or possibly a yak roast bowls of warm yak milk cheese made from yak milk and tea in which plenty of yak butter had been added the lowly yak provided almost everything doc went directly to the house in which he had awakened from the mysterious period of senselessness making no noise he visited several rooms none of his five men were in evidence doc heard a stir in the corridor and stepped out oh gasped pretty rae stanley she stared at doc and radiance overspread her attractive features im so glad youre back she said i was worried you took such a chance in substituting yourself for me in the box where are monk and the others doc asked searching for shrops and saturday loo rae explained shrops and saturday loo were not in the yurt when i guided your men there last night that spoiled our hopes of seizing them doc nodded have you decided to give up that engagement story the young woman colored and showed embarrassment shrops and saturday loo made me deceive you she replied they have my father a prisoner and they threatened to kill him unless i did as they wished doc did not tell her that he had come upon her father dot as a prisoner of shrops and saturday loo but as a tenant in a barred room in mogweis temporary headquarters their purpose was to trick me into wiping out mogwei eh doc asked rae stanley nodded shrops and saturday loo were once partners of mogwei they doublecrossed him taking part of the blue meteor as well as a cure for its effects intended to use it to do some pillaging on their own initiative eh doc surmised exactly they want mogwei out of the way theyre afraid of him themselves and in addition do not know his actual identity so they hit on the bright idea of getting you to polish off mogwei for them they went to south america for that purpose they forced me to go along to aid them to this doc said nothing his flakegold eyes rested steadily upon the young woman she shifted uneasily whether you believe it or not i intended to tell you the whole truth the instant you captured mogwei she said earnestly of course i was not such a fool but that i knew shrops and saturday loo would try to kill you when you had mogwei out of the way doc still made no reply dont you believe me wailed the girl the part of your first story about your father going into the desert by caravan and leaving you here with a missionary was true insisted rae stanley i swear it was true what do you know of this blue meteor of its actual composition doc questioned nothing at ail absolutely nothing shrops and saturday loo kept it from me loud voices came from an outer room feet thumped and scuffed the hard earth floor monk came in his bigeared pet pig habeas corpus under an arm well well the homely chemist grinned i hope i didnt bust into no private talk between fiance and fiancee the engagement is off snapped rae stanley then she looked at doc and her neck became faintly pink great monk said gallantly that gives the rest of us a chance except for ham here who is handicapped by his wife and thirteen halfwit children the sartorially perfect lawyer trailing monk into the room scowled darkly and fingered his sword cane whenever a race for a young womans favor was in prospect monk invariably told the wifeandthirteenhalfwits story while this preposterous yarn was not generally believed a girl was inclined to doubt ham after hearing it one of these days im gonna shave you and see if theres really a man under that hair ham told the furry monk renny entered huge fists dangling like buckets of reddish concrete on the ends of his arms long tom even paler by daylight and the bony johnny followed what about shrops and saturday loo doc demanded we looked into every yurt around town replied gaunt johnny theyve skipped without the slightest hesitation doc began issuing orders long tom was to assemble his electrical devices monk was to concoct grenades filled with a gas which would produce unconsciousness but not death renny was instructed to negotiate for the purchase of two yurts and sufficient extra felt mumdahs for bed coverings johnny was to buy yaks and ham collect food money for all this came from one of docs bags miraculously the funds had not been disturbed saturday loo and shrops didnt want to handicap us doc decided whats the idea of the outfitting asked monk were going after mogwei as well as shrops and saturday loo you have a line on mogweis whereabouts docs only reply to this was a brief nod his five men although they would have liked mightily to hear their bronze chiefs story did not press questions they knew very well that it would be of no use rae stanley however was not so well acquainted with docs ways you havent told us your own story she reminded doc the metallic giant seemed not to have heard did you learn anything of my father rae persisted doc might have been afflicted with a sudden deafness he busied himself assembling his own scientific equipment rae stanley stamped a foot angrily say what monk caught her arm shhh he guided her outside then explained youre wasting your breath the girl wrinkled her attractive brow hut what got into him why wouldnt he answer my questions is he miffed because i tried to fool him with that engagement fib nothing like that the homely chemist told her then what ails him the beauty was evidently not accustomed to having men ignore her queries its just docs way monk explained in some ways the big fellow is beyond understanding but what he does always turns out right you can depend on that thats not a clear explanation monk mentally threw up his hands all right all right he chuckled i cant explain why doc does things hes too deep for me hes wonderful isnt he the young woman said perversely you said it monk grinned me and these other four palookas have been around doc for years yet there aint a day passes but that were amazed at something he accomplishes where does be get his marvelous ability rae stanley asked wonderingly he takes two hours of terrific exercise every day monk told her exercises that develop all his senses the mahoganyhaired girl considered this he must study a lot too sure monk a greed but he does something else even more remarkable he disappears completely for long periods and not even the other four or myself know where he goes disappears for weeks or even months and always he comes back with some great scientific discovery all we know is that he goes to his fortress of solitude where he studies and carries on scientific experiments without possibility of an interruption i can understand how such a remarkable man would suit himself about answering questions said rae stanley her tone however said she understood nothing of the sort and that she was still piqued at doc want to help me mix chemicals monk asked sure much to the dapper hams disgust monk and rae proceeded to get along excellently ham hated to see his homely sparring mate make a hit with anything feminine grumbling ham rambled off to purchase food well meet near the yurt formerly occupied by shrops and saturday loo doc advised load the food and other stuff on the yaks johnny will purchase leave the pig monk too cold in the mountains hire a tibetan villager to take care of him docs men had a manner of moving swiftly when on the trail of gentlemen such as mogwei shrops or saturday loo an hour had not yet elapsed when they gathered near the yurt which rae stanley had visited the night before monk had located a custodian for habeas corpus thats it said rae indicating the yurt doc eyed the young woman levelly you he said are not accompanying us and you retorted the girl are mistaken im going along doc glanced at the homely monk on occasions in the past the bronze mans aides had noted a weird quality about docs flakegold eyes a strange ability to convey orders with their glance just now docs gaze suggested that monk return the young lady to town whether or not such was her wish monk took raes arm docs right he said its too dangerous for you ham gesturing with his sword came interrupted hey doc he rapped have you checked up on the attitude of the people in this village for some reason theyre particularly down on white people we had to pay a dozen prices for food yaks and two yurts otherwise we wouldnt have gotten them it might be dangerous to leave the young woman among them without a word doc wheeled and strode into the town of tonyi ten minutes later he was back youre right ham he said these people have an actual mania against whites we will take the young lady along thank you said rae stanley she gave monk a cold look and smiled ravishingly upon ham as a reward for his intercession she walked off on hams arm monk glowering after the couple asked doc say what has riled these villagers against whites getting no answer to this monk looked around doc had either not heard the query or had ignored it the bronze man was over beside the yurt in docs hand was a tank device to which was attached that which resembled a small spray nozzle there was a pump for forcing compressed air into the tank doc was operating this pump he pointed the nozzle at the earth and turned a valve with a hissing an almost colorless spray poured out doc fanned this back and forth over the earth in front of the yurt entrance in magical fashion grayish footprints sprang out it looked as if some one had stepped in whitewash then walked out of the yurt holy cow boomed renny whats that conducting them into the yurt doc pointed out near the inside of the floor a film of liquid the color of water but as sticky as molasses he turned his sprayer on the colorless stuff instantly there was formed by the union of chemicals in the spray and in the sticky material a gray precipitate i placed this chemical mixture inside the yurt door last night after rae stanley departed doc explained rae stanley seeming somewhat dazed by the manner in which the giant bronze man pulled figurative rabbits out of hats gasped why this enables us to follow shrops and saturday loo lets go said ham it looks like they beaded straight away from town as ham had pointed out the grayish tracks left by shrops and saturday loo beelined away from tonyi doc followed them swiftly the others trailing with the yaks and the supplies only occasionally did doc find it necessary to use his chemical device for his eyes trained by scientific exercise from his cradle days possessed an ability to read sign beyond that of other men at times villagers had crossed the trail however and on such occasions the spraying apparatus was essential approximately a mile from the settlement it was evident that a sizable force of men had joined with shrops and saturday loo their gang monk surmised reading the now easily distinguishable evidence of the meeting they all lit out to the north wonder what theyre up to theyve got yaks and ponies ham who was riding a yak beside pretty rae stanley hooted his ungainly steed up and suggested my idea is that shrops and saturday loo knowing doc was onto their game or suspecting that he might get onto it decided to try some potshooting at mogwei on their own hook nobody asked for your idea growled monk who was not pleased by the manner in which the dressy lawyer was monopolizing the young womans attentions i think he is right said rae fixing monk with a frosty eye k monk groaned lets trail after em maybe theyll clean up on each other and save us a lot of trouble chapter the trick sunset found monk still groaning now however his laments had to do with yaks in general and their riding qualities in particular ive traveled in lots of ways be howled but this takes the cake by a long stretch such a gait monk evidently meant the peculiar manner in which a yak in motion seems to trot with its front legs and amble with the rear legs the fact that attractive rae stanley had shown a marked preference for hams company through the entire afternoon did not tend to soothe monks temper rae now glanced about high mountains jutted up about them these were absolutely bare of vegetation and an uninviting brownishred in hue not unlike the peaks of arizona thats strange she remarked or maybe its not strange either what are you talking about ham asked her my father listened to all the legends he could dig up concerning the blue meteor the young woman replied the general consensus seemed to be that the meteor struck in mountains such as these weve been going steadily northward ham agreed i wouldnt he surprised if we were in the region where the infernal thing hit ham might have been surprised however had he known that they were now in the vicinity of the pueblolike village to which doc savage had been carried in the coffinshaped box doc had told no one of the existence of the village of the mad ones in fact he had spoken no word concerning his encounter with mogwei or with professor elmont stanley they were still on the trail of shrops and saturday loo the sticky chemical of course had long since worn off the shoes of those they followed but it was a simple matter for doc to follow a trail such as was being made by shrops and his party doc savage was ranging ahead of the others picking out the trail they were not heading directly for the village of the mad ones but circling around it doc appeared suddenly in the twilight he approached monk how about playing bait in a little trap he asked his voice so low that none of the others heard it huh monk grunted its dangerous doc said frankly count on me monk grinned what dyou want me to do just drop behind the party doc told him and dont take chances by that i mean dont do anything reckless you know me monk chuckled sure doc told him dryly thats why im warning you not to get reckless doc now moved forward until he came alongside long torn the electrical wizard can you keep tuned in steadily on your portable radio receiver doc queried easily long tom replied by way of demonstration he removed his bulky fur cap they were all wearing tibetan garb which was best fitted to these high altitudes and donned a radio headset the outfit was compact and he was able to draw his fur cap on over it long tom switched on the receiving side of the portable outfit all set he advised doc doc savage nodded he visited other members of the party but the words which be addressed to them had only to do with their comfort a few minutes later the bronze man went on ahead and the oncoming night swallowed him ridin this yak is like sittin on a hump of hair monk complained monk was referring to the manner in which yaks walk with beads held low making it seem to the rider that his steed has no head giddap grunted monk and booted his yak in the ribs the yak promptly came to a complete stop monk had known the animal would do this having learned something of yak temperament during the afternoon ride the creatures balked when tired or angry the rest of the caravan drew ahead mounting a small hill there was a sly delight on monks pleasantly ugly features doc had said there would be danger and when the bronze man mentioned danger be usually meant extreme peril monk however was unworried this was the sort of thing he thrived upon he was quite happy although not possessed of the slightest idea of what was due to happen getting off his yak he made a show of trying to get it in motion a rope was tied to a ring in the animals nose monk pulled on this the yaks nose stretched rubberlike a surprising distance ill walk monk growled and threw down the rope the remainder of the cavalcade had topped the bill and become lost to sight monk strode after them looking around within a few seconds however he saw his balky yak following closely after him the life of adventure he complained and went back to have another try at riding the tibetan version of a charger he snapped to an abrupt halt two squat tobaccocolored men had appeared one on either side of the trail they held efficient automatic rifles and these were trained on monk silence is a food on which men thrive under certain conditions one murmured softly monk understood the longwinded command for silence and the gentle tones did not fool him he elevated his furry hands the stocky fellows stepped close and removed monks weapons in a cautious manner as if be were some ferocious beast which they were afraid of prodding into activity monk recognized them they were some of the swart gentry who had seized himself and ham in south america weeks before shropss gang he grunted silence big monkey ordered a rifleman shrops left you two behind to watch the trail huh monk ruminated one of the rifles cocked with a distinct click monk hastily subsided remembering docs admonition to avoid recklessness doc of course had foreseen this had guessed exactly what would happen one of the dark men smirked we talked the situation over out there among the rocks he said we have decided to take you to the allwise shrops hell be the alltopieces shrops if i ever get my hands on im monk promised inwardly the hirsute chemist was elated he understood now how doc had foreseen this docs sharp gaze had detected these guards left behind by shrops and the bronze man had overheard their decision to take any prisoners they might catch to shrops alive it is to be regretted that we could not capture more than one of you said one of the two captors you see to secure your release doc savage will have to eliminate the mostawful mogwei doc will wring your necks monk growled to cook a chicken it is first necessary to catch it chuckled the asiatic ni chu ba be off walk ahead of us monk complied with the command making an effort to seem worried doc he realized was somewhere out there in the darkness the bronze man would follow monk and his captors to shrops and saturday loo monk could hear rennys deep voice rumbling beyond the hilltop as he moved off the trait distance made the cavernous tones unintelligible renny was saying it looks like things are starting to happen at last attractive rae stanley who had failed to notice anything peculiar in recent developments turned her head what do you mean she asked long tom the electrical magician held up a hand in the murk quiet please he requested for some moments he listened intently to what was coming over the portable radio shrops men have seized monk he announced doc is trailing them believing he will be led to shrops oh gasped rae stanley the young woman was astounded that so much had taken place almost under her nose without catching her notice was monk hurt ham demanded the anxiety in the carefully dressed lawyers voice was in marked contrast to the tone which he used to address monk when they were face to face monk is o k long tom replied but how are you learning all of that rae stanley asked doc has a portable radio transmitter and receiver with him the pallid electrical expert told her but i didnt notice it did you notice this one long tom asked and threw open his robe secured to a webbing belt which encircled his chest were three compact flat cases no i hadnt noticed said rae surprised transmitter receiver and current supply long tom told her indicating each of the diminutive containers in succession docs outfit is like this theyre not efficient over any great distance but they serve us to keep in contact with each other whatre we to do renny boomed doc says leave the trail and head due west long tom announced thats the direction monks captors are taking the party hastily followed this suggestion night had descended in its entirety and a brilliant moon and diamondfleck stars had alleviated the murk somewhat it was not going to be a bad night for traveling the group moved slowly letting the surefooted yaks pick their way i hope poor monk makes it all right ham groaned monk at the moment was hardly as worried as ham over his prospects he was keeping up a conversation which seemed rambling and inane but which was actually calculated to draw morsels of information from his unwelcome hosts you fellows are pretty smart he said flatteringly ill bet some of you managed to get yourselves hired by professor elmont stanley when he made up his caravan to go in search of the blue meteor monk who did not know that doc had located professor stanley was trying to learn the whereabouts of the meteor expert we have never seen professor stanley replied one of the brown men in answer to monks query huh monk ejaculated at no time have we seen him but i thought you guys had him a prisoner both of the homely chemists captors laughed harshly all wise men know that dangers which exist only in thought are as terrible as those which exist in reality one of the pair explained longwindedly we fooled the girl you mean shrops lied to her about having her dad thy small brain has grasped the truth hairy one monk ignored this insult while he considered what he had learned is mogwei holding professor stanley the chemist demanded the tibetans did not answer immediately we know not they replied at last but there are rumors of a hairless white man of great learning who has surrendered his brain to the blue meteor that would be stanley monk shuddered you say the blue meteor has got him do you mean that mogwei has been usin stanley as a subject for experiments the information you wish is not in our brains answered the other you dont know eh for the love of mud werent you members of mogweis gang before you sided in with shrops and saturday loo mogweis men know not their master nor do they know much of his movements or affairs did you guys have much trouble makin off with a piece of the blue meteor we were clever said the tibetan proudly we escaped with the blue meteor and with the cure for its effects before we were discovered monk made his voice elaborately casual the pair were talking much more freely than he had expected he had visions of learning exactly what the hideous blue meteor was is it heavy to carry this blue meteor he asked men do not carry it retorted the dark man it is hauled upon yaks except at times when it would thou like to lose thy tongue fool snarled the other captor this hairy one is sucking information from you as a yak calf draws sustenance from its mother monk learned no more they worked down into a deep canyon and crossed a rapidlyrunning stream a peculiar point about the rivulet was the fact that anchor ice had formed on the bottom although the water itself was moving too fast to freeze wading the stream was a slippery process they climbed on upward monk kept his ears attuned in an effort to catch some sound which would indicate doc savage was trailing them he heard absolutely nothing contrarily enough this did not worry monk he knew docs ability indeed had he heard any sound he would have reflected that doc must be slipping lih ding rapped a voice halt monks captors came to a stop would thou shake down the mountains with thy voice growled one of the pair not so loud men materialized out of the darkness some of these monk recollected having seen in antofagasta chile others were strangers but obviously all were shropss men we have a hairy morsel for the allwise shrops said one of monk captors giving the furry chemist a prod with a rifle barrel let us hope it soothes his temper muttered a sentry is he not at peace with himself he is in a great rage why saturday leo has disappeared monk listening to this with great interest put in saturday loo probably went over to mogweis side a moonfaced thug promptly kicked monk in the middle the kick thanks probably to long practice at booting yaks was hard and painful monk lost his temper with a backslap of a huge hirsute paw he knocked the kicker head over heels a man lunged in swinging a rifle with a bewildering speed monk grasped the weapon twisted it from the man and dropped the former owner with a swing of the barrel to monks ears came a low sound it was a note which seemed strangely to fit the bleak towering mountain surroundings with their bitter cold and snow and ice it might have been some chill wind from the fastnesses of the himalayas that sound it was a low trilling which drifted lazily up and down the musical scale then slowly sank into complete nothingness monk recognized it as the sound of doc savage he stopped struggling the trilling meant doc was warning him not to get himself killed what was that asked a tibetan in a quavering voice a wind o fool grunted a comrade come let us take this hairy one to the allwise shrops chapter blue terror a yurt strikingly like an inverted gray bowl a dozen feet in diameter had been erected in the lee of a cluster of housesized boulders the chill wind whooped and moaned it seized the numdah covering of the kurt and clapped it against the wooden skeleton it made the fire of teyzak burn more briskly more bluely than it should have the cockney jolin mark shrops crouched over the fire he was not there for comfort exclusively he was warming belts of machine gun ammunition k this intense cold the fulminate in the detonators sometimes froze causing a cartridge to misfire three machine guns lay where the heat would blow upon them in order that the grease in the mechanism would not become too stiff shrops looked up and scowled when monk was shoved into the kurt blister me he exclaimed sourly so youve joined my appy family tblazes with you monk growled soberly shrops listened to his two henchmen tell not without much bragging how they had captured monk the pair made their feat sound like a tremendous accomplishment humph snorted shrops when they had finished but are you not pleased master one of the two asked anxiously get outa ere shrops snarled then translated the comman into profane palskad the brown men retreated out into the cold minus the praise they had expected for their work in apprehending monk you dont seem happy to see me monk said dryly shut up gritted shrops and whipped a gun out of his clothing for a moment monk had visions of receiving a bullet but shrops reconsidered and restored his weapon to its hidden holster a rather brittle silence followed occasionally the wind popped the numdah against the yurt frame the fire smoked and smelled up the habitation a tibetan squirmed into the yurt the scout which you sent to examine the village of the mad ones has returned he reported send im in you barmy goat rapped shrops in his ill temper the cockney spoke english the tibetan only looked puzzled not comprehending the words usher him to my presence one without sense shrops said lapsing into the language of the country a scrawny yellowish fellow entered considering the chill of these heights he wore astoundingly few clothes he was breathing loudly and heavily from a long run the village of the mad ones is deserted he reported but there are signs which show mogweis men were there only today cooking stones were still warm when i felt of them gone to is other angout snapped shrops the messenger took his departure after looking longingly at the teyzak fire what is this village of the mad ones asked monk who had listened curiously its a town where everybody went barmy shrops growled they went mad because the blue meteor had buried itself somewhere near monk persisted what dyou think you airy ape shrops grunted now keep still hive got me worries hi ave youre afraid saturday loo has gone over to mogwei huh monk asked the resounding limehouse profanity which this elicited from shrops told the homely chemist that his guess had been correct the cockney was fearful that his partner had doublecrossed him time dragged twice shrops went to the kurt door and bellowed a question as any word come from the other scout the one hi sent to mogweis second angout in each case the answer was a negative and the cockney scowled muttered and stamped about the kurt monk watched the fellow several times he saw shrops feel of a certain pocket once the cockney drew from the pocket what seemed to be a metal cylinder with a screwon cap whatever the material in that cylinder it was evidently important monk fell to wondering when doc would go into action the bronze man he believed was lurking somewhere near possibly doc was biding his time in order to gather more in formation before closing with shrops the cockney it appeared had scouts out seeking to locate mogwei monks thoughts were interrupted a shout mingled with the whooping wind a tibetan dived into the kurt breathless perspiration steaming on his tobaccocolored features saturday loo has turned traitor he howled shrops had shown a command of profanity before but it was nothing to the repertoire which he exhibited now the air crackled jarred and sang finally he calmed down the yellow scut he gritted hi should ave known ed fail in a pinch the messenger shifted feet uneasily and panted there was something strange about what i saw master he said whatcha mean shrops growled saturday loo did not go in fear and trembling reported the scout at this speech a blank look overspread shropss applelike features he sank down on a rolled sleeping munidah and his jaw sagged steam poured out of his open mouth for a time then be swallowed blime he gulped twas saturday loo who first came to me an invited me t join mogwei it was the same in my case master said the scout who evidently understood english it was saturday loo who recruited much of mogweis force of men shropss eyes roved and finally came to rest upon monk in his perturbation the cockney seemed to forget that monk was a prisoner dyou know what it looks like he asked hoarsely no said monk what it looks like saturday loo is mogwei shrops mumbled after this statement the cockney took several stamping turns around the kurt expressing an opinion of saturday loo and all of his ancestors back to the legendary monkey abode of the chenresi or compassionate spirit which mated with a shedevil to produce the first tibetan according to the local belief saturday loo is mogwei he yelled angrily what a blind arfwit hive been the clever devil fell in wit my suggestion to steal part the blue meteor an some the cur shrops paused to feel of the pocket which monk had noted him exploring earlier we are in danger here master reminded the scout the location of our camp is now known to our enemies righto shrops agreed an well blame well move tell the bloody men t break camp the scout went out then as if he had been struck a great blow he came flying back inside the blue meteor he bellowed monk shed his lethargy heedless of the fact that he was a prisoner and that any sudden move might draw a bullet he plunged outside his gaze roved then fixed on the northern sky what he saw might have been a blue sunrise had it been in the east it was faint now the most lucent of zaffer flushes but the color was becoming more pronounced soon the boulders began to cast pronounced shadows in the unearthly luminance monks ears picked up a faint squeal a whistling note such as had characterized the blue transient in south america shrops had not come out of the yurt wondering about that monk wheeled and peered inside the cockney was on all fours above a cluster of boxes over which a numdah had been reposing the boxes had black insulating panels dials knobs and switches with a frenzied haste shrops manipulated the controls on the mechanism leaping to his feet the cockney dived out of the felt tent of a shelter he glanced to the north from whence the blue glow was approaching then he peered fixedly into the west it was apparent that he expected something to come out of the west nothing appeared blimme he wailed blimme his apple of a face blanched he kneaded his hands together in an agony of suspense still nothing came out of the west the blue in the northern sky changed from a haze to a glare and this became a glitter which ached the eyes blimme croaked shrops saturday loo as taken my part the blue meteor it should be comin but it aint brown men were yelling in excitement and shielding their eyes against the screaming blue terror in the north they ran toward shrops the cure master they cried shrops slapped his left hand against the pocket which he had touched so often hi aint got enough t go around he barked the main supply the stuff was wit our part the blue meteor an saturday loo mustve made off wit that divide what you have barked a swarthy man shrops dived a hand into his clothing and brought out a revolver back you bloomin dogs he grated hive only got enough t fix one man up the tibetans milled in front of him some were belligerent casting longing eyes at their weapons two or three fell on their knees and stuck their tongues out in attitudes of meek supplication monk taking advantage of the tension sidled toward shrops shrops saw him blarst you the cockney yelled he jutted his gun at monk and pulled the trigger the bullet however climbed off in the direction of the oncoming blue meteor its sound a feeble squeak in the face of the overpowering scream which the blue mystery was making a rock small and jagged had collided with shropss wrist and knocked the gun aside agony made shrops drop his weapon he looked in the direction from which the flung stone had come a giant of bronze was approaching seeming to move with the terrific speed of light shrops whirled yelling in fear and ran monk had ducked at the prospect of receiving a bullet although the act would never have saved him had doc not thrown the rock down on all fours he tried to rear up and pursue the cockney but small rounded stones under him rolled and delayed him doc whipped past terror had lent speed and cunning to shropss flight several yaks were near by shrops sprang upon one of these the yak is ordinarily not a speedy animal but this one was scared it bounded away from the vicinity with an agility which no horse could have equalled on such precarious rocky footing doc pitched in pursuit monk also followed but was soon left far behind the blue glare in the north became more painful to the eye and its shriek racked the ears for some seventy yards doc barely held his own with shrops and the cowlike steed for the going was especially treacherous then he gained rapidly without slackening his pace he scooped up a rock and flung it there was no sound as it hit shrops the thump was as nothing compared to the banshee squawl of the blue meteor shrops his breath jarred out toppled off the yak an instant later doc was upon him a short mauling stroke of a bronze fist reduced the cockney to senselessness doc dipped a hand into shropss pocket he brought out the metal cylinder with a screwon top straightening doc sprinted back toward monk possibly he intended to administer some of the antidote for the blue meteors evil spell to monk perhaps also he hoped to be of some assistance to his other four aides and rae stanley the latter following docs radio directions had kept close to monks captors and were now lurking near the kurt doc could see rae stanley in the shelter of a boulder where until the azure glitter had come out of the north there had been darkness the young woman had both hands pressed over her eyes to shut out the awful light the bronze man stumbled almost fell recovering his balance he went on more sluggishly his metallic features bore frozen determination again he tripped his usual agility seemed to have vanished the weird power of the blue meteor was descending upon his brain it came to doc with certainty that he could not reach his friends in time long before he could even gain monks side he would be down overcome by the power of the meteor and even should he accomplish the impossible and join them there was by shropss attestation only enough of the antidote in the metal cylinder to save one man however not until he went down a third time and could not arise and unintelligible rumbling sounds came from his great lungs when he tried to make words did he open the metal tube he had waited nearly overlong his fingers possessed of a strange aimlessness could hardly remove the cap the instant the cap was free of the cylinder a fantastic blue aurora appeared at the mouth a glow brighter even than the hellblue in the northern heavens the flare leaped upward like flame played there a moment then vanished doc savage seemed to lose all vestige of his remaining might and vitality he sank as if stricken between the eyes with a sledge swung by a brawny arm he was on a steep slope at the moment the region where the pursuit of shrops and the yak had been so difficult he collapsed and there was no level spot to prevent his huge frame from rolling over and over he tumbled downward boulders were loosened and bounced against other boulders and all the rocks joined in a dancing procession down the declivity dust climbed up from the turmoil and snow mingled with it in a gray swirl as drifts were disturbed the giant bronze body of doc savage was lost to sight there grew a great landslide which traveled for thousands of yards down the mountainside before it piled stone shale clay sand and snow in the valley to a depth in spots of a hundred feet but long before the avalanche ceased moving the blue meteor betook itself overhead with a whiplike snap and was gone into the night sky chapter the devils nest men poured over the mountaintop from the left they were mogweis followers and they had been far to one side so that they might escape the hideous effects of the blue meteor despite the fact that none of them had been under the uncanny sky visitor however several individuals of weaker constitution stumbled erratically and seemed a little insane they had not avoided the spell entirely in the lead bounded an apparition in brilliant yellow robes and a purple mask of bron the yak demon mogwei himself he cried out in squawking tones like those of a magpie the bronze man find the bronze man kill him instantly a thug evidently took this to mean that all of the group overcome by the blue meteor were to be slain he plucked a long sword sprang to the side of rae stanley and lifted the blade the young woman stood perfectly motionless in the moonlight her eyes were wide and glassy although the sword blade was suspended before her eyes and murder rode the face of the brown fiend wielding the weapon she gave no sign that she comprehended peril her brain had ceased functioning the swordsman gathered his muscles for the stroke that would end her life there was a rap of a sound like that of a brittle stick breaking only louder the swordsman gave a small jump and fell flat on his back and spots on opposite sides of his skull began to turn red and moist and to steam in the intense cold mogwei waved the automatic pistol with which he had killed his follower keep the prisoners alive for the time being he ordered and his unearthly cackling voice was even stranger than usual at the shot every one had halted they stood and stared at the dead man at mogwei at the girl and the others whose brains had suspended functioning find the bronze devil mogwei cackled again roundfaced men scattered hastily to comply with the order they stood on the mountainside and peered downward where boulders still gnashed together like great teeth they strove to pierce the boiling fog of dust and snow no one could live in that they muttered but they did not take doc savages demise for granted gingerly making a human chain by holding hands they descended the treacherous slope they used powerful flashlights for illumination over the settling debris in the valley they scrambled they peered into cracks and tried to lever boulders aside it would be the work of an army to move all of this they decided so they went up to mogwei and reported the bronze devil who has the lives of a cat is assuredly dead they said ii he is not dead each of you will have a chance to try life without his head mogwei promised in his high irrational gobble the men shivered but stood their ground we will not lose our heads they declared for the bronze man met his end in that landslide good gibbered mogwei tie all of these prisoners and bring them along why not end their lives now because men of small wits the bronze devil may still live in such case we will buy him off with the lives of these others but the bronze one is dead it will do no harm to hold these friends of his they are without their brains and what about shrops a horrible cackle of mirth came from behind the purple yak mask i have a special hell to which i wish to consign shrops said mogwei come let us return to our castle two hours later the men of mogwei filed into their chief stronghold bearing rae stanley doc savages five men shrops and shropss tibetan aides the party made a great evil cloud of humanity which swarmed up one of the numerous mountain peaks of the region atop the peak stood mogweis aerie the place was not unlike a castle minus moat and drawbridge walls were of brown rock mudmortared and windows were almost nonexistent the place towered fully three stories and judging from the amount of debris below the walls there must be numerous subterranean chambers roofs were of hardened mud much of the south side of the peak on which the great structure stood had slid away into a valley below in some past landslide leaving a great sweep of loose rock and exposed clay mogwei stood beside the gate and watched the pitiful captives carried in toward the end he flew into a rage wailing where is their baggage we left it mogwei the devilfaced master of the blue meteor and future master of all mankind their luggage was too much of a burden to carry return and get it omanwhomadethemistakeofthinkingforhimself and take with you a force of men to search that landslide thoroughly for the body of doc savage it is cold and not pleasant silence go the moonfaced man nodded but not cheerfully he glanced at the sky it was very cold tonight and moreover indications were that a buran one of the violent windstorms of central asia might strike before dawn he knew better though than to argue with mogwei gathering a squad of assistants he shuffled off in the chill moonlight mogwei supervised the placing of the prisoners following as they were carried down gloomy passages and through cavernous rooms that smelled of buttered tea and farther on of incense the floors were of stone and did not show great wear the entire structure had been built a long time obviously yet did not seem to have been much tenanted the captives were dumped in a large windowless room the door of which was crossed by a great bar guard them closely mogwei directed from behind his purple mask then be ambled off yellow robes swishing cackling demoniacal mirth silence fell within the confines of the ancient building occasionally low guttural words of palskad were spoken several times meaningless bawling sounds rattled through the subterranean runways and cavernous rooms these noises were human yet without any quality of saneness the sounds were made by the victims of the blue meteor and the tibetans exchanged uneasy glances after bearing them calloused though they were and familiar with the effects of the screaming blue thing nevertheless the noises got under their thick hides two hours ticked into eternity the men sent to get the baggage returned they had made a quick trip for it was cold and running and keeping warm was easier than loafing and freezing anyway they were excited mogwei they shrieked bad news master mogwei still in yellow robes and purple bron mask came shuffling out of a passage he might have been an evil animal exiting from its burrow what he cackled the baggage was gone mogwei was ominously silent master we looked in all places but nowhere was there trace of what you sent us for insisted one of the party uneasily mogwei continued to say nothing back of the yellowish eyes of the bron mask the orbs of the man glittered the yellow pupils of the mask were evidently colored glass through which vision was possible the upturned horns great things that appeared like a set of needlepointed handlebars added to the villainous aspect of the masquerade what else did you find he demanded his men squirmed there is naught except that we could not find the baggage it had vanished the tone in which these words were spoken however revealed that they were not the truth the men were not good liars mogwei had spotted their uncertainty with the first speech the truth he ripped it seems that we will lose our heads master a man wailed the bronze man still lives we found a path where be had leaped clear of the landslide and had stumbled through snow did you not try to follow mogwei demanded ominously we did but the bronze man became stronger as be went on and soon we lost the trail it must have been be who carried off the baggage mogwei launched into a cackling tirade which moved his followers to recoil in horror i shall boil each of you in yak tallow and crack open your skulls that the ravens may feast he snarled i shall abruptly he fell silent apparently considering ўyour punishment can wait he said it may be that you can escape your just fate if you do my bidding well every man went to his knees and stuck out his tongue to indicate his abject obeisance chapter the meteor that failed mogwei gestured to his henchmen urging them erect go he commanded bind all of the prisoners most solidly and bring them to the large central room to my personal quarters the men scuttled off falling over each other in their haste to obey visions of death which they had held a moment ago had faded had even turned to dreams of a rosy future the chief attraction in which would be much wealth extracted from rich american cities this would be done by threats of sending the blue meteor over or by actually sending it then entering and robbing the helpless towns mogwei himself marched to a portion of the vast structure which was more pretentiously furnished than the outer rooms a man occupied this he was not a tibetan but of some other oriental strain with a mingling of caucasian blood you will send the blue meteor up commanded mogwei cover all of the surrounding country that bronze devil doc savage is at large and we must eliminate him mogweis manner as he addressed this man was slightly more courteous the man departed hurriedly making his way to the roof of the mountaintop stronghold the roof was flat and of no inconsiderable size at one end was a small shed when the door of the shed was opened a pale blue glare came out it was very dark where moonlight did not penetrate and the glare was not pronounced enough to permit a view of what the shed held clanking sounds issued from the structure noises which indicated wrenches were being used soon the man scampered out of the shed he carried a small portable radio transmitter to which was fitted a complicatedlooking device he carried this down from the roof and through the outer door of the ancient building he had left the shed doors open then he turned dials and switches on his apparatus up on the roof a whistle started it was low at first but became louder after the fashion of a siren the man turned another dial with a scream something left the rooftop an object of a pale blue color this receded rapidly when it was almost a mile away the expert operated still another dial a great blue blaze covered all the sky the blue meteor was abroad manipulating dials the man sent the blue meteor scooting back and forth across the sky skimming close to the mountaintops and even dipping into such valleys as were clearly defined in the moonlight it seemed like a living hunter did that hideous blue thing of the skies as it sought for doc savage mogwei saw the blue meteor off then he betook himself to the innermost recess of his castlelike headquarters at his order half a dozen men trailed him the cavalcade turned into a room doubtless the men with mogwei had been present in the chamber before but so great was the oriental splendor of the place that they stopped to stare a bit breathless rich rugs overlay the crude stone floor costly tapestries covered every exposed inch of wall the number and plumpness of the pillows scattered about made the place resemble a movie directors idea of a harem interior the most striking feature however was a square opening in the floor a low wall surrounded this blue light came from the opening a plume of it so brilliant as to cause the eyes to pain arrayed near the shaft mouth from which poured the azure glitter were tightly bound figures monk and ham were close together and rae stanley was next to them long tom came next then johnny more skeletonlike than usual in the unearthly blue glow of the meteor and bigfisted renny john mark shrops occupied a position of honor well to one side expressionless faces and blank eyes showed that none of the captives knew what was going on mogwei strode over and peered into the shaft the blue light on his purple devil mask made a revolting combination i see many bodies he cackled who are they not i hope any that i would have enjoyed disposing of only the men who helped shrops replied one of mogweis cohorts mogwei backed from the evil opening these shall be awake to enjoy themselves he said his parrotlike voice unusually raucous he indicated the bound and mentally inactive prisoners bring me the curecylinders that i may make them normal a man scampered out and came back with an armload of the screwcapped metal tubes seizing one of these mogwei held it close to the head of bigfisted renny and backed the cap off there was a blinding blue flash a plume of flame seemed to play about the top of the tube then vanished the blankness slowly faded from rennys eyes the expression on his long puritanical face became sane he stared at the hideous apparition in the mask of bron the yak demon he noted particularly the long upturning needlepointed horns holy cow he muttered mogwei went rapidly to the other prisoners opening a cylinder close to the head of each all regained their senses he had just revived shrops when an interruption came a man dashed in die ii iai he cried come here something is wrong wrong with what stupid one the blue meteor behaves not as it should watch these prisoners mogwei ordered and ran out yellow robes fluttering using both hands to hold his purple mask on the hands were purplegloved the man with the radio apparatus was perspiring and working over his dials and knobs look he said and pointed at the distant sky the blue meteor was still emitting its piercing whistle and crawling back and forth in the sky but as mogwei watched the meteor darted to one side did not do that muttered the man at the controls there must be something wrong with the radio control apparatus let me see snarled mogwei i do not see how anything could go awry i perfected this apparatus myself it is foolproof he swooped upon the boxes containing the wireless transmitter and the attendant devices necessary for remote control by radio the distant blue meteor whipped off its course again this time it did not return to its route it came directly toward the mountaintop stronghold the control transmitter is perfect mogwei shrieked then what the bronze devil walled mogwei he is using a transmitter of his own upon it he has listened to our own sending signals gotten their wavelength and adjusted his apparatus accordingly a wild scene now ensued repeatedly mogwei sought to steer the blue meteor away from the mountain twice he almost succeeded only to have the squealing sky terror head straight for him once more the bronze mans transmitter is the stronger he squawked with frenzied fingers mogwei felt in his yellow robe for one of the metal cylinders he found only one specimen in his possession holding the canister in his hands he watched the blue meteor come toward him behind mogwei moonfaced men dashed madly about it seemed that few of them carried the cylinders which held the cure for the blue meteors spell a mad scramble ensued as they sought to get them only a few succeeded for with a deafening wall the blue meteor screeched overhead as it went over mogwei opened his canister holding it close to his face the pluming blue blaze and the glitter of the azure skytraveler intermingled mogwei swayed but managed to keep his feet going on the blue meteor hit the slope of an adjacent mountain there was a great burst of blue fragments like sparks they poured down the mountain slope and like bits of bluehot metal they glowed even after they stopped rolling mogwei stared about anxiously he was not surprised at what he saw a herculean bronze man coming up the mountain side with great leaps dihgun mogwei shrilled our enemy wheeling mogwei dived into the huge old building he called out loudly to his men the roof we can shoot the bronze man from the roof he scrambled up ramshackle stone stairs trailed by such of his foowers as had managed to get possession of the metal cylinders before the blue meteor passed overhead from the rooftop they opened fire men firing downward are prone to overshoot and doc savage heard the first bullets make ratsqueak sounds in the moonlight over his head doc doubled aside seeking the shelter of rocks he had gotten closer to the building than he had expected before being fired upon the walls of the castlelike structure were perhaps a hundred yards distant he dipped a hand inside his clothing and brought out a globular metal object two inches in diameter he flipped this a few feet ahead a tremendous quantity of black smoke poured from the metal globe the chill night wind swept it upward toward the hilltop fortress doc had been careful to choose for his assault the side from which the wind blew the giant bronze man arose under cover of the black pall and glided forward bullets were searching for him but few of them came close especially after he swerved far to the right and approached the high stone walls from the side docs garments were torn in numerous places his bronze skin was broken in fact he was more battered than he had been for a long time it had been no simple task to escape from the landslide which he had started just why he had keeled over when opening the curecylinder it had taken him some time to figure out he had concluded it was because he had been inexperienced in use of the cure the stuff of course was highly potent doc wore a leather vest which had been in his luggage this was fitted with innumerable pockets from one of these he drew a tiny gas bomb he lobbed it atop the roof no mask was necessary with this type of gas the stuff although it produced sudden unconsciousness became ineffective after mixing with the air for somewhat less than a minute when using it doc had merely to hold his breath until the gas did its work and dissolved in the air from another of the vest pockets doc drew a silken cord to one end of which was affixed a grappling iron he sprung the grapple open reaching the walls he flung the hook upward it caught somewhere and held he mounted the silken line as agilely as a spider climbs its web only two rifles were firing from the roof now the other gunmen must have succumbed to the gas bomb without hesitating doc swung over the roof edge he came face to face with one of mogweis men the swarthy fellow whipped his rifle around shrieking at the top of his voice as he did so and pulled the trigger doc toppled backward off the rooftop i have done it howled the rifleman my bullet brought death to the bronze one the squat man jumped up and down several times to celebrate his feat then scuttled forward to see if he could discern the crumpled body of the bronze man through the smoke and night murk he got down on all fours and peered over the roof edge his eyes all but fell out his mouth popped wide open to let out a yell of horror the howl ended as if his head had been lopped off below the vocal cords when mighty bronze hands clamped his neck retaining his clutch on the man doc savage regained the roof he had been clinging to the silk cord after being forced to dive off the roof to evade the riflemans bullet it had been a narrow escape doc belted his prize alongside the temple with the edge of a hand the fellow gave one tremendous kick then became limp doc dropped him from across the roof a gun coughed lead doc twisting down weaving to one side then the other drew his flashlight he scooted the beam across the roof the luminance picked up mogweis purple bron mask and yellow robe mogwei had fired with an automatic but he had a stubby submachine gun under the crook of an arm changing to this he hosed bullets across the roof long before the fellow made the shift from automatic to submachine gun however doc had doused his light and drifted to the left a square building reared there he wrenched the doors open thinking perhaps that a stairway led downward from the interior a weak blue glow met him he squirted his flashlight beam inside revealed was the secret of the blue meteor the thing was a tiny monoplane too small to carry a man to this was fitted a large tubular device the contraption secured beneath the fuselage was fitted with hinges no doubt it opened wide actuated by mechanism within when in the air opening the cover exposed the substance which composed the blue meteor itself a faint glow even penetrated the container itself doc took time to glance closely at the metal which composed this cylinder he decided it was principally of lead a metal most resistant to strange ray phenomena the engine exhaust after leading into a tank which smoothed out the pressure was discharged through a simple whistle that then accounted for the weird sound the plane was obviously radiocontrolled that in itself was not remarkable radio control devices having been in use for nearly twenty years there were other things of interest for instance a parachute which could be opened by a radio impulse lowering the craft safely where there was no landing field doc however did not have time to make a lengthy examination mogwei began peppering the little hangar structure with his machine gun doc studied the guttering powder flame getting mogweis location then he drew a small metal container from his capacious leather vest and flung it the thing burst softly near mogweis feet chapter the blue pit doc savage shouldered the hangar doors more widely open he bent over the radiocontrolled plane after only a short glance his vast mechanical knowledge told him how the thing operated he threw a switch and twisted two wires together the engine started automatically and the exhaust pouring through the whistles made an earsplitting din doc drew back the whistles of course had been installed merely to heighten the eerie effect he played his flashlight on the wheels before the thing began to move stooping swiftly he disengaged a weed fragment from the air valve the weed was a south american variety this then was the stolen blue meteor which shrops had carried across the pacific and back again in the chilean senorita mogwei had recovered it apparently there were no more of the devices the monoplane scooted out of the hangar and mounted from the roof it was so tiny as to be hardly distinguishable in the fitful moonlight the smoke had now blown away from the mountaintop fortress mogwei had stopped shooting apparently be feared doc was up to some fiendish trick with the blue meteor doc watched the bluish blur that marked the position of the monoplane the plane dived for a distant mountainside struck and showered azure sparks down the steep slope certain the thing was destroyed doc glided across the roof mogwei had gone below doc reached the spot where the bronmasked fiend had stood and swept the packed mud with his flashlight the metal container which he had flung at mogwei had contained a sticky liquid something like the stuff which he had planted at the entrance of shropss yurt but of a more grayish color mogwei had walked through the fluid again the pockets of docs vest yielded a tiny device this resembled a magic lantern made to fit the palm of the hand doc switched it on apparently nothing happened certainly no visible light appeared he turned the lantern on the roof mogweis tracks instantly sprang out they glowed like pale green flame doc followed the trail his lantern device was a projector of ultraviolet light rays of a wavelength outside the spectrum visible to the human eye the material mogwei was tracking was a substance which fluoresced or glowed when exposed to ultraviolet rays this was not an unusual property being possessed also by such common substances as vaseline and aspirin doc made great speed for the trail could hardly have been easier to follow it was marked ahead in green fire he came to the vast room which was tapestried and floored with luxurious rugs the room in the center of which gaped the open shaft with its blinding halo of blue glare docs first view of that shaft maw was not pleasant mogwei stood at the shaft lip high above his head ready to fling into the shimmering azure depths mogwei held a bound man john mark shrops nowhere else on the rugpadded floor were there signs of the other captives blue flickered from the shaft maw like from a dragon mouth doc savage carried no gun he had two reasons for not doing so in the first place he never took human life directly no matter how great the provocation secondly doc considered the possession of a firearm bad psychology a man with a gun in his pocket would come to depend upon the weapon instead of upon his wits relieved of the gun he would be accordingly helpless hence when doc found mogwei holding shrops over the pit there was no gun at hand with which to drive lead at the fiend in the bron mask and yellow robe doc tossed a hand forward in a throwing motion a small pigeon egg of metal left his fingers and sailed toward mogwei the object burst with a terrific report in the air in front of mogwei the blast was deafening and flash blinding for this was one of the little noiseandglare bombs which doc had used on his visit to the village of the mad ones the concussion knocked mogwei and his burden back from the shaft lip both fell to the stone floor so great was the wind of the explosion that rugs were scooped aside exposing the stones of the floor doc hurtled forward the blast of the little bomb should have temporarily blinded and deafened mogwei but the mask must have saved mogwei the yellow eye glass in it had probably kept the glare away to a degree mogwei twisted to his feet clawing his submachine gun from a sling beneath his robe his hand found the firing lever the rapidfirer muzzle spouted flame noise bullets the breech spewed smoking cartridge cases which rained about the foot of the yellow robe the slugs gouged mud off the ceiling mogwei had started firing without aiming as a fireman directs a hose stream the bron monster swayed the lead torrent toward doc savage the bronze giant knowing very well his own ability realized he could not get to mogwei before the bullet stream found him he swerved and doubled low this put him behind the upraised stone wall around the shaft lip mogwei cackled shrilly and danced over to get doc in view he was a trifle slow doc got to a side door and dived through doc fell over a nottooyielding form on the floor holy cow grunted rennys voice the bronze man scooped the bigfisted engineer up and moved him to one side of the door faint blue light came in from the other room it disclosed more bound figures rae stanley monk ham johnny long tom all were there the guards ran out renny rumbled we managed to flop in here shrops tried to go the other direction mogwei met im doc untied his five men all of you but monk scatter he directed go over this place and clean up such of the outfit as are still on their feet monk youll stick here and help take care of mogwei doc passed gas bombs to his men and they darted away mogwei was still behind the shaftmouth parapet in the other room from this shelter he drove occasional bullets he seemed afraid to flee doubtless believing doc had a gun pretty rae stanley crouched behind doc monk peered into the other room then drew back as lead popped about the door whatll we do he asked let him make the first move doc suggested silence fell it was a deadly quiet it seemed to get on monks nerves he broke it with conversation what kind of a joint is this anyway he asked surely mogwei didnt build it its a monastery erected above the spot where the blue meteor buried itself many years ago doc explained monk nodded in the pale blue light reflected from the other room docs vast knowledge of architecture had undoubtedly informed him of the nature of the building probably lamas noted the effect of the buried meteor thought it was an evil spirit and erected this structure to combat it doc continued then after many of them were driven insane they concluded the evil spirit was too strong and quitted the place thats only a surmise on my part however sounds reasonable monk replied mogweis gun howled and its lead battered rock fragments off the edge of the door so the blue meteor is at the bottom of that shalt monk grunted obviously it struck just below the tip of the mountain and penetrated deeply this devil mogwei dug down to it he is a clever scientist he evolved a reactionary agent which nullifies the effects of the blue meteor that is the stuff in the metal cylinders from distant parts of the stronghold loud yells were drifting the nature of these howls indicated that docs men were overpowering such of mogweis followers as had not been trapped by the blue meteor what is that blue meteor monk asked a highly radioactive substance doc told him to answer more specifically will require a lengthy examination in a wellequipped laboratory my general information i got from observation you mean its somethin like radium on that order doc agreed he listened intently for any move from mogwei scientists do not know too much about atomic emissions and ultraray phenomena there being much doubt for instance about the source of socalled cosmic rays it is possible certain stellar bodies give off such rays just as the sun emits light visible to the eye when the blue meteor went over it was a case of meteor stroke instead of sunstroke huh monk grunted broadly speaking it was like that doc agreed even radium has a terrible effect on the brain as all medical men know if brought in too close proximity this blue meteor undoubtedly gave off emanations of much greater violence doc paused to listen mogwei seemed to be moving about at least scuffing sounds came from behind the shaft escarpment the emanations from the blue meteor simply shocked the human nerve system into a state of paralysis doc continued any idea what the antidote is monk queried some substance distilled from the blue meteor doc surmised it was in a vapor form it merely acted as an antidote a counterirritant which kept the nerves functioning despite the shock of the blue meteor emanations the scuffling sounds behind the shaft wall were becoming louder what a hideous weapon that blue meteor was choked rae stanley her face was white her voice was shrill in the wrong hands it was monk agreed but its just about out of the wrong hands now the girl stared tensely at doc my father she choked i have seen no sign of him docs weird goldflake eyes remained fixed on the other room and he did not answer my father havent you any idea where he is rae stanley repeated doc said gently keep a grip on your nerve rae her eyes began to moisten you mean that im afraid the news about your father will not be what you had hoped for doc told her chapter the fanciest liar the scuffling behind the shaft wall in the other room abruptly became understandable curses exploded grunts puffed two men heaved up behind the parapet mogwei and shrops they were locked in ferocious embrace in some fashion shrops had managed to free his hands he had his arms banded around the sinister apparition in the yellow robe and purple mask of the yak demon nows our chance monk yelled but doc was already on his feet and whipping into the large room mogwei looked around and saw the bronze giant the sight maddened him he pitched about in an effort to free himself he got clear the bron mask hampered his vision and he stepped back almost to the lip of the pit even then he would not have fallen in however but shrops howling in rage dived forward the cockneys shove propelled mogwei over the wall and into the pit mogwei clutched madly his hands managed to tangle in shropss hair and he jerked the cockney along as he fell both men shrieked as they sank into the glittering blue depths the shrieks seemed to sink into the depths of the earth somehow the receding wails were remindful of the dying whistle of the blue meteors themselves the sounds ended with meaningful abruptness racing forward doc peered into the pit shielding his eyes from the glare he stared for only a moment then he drew away and waved monk and rae stanley back theres no need of looking he said its a sight you might remember too long monk grunted you mean the shaft must be two hundred feet deep doc replied they were killed by the fall rae stanley suddenly covered her face with her hands and choked my father hunt him an arm across her shoulders doc guided her outside ham appeared weve got just about everybody reported the dapper lawyer doc signalled him and ham took over the handling of rae stanley he guided her to an adjacent chamber bigfisted renny dashed up his arms were laden with numerous of the metal curecylinders lookit he rumbled theres enough of these things to return normalcy to those poor devils who were overcome by the blue meteor in south america well ship them over as quickly as possible doc told him long tom and johnny turned up satisfaction on their faces weve got the whole outfit doc the electrical wizard grunted locked in the strongest room in the place added gaunt johnny monk squinted at the mouth of the shaft with its topping plume of blue light then eyed doc who was mogwei he asked or did you get a look at his face his face is visible at the bottom of the shaft doc said after a pause the purple mask came off in the fall is he somebody we know doc was very slow in answering this is one of the few times i have really hated to reveal the identity of a villain he said at last in fact were not going to disclose it to the world the others seemed astounded why not this man was undoubtedly robbed of his mental balance by the blue meteor doc explained as far as his right mind was concerned he has probably been dead for many months his body lived and in it the distorted shred of mentality which the blue meteor had left him monk gulped seeming too surprised to speak he had comprehended the identity of mogwei from docs words the man was not responsible for his hideous plan to make himself master of civilization doc continued it was the product of an irrational brain that idea there is little doubt but that it would have succeeded had his own men shrops and saturday loo not doublecrossed him when did you get a line on his identity doc monk demanded in the village of the mad ones doc replied slowly i was masquerading as mogwei and told a guard that the bronze man was holding the man who was actually mcgwei when the guard instantly realized mogwei could not be a prisoner and be addressing him at the same time he gave an alarm that told me the truth and when rae stanley asked you about her father said monk you didnt tell her i did not tell her that professor stanley was mogwei doc said grimly brothers the bronze man continued were going to keep rae stanley from learning her father was mogwei shes a swell girl and stanley was not mentally responsible the blue meteor got him undoubtedly doc went over to the shaft and glanced into its blue depths he could see professor stanley still wearing the yellow robe of mogwei near by lay saturday loo who had turned traitor to shrops no doubt mogwei had cast him to his death there were other victims of mogweis poor deranged mind down there doc drew back he plucked a metal egg of a bomb from his vest and tossed it into the shaft then he herded his men swiftly outside there was a whooping roar the stone floor shuddered lumps of mud jumped off the walls the celling groaned the floor all about the shaft caved in and the azure light shut off indicating that the pit had closed itself tightly it will never be opened again doc said grimly well have the tibetan government see to that a sober file of men doc and his aides moved toward the room which held ham and rae stanley professor stanley was mogwei monk mumbled that explains why the tibetan natives hated white men a rumor got out that mogwei was white probably doc replied nothing the flakegold of the bronze mans eyes seemed less animated than usual as if at rest the men walked through the ancient monastery and came near the room which held ham and rae stanley monk held up a hand let me handle this he muttered im the fanciest liar in the gang they entered the room rae stanley looked up tearfully my father perished several months ago monk told her the end
