dr no ian fleming i i hear you loud and clear punctually at six oclock the sun set with a last yellow flash behind the blue mountains a wave of violet shadow poured down richmond road and the crickets and tree frogs in the fine gardens began to zing and tinkle apart from the background noise of the insects the wide empty street was quiet the wealthy owners of the big withdrawn housesthe bank managers company directors and top civil servantshad been home since five oclock and they would be discussing the day with their wives or taking a shower and changing their clothes in half an hour the street would come to life again with the cocktail traffic but now this very superior half mile of rich road as it was known to the tradesmen of kingston held nothing but the suspense of an empty stage and the heavy perfume of nightscented jasmine richmond road is the best road in all jamaica it is jamaicas park avenue its kensington palace gardens its avenue dlena the best people live in its big oldfashioned houses each in an acre or two of beautiful lawn set too trimly with the finest trees and flowers from the botanical gardens at hope the long straight road is cool and quiet and withdrawn from the hot vulgar sprawl of kingston where its residents earn their money and on the other side of the tintersection at its top lie the grounds of kings house where the governor and commanderinchief of jamaica lives with his family in jamaica no road could have a finer ending on the eastern corner of the top intersection stands no richmond road a substantial twostorey house with broad whitepainted verandas running round both floors from the road a gravel path leads up to the pillared entrance through wide lawns marked out with tennis courts on which this evening as on all evenings the sprinklers are at work this mansion is the social mecca of kingston it is queens club which for fifty years has boasted the power and frequency of its blackballs such stubborn retreats will not long survive in modern jamaica one day queens club will have its windows smashed and perhaps be burned to the ground but for the time being it is a useful place to find in a subtropical islandwell run well staffed and with the finest cuisine and cellar in the caribbean at thattime of day on most evenings of the year you would find the same four motor cars standing in the road outside the club they were the cars belonging to the high bridge game that assembled punctually at five and played until around midnight you could almost set your watch by these cars they belonged reading from the order in which they now stood against the kerb to the brigadier in command of the caribbean defence force to kingstons leading criminal lawyer and to the mathematics professor from kingston university at the tail of the line stood the black sunbeam alpine of commander john strangways rn regional control officer for the caribbeanor less discreetly the local representative of the british secret service just before sixfifteen the silence of richmond road was softly broken three blind beggars came round the corner of the intersection and moved slowly down the pavement towards the four cars they were chigroeschinese negroesbulky men but bowed as they shuffled along tapping at the kerb with their white sticks they walked in file the first man who wore blue glasses and could presumably see better than the others walked in front holding a tin cup against the crook of the stick in his left hand the right hand of the second man rested on his shoulder and the right hand of the third on the shoulder of the second the eyes of the second and third men were shut the three men were dressed in rags and wore dirty jippajappa baseball caps with long peaks they said nothing and no noise came from them except the soft tapping of their sticks as they came slowly down the shadowed pavement towards the group of cars the three blind men would not have been incongruous in kingston where there are many diseased people on the streets but in this quiet rich empty street they made an unpleasant impression and it was odd that they should all be chinese negroes this is not a common mixture of bloods in the cardroom the sunburned hand reached out into the green pool of the centre table and gathered up the four cards there was a quiet snap as the trick went to join the rest hundred honours said strangways and ninety below he looked at his watch and stood up back in twenty minutes your deal bill order some drinks usual for me dont bother to cook a hand for me while im gone i always spot them bill templar the brigadier laughed shortly he pinged the bell by his side and raked the cards in towards him he said hurry up blast you you always let the cards go cold just as your partners in the money strangways was already out of the door the three men sat back resignedly in their chairs the coloured steward came in and they ordered drinks for themselves and a whisky and water for strangways there was this maddening interruption every evening at sixfifteen about halfway through their second rubber at this time precisely even if they were in the middle of a hand strangways had to go to his office and make a call it was a damned nuisance but strangways was a vital part of their four and they put up with it it was never explained what the call was and no one asked strangwayss job was hush and that was that he was rarely away for more than twenty minutes and it was understood that he paid for his absence with a round of drinks the drinks came and the three men began to talk racing in fact this was the most important moment in strangwayss daythe time of his duty radio contact with the powerful transmitter on the roof of the building in regents park that is the headquarters of the secret service every day at eighteenthirty local time unless he gave warning the day before that he would not be on the airwhen he had business on one of the other islands in his territory for instance or was seriously illhe would transmit his daily report and receive his orders if he failed to come on the air precisely at sixthirty there would be a second call the blue call at seven and finally the red call at seventhirty after this if his transmitter remained silent it was emergency and section iii his controlling authority in london would urgently get on the job of finding out what had happened to him even a blue call means a bad mark for an agent unless his reasons in writing are unanswerable londons radio schedules round the world are desperately tight and their minute disruption by even one extra call is a dangerous nuisance strangways had never suffered the ignominy of a blue call let alone a red and was as certain as could be that he never would do so every evening at precisely sixfifteen he left queens club got into his car and drove for ten minutes up into the foothills of the blue mountains to his neat bungalow with the fabulous view over kingston harbour at six twentyfive he walked through the hall to the office at the back he unlocked the door and locked it again behind him miss trueblood who passed as his secretary but was in fact his no and a former chief officer wrns would already be sitting in front of the dials inside the dummy filing cabinet she would have the earphones on and would be making first contact tapping out his callsign wxn on megacycles there would be a shorthand pad on her elegant knees strangways would drop into the chair beside her and pick up the other pair of headphones and at exactly six twentyeight he would take over from her and wait for the sudden hollowness in the ether that meant that www in london was coming in to acknowledge it was an iron routine strangways was a man of iron routine unfortunately strict patterns of behaviour can be deadly if they are read by an enemy strangways a tall lean man with a black patch over the right eye and the sort of aquiline good looks you associate with the bridge of a destroyer walked quickly across the mahogany panelled hallway of queens club and pushed through the light mosquitowired doors and ran down the three steps to the path there was nothing very much on his mind except the sensual pleasure of the clean fresh evening air and the memory of the finesse that had given him his three spades there was this case of course the case he was working on a curious and complicated affair that m had rather nonchalantly tossed over the air at him two weeks earlier but it was going well a chance lead into the chinese community had paid off someodd angles had come to lightfor the present the merest shadows of anglesbut if they jelled thought strangways as he strode down the gravel path and into richmond road he might find himself involved in something very odd indeed strangways shrugged his shoulders of course it wouldnt turn out like that the fantastic never materialized in his line of business there would be some drab solution that had been embroidered by overheated imaginations and the usual hysteria of the chinese automatically another part of strangwayss mind took in the three blind men they were tapping slowly towards him down the sidewalk they were about twenty yards away he calculated that they would pass him a second or two before he reached his car out of shame for his own health and gratitude for it strangways felt for a coin he ran his thumbnail down its edge to make sure it was a florin and not a penny he took it out he was parallel with the beggars how odd they were all chigroes how very odd strangwayss hand went out the coin clanged in the tin cup bless you master said the leading man bless you echoed the other two the car key was in strangwayss hand vaguely he registered the moment of silence as the tapping of the white sticks ceased it was too late as strangways had passed the last man all three had swivelled the back two had fanned out a step to have a clear field of fire three revolvers ungainly with their sausageshaped silencers whipped out of holsters concealed among the rags with disciplined precision the three men aimed at different points down strangwayss spineone between the shoulders one in the small of the back one at the pelvis the three heavy coughs were almost one strangwayss body was hurled forward as if it had been kicked it lay absolutely still in the small puff of dust from the sidewalk it was sixseventeen with a squeal of tyres a dingy motor hearse with black plumes flying from the four corners of its roof took the tintersection into richmond road and shot down towards the group on the pavement the three men had just had time to pick up strangwayss body when the hearse slid to a stop abreast of them the double doors at the back were open so was the plain deal coffin inside the three men manhandled the body through the doors and into the coffin they climbed in the lid was put on and the doors pulled shut the three negroes sat down on three of the four little seats at the corners of the coffin and unhurriedly laid their white sticks beside them roomy black alpaca coats hung over the backs of the seats they put the coats on over their rags then they took off their baseball caps and reached down to the floor and picked up black top hats and put them on their heads the driver who also was a chinese negro looked nervously over his shoulder go man go said the biggest of the killers he glanced down at the luminous dial of his wrist watch it said sixtwenty just three minutes for the job dead on time the hearse made a decorous uturn and moved at a sedate speed up to the intersection there it turned right and at thirty miles an hour it cruised genteelry up the tarmac highway towards the hills its black plumes streaming the doleful signal of its burden and the three mourners sitting bolt upright with their arms crossed respectfully over their hearts wxn calling www wxn calling www wxn wxn wxn the centre finger of mary truebloods right hand stabbed softly elegantly at the key she lifted her left wrist six twentyeight he was a minute late mary trueblood smiled at the thought of the little open sunbeam tearing up the road towards her now in a second she would hear the quick step then the key in the lock and he would be sitting beside her there would be the apologetic smile as he reached for the earphones sorry mary damned car wouldnt start or youd think the blasted police knew my number by now stopped me at halfway tree mary trueblood took the second pair of earphones off their hook and put them on his chair to save him half a second wxn calling wwwwxn calling www she tuned the dial a hairs breadth and tried again her watch said sixtwentynine she began to worry in a matter of seconds london would be coming in suddenly she thought god what could she do if strangways wasnt on time it was useless for her to acknowledge london and pretend she was himuseless and dangerous radio security would be monitoring the call as they monitored every call from an agent those instruments which measured the minute peculiarities in an operators fist would at once detect it wasnt strangways at the key mary trueblood had been shown the forest of dials in the quiet room on the top floor at headquarters had watched as the dancing hands registered the weight of each pulse the speed of each cipher group the stumble over a particular letter the controller had explained it all to her when she had joined the caribbean station five years beforehow a buzzer would sound and the contact be automatically broken if the wrong operator had come on the air it was the basic protection against a secret servicetransmitter falling into enemy hands and if an agent had been captured and was being forced to contact london under torture he had only to add a few hairbreadth peculiarities to his usual fist and they would tell the story of his capture as clearly as if he had announced it en clair now it had come now she was hearing the hollowness in the ether that meant london was coming in mary trueblood glanced at her watch sixthirty panic but now at last there were the footsteps in the hall thank god in a second he would come in she must protect him desperately she decided to take a chance and keep the circuit open www calling wxnwww calling wxncan you hear me can you hear me london was coming over strong searching for the jamaica station the footsteps were at the door coolly confidently she tapped back hear you loud and clear hear you loud and clear hear you behind her there was an explosion something hit her on the ankle she looked down it was the lock of the door mary trueblood swivelled sharply on her chair a man stood in the doorway it wasnt strangways it was a big negro with yellowish skin and slanting eyes there was a gun in his hand it ended in a thick black cylinder mary trueblood opened her mouth to scream the man smiled broadly slowly lovingly he lifted the gun and shot her three times in and around the left breast the girl slumped sideways off her chair the earphones slipped off her golden hair on to the floor for perhaps a second the tiny chirrup of london sounded out into the room then it stopped the buzzer at the controllers desk in radio security had signalled that something was wrong on wxn the killer walked out of the door he came back carrying a box with a coloured label on it that said presto fire and a big sugar sack marked tate lyle he put the box down on the floor and went to the body and roughly forced the sack over the head and down to the ankles the feet stuck out he bent them and crammed them in he dragged the bulky sack out into the hall and came back in the corner of the room the safe stood open as he had been told it would and the cipher books had been taken out and laid on the desk ready for work on the london signals the man threw these and all the papers in the safe into the centre of the room he tore down the curtains and added them to the pile he topped it up with a couple of chairs he opened the box of presto firelighters and took out a handful and tucked them into the pile and lit them then he went out into the hall and lit similar bonfires in appropriate places the tinderdry furniture caught quickly and the flames began to lick up the panellingthe man went to the front door and opened it through the hibiscus hedge he could see the glint of the hearse there was no noise except the zing of crickets and the soft tickover of the cars engine up and down the road there was no other sign of life the man went back into the smokefilled hall and easily shouldered the sack and came out again leaving the door open to make a draught he walked swiftly down the path to the road the back doors of the hearse were open he handed in the sack and watched the two men force it into the coffin on top of strangwayss body then he climbed in and shut the doors and sat down and put on his top hat as the first flames showed in the upper windows of the bungalow the hearse moved quietly from the sidewalk and went on its way up towards the mona reservoir there the weighted coffin would slip down into its fiftyfathom grave and in just fortyfive minutes the personnel and records of the caribbean station of the secret service would have been utterly destroyed ii choice of weapons three weeks later in london march came in like a rattlesnake from first light on march ist hail and icy sleet with a force gale behind them lashed at the city and went on lashing as the people streamed miserably to work their legs whipped by the wet hems of their macintoshes and their faces blotching with the cold it was a filthy day and everybody said soeven m who rarely admitted the existence of weather even in its extreme forms when the old black silver wraith rolls with the nondescript numberplate stopped outside the tall building in regents park and he climbed stiffly out on to the pavement hail hit him in the face like a whiff of smallshot instead of hurrying inside the building he walked deliberately round the car to the window beside the chauffeur wont be needing the car again today smith take it away and go home ill use the tube this evening no weather for driving a car worse than one of those pq convoys exleading stoker smith grinned gratefully ayeaye sir and thanks he watched the elderly erect figure walk round the bonnet of the rolls and across the pavement and into the building just like the old boy hed always see the men right first smith clicked the gear lever into first and moved off peering forward through the streaming windscreen they didnt come like that any more m went up in the lift to the eighth floor and along the thickcarpeted corridor to his office he shut the door behind him took off his overcoat and scarf and hung them behind the door he took out a large blue silk bandanna handkerchief and brusquely wiped it over his face it was odd but he wouldnt have done this in front of the porters or the liftman he went over to his desk and sat down and bent towards the intercom he pressed a switch im in miss moneypenny the signals please and anything else youve got then get me sir james molony hell be doing his rounds at st marys about now tell the chief of staff ill see in half an hour and let me have the strangways file m waited for the metallic yes sir and released the switch he sat back and reached for his pipe and began filling it thoughtfully he didnt look up when his secretary came in with the stack of papers and he even ignored the half dozen pink most immediates on top of the signal file if they had been vital he would have been called during the night a yellow light winked on the intercom m picked up the black telephone from the row of four that you sir james have you got five minutes six for you at the other end of the line the famous neurologist chuckled want me to certify one of her majestys ministers not today m frowned irritably the old navy had respected governments its about that man of mine youve been handling we wont bother about the name this is an open line i gather you let him out yesterday is he fit for duty there was a pause on the other end now the voice was professional judicious physically hes as fit as a fiddle legs healed up shouldnt be any aftereffects yes hes all right there was another pause just one thing m theres a lot of tension there you know you work these men of yours pretty hard can you give him something easy to start with from what youve told me hes been having a tough time for some years now m said gruffly thats what hes paid for itll soon show if hes not up to the work wont be the first one thats cracked from what you say he sounds in perfectly good shape it isnt as if hed really been damaged like some of the patients ive sent youmen whove been properly put through the mangle of course if you put it like that but pains an odd thing we know very little about it you cant measure itthe difference in suffering between a woman having a baby and a man having a renal colic and thank god the body seems to forget fairly quickly but this man of yours has been in real pain m dont think that just because nothings been broken quite quite bond had made a mistake and he had suffered for it in any case m didnt like being lectured even by one of the most famous doctors in the world on how he should handle his agents there had been a note of criticism in sir james molonys voice m said abruptly ever hear of a man called steincrohndr peter steincrohn no whos he american doctor written a book my washington people sent over for our library this man talks about how much punishment the human body can put up with gives a list of the bits of the body an average man can do without matter of fact j copied it out for future reference care to hear the list m dug into his coat pocket and put some letters and scraps of paper on the desk in front of him with his left hand he selected a piece of paper and unfolded it he wasnt put out by the silence on the other end of the line hullo sir james well here they are gall bladder spleen tonsils appendix one of his two kidneys one of his two lungs two of his four or five quarts of blood twofifths of his liver most of his stomach four of his twentythree feet of intestines and halfof his brain m paused when the silence continued at the other end he said any comments sir james there was a reluctant grunt at the other end of the telephone i wonder he didnt add an arm and a leg or all of them i dont see quite what youre trying to prove m gave a curt laugh im not trying to prove anything sir james it just struck me as an interesting list all im trying to say is that my man seems to have got off pretty lightly compared with that sort of punishment but m relented dont lets argue about it he said in a milder voice as a matter of fact i did have it in mind to let him have a bit of a breather somethings come up in jamaica m glanced at the streaming windows itll be more of a rest cure than anything two of my people a man and a girl have gone off together or thats what it looks like our friend can have a spell at being an inquiry agentin the sunshine too hows that just the ticket i wouldnt mind the job myself on a day like this but sir james molony was determined to get his message through he persisted mildly dont think i wanted to interfere m but there are limits to a mans courage i know you have to treat these men as if they were expendable but presumably you dont want them to crack at the wrong moment this one ive had here is tough id say youll get plenty more work out of him but you know what moran has to say about courage in that book of his dont recall he says that courage is a capital sum reduced by expenditure i agree with him all im trying to say is that this particular man seems to have been spending pretty hard since before the war i wouldnt say hes overdrawnnot yet but there are limits just so m decided that was quite enough of that nowadays softness was everywhere thats why im sending him abroad holiday in jamaica dont worry sir james ill take care of him by the way did you ever discover what the stuff was that russian woman put into him got the answer yesterday sir james molony also was glad the subject had been changed the old man was as raw as the weather was there any chance that he had got his message across into what he described to himself as ms thick skull taken us three months it was a bright chap at the school of tropical medicine who came up with it the drug was fugu poison the japanese use it for committing suicide it comes from the sex organs of the japanese globefish trust the russians to use something no ones ever heard of they might just as well have used curare it has much the same effectparalysis of the central nervous system fugus scientific name is tetrodotoxin its terrible stuff and very quick one shot of it like your man got and in a matter of seconds the motor and respiratory muscles are paralysed at first the chap sees double and then he cant keep his eyes open next he cant swallow his head falls and he cant raise it dies of respiratory paralysis lucky he got away with it miracle thanks entirely to that frenchman who was with him got your man on the floor and gave him artificial respiration as if he was drowning somehow kept his lungs going until the doctor came luckily the doctor had worked in south america diagnosed curare and treated him accordingly but it was a chance in a million by the same token what happened to the russian woman m said shortly oh she died well many thanks sir james and dont worry about your patient ill see he has an easy time of it goodbye m hung up his face was cold and blank he pulled over the signal file and went quickly through it on some of the signals he scribbled a comment occasionally he made a brief telephone call to one of the sections when he had finished he tossed the pile into his out basket and reached for his pipe and the tobacco jar made out of the base of a fourteenpounder shell nothing remained in front of him except a buff folder marked with the top secret red star across the centre of the folder was written in block capitals caribbean station and underneath in italics strangways and trueblood a light winked on the intercom m pressed down the switch yes s here sir send him in and tell the armourer to come up in five minutes m sat back he put his pipe in his mouth and set a match to it through the smoke he watched the door to his secretarys office his eyes were very bright and watchful james bond came through the door and shut it behind him he walked over to the chair across the desk from m and sat down morning good morning sir there was silence in the room except for the rasping of ms pipe it seemed to be taking a lot of matches to get it going in the background the fingernails of the sleet slashed against the two broad windows it was all just as bond had remembered it through the months of being shunted from hospital to hospital the weeks of dreary convalescence the hard work of getting his body back into shape to him this represented stepping back into life sitting here in this room opposite m was the symbol of normality he had longed for he looked across through the smoke clouds into the shrewd grey eyes they were watching him what was coming a postmortem on the shambles which had been his last case a curt relegation to one of the home sections for a spell of desk work or some splendid new assignment m had been keeping on ice while waiting for bond to get back to duty m threw the box of matches down on the red leather desk he leant back and clasped his hands behind his head how do you feel glad to be back very glad sir and i feel fine any final thoughts about your last case havent bothered you with it till you got well you heard i ordered an inquiry i believe the chief of staff took some evidence from you anything to add ms voice was businesslike cold bond didnt like it something unpleasant was coming he said no sir it was a mess i blame myself for letting that woman get me shouldnt have happened m took his hands from behind his neck and slowly leant forward and placed them flat on the desk in front of him his eyes were hard just so the voice was velvet dangerous your gun got stuck if i recall this beretta of yours with the silencer something wrong there cant afford that sort of mistake if youre to carry an oo number would you prefer to drop it and go back to normal duties bond stiffened his eyes looked resentfully into ms the licence to kill for the secret service the doubleo prefix was a great honour it had been earned hardly it brought bond the only assignments he enjoyed the dangerous ones no i wouldnt sir then well have to change your equipment that was one of the findings of the court of inquiry i agree with it dyou understand bond said obstinately im used to that gun sir i like working with it what happened could have happened to anyone with any kind of gun i dont agree nor did the court of inquiry so thats final the only question is what youre to use instead m bent forward to the intercom is the armourer there send him in m sat back you may not know it but major boothroyds the greatest smallarms expert in the world he wouldnt be here if he wasnt well hear what he has to say the door opened a short slim man with sandy hair came in and walked over to the desk and stood beside bonds chair bond looked up into his face he hadnt often seen the man before but he remembered the very wide apart clear grey eyes that never seemed to flicker with a noncommittal glance down at bond the man stood relaxed looking across at m he said good morning sir in a flat unemotional voice morning armourer now i want to ask you some questions ms voice was casual first of all what do you think of the beretta the ladies gun sir m raised ironic eyebrows at bond bond smiled thinly really and why do you say that no stopping power sir but its easy to operate a bit fancy looking too if you know what i mean sir appeals to the ladies how would it be with a silencer still less stopping power sir and i dont like silencers theyre heavy and get stuck in your clothing when youre in a hurry i wouldnt recommend anyone to try a combination like that sir not if they were meaning business m said pleasantly to bond any comment bond shrugged his shoulders i dont agree ive used the beretta for fifteen years never had a stoppage and i havent missed with it yet not a bad record for a gun it just happens that im used to it and i can point it straight ive used bigger guns when ive had tothe colt with the long barrel for instance but for closeup work and concealment i like the beretta bond paused he felt he should give way somewhere id agree about the silencer sir theyre a nuisance but sometimes you have to use them weve seen what happens when you do said m drily and as for changing your gun its only a question of practice youll soon get the feel of a new one m allowed a trace of sympathy to enter his voice sorry but ive decided just stand up a moment i want the armourer to get a look at your build bond stood up and faced the other man there was no warmth in the two pairs of eyes bonds showed irritation major boothroyds were indifferent clinical he walked round bond he said excuse me and felt bonds biceps and forearms he came back in front of him and said might i see your gun bonds hand went slowly into his coat he handed over the taped beretta with the sawn barrel boothroyd examined the gun and weighed it in his hand he put it down on the desk and your holster bond took off his coat and slipped off the chamois leather holster and harness he put his coat on again with a glance at the lips of the holster perhaps to see if they showed traces of snagging boothroyd tossed the holster down beside the gun with a motion that sneered he looked across at m i think we can do better than this sir it was the sort of voice bonds first expensive tailor had used bond sat down he just stopped himself gazing rudely at the ceiling instead he looked impassively across at m well armourer what do you recommend major boothroyd put on the experts voice as a matter of fact sir he said modestly ive just been testing most of the small automatics five thousand rounds each at twentyfive yards of all of them id choose the walther ppk mm it only came fourth after the japanese m the russian tokarev and the sauer m but i like its light trigger pull and the extension spur of the magazine gives a grip that should suit its a real stopping gun of course its about a calibre as compared with the berettas but i wouldnt recommend anything lighter and you can get ammunition for the walther anywhere in the world that gives it an edge on the japanese and the russian guns m turned to bond any comments its a good gun sir bond admitted bit more bulky than the beretta how does the armourer suggest i carry it berns martin tripledraw holster said major boothroyd succinctly best worn inside the trouser band to the left but its all right below the shoulder stiff saddle leather holds the gun in with a spring should make for a quicker draw than that he gestured towards the desk threefifths of a second to hit a man at twenty feet would be about right thats settled then ms voice was final and what about something bigger theres only one gun for that sir said major boothroyd stolidly smith wesson centennial airweight revolver calibre hammerless so it wont catch in clothing overall length of six and a half inches and it only weighs thirteen ounces to keep down the weight the cylinder holds only five cartridges but by the time theyre gone major boothroyd allowed himself a wintry smile somebodys been killed fires the s w special very accurate cartridge indeed with standard loading it has amuzzle velocity of eight hundred and sixty feet per second and muzzle energy of two hundred and sixty footpounds there are various barrel lengths three and a half inch five inch all right all right ms voice was testy take it as read if you say its the best ill believe you so its the walther and the smith wesson send up one of each to with the harness and arrange for him to fire them in starting today hes got to be expert in a week all right then thank you very much armourer i wont detain you thank you sir said major boothroyd he turned and marched stiffly out of the room there was a moments silence the sleet tore at the windows m swivelled his chair and watched the streaming panes bond took the opportunity to glance at his watch ten oclock his eyes slid to the gun and holster on the desk he thought of his fifteen years marriage to the ugly bit of metal he remembered the times its single word had saved his lifeand the times when its threat alone had been enough he thought of the days when he had literally dressed to killwhen he had dismantled the gun and oiled it and packed the bullets carefully into the springloaded magazine and tried the action once or twice pumping the cartridges out on to the bedspread in some hotel bedroom somewhere round the world then the last wipe of a dry rag and the gun into the little holster and a pause in front of the mirror to see that nothing showed and then out of the door and on his way to the rendezvous that was to end with either darkness or light how many times had it saved his life how many death sentences had it signed bond felt unreasonably sad how could one have such ties with an inanimate object an ugly one at that and he had to admit it with a weapon that was not in the same class as the ones chosen by the armourer but he had the ties and m was going to cut them m swivelled back to face him sorry james he said and there was no sympathy in his voice i know how you like that bit of iron but im afraid its got to go never give a weapon a second chanceany more than a man i cant afford to gamble with the doubleo section theyve got to be properly equipped you understand that a guns more important than a hand or a foot in your job bond smiled thinly i know sir i shant argue im just sorry to see it go all right then well say no more about it now ive got some more news for you theres a job come up in jamaica personnel problem or thats what it looks like routine investigation and report the sunshinell do you good and you can practise your new guns on the turtles or whatever they have down there you can do with a bit of holiday like to take it on bond thought hes got it in for me over the last job feels i let him down wont trust me with anything tough wants to see oh well he said sounds rather like the soft life sir ive had almost too much of that lately but if its got to be done if you say so sir yes said m i say so iii holiday task it was getting dark outside the weather was thickening m reached over and switched on the greenshaded desklight the centre of the room became a warm yellow pool in which the leather top of the desk glowed bloodred m pulled the thick file towards him bond noticed it for the first time he read the reversed lettering without difficulty what had strangways been up to who was trueblood m pressed a button on his desk ill get the chief of staff in on this he said i know the bones of the case but he can fill in the flesh its a drab little story im afraid the chief of staff came in he was a colonel in the sappers a man of about bonds age but his hair was prematurely grey at the temples from the endless grind of work and responsibility he was saved from a nervous breakdown by physical toughness and a sense of humour he was bonds best friend at headquarters they smiled at each other bring up a chair chief of staff ive given the strangways case got to get the mess cleared up before we make a new appointment there can be acting head of station in the meantime i want him to leave in a week would you fix that with the colonial office and the governor and now lets go over the case he turned to bond i think you knew strangways see you worked with him on that treasure business about five years ago what did you think of him good man sir bit highly strung id have thought hed have been relieved by now five years is a long time in the tropics m ignored the comment and his number two this girl trueblood mary trueblood ever come across her no sir i see shes got a good record chief officer wrns and then came to us nothing against her on her confidential record goodlooker to judge from her photographs that probably explains it would you say strangways was a bit of a womanizer could have been said bond carefully not wanting to say anything against strangways but remembering the dashing good looks but whats happened to them sir thats what we want to find out said m theyve gone vanished into thin air both went on the same evening about three weeks ago left strangwayss bungalow burned to the groundradio codebooks files nothing left but a few charred scraps the girl left all her thingsantact must have taken only what she stood up in even her passport was in her room but it would have been easy for strangways to cook up two passports he had plenty of blanks he was passport control officer for the island any number of planes they could have takento florida or south america or one of the other islands in his area police are still checking the passenger lists nothings come up yet but they could always have gone to ground for a day or two and then done a bunk dyed the girls hair and so forth airport security doesnt amount to much in that part of the world isnt that so chief of staff yes sir the chief of staff sounded dubious but i still cant understand that last radio contact he turned to bond you see they began to make their routine contact at eighteenthirty jamaican time someone radio security thinks it was the girl acknowledged our www and then went off the air we tried to regain contact but there was obviously something fishy and we broke off no answer to the blue call or to the red so that was that next day section iii sent down from washington by that time the police had taken over and the governor had already made up his mind and was trying to get the case hushed up it all seemed pretty obvious to him strangways has had occasional girl trouble down there cant blame the chap myself its a quiet station not much to occupy his time the governor jumped to the obvious conclusions so of course did the local police sex and machete fights are about all they understand spent a week down there and couldnt turn up a scrap of contrary evidence he reported accordingly and we sent him back to washington since then the police have been scraping around rather ineffectually and getting nowhere the chief of staff paused he looked apologetically at m i know youre inclined to agree with the governor sir but that radio contact sticks in my throat i just cant see where it fits into the runawaycouple picture and strangwayss friends at his club say he was perfectly normal left in the middle of a rubber of bridgealways did when he was getting close to his deadline said hed be back in twenty minutes ordered drinks all roundagain just as he always didand left the club dead on sixfifteen exactly to schedule then he vanished into thin air even left his car in front of the club now why should he set the rest of his bridge four looking for him if he wanted to skip with the girl why not leave in the morning or better still late at night after theyd made their radio call and tidied up their lives it just doesnt make sense to me m grunted noncommittally people inerlove do stupid things he said gruffly act like lunatics sometimes and anyway what other explanation is there absolutely no trace of foul playno reason for it that anyone can see its a quiet station down there same routines every monthan occasional communist trying to get into the island from cuba crooks from england thinking they can hide away just because jamaicas so far from london i dont suppose strangways has had a big case since was there he turned to bond on what youve heard what do you think theres not much else to tell you bond was definite i just cant see strangways flying off the handle like that sir i daresay he was having an affair with the girl though i wouldnt have thought he was a man to mix business with pleasure but the service was his whole life hed never have let it down i can see him handing in his papers and the girl doing the same and then going off with her after youd sent out reliefs but i dont believe it was in him to leave us in the air like this and from what you say of the girl id say it would be much the same with her chief officers wrns dont go out of their senses thank you ms voice was controlled these considerations had also crossed my mind no ones been jumping to conclusions without weighing all the possibilities perhaps you can suggest another solution m sat back and waited he reached for his pipe and began filling it the case bored him he didnt like personnel problems least of all messy ones like this there were plenty of other worries waiting to be coped with round the world it was only to give bond the pretence of a job mixed with a good rest that he had decided to send him out to jamaica to close the case he put the pipe in his mouth and reached for the matches well bond wasnt going to be put off his stride he had liked strangways and he was impressed by the points the chief of staff had made he said well sir for instance what was the last case strangways was working on had he reported anything or was there anything section iii had asked him to look into anything at all in the last few months nothing whatsoever m was definite he took the pipe out of his mouth and cocked it at the chief of staff right right sir said the chief of staff only that damned business about the birds oh that said m contemptuously some rot from the zoo or somebody got wished on us by the colonial office about six weeks ago wasnt it thats right sir but it wasnt the zoo it was some people in america called the audubon society they protect rare birds from extinction or something like that got on to our ambassador in washington and the fo passed the buck to the colonial office they shoved it on to us seems these bird people are pretty powerful in america they even got an atom bombing range shifted on the west coast because it interfered with some birds nests m snorted damned thing called a whooping crane read about in the papers bond persisted could you tell me about it sir what did the audubon people want us to do m waved his pipe impatiently he picked up the strangways file and tossed it down in front of the chief of staff you tell him chief of staff he said wearily its all in there the chief of staff took the file and riffled through the pages towards the back he found what he wanted and bent the file in half there was silence in the room while he ran his eye over three pages of typescript which bond could see were headed with the blue and white cipher of the colonial office bond sat quietly trying not to feel ms coiled impatience radiating across the desk the chief of staff slapped the file shut he said well this is the story as we passed it to strangways on january zoth he acknowledged receipt but after that we heard nothing from him the chief of staff sat back in his chair he looked at bond it seems theres a bird called a roseate spoonbill theres a coloured photograph of it in here looks like a sort of pink stork with an ugly flat bill which it uses for digging for food in the mud not many years ago these birds were dying out just before the war there were only a few hundred left in the world mostly in florida and thereabouts then somebody reported a colony of them on an island called crab key between jamaica and cuba its british territorya dependency of jamaica used to be a guano island but the quality of the guano was too low for the cost of digging it when the birds were found there it had been uninhabited for about fifty years the audubon people went there and ended up by leasing a corner as a sanctuary for these spoonbills put two wardens in charge and persuaded the airlines to stop flying over the island and disturbing the birds the birds flourished and at the last count there were about five thousand of them on the island then came the war the price of guano went up and some bright chap had the idea of buying the island and starting to work it again he negotiated with the jamaican government and bought the place for ten thousand pounds with the condition that he didnt disturb the lease of the sanctuary that was in well this man imported plenty of cheap labour and soon had the place working at a profit and its gone on making a profit until recently then the price of guano took a dip and its thought that he must be having a hard time making both ends meet who is this man chinaman or rather half chinese and half german got a daft name calls himself doctor nodoctor julius no no spelt like yes thats right any facts about him nothing except that he keeps very much to himself hasnt been seen since he made his deal with the jamaican government and theres no traffic with the island its his and he keeps it private says he doesnt want people disturbing the guanay birds who turn out his guano seems reasonable well nothing happened until just before christmas when one of the audubon wardens a barbadian good solid chap apparently arrived on the north shore of jamaica in a canoe he was very sick he was terribly burneddied in a few days before he died he told some crazy story about their camp having been attacked by a dragon with flames coming out of its mouth this dragon had killed his pal and burned up the camp and gone roaring off into the bird sanctuary belching fire among the birds and scaring them off to god knows where he had been badly burned but hed escaped to the coast and stolen a canoe and sailed all one night to jamaica poor chap was obviously off his rocker and that was that except that a routine report had to be sent off to the audubon society and they werent satisfied sent down two of their big brass in a beechcraft from miami to investigate theres an airstrip on the island this chinamans got a grumman amphibian for bringing in supplies m interjected sourly all these people seem to have a hell of a lot of money to throw about on their damned birds bond and the chief of staff exchanged smiles m had been trying for years to get the treasury to give him an auster for the caribbean station the chief of staff continued and the beechcraft crashed on landing and killed the two audubon men well that aroused these bird people to a fury they got a corvette from the us training squadron in the caribbean to make a call on doctor no thats how powerful these people are seems theyve got quite a lobby in washington the captain of the corvette reported that he was received very civilly by doctor no but was kept well away from the guano workings he was taken to the airstrip and examined the remains of the plane smashed to pieces but nothing suspiciouscame in to land too fast probably the bodies of the two men and the pilot had been reverently embalmed and packed in handsome coffins which were handed over with quite a ceremony the captain was very impressed by doctor nos courtesy he asked to see the wardens camp and he was taken out there and shown the remains of it doctor nos theory was that the two men had gone mad because of the heat and the loneliness or at any rate that one of them had gone mad and burned down the camp with the other inside it this seemed possible to the captain when hed seen what a godforsaken bit of marsh the men had been living in for ten years or more there was nothing else to see and he was politely steered back to his ship and sailed away the chief of staff spread his hands and thats the lot except that the captain reported that he saw only a handful of roseate spoonbills when his report got back to the audubon society it was apparently the loss of their blasted birds that infuriated these people most of all and ever since then theyve been nagging at us to have an inquiry into the whole business of course nobody at the colonial office or in jamaicas in the least interested so in the end the whole fairy story was dumped in our lap the chief of staff shrugged his shoulders with finality and thats how this pile of bumf he waved the file or at any rate the guts of it got landed on strangways m looked morosely at bond see what i mean just the sort of mares nest these old womens societies are always stirring up people start preserving somethingchurches old houses decaying pictures birdsand theres always a hullabaloo of some sort the trouble is these sort of people get really worked up about their damned birds or whatever it is they get the politicians involved and somehow they all seem to have stacks of money god knows where it comes from other old women i suppose and then there comes a point when someone has to do something to keep them quiet like this case it gets shunted off on to me because the place is british territory at the same time its private land nobody wants to interfere officially so im supposed to do what send a submarine to the island for what to find out whats happened to a covey of pink storks m snorted anyway you asked about strangwayss last case and thats it m leant forward belligerently any questions ive got a busy day ahead bond grinned he couldnt help it ms occasional outbursts of rage were so splendid and nothing set him going so well as any attempt to waste the time and energies and slim funds of the secret service bond got to his feet perhaps if i could have the file sir he said placatingly it just strikes me that four people seem to have died more or less because of these birds perhaps two more didstrangways and the trueblood girl i agree it sounds ridiculous but weve got nothing else to go on take it take it said m impatiently and hurry up and get your holiday over you may not have noticed it but the rest of the world happens to be in a bit of a mess bond reached across and picked up the file he also made to pick up his beretta and the holster no said m sharply leave that and mind youve got the hang of the other two guns by the time i see you again bond looked across into ms eyes for the first time in his life he hated the man he knew perfectly well why m was being tough and mean it was deferred punishment for having nearly got killed on his last job plus getting away from this filthy weather into the sunshine m couldnt bear his men to have an easy time in a way bond felt sure he was being sent on this cushy assignment to humiliate him the old bastard with the anger balling up inside him like cats fur bond said ill see to it sir and turned and walked out of the room iv reception committee the sixtyeight tons deadweight of the superconstellation hurtled high above the green and brown chequerboard of cuba and with only another hundred miles to go started its slow declining flight towards jamaica bond watched the big green turtlebacked island grow on the horizon and the water below him turn from the dark blue of the cuba deep to the azure and milk of the inshore shoals then they were over the north shore over its rash of millionaire hotels and crossing the high mountains of the interior the scattered dice of smallholdings showed on the slopes and in clearings in the jungle and the setting sun flashed gold on the bright worms of tumbling rivers and streams xaymaca the arawak indians had called itthe land of hills and rivers bonds heart lifted with the beauty of one of the most fertile islands in the world the other side of the mountains was in deep violet shadow lights were already twinkling in the foothills and spangling the streets of kingston but beyond the far arm of the harbour and the airport were still touched with the sun against which the port royal lighthouse blinked ineffectually now the constellation was getting its nose down into a wide sweep beyond the harbour there was a slight thump as the tricycle landing gear extended under the aircraft and locked into position and a shrill hydraulic whine as the brake flaps slid out of the trailing edge of the wings slowly the great aircraft turned in again towards the land and for a moment the setting sun poured gold into the cabin then the plane had dipped below the level of the blue mountains and was skimming down towards the single northsouth runway there was a glimpse of a road and telephone wires then the concrete scarred with black skidmarks was under the belly of the plane and there was the soft double thump of a perfect landing and the roar of reversing props as they taxied in towards the low white airport buildings the sticky fingers of the tropics brushed bonds face as he left the aircraft and walked over to health and immigration he knew that by the time he had got through customs he would be sweating he didnt mind after the rasping cold of london the stuffy velvet heat was easily bearable bonds passport described him as import and export merchant what company sir universal export are you here on business or pleasure sir pleasure i hope you enjoy your stay sir the negro immigration officer handed bond his passport with indifference thank you bond walked out into the customs hall at once he saw the tall brownskinned man against the barrier he was wearing the same old faded blue shirt and probably the same khaki twill trousers he had been wearing when bond first met him five years before quarrel from behind the barrier the cayman islander gave a broad grin he lifted his right forearm across his eyes in the old salute of the west indians how you capn he called delightedly im fine said bond just wait till i get my bag through got the car sure capn the customs officer who like most men from the waterfront knew quarrel chalked bonds bag without opening it and bond picked it up and went out through the barrier quarrel took it from him and held out his right hand bond took the warm dry calloused paw and looked into the dark grey eyes that showed descent from a cromwellian soldier or a pirate of morgans time you havent changed quarrel he said affectionately hows the turtle fishing not so bad capn an not so good much de same as always he looked critically at bond yo been sick or somepun bond was surprised as a matter of fact i have but ive been fit for weeks what made you say that quarrel was embarrassed sorry capn he said thinking he might have offended bond dere some pain lines in yo face since de las time oh well said bond it was nothing much but i could do with a spell of your training im not as fit as i ought to be shooting capn they were moving towards the exit when there came the sharp crack and flash of a press camera a pretty chinese girl in jamaican dress was lowering her speed graphic she came up to them she said with synthetic charm thank you gentlemen i am from the daily gleaner she glanced down at a list in her hand mister bond isnt it and how long will you be with us mister bond bond was offhand this was a bad start in transit he said shortly i think youll find there were more interesting people on the plane oh no im sure not mister bond you look very important and what hotel will you be staying at damn thought bond he said myrtle bank and moved on thank you mister bond said the tinkling voice i hope youll enjoy they were outside as they walked towards the parking place bond said ever seen that girl at the airport before quarrel reflected reckn not capn but de gleaner have plenty camera gals bond was vaguely worried there was no earthly reason why his picture should be wanted by the press it was five years since his last adventures on the island and anyway his name had been kept out of the papers they got to the car it was a black sunbeam alpine bond looked sharply at it and then at the number plate strangwayss car what the hell where did you get this quarrel adc tell me fe to take him capn him say hit de only spare car dey have why capn him no good oh its all right quarrel said bond resignedly come on lets get going bond got into the passenger seat it was entirely his fault he might have guessed at the chance of getting this car but it would certainly put the finger on him and on what he was doing in jamaica if anyone happened to be interested they moved off down the long cactusfringed road towards the distant lights of kingston normally bond would have sat and enjoyed the beauty of it allthe steady zing of the crickets the rush of warm scented air the ceiling of stars the necklace of yellow lights shimmering across the harbourbut now he was cursing his carelessness and knowing what he shouldnt have done what he had done was to send one signal through the colonial office to the governor in it he had first asked that the adc should get quarrel over from the cayman islands for an indefinite period on a salary of ten pounds a week quarrel had been with bond on his last adventure in jamaica he was an invaluable handyman with all the fine seamans qualities of the cayman islander and he was a passport into the lower strata of coloured life which would otherwise be closed to bond everybody loved him and he was a splendid companion bond knew that quarrel was vital if he was to get anywhere on the strangways casewhether it was a case or just a scandal then bond had asked for a single room and shower at the blue hills hotel for the loan of a car and for quarrel to meet him with the car at the airport most of this had been wrong in particular bond should have taken a taxi to his hotel and made contact with quarrel later then he would have seen the car and had a chance to change it as it was reflected bond he might just as well have advertised his visit and its purpose in the gleaner he sighed it was the mistakes one made at the beginning of a case that were the worst they were the irretrievable ones the ones that got you off on the wrong foot that gave the enemy the firstgame but was there an enemy wasnt he being overcautious on an impulse bond turned in his seat a hundred yards behind were two dim sidelights most jamaicans drive with their headlights full on bond turned back he said quarrel at the end of the palisadoes where the left fork goes to kingston and right to morant i want you to turn quickly down the morant road and stop at once and turn your lights off right and now go like hell okay capn quarrels voice sounded pleased he put his foot down to the floorboards the little car gave a deep growl and tore off down the white road now they were at the end of the straight the car skidded round the curve where the corner of the harbour bit into the land another five hundred yards and they would be at the intersection bond looked back there was no sign of the other car here was the signpost quarrel did a racing change and hurled the car round on a tight lock he pulled in to the side and dowsed his lights bond turned and waited at once he heard the roar of a big car at speed lights blazed on looking for them then the car was past and tearing on towards kingston bond had time to notice that it was a big american type taxicab and that there was no one in it but the driver then it was gone the dust settled slowly they sat for ten minutes saying nothing then bond told quarrel to turn the car and take the kingston road he said i think that car was interested in us quarrel you dont drive an empty taxi back from the airport its an expensive run keep a watch out he may find weve fooled him and be waiting for us sho ting capn said quarrel happily this was just the sort of life he had hoped for when he got bonds message they came into the stream of kingston trafficbuses cars horsedrawn carts pannierladen donkeys down from the hills and the handdrawn barrows selling violent coloured drinks in the crush it was impossible to say if they were being followed they turned off to the right and up towards the hills there were many cars behind them any one of them could have been the american taxi they drove for a quarter of an hour up to halfway tree and then on to the junction road the main road across the island soon there was a neon sign of a green palm tree and underneath blue hills the hotel they drove in and up the drive lined with neatly rounded bushes of bougainvillaea a hundred yards higher up the road the black taxi waved the following drivers on and pulled in to the left it made a uturn in a break in the traffic and swept back down the hill towards kingston the blue hills was a comfortable oldfashioned hotel with modern trimmings bond was welcomed with deference because his reservation had been made by kings house he was shown to a fine corner room with a balcony looking out over the distant sweep of kingston harbour thankfully he took off his london clothes now moist with perspiration and went into the glassfronted shower and turned the cold water full on and stood under it for five minutes during which he washed his hair to remove the last dirt of bigcity life then he pulled on a pair of sea island cotton shorts and with sensual pleasure at the warm soft air on his nakedness unpacked his things and rang for the waiter bond ordered a double gin and tonic and one whole green lime when the drink came he cut the lime in half dropped the two squeezed halves into the long glass almost filled the glass with ice cubes and then poured in the tonic he took the drink out on to the balcony and sat and looked out across the spectacular view he thought how wonderful it was to be away from headquarters and from london and from hospitals and to be here at this moment doing what he was doing and knowing as all his senses told him that he was on a good tough case again he sat for a while luxuriously letting the gin relax him he ordered another and drank it down it was sevenfifteen he had arranged for quarrel to pick him up at seventhirty they were going to have dinner together bond had asked quarrel to suggest a place after a moment of embarrassment quarrel had said that whenever he wanted to enjoy himself in kingston he went to a waterfront nightspot called the joy boat hit no great shakes capn he had said apologetically but da food an drinks an music is good and i got a good fren dere him owns de joint dey calls him pusfeller seein how him once fought wit a big hoctopus bond smiled to himself at the way quarrel like most west indians added an h where it wasnt needed and took it off when it was he went into his room and dressed in his old dark blue tropical worsted suit a sleeveless white cotton shirt and a black knitted tie looked in the glass to see that the walther didnt show under his armpit and went down and out to where the car was waiting they swooped down quietly through the soft singing dusk into kingston and turned to the left along the harbour side they passed one or two smart restaurants and night clubs from which came the throb and twang of calypso music there was a stretch of private houses that dwindled into a poorclass shopping centre and then into shacks then where the road curved away from the sea there was a blaze of golden neon in the shape of a spanish galleon above green lettering that said the joy boat they pulled into a parking place and bond followed quarrel through the gate into a small garden of palm trees growing out of lawn at the end was the beach and the sea tables were dotted about under the palms and in the centre was a small deserted cement dance floor to one side of which a calypso trio in sequined scarlet shirts was softly improvising on take her to jamaica where the rum comes from only half the tables were filled mostly by coloured people there was a sprinkling of british and american sailors with their girls an immensely fat negro in a smart white dinner jacket left one of the tables and came to meet them hi mister q long time no see nice table for two thats right pusfeller closer to da kitchen dan da music the big man chuckled he led them down towards the sea and placed them at a quiet table under a palm tree that grew out of the base of the restaurant building drinks gemmun bond ordered his gin and tonic with a lime and quarrel a red stripe beer they scanned the menu and both decided on broiled lobster followed by a rare steak with native vegetables the drinks came the glasses were dripping with con densation the small fact reminded bond of other times in hot climates a few yards away the sea lisped on the flat sand the threepiece began playing kitch above them the palm fronds clashed softly in the night breeze a gecko chuckled somewhere in the garden bond thought of the london he had left the day before he said i like this place quarrel quarrel was pleased him a good fren of mine da pusfeller him knows mostly what goes hon hin kingston case you got hany questions capn him come

plenty private tell da trut capn quarrel was apologetic dat crab key scare me plenty bond said thoughtfully well well the food came they ordered another round of drinks and ate while they ate bond gave quarrel an outline of the strangways case quarrel listened carefully occasionally asking questions he was particularly interested in the birds on crab key and what the watchmen had said and how the plane was supposed to have crashed finally he pushed his plate away he wiped the back of his hand across his mouth he took out a cigarette and lit it he leant forward capn he said softly i no mind if hit was birds or butterflies or bees if dey was on crab key and da commander was stickin his nose into da business yo kin bet yo bottom dollar him been mashed him and him girl da chinee mash dem

dis world an what dem want sufficient dem gits a glint of light caught the corner of bonds eye he turned quickly the chinese girl from the airport was standing in the nearby shadows now she was dressed in a tightfitting sheath of black satin slashed up one side almost to her hip she had a leica with a flash attachment in one hand the other was in a leather case at her side the hand came out holding a flashbulb the girl slipped the base into her mouth to wet it and improve the contact and made to screw it into the reflector get that girl said bond quickly in two strides quarrel was up with her he held out his hand evenin missy he said softly the girl smiled she let the leica hang on the thin strap round her neck she took quarrels hand quarrel swung her round like a ballet dancer now he had her hand behind her back and she was in the crook of his arm she looked up at him angrily dont youre hurting quarrel smiled down into the flashing dark eyes in the pale almondshaped face capn like you take a drink wit we he said soothingly he came back to the table moving the girl along with him he hooked a chair out with his foot and sat her down beside him keeping the grip on her wrist behind her back they sat bolt upright like quarrelling lovers bond looked into the pretty angry little face good evening what are you doing here why do you want another picture of me im doing the nightspots the cupids bow of a mouth parted persuasively the first picture of you didnt come out tell this man to leave me alone so you work for the gleaner whats your name i wont tell you bond cocked an eyebrow at quarrel quarrels eyes narrowed his hand behind the girls back turned slowly the girl struggled like an eel her teeth clenched on her lower lip quarrel went on twisting suddenly she said ow sharply and gasped ill tell i quarrel eased his grip the girl looked furiously at bond annabel chung bond said to quarrel call the pusfeller quarrel picked up a fork with his free hand and clanged it against a glass the big negro hurried up bond looked up at him ever seen this girl before yes boss she come here sometimes she bein a nuisance want for me to send her away no we like her said bond amiably but she wants to take a studio portraitof me and i dont know if shes worth the money would you call up the gleaner and ask if theyve got a photographer called annabel chung if she really is one of their people she ought to be good enough sure boss the man hurried away bond smiled at the girl why didnt you ask that man to rescue you the girl glowered at him im sorry to have to exert pressure said bond but my export manager in london said that kingston was full of shady characters im sure youre not one of them but i really cant understand why youre so anxious to get my picture tell me why what i told you said the girl sulkily its my job bond tried other questions she didnt answer them the pusfeller came up thats right boss annabel chung one of their freelance girls they say she takes fine pictures youll be okay with her he looked bland studio portrait studio bed more like thanks said bond the negro went away bond turned back to the girl freelance he said softly that still doesnt explain who wanted my picture his face went cold now give no said the girl sullenly all right quarrel go ahead bond sat back his instincts told him that this was the sixtyfour thousand dollar question if he could get the answer out of the girl he might be saved weeks of legwork quarrels right shoulder started to dip downwards the girl squirmed towards him to ease the pressure but he held her body away with his free hand the girls face strained towards quarrels suddenly she spat full in his eyes quarrel grinned and increased the twist the girls feet kicked wildly under the table she hissed out words in chinese sweat beaded on her forehead tell said bond softly tell and it will stop and well be friends and have a drink he was getting worried the girls arm must be on the verge of breaking you suddenly the girls left hand flew up and into quarrels face bond was too slow to stop her something glinted and there was a sharp explosion bond snatched at her arm and dragged it back blood was streaming down quarrels cheek glass and metal tinkled on to the table she had smashed the flashbulb on quarrels face if she had been able to reach an eye it would have been blinded quarrels free hand went up and felt his cheek he put it in front of his eyes and looked at the blood aha there was nothing but admiration and a feline pleasure in his voice he said equably to bond we get nuthen out of dis gal capn she plenty tough you want fe me to break shes arm good god no bond let go the arm he was holding let her go he felt angry with himself for having hurt the girl and still failed but he had learned something whoever was behind her held his people by a steel chain quarrel brought the girls right arm from behind her back he still held on to the wrist now he opened the girls hand he looked into her eyes his own were cruel you mark me missy now i mark you he brought up his other hand and took the mount of venus the soft lozenge of flesh in the palm below her thumb between his thumb and forefinger he began to squeeze it bond could see his knuckles go white with the pressure the girl gave a yelp she hammered at quarrels hand and then at his face quarrel grinned and squeezed harder suddenly he let go the girl shot to her feet and backed away from the table her bruised hand at her mouth she took her hand down and hissed furiously hell get you you bastards then her leica dangling she ran off through the trees quarrel laughed shortly he took a napkin and wiped it down his cheek and threw it on the ground and took up another he said to bond shes love moun be sore long after ma face done get healed dat a fine piece of a woman de love moun when him fat like wit dat girl you kin tell herll be good in bed you know dat capn no said bond thats new to me sho ting dat piece of da han most hindicative don you worry bout she he added noticing the dubious expression on bonds face hers got nuttin but a big bruise on shes love moun but boy was dat a fat love moun i come back after dat girl sometime see if ma teory is da troof appropriately the band started playing don touch me tomato bond said quarrel its time you married and settled down and you leave that girl alone or youll get a knife between your ribs now come on well get the check and go its three oclock in the morning in london where i was yesterday i need a nights sleep youve got to start getting me into training i think im going to need it and its about time you put some plaster on that cheek of yours shes written her name and address on it quarrel grunted reminiscently he said with quiet pleasure dat were some tough baby he picked up a fork and clanged it against his glass v facts and figures hell get you hell get you hell get you you bastards the words were still ringing in bonds brain the next day as he sat on his balcony and ate a delicious breakfast and gazed out across the riot of tropkal gardens to kingston five miles below him now he was sure that strangways and the girl had been killed someone had needed to stop them looking any further into his business so he had killed them and destroyed the records of what they were investigating the same person knew or suspected that the secret service would follow up strangwayss disappearance somehow he had known that bond had been given the job he had wanted a picture of bond and he had wanted to know where bond was staying he would be keeping an eye on bond to see if bond picked up any of the leads that had led to strangwayss death if bond did so bond would also have to be eliminated there would be a car smash or a street fight or some other innocent death and how bond wondered would this person react to their treatment of the chung girl if he was as ruthless as bond supposed that would be enough it showed that bond was on to something perhaps strangways had made a preliminary report to london before he was killed perhaps someone had leaked the enemy would be foolish to take chances if he had any sense after the chung incident he would deal with bond and perhaps also with quarrel without delay bond lit his first cigarette of the daythe first royal blend hehad smoked for five yearsand let the smoke come out between his teeth in a luxurious hiss that was his enemy appreciation now who was this enemy well there was only one candidate and a pretty insubstantial one at that doctor no doctor julius no the german chinese who owned crab key and made his money out of guano there had been nothing on this man in records and a signal to the fbi had been negative the affair of the roseate spoonbills and the trouble with the audubon society meant precisely nothing except as m had said that a lot of old women had got excited about some pink storks all the same four people had died because of these storks and most significant of all to bond quarrel was scared of doctor no arid his island that was very odd indeed cayman islanders least of all quarrel did not scare easily and why had doctor no got this mania for privacy why did he go to such expense and trouble to keep people away from his guano island guanobird dung who wanted the stuff how valuable was it bond was due to call on the governor at ten oclock after he had made his number he would get hold of the colonial secretary and try and find out all about the damned stuff and about crab key and if possible about doctor no there was a double knock on the door bond got up and unlocked it it was quarrel his left cheek decorated with a piratical cross of stickingplaster mornin capn yo said eighttirty yes come on in quarrel weve got a busy day had some breakfast yes tank you capn salt fish an ackee an a tot of rum good god said bond thats tough stuff to start the day on mos refreshin said quarrel stolidly they

know where ill be tanks capn said quarrel awestruck by the big sum he stowed it away inside his blue shirt and buttoned the shirt up to his neck anyting helse no but take a lot of trouble about not being followed leave the car somewhere downtown and walk to these places and watch out particularly for any chinese near you bond got up and they went to the door see you tomorrow morning ajt sixfifteen and well get over to the north coast as far as i can see thats going to be our base for a while quarrel nodded his face was enigmatic he said okay capn and went off down the corridor half an hour later bond went downstairs and took a taxi to kings house he didnt sign the governors book in the cool hall he was put in a waiting room for the quarter of an hour necessary to show him that he was unimportant then the adc came for him and took him up to the governors study on the first floor it was a large cool room smelling of cigar smoke the acting governor in a cream tussore suit and an inappropriate wing collar and spotted bow tie was sitting at a broad mahogany desk on which there was nothing but the daily gleaner the times weekly and a bowl of hibiscus blossoms his hands lay flat on the desk in front of him he was sixtyish with a red rather petulant face and bright bitter blue eyes he didnt smile or get up he said good morning mrerbond please sit down bond took the chair across the desk from the governor and sat down he said good morning sir and waited a friend at the colonial office had told him his reception would be frigid hes nearly at retiring age only an interim appointment we had to find an acting governor to take over at short notice when sir hugh foot was promoted foot was a great success this mans not even trying to compete he knows hes only got the job for a few months while we find someone to replace foot this mans been passed over for the governor generalship of rhodesia now all he wants is to retire and get some directorships in the city last thing he wants is any trouble in jamaica he keeps on trying to close this strangways case of yours wont like you ferreting about the governor cleared his throat he recognized that bond wasnt one of the servile ones you wanted to see me just to make my number sir said bond equably im here on the strangways case i think you had a signal front the secretary of state this was a reminder that the people behind bond were powerful people bond didnt like attempts to squash him or his service i recall the signal and what can i do for you so far as were concerned here the case is closed in what way closed sir the governor said roughly strangways obviously did a bunk with the girl unbalanced sort of fellow at the best of times some of yourercolleagues dont seem to be able to leave women alone the governor clearly included bond had to bail the chap out of various scandals before now doesnt do the colony any good mrerbond hope your people will be sending us a rather better type of man to take his place that is he added coldly if a regional control man is really needed here personally i have every confidence in our police bond smiled sympathetically ill report your views sir i expect my chief will like to discuss them with the minister of defence and the secretary of state naturally if you would like totake over these extra duties it will be a saving in manpower so far as my service is concerned im sure the jamaican constabulary is most efficient the governor looked at bond suspiciously perhaps he had better handle this man a bit more carefully this is an informal discussion mr bond when i have decided on my views i will communicate them myself to the secretary of state in the meantime is there anyone you wish to see on my staff id like to have a word with the colonial secretary sir really and why pray theres been some trouble on crab key something about a bird sanctuary the case was passed to us by the colonial office my chief asked me to look into it while im here the governor looked relieved certainly certainly ill see that mr pleydellsmith receives you straight away so you feel we can leave the strangways case to sort itself out theyll turn up before long never fear he reached over and rang a bell the adc came in this gentleman would like to see the colonial secretary adc take him along would you ill call mr pleydellsmith myself and ask him to make himself available he got up and came round the desk he held out his hand goodbye then mr bond and im so glad we see eye to eye crab key eh never been there myself but im sure it would repay a visit bond shook hands that was what i was thinking goodbye sir goodbye goodbye the governor watched bonds back retreating out of the door and himself returned well satisfied to his desk young whippersnapper he said to the empty room he sat down and said a few peremptory words down the telephone to the colonial secretary then he picked up the times weekly and turned to the stock exchange prices the colonial secretary was a youngish shaggyhaired man with bright boyish eyes he was one of those nervous pipe smokers who are constantly patting their pockets for matches shaking the box to see how many are left in it or knocking the dottle out of their pipes after he had gone through this routine two or three times in his first ten minutes with bond bond wondered if he ever got any smoke into his lungs at all after pumping energetically at bonds hand and waving vaguely at a chair pleydellsmith walked up and down the room scratching his temple with the stem of his pipe bond bond bond rings a bell now let me see yes by jove you werejthe chap who was mixed up in that treasure business here by jove yes four five years ago found the file lying around only the other day splendid show what a lark i say wish youd start another bonfire like that here stir the place up a bit all they think of nowadays is federation and their bloody selfimportance selfdetermination indeed they cant even run a bus service and the colour problem my dear chap theres far more colour problem between the straighthaired and the crinklyhaired jamaicans than there is between me and my black cook howeverpleydellsmith came to rest beside his desk he sat down opposite bond and draped one leg over the arm of his chair reaching for a tobacco jar with the arms of kings college cambridge on it he dug into it and started filling his pipei mean to say i dont want to bore you with all that you go ahead and bore me whats your problem glad to help i bet its more interesting than this muck he waved at the pile of papers in his in tray bond grinned at him this was more like it he had found an ally and an intelligent one at that well he said seriously im here on the strangways case but first of all i want to ask you a question that may sound odd exactly how did you come to be looking at that other case of mine you say you found the file lying about how was that had someone asked for it i dont want to be indiscreet so dont answer if you dont want to im just inquisitive pleydellsmith cocked an eye at him i suppose thats your job he reflected gazing at the ceiling well now i come to think of it i saw it on my secretarys desk shes a new girl said she was trying to get up to date with the files mark you the colonial secretary hastened to exonerate his girl there were plenty of other files on her desk it was just this one that caught my eye oh i see said bond it was like that he smiled apologetically sorry but various people seem to be rather interested in me being here what i really wanted to talk to you about was crab key anything you know about the place and about this chinaman doctor no who bought it and anything you can tell me about his guano business rather a tall order im afraid but any scraps will help pleydellsmith laughed shortly through the stem of his pipe he jerked the pipe out of his mouth and talked while he tamped down the burning tobacco with his matchbox bitten off a bit more than you can chew on guano talk to you for hours about it started in the consular before i transferred to the colonial office first job was in peru had a lot to do with their people who administer the whole tradecompania aministradora del guano nice people the pipe was going now and pleydellsmith threw his matchbox down on the table as for the rest its just a question of getting the file he rang a bell in a minute the door opened behind bond miss taro the file on crab key please the one on the sale of the place and the other one on that warden fellow who turned up before christmas miss longfellow will know where to find them a soft voice said yes sir bond heard the door close now then guano pleydellsmith tilted his chair back bond prepared to be bored as you know its bird dung comes frorn the rear end of two birds the masked booby and the guanay so far as crab key is concerned its only the guanay otherwise known as the green cormorant same bird as you find in england the guanay is a machine for converting fish into guano they mostly eat anchovies just to show you how much fish they eat theyve found up to seventy anchovies inside one bird pleydellsmith took out his pipe and pointed it impressively at bond the whole population of peru eats four thousand tons of fish a year the sea birds of the country eat five hundred thousand tons bond pursed his lips to show he was impressed really well now continued the colonial secretary every day each one of these hundreds of thousands of guanays eat a pound or so of fish and deposit an ounce of guano on the guanerathats the guano island bond interrupted why dont they do it in the sea dont know pleydellsmith took the question and turned it over in his mind never occurred to me anyway they dont they do it on the land and theyve been doing it since before genesis that makes the hell of a lot of bird dungmillions of tons of it on the pescadores and the other guanera then around someone discovered it was the greatest natural fertilizer in the worldstuffed with nitrates and phosphates and what have you and the ships and the men came to the guaneras and simply ravaged them for twenty years or more its a time known as the saturnalia in peru it was like the klondyke people fought over the muck hijacked each others ships shot the workers sold phoney maps of secret guano islandsanything you like and people made fortunes out of the stuff where does crab key come in bond wanted to get down to cases that was the only worthwhile guanera so far north it was worked too god knows who by but the stuff had a low nitrate content waters not as rich round here as it is down along the humboldt current so the fish arent so rich in chemicals so the guano isnt so rich either crab key got worked on and off when the price was high enough but the whole industry went bust with crab key and the other poorquality deposits in the van when the germans invented artificial chemical manure by this time peru had realized that she had squandered a fantastic capital asset and she set about organizing the remains of the industry and protecting the guanera she nationalized the industry and protected the birds and slowly very slowly the supplies built up again then people found that there were snags about the german stuff it impoverishes the soil which guano doesnt do and gradually the price of guano improved and the industry staggered back to its feet now its going fine except that peru keeps most of the guano to herself for her own agriculture and that was where crab key came in again ah yes said pleydellsmith patting his pockets for the matches finding them on the desk shaking them against his ear and starting his pipefilling routine at the beginning of the war this chinaman who must be a wily devil by the way got the idea that he could make a good thing out of the old guanera on crab key the price was about fifty dollars a ton on this side of the atlantic and he bought the island from us for about ten thousand pounds as i recall it brought in labour and got to work been working it ever since must have made a fortune he ships direct to europe to antwerp they send him a ship once a month hes installed the latest crushers and separators sweats his labour i daresay to make a decent profit hed have to particularly now last year i heard he was only getting about thirtyeight to forty dollars a ton cif antwerp god knows what he must pay his labour to make a profit at that price ive never been able to find out he runs that place like a fortresssort of forced labour camp no one ever gets off it ive heard some funny rumours but no ones ever complained its his island of course and he can do what he likes on it bond hunted for clues would it really be so valuable to him this place what do you suppose its worth pleydellsmith said the guanay is the most valuable bird in the world each pair produces about two dollars worth of guano in a year without any expense to the owner each female lays anaverage of three eggs and raises two young two broods a year say theyre worth fifteen dollars a pair and say there are one hundred thousand birds on crab key which is a reasonable guess on the old figures we have that makes his birds worth a million and a half dollars pretty valuable property add the value of the installations say another million and youve got a small fortune on that hideous little place which reminds me pleydellsmith pressed the bell what the hell has happened to those files youll find all the dope you want in them the door opened behind bond pleydellsmith said irritably really miss taro what about those files very sorry sir said the soft voice but we cant find them anywhere what do you mean cant find them who had them last commander strangways sir well i remember distinctly him bringing them back to this room what happened to them then cant say sir the voice was unemotional the covers are there but theres nothing inside them bond turned in his chair he glanced at the girl and turned back he smiled grimly to himself he knew where the files had gone he also knew why the old file on himself had been out on the secretarys desk he also guessed how the particular significance of james bond import and export merchant seemed to have leaked out of kings house the only place where the significance was known like doctor no like miss annabel chung the demure efficientlooking little secretary in the hornrimmed glasses was a chinese vi the finger on the trigger the colonial secretary gave bond lunch at queens club they sat in a corner of the elegant mahoganypanelled diningroom with its four big ceiling fans and gossiped about jamaica by the time coffee came pleydellsmith was delving well below the surface of the prosperous peaceful island the world knows its like this he began his antics with the pipe the jamaican is a kindly lazy man with the virtues and vices of a child he lives on a very rich island but he doesnt get rich from it he doesnt know how to and hes too lazy the british come and go and take the easy pickings but for about two hundred years no englishman has made a fortune out here he doesnt stay long enough he takes a fat cut and leaves its the portuguese jews who make the most they came here with the british and theyve stayed but theyre snobs and they spend too much of their fortunes on building fine houses and giving dances theyre the names that fill the social column in the gleaner when the tourists have gone theyre in rum and tobacco and they represent the big british firms over heremotor cars insurance and so forth then come the syrians very rich too but not such good businessmen they have most of the stores and some of the best hotels theyre not a very good risk get overstocked and have to have an occasional fire to get liquid again then there are the indians with their usual flashy trade in soft goods and the like theyre not much of a lot finally there are the chinese solid compact discreetthe most powerful clique in jamaica theyve got the bakeries and the laundries and the best food stores they keep to themselves and keep their strain pure pleydellsmith laughed not that they dont take the black girls when they want them you can see the result all over kingstonchigroeschinese negroes and negresses the chigroes are a tough forgotten race they look down on the negroes and the chinese look down on them one day they may become a nuisance theyve got some of the intelligence of the chinese and most of the vices of the black man the police have a lot of trouble with them bond said that secretary of yours would she be one of them thats right bright girl and very efficient had her for about six months she was far the best of the ones that answered our advertisement she looks bright said bond noncommittally are they organized these people is there some head of the chinese negro community not yet but someonell get hold of them one of these days theyd be a useful little pressure group pleydellsmith glanced at his watch that reminds me must be getting along got to go and read the riot act about those files cant think what happened to them i distinctly remember he broke off however main point is that i havent been able to give you much dope about crab key and this doctor fellow but i can tell you there wasnt much youd have found out from the files he seems to have been a pleasant spoken chap very businesslike then there was that argument with the audubon society i gather you know all about that as for the place itself there was nothing on the files but one or two prewar reports and a copy of the last ordnance survey godforsaken bloody place it sounds nothing but miles of mangrove swamps and a huge mountain of bird dung at one end but you said you were going down to the institute why dont i take you there and introduce you to the fellow who runs the map section an hour later bond was ensconced in a corner of a sombre room with the ordnance survey map of crab key dated spread out on a table in front of him he had a sheet of the institutes writingpaper and had made a rough sketchmap and was jotting down the salient points the overall area of the island was about fifty square miles threequarters of this to the east was swamp and shallow lake from the lake a flat river meandered down to the sea and came out halfway along the south coast into a small sandy bay bond guessed that somewhere at the headwaters of the river would be a likely spot for the audubon wardens to have chosen for their camp to the west the island rose steeply to a hill stated to be five hundred feet high and ended abruptly with what appeared to be a sheer drop to the sea a dotted line led from this hill to a box in the corner of the map which contained the words guano deposits last workings there was no sign of a road or even of a track oh the island and no sign of a house the relief map showed that the island looked rather like a swimming water rata flat spine rising sharply to the headheading west it appeared to be about thirty miles due north of galina point on the north shore of jamaica and about sixty miles south of cuba little else could be gleaned from the map crab key was surrounded by shoal water except below the western cliff where the nearest marking was five hundred fathoms after that came the plunge into the cuba deep bond folded the map and handed it in to the librarian suddenly he felt exhausted it was only four oclock but it was roasting in kingston and his shirt was sticking to him bond walked out of the institute and found a taxi and went back up into the cool hills to his hotel he was well satisfied with his day but nothingelse could be done on this side of the island he would spend a quiet evening at his hotel and be ready to get up early next morning and be away bond went to the reception desk to see if there was a message from quarrel no messages sir said the girl but a basket of fruit came from kings house just after lunch the messenger took it up to your room what sort of a messenger coloured man sir said he was from the adcs office thank you bond took his key and went up the stairs to the first floor it was ridiculously improbable his hand on the gun under his coat bond softly approached his door he turned the key and kicked the door open the empty room yawned at him bond shut and locked the door on his dressing table was a large ornate basket of fruittangerines grapefruit pink bananas soursop starapples and even a couple of hothouse nectarines attached to a broad ribbon on the handle was a white envelope bond removed it and held it up to the light he opened it on a plain sheet of expensive white writing paper was typed with the compliments of his excellency the governor bond snorted he stood looking at the fruit he bent his ear to it and listened he then took the basket by the handle and tipped its contents out on to the floor the fruit bounced and rolled over the coconut matting there was nothing but fruit in the basket bond grinned at his precautions there was a last possibility he picked up one of the nectarines the most likely for a greedy man to choose first and took it into the bathroom he dropped it in the washbasin and went back to the bedroom and after inspecting the lock unlocked the wardrobe gingerly he lifted out his suitcase and stood it in the middle of the room he knelt down and looked for the traces of talcum powder he had dusted round the two locks they were smeared and there were minute scratches round the keyholes bond sourly examined the marks these people were not as careful as some others he had had to deal with he unlocked the case and stood it up on end there were four innocent copper studs in the welting at the front righthand corner of the lid bond prised at the top one of these studs with his nail and it eased out he took hold of it and pulled out three feet of thick steel wire and put it on the floor beside him this wire threaded through small wire loops inside the lid and sewed the case shut bond lifted the lid and verified that nothing had been disturbed from his tool case he took out a jewellers glass and went back into the bathroom and switched on the light over the shaving mirror he screwed the glass into his eye and gingerly picked the nectarine out of the washbasin and revolved it slowly between finger and thumb bond stopped turning the nectarine he had come to a minute pinhole its edges faintly discoloured brown it was in the crevice of the fruit invisible except under a magnifying glass bond put the nectarine carefully down in the washbasin he stood for a moment and looked thoughtfully into his eyes in the mirror so it was war well well how very interesting bond felt the slight tautening of the skin at the base of his stomach he smiled thinly at his reflection in the mirror so his instincts and his reasoning had been correct strangways and the girl had been murdered and their records destroyed because they had got too hot on the trail then bond had come on the scene and thanks to miss taro they had been waiting for him miss chung and perhaps the taxi driver had picked up the scent he had been traced to the blue hills hotel the first shot had been fired there would be others and whose finger was on the trigger who had got him so accurately in his sights bonds mind was made up the evidence was nil but he was certain of it this was long range fire from crab key the man behind the gun was doctor no bond walked back into the bedroom one by one he picked up the fruit and took each piece back to the bathroom and examined it through his glass the pinprick was always there concealed in the stalkhole or a crevice bond rang down and asked for a cardboard box and paper and string he packed the fruit carefully in the box and picked up the telephone and called kings house he asked for the colonial secretary that you pleydellsmith james bond speaking sorry to bother you got a bit of a problem is there a public analyst in kingston i see well ive got something i want analysed if i sent the box down to you would you be very kind and pass it on to this chap i dont want my name to come into this all right ill explain later when you get his report would you send me a short telegram telling me the answer ill be at beau desert over at morgans harbour for the next week or so be glad if youd keep that to yourself too sorry to be so damned mysterious ill explain everything when i see you next i expect youll get a clue when you see what the analyst has to say and by the way tell him to handle the specimens carefully would you warn him theres more in them than meets the eye very many thanks lucky i met you this morning goodbye bond addressed the parcel and went down and paid a taxi to deliver it at once to kings house it was six oclock he went back to his room and had a shower and changed and ordered his first drink he was about to take it out on the balcony when the telephone rang it was quarrel everyting fixed capn everything thats wonderful that house all right everyting okay quarrel repeated his voice careful see yo as yo done said capn fine said bond he was impressed with quarrels efficiency and a sense of security he put down the telephone and went out on to the balcony the sun was just setting the wave of violet shadow was creeping down towards the town and the harbour when it hits the town thought bond the lights will go on it happened as he had expected above him there was the noise of a plane it came into sight a super constellation the same flight that bond had been on the night before bond watched it sweep out over the sea and then turn and come in to land at the palisadoes airport what a long way he had come since that moment only twentyfour hours before when the door of the plane had clanged open and the loudspeaker had said this ia kingston jamaica will passengers please remain seated until the aircraft has been cleared by the health authorities should he tell m how the picture had changed should he make a report to the governor bond thought of the governor and dismissed that idea but what about m bond had his own cipher he could easily send m a signal through the colonial office what would he say to m that doctor no had sent him some poisoned fruit but he didnt even know that it was poisoned or for the matter of that that it had come from doctor no bond could see ms face as he read the signal he saw him press down the lever on the intercom chief of staff s gone round the bend says someones been trying to feed him a poisoned banana fellows lost his nerve been in hospital too long better call him home bond smiled to himself he got up and rang down for another drink it wouldnt be quite like that of course but still no hed wait until he had something more to show of course if something went badly wrong and he hadnt sent a warning hed be in trouble it was up to him to see that nothing did go wrong bond drank his second drink and thought over the details of his plan then he went down and had dinner in the halfdeserted diningroom and read the handbook of the west indies by nine oclock he was half asleep he went back to his room and packed his bag ready for the morning he telephoned down and arranged to be called at fivethirty then he bolted the door on the inside and also shut and bolted the slatted jalousies across the windows it would mean a hot stuffy night that couldnt be helped bond climbed naked under the single cotton sheet and turned over on his left side and slipped his right hand on to the butt of the walther ppk under the pillow in five minutes he was asleep the next thing bond knew was that it was three oclock in the morning he knew it was three oclock because the luminous dial of his watch was close to his face he lay absolutely still there was not a sound in the room he strained his ears outside too it was deathly quiet far in the distance a dog started to bark other dogs joined in and there was a brief hysterical chorus which stopped as suddenly as it had begun then it was quite quiet again the moon coming through the slats in the jalousies threw black and white bars across the corner of the room next to his bed it was as if he was lying in a cage what had woken him up bond moved softly preparing to slip out of bed bond stopped moving he stopped as dead as a live man can something had stirred on his right ankle now it was moving up the inside of his shin bond could feel the hairs on his leg being parted it was an insect of some sort a very big one it was long five or six inchesas long as his hand he could feel dozens of tiny feet lightly touching his skin what was it then bond heard something he had never heard beforethe sound of the hair on his head rasping up on the pillow bond analysed the noise it couldnt be it simply couldnt yes his hair was standing on end bond could even feel the cool air reaching his scalp between the hairs how extraordinary how very extraordinary he had always thought it was a figure of speech but why why was it happening to him the thing on his leg moved suddenly bond realized that he was afraid terrified his instincts even before they had communicated with his brain had told his body that he had a centipede on him bond lay frozen he had once seen a tropical centipede in a bottle of spirit on the shelf in a museum it had been pale brown and very flat and five or six inches longabout the length of this one on either side of the blunt head there had been curved poison claws the label on the bottle had said that its poison was mortal if it hit an artery bond had looked curiously at the corkscrew of dead cuticle and had moved on the centipede had reached his knee it was starting up his thigh whatever happened he mustnt move mustnt even tremble bonds whole consciousness had drained down to the two rows of softly creeping feet now they had reached his flank god it was turning down towards his groin bond set his teeth supposing it liked the warmth there supposing it tried to crawl into the crevices could he stand it supposing it chose that place to bite bond could feel it questing amongst the first hairs it tickled the skin on bonds belly fluttered there was nothing he could do to control it but now the thing was turning up and along his stomach its feet were gripping tighter to prevent it falling now it was at his heart if it bit there surely it would kill him the centipede trampled steadily on through the thin hairs on bonds right breast up to his collar bone it stopped what was it doing bond could feel the blunt head questing blindly to and fro what was it looking for was there room between his skin and the sheet for it to get through dare he lift the sheet an inch to help it no never the animal was at the base of his jugular perhaps it was intrigued by the heavy pulse there christ if only he could control the pumping of his blood damn you bond tried to communicate with the centipede its nothing its not dangerous that pulse it means you no harm get on out into the fresh air as if the beast had heard it moved on up the column of the neck and into the stubble on bonds chin now it was at the corner of his mouth tickling madly on it went up along the nose now he could feel its whole weight and length softly bond closed his eyes two by two the pairs of feet moving alternately trampled across his right eyelid when it got off his eye should he take a chance and shake it offrely on its feet slipping in his sweat no for gods sake the grip of the feet was endless he might shake one lot off but not the rest with incredible deliberation the huge insect ambled across bonds forehead it stopped below the hair what the hell was it doing now bond could feel it nuzzling at his skin it was drinking drinking the beads of salt sweat bond was sure of it for minutes it hardly moved bond felt weak with the tension he could feel the sweat pouring off the rest of his body on to the sheet in a second his limbs would start to tremble he could feel it coming on he would start to shake with an ague of fear could he control it could he bond lay and waited the breath coming softly through his open snarling mouth the centipede started to move again it walked into the forest of hair bond could feel the roots being pushed aside as it forced its way along would it like it there would it settle down how did centipedes sleep curled up or at full length the tiny centipedes he had known as a child the ones that always seemed to find their way up the plughole into the empty bath curled up when you touched them now it had come to where his head lay against the sheet would it walk out on to the pillow or would it stay on in the warm forest the centipede stopped out out bonds nerves screamed at it the centipede stirred slowly it walked out of his hair on to the pillow bond waited a second now he could hear the rows of feet picking softly at the cotton it was a tiny scraping noise like soft fingernails with a crash that shook the room bonds body jackknifed out of bed and on to the floor at once bond was on his feet and at the door he turned on the light he found he was shaking uncontrollably he staggered to the bed there it was crawling out of sight over the edge of the pillow bonds first instinct was to twitch the pillow on to the floor he controlled himself waiting for his nerves to quieten then softly deliberately he picked up the pillow by one corner and walked into the middle of the room and dropped it the centipede came out from under the pillow it started to snake swiftly away across the matting now bond was uninterested he looked round for something to kill it with slowly he went and picked up a shoe and came back the danger was past his mind was now wondering how the centipede had got into his bed he lifted the shoe and slowly almost carelessly smashed it down he heard the crack of the hard carapace bond lifted the shoe the centipede was whipping from side to side in its agonyfive inches of greybrown shiny death bond hit it again it burst open yellowly bond dropped the shoe and ran for the bathroom and was violently sick vii night passage by the way quarrel bond dared a bus with brown bomber painted above its windshield the bus pulled over and roared on down the hill towards kingston sounding a furious chord on its triple windhorn to restore the drivers ego what do you know about centipedes centipedes capn quarrel squinted sideways for a clue to the question bonds expression was casual well we got some bad ones here in jamaica tree fo five inches long dey kills folks dey mosly lives in de old houses in kingston dey loves de rotten wood an de mouldy places dey hoperates mosly at night why capn yo seen one bond dodged the question he had also not told quarrel about the fruit quarrel was a tough man but there was no reason to sow the seeds of fear would you expect to find one in a modern house for instance in your shoe or in a drawer or in your bed nossir quarrels voice was definite not hunless dem put dere a purpose dese hinsecks love de holes and de crannies dey not love de clean places dey dirtylivin hinsecks mebbe yo find dem in de bush under logs an stones but never in de bright places i see bond changed the

yo worry quarrel misunderstood bonds concern i say i tell de police dey stole de car if dey don they were at the saddleback at stony hill where the junction road dives down through fifty sbends towards the north coast bond put the little austin ao into second gear and let it coast the sun was coming up over the blue mountain peak and dusty shafts of gold lanced into the plunging valley there were few people on the roadan occasional man going off to his precipitous smallholding on the flank of a hill his threefoot steel cutlass dangling from his right hand chewing at his breakfast a foot of raw sugar cane held in his left or a woman sauntering up the road with a covered basket of fruit or vegetables for stony hill market her shoes on her head to be donned when she got near the village it was a savage peaceful scene that had hardly changed except for the surface of the road for two hundred years or more bond almost smelted the dung of the mule train in which he would have been riding over from port royal to visit the garrison at morgans harbour in quarrel interrupted his thoughts capn he said apologetically beggin yo pardon but kin yo tell me what yo have in mind for we ise bin puzzlin an ah caint seem to figger bout yo game ive hardly figured it out myself quarrel bond changed up into top and dawdled through the cool beautiful glades of castleton gardens i told you im

come to agree with you i think doctor no that chinaman on crab key had it done strangways was poking his nose into this mans affairssomething to do with the bird sanctuary doctor no has this mania for privacy you were telling me so yourself seems hell do anything to stop people climbing over his wall mark you its not more than a guess about doctor no but some funny things happened in the last

anything wrong well get away again and come back by the front doorwith some soldiers to help have a fulldress inquiry cant do that until weve got something to go on what do you think quarrel dug into his hip pocket for a cigarette he made a fuss about lighting it he blew a cloud of smoke through his nostrils and watched it whip out of the window he said capn ah tink yose plumb crazy to trespass hon dat island quarrel had wound himself up he paused there was no comment he looked sideways at the quiet profile he said more quietly in an embarrassed voice jess one ting capn ah have some folks back in da caymans would yo consider takin hout a life hinsurance hon me afore we sail bond glanced affectionately at the strong brown face it had a deep cleft of worry between the eyes of course quarrel ill fix it at port maria tomorrow well make it big say five thousand pounds now then how shall we go canoe dats right capn quarrels voice was reluctant we need a calm sea an a light wind come

and stop us getting off for a night or two couple of good hunting knives ill take a gun you never can tell no sir said quarrel emphatically he relapsed into a brooding silence which lasted until they got to port maria they went through the little town and on round the headland to morgans harbour it was just as bond rememberedthe sugarloaf of the isle of surprise rising out of the calm bay the canoes drawn up beside the mounds of empty conch shells the distant boom of the surf on the reef which had so nearly been his grave bond his mind full of memories took the car down the little side road and through the cane fields in the middle of which the gaunt ruin of the old great house of beau desert plantation stood up like a stranded galleon they came to the gate leading to the bungalow quarrel got out and opened the gate and bond drove through and pulled up in the yard behind the white singlestoreyed house it was very quiet bond walked round the house and across the lawn to the edge of the sea yes there it was the stretch of deep silent waterthe submarine path he had taken to the isle of surprise it sometimes came back to him in nightmares bond stood looking at it and thinking of solitaire the girl he had brought back torn and bleeding from that sea he had carried her across the lawn to the house what had happened to her where was she brusquely bond turned and walked back into the house driving the phantoms away from him it was eightthirty bond unpacked his few things and changed into sandals and shorts soon there was the delicious smell of coffee and frying bacon they ate their breakfast while bond fixed his training routineup at seven swim a quarter of a mile breakfast an hours sunbathing run a mile swim again lunch sleep sunbathe swim a mile hot bath and massage dinner and asleep by nine after breakfast the routine began nothing interrupted the grinding week except a brief story in the daily gleaner and a telegram from pleydellsmith the gleaner said that a sunbeam talbot h had been involved in a fatal accident on the devils racecourse a stretch of winding road between spanish town and ochos rioon the kingstonmontego route a runaway lorry whose driver was being traced had crashed into the sunbeam as it came round a bend both vehicles had left the road and hurtled into the ravine below the two occupants of the sunbeam ben gibbons of harbour street and josiah smith no address had been killed a mr bond an english visitor who had been lent the car was asked to contact the nearest police station bond burned that copy of the gleaner he didnt want to upset quarrel with only one day to go the telegram came from pleydellsmith it said each object contained enough cyanide to kill a horse stop suggest you change your grocer stop good luck smith bond also burned the telegram quarrel hired a canoe and they spent three days sailing it it was a clumsy shell cut out of a single giant cotton tree it had two thin thwarts two heavy paddles and a small sail of dirty canvas it was a blunt instrument quarrel was pleased with it seven eight hours capn he said den we bring down de sail an use de paddles less target for de radar to see the weather held the forecast from kingston radio was good the nights were as black as sin the two men got in their stores bond fitted himself out with cheap black canvas jeans and a dark blue shirt and ropesoled shoes the last evening came bond was glad he was on his way he had only once been out of the training campto get the stores and arrange quarrels insuranceand he was chafing to get out of the stable and on to the track he admitted to himself that this adventure excited him it had the right ingredientsphysical exertion mystery and a ruthless enemy he had a good companion his cause was just there might also be the satisfaction of throwing the holiday in the sun back in ms teeth that had rankled bond didnt like being coddled the sun blazed beautifully into its grave bond went into his bedroom and took out his two guns and looked at them neither was a part of him as the beretta had beenan extension of his right handbut he already knew them as better weapons which should he take bond picked up each in turn hefting them in his hand it had to be the heavier smith wesson there would be no close shooting if there was any shooting on crab key heavy longrange stuffif anything the brutal stumpy revolver had an extra twentyfive yards over the walther bond fitted the holster into the waistband of his jeans and clipped in the gun he put twenty spare rounds in his pocket was it overinsurance to take all this metal on what might only be a tropical picnic bond went to the icebox and took a pint of canadian club blended rye and some ice and sodawater and went and sat in the garden and watched the last light flame and die the shadows crept from behind the house and marched across the lawn and enveloped him the undertakers wind that blows at night from the centre of the island clattered softly in the tops of the palm trees the frogs began to tinkle among the shrubs the fireflies the blinkablinks as quarrel called them came out and began flashing their sexual morse for a moment the melancholy of the tropical dusk caught at bonds heart he picked up the bottle and looked atit he had drunk a quarter of it he poured another big slug into his glass and added some ice what was he drinking for because of the thirty miles of black sea he had to cross tonight because he was going into the unknown because of doctor no quarrel came up from the beach time capn bond swallowed his drink and followed the cayman islander down to the canoe it was rocking quietly in the water its bows on the sand quarrel went aft and bond climbed into the space between the forrard thwart and the bows the sail wrapped round the short mast was at his back bond took up his paddle and pushed off and they turned slowly and headed out for the break in the softly creaming waves that was the passage through the reef they paddled easily in unison the paddles turning in their hands so that they did not leave the water on the forward stroke the small waves slapped softly against the bows otherwise they made no noise it was dark nobody saw them go they just left the land and went off across the sea bonds only duty was to keep paddling quarrel did the steering at the opening through the reef there was a swirl and suck of conflicting currents and they were in amongst the jagged niggerheads and coral trees bared like fangs by the swell bond could feel the strength of quarrels great sweeps with the paddle as the heavy craft wallowed and plunged again and again bonds own paddle thudded against rock and once he had to hold on as the canoe hit a buried mass of brain coral and slid off again then they were through and far below the boat there were indigo patches of sand and around them the solid oily feel of deep water okay capn said quarrel softly bond shipped his paddle and got down off one knee and sat with his back to the thwart he heard the scratching of quarrels nails against canvas as he unwrapped the sail and then the sharp flap as it caught the breeze the canoe straightened and began to move it tilted slowly there was a soft hiss under the bows a handful of spray tossed up into bonds face the wind of their movement was cool and would soon get cold bond hunched up his knees and put his arms round them the wood was already beginning to bite into his buttocks and his back it crossed his mind that it was going to be the hell of a long and uncomfortable night in the darkness ahead bond could just make out the rim of the world then came a layer of black haze above which the stars began first sparsely and then merging into a dense bright carpet the milky way soared overhead how many stars bond tried counting a fingers length and was soon past the hundred the stars lit the sea into a faint grey road and then arched away over the tip of the mast towards the black silhouette of jamaica bond looked back behind the hunched figure of quarrel there was a faraway cluster of lights which would be port maria already they were a couple of miles out soon they would be a tenth of the way then a quarter then half that would be around midnight when bond would take over bond sighed and put his head down to his knees and closed his eyes he must have slept because he was awakened by the clonk of a paddle against the boat he lifted his arm to show that he had heard and glanced at the luminous blaze of his watch twelvefifteen stiffly he unbent his legs and turned and scrambled over the thwart sorry quarrel he said and it was odd to hear his voice you ought to have shaken me up before hit don signify capn said quarrel with a grey glint of teeth do yo good to sleep gingerly they slipped past each other and bond settled in the stern and picked up the paddle the sail was secured to a bent nail beside him it was flapping bond brought the bows into the wind and edged them round so that the north star was directly over quarrels bent head in the bows for a time this would be fun there was something to do there was no change in the night except that it seemed darker and emptier the pulse of the sleeping sea seemed slower the heavy swell was longer and the troughs deeper they were running through a patch of phosphorus that winked at the bows and dripped jewels when bond lifted the paddle out of the water how safe it was slipping through the night in this ridiculously vulnerable little boat how kind and soft the sea could be a covey of flying fish broke the surface in front of the bows and scattered like shrapnel some kept going for a time beside the canoe flying as much as twenty yards before they dived into the wall of the swell was some bigger fish after them or did they think the canoe was a fish or were they just playing bond thought of what was going on in the hundreds of fathoms below the boat the big fish the shark and barracuda and tarpon and sailfish quietly cruising the shoals of kingfish and mackerel and bonito and far below in the grey twilight of the great depths the phosphorous jellied boneless things that were never seen the fiftyfoot squids with eyes a foot wide that streamed along like zeppelins the last real monsters of the sea whose size was only known from the fragments found inside whales what would happen if a wave caught the canoe broadside and capsized them how long would they last bond took an ounce more pains with his steering and put the thought aside one oclock two oclock three four quarrel awoke and stretched he called softly to bond ah smells land capn soon there was a thickening of the darkness ahead the low shadow slowly took on the shape of a huge swimming rat a pale moon rose slowly behind them now the island showed distinctly a couple of miles away and there was the distant grumble of surf they changed places quarrel brought down the sail and they took up the paddles for at least another mile thought bond they would be invisible in the troughs of the waves not even radar would distinguish them from the crests it was the last mile they would have to hurry over with the dawn not far off now he too could smell the land it had no particular scent it was just something new in the nose after hours of clean sea he could make out the white fringe of surf the swell subsided and the waves became choppier now capn called quarrel and bond the sweat already dropping off his chin dug deeper and more often god it was hard work the hulking log of wood which had sped along so well under the sail now seemed hardly to move the wave at the bows was only a ripple bonds shoulders were aching like fire the one knee he was resting on was beginning to bruise his hands were cramped on the clumsy shaft of a paddle made of lead it was incredible but they were coming up with the reef patches of sand showed deep under the boat now the surf was a roar they followed along the edge of the reef looking foran opening a hundred yards inside the reef breaking the sandline was the shimmer of water running inland the river so the landfall had been all right the wall of surf broke up there was a patch of black oily current swelling over hidden coral heads the nose of the canoe turned towards it and into it there was a turmoil of water and a series of grating thuds and then a sudden rush forward into peace and the canoe was moving slowly across a smooth mirror towards the shore quarrel steered the boat towards the lee of a rocky promontory where the beach ended bond wondered why the beach didnt shine white under the thin moon when they grounded and bond climbed stiffly out he understood why the beach was black the sand was soft and wonderful to the feet but it must have been formed out of volcanic rock pounded over the centuries and bonds naked feet on it looked like white crabs they made haste quarrel took three short lengths of thick bamboo out of the boat and laid them up the flat beach they heaved the nose of the canoe on to the first and pushed the boat up the rollers after each yard of progress bond picked up the back roller and brought it to the front slowly the canoe moved up the sand until at last it was over the back tideline and among the rocks and turtle grass and low seagrape bushes they pushed it another twenty yards inland into the beginning of the mangrove there they covered it with dried seaweed and bits of driftwood from the tideline then quarrel cut lengths of screwpalm and went back over their tracks sweeping and tidying it was still dark but the breath of grey in the east would soon be turning to pearl it was five oclock they were dead tired they exchanged a few words and quarrel went off among the rocks on the promontory bond scooped out a depression in the fine dry sand under a thick bush of seagrape there were a few hermit crabs beside his bed he picked up as many as he could find and hurled them into the mangrove then not caring what other animals or insects might come to his smell and his warmth he lay down full length in the sand and rested his head on his arm he was at once asleep viii the elegant venus bond awoke lazily the feel of the sand reminded him where he was he glanced at his watch ten oclock the sun through the round thick leaves of the seagrape was already hot a larger shadow moved across the dappled sand in front of his face quarrel bond shifted his head and peered through the fringe of leaves and grass that concealed him from the beach he stiffened his heart missed a beat and then began pounding so that he had to breathe deeply to quieten it his eyes as he stared through the blades of grass were fierce slits it was a naked girl with her back to him she was not quite naked she wore a broad leather belt round her waist with a hunting knife in a leather sheath at her right hip the belt made her nakedness extraordinarily erotic she stood not more than five yards away on the tideline looking down at something in her hand she stood in the classical relaxed pose of the nude all the weight on the right leg and the left knee bent and turning slightly inwards the head to one side as she examined the things in her hand it was a beautiful back the skin was a very light uniform cafй au lait with the sheen of dull satin the gentle curve of the backbone was deeply indented suggesting more powerful muscles than is usual in a woman and the behind was almost as firm and rounded as a boys the legs were straight and beautiful and no pinkness showed under the slightly lifted left heel she was not a coloured girl her hair was ash blonde it was cut to the shoulders and hung there and along the side of her bent cheek in thick wet strands a green diving mask was pushed back above her forehead and the green rubber thong bound her hair at the back the whole scene the empty beach the green and blue sea the naked girl with the strands of fair hair reminded bond of something he searched his mind yes she was botticellis venus seen from behind how had she got there what was she doing bond looked up and down the beach it was not black he now saw but a deep chocolate brown to the right he could see as far as the river mouth perhaps five hundred yards away the beach was empty and featureless except for a scattering of small pinkish objects there were a lot of them shells of some sort bond supposed and they looked decorative against the dark brown background he looked to the left to where twenty yards away the rocks of the small headland began yes there was a yard or two of groove in the sand where a canoe had been drawn up into the shelter of the rocks it must have been a light one or she couldnt have drawn it up alone perhaps the girl wasnt alone but there was only one set of footprints leading down from the rocks to the sea and another set coming out of the sea and up the beach to where she now stood on the tideline did she live here or had she too sailed over from jamaica that night hell of a thing for a girl to do anyway what in gods name was she doing here as if to answer him the girl made a throwaway gesture of the right hand and scattered a dozen shells on the sand beside her they were violent pink and seemed to bond to be the same as he had noticed on the beach the girl looked down into her left hand and began to whistle softly to herself there was a happy note of triumph in the whistle she was whistling marion a plaintive little calypso that has now been cleaned up and made famous outside jamaica it had always been one of bonds favourites it went all day all night marion sittin by the seaside siftin sand the girl broke off to stretch her arms out in a deep yawn bond smiled to himself he wetted his lips and took up the refrain the water from her eyes could sail a boat the hair on her head could tie a goat the hands flew down and across her chest the muscles of her behind bunched with tension she was listening her head still hidden by the curtain of hair cocked to one side hesitantly she began again the whistle trembled and died at the first note of bonds echo the girl whirled round she didnt cover her body with the two classical gestures one hand flew downwards but the other instead of hiding her breasts went up to her face covering it below the eyes now wide with fear whos that the words came out in a terrified whisper bond got to his feet and stepped out through the seagrape he stopped on the edge of the grass he held his hands open at his sides to show they were empty he smiled cheerfully at her its only me im another trespasser dont be frightened the girl dropped her hand down from her face it went to the knife at her belt bond watched the fingers curl round the hilt he looked up at her face now he realized why her hand had instinctively gone to it it was a beautiful face with wideapart deep blue eyes under lashes paled by the sun the mouth was wide and when she stopped pursing the lips with tension they would be full it was a serious face and the jawline was determinedthe face of a girl who fends for herself and once reflected bond she had failed to fend for the nose was badly broken smashed crooked like a boxers bond stiffened with revolt at what had happened to this supremely beautiful girl no wonder this was her shame and not the beautiful firm breasts that now jutted towards him without concealment the eyes examined him fiercely who are you what are you doing here there was the slight lilt of a jamaican accent the voice was sharp and accustomed to being obeyed im an englishman im interested in birds oh the voice was doubtful the hand still rested on the knife how long have you been watching me how did you get here ten minutes but no more answers until you tell me who you are im no one in particular i come from jamaica i collect shells i came in a canoe did you yes where is your canoe ive got a friend with me weve hidden it in the mangroves there are no marks of a canoe landing were careful wecovered them up not like you bond gestured towards the rocks you ought to take more trouble did you use a sail right up to the reef of course why not i always do then theyll know youre here theyve got radar theyve never caught me yet the girl took her hand away from her knife she reached up and stripped off the diving mask and stood swinging it she seemed to think she had the measure of bond she said with some of the sharpnessgone from her voice whats your name bond james bond whats yours she reflected rider what rider honeychile bond smiled whats so funny about it nothing honeychile rider its a pretty name she unbent people call me honey well im glad to meet you the prosaic phrase seemed to remind her of her nakedness she blushed she said uncertainly i must get dressed she looked down at the scattered shells around her feet she obviously wanted to pick them up perhaps she realized that the movement might be still more revealing than her present pose she said sharply youre not to touch those while im gone bond smiled at the childish challenge dont worry ill look after them the girl looked at him doubtfully and then turned and walked stifflegged over to the rocks and disappeared behind them bond walked the few steps down the beach and bent and picked up one of the shells it was alive and the two halves were shut tight it appeared to be some kind of a cockle rather deeply ribbed and coloured a mauvepink along both edges of the hinge thin horns stood out about half a dozen to each side it didnt seem to bond a very distinguished shell he replaced it carefully with the others he stood looking down at the shells and wondering was she really collecting them it certainly looked like it but what a risk to take to get themthe voyage over alone in the canoe and then back again and she seemed to realize that this was a dangerous place theyve never caught me yet what an extraordinary girl bonds heart warmed and his senses stirred as he thought of her already as he had found so often when people had deformities he had almost forgotten her broken nose it had somehow slipped away behind his memory of her eyes and her mouth and her amazingly beautiful body her imperious attitude and her quality of attack were exciting the way she had reached for her knife to defend herself shewas like an animal whose cubs are threatened where did she live who were her parents there was something uncared for about hera dog that nobody wants to pet who was she bond heard her footsteps riffling the sand he turned to look at her she was dressed almost in ragsa faded brown shirt with torn sleeves and a kneelength patched brown cotton skirt held in place by the leather belt with the knife she had a canvas knapsack slung over one shoulder she looked like a principal girl dressed as man friday she came up with him and at once went down on one knee and began picking up the live shells and stowing them in the knapsack bond said are those rare she sat back on her haunches and looked up at him she surveyed his face apparently she was satisfied you promise you wont tell anybody swear i promise said bond well then yes they are rare very you can get five dollars for a perfect specimen in miami thats where i deal with theyre called venus elegansthe elegant venus her eyes sparkled up at him with excitement this morning i found what i wanted the bed where they live she waved towards the sea you wouldnt find it though she added with sudden carefulness its very deep and hidden away i doubt if you could dive that deep and anyway she looked happy im going to clear the whole bed today youd only get the imperfect ones if you came back here bond laughed i promise i wont steal any i really dont know anything about shells cross my heart she stood up her work completed what about these birds of yours what sort are they are they valuable too i wont tell either if you tell me i only collect shells theyre called roseate spoonbills said bond sort of pink stork with a flat beak ever seen any oh those she said scornfully there used to be thousands of them here but you wont find many now they scared them all away she sat down on the sand and put her arms round her knees proud of her superior knowledge and now certain that she had nothing to fear from this man bond sat down a yard away he stretched out and turned towards her resting on his elbow he wanted to preserve the picnic atmosphere and try to find out more about this queer beautiful girl he said easily oh really what happened who did it she shrugged impatiently the people here did it i dont know who they are theres a chinaman he doesnt like birds or something hes got a dragon he sent the dragon after the birds and scared them away the dragon burned up their nesting places there used to be two men who lived with the birds and looked after them they got scared away too or killed or something it all seemed quite natural to her she gave the facts indifferently staring out to sea bond said this dragon what kind is he have you ever seen him yes ive seen him she screwed up her eyes and made a wry face as if she was swallowing bitter medicine she looked earnestly at bond to make him share her feelings ive been coming here for about a year looking for shells and exploring i only found these she waved at the beach about a month ago on my last trip but ive found plenty of other good ones just before christmas i thought id explore the river i went up it to the top where the birdmen had their camp it was all broken up it was getting late and i decided to spend the night there in the middle of the night i woke up the dragon was coming by only a few chains away from me it had two great glaring eyes and a long snout it had sort of short wings and a pointed tail it was all black and gold she frowned at the expression on bonds face there was a full moon i could see it quite clearlyit went by me it was making a sort of roaring noise it went over the marsh and came to some thick mangrove and it simply climbed over the bushes and went on a whole flock of birds got up in front of it and suddenly a lot of fire came out of its mouth and it burned a lot of them up and all the trees theyd been roosting in it was horrible the most horrible thing ive ever seen the girl leant sideways and peered at bonds face she sat up straight again and stared obstinately out to sea i can see you dont believe me she said in a furious tense voice youre one of these city people you dont believe anything ugh she shuddered with dislike of him bond said reasonably honey there just arent such things as dragons in the world you saw something that looked very like a dragon im just wondering what it was how do you know there arent such things as dragons now he had made her really angry nobody lives on this end of the island one could easily have survived here anyway what do you think you know about animals and things ive lived with snakes and things since i was a child alone have you ever seen a praying mantis eat her husband after theyve made love have you ever seen the mongoose dance or an octopus dance how long is a humming birds tongue have you ever had a pet snake that wore a bell round its neck and rang it to wake you have you seen a scorpion get sunstroke and kill itself with its own sting have you seen the carpet of flowers under the sea at night do you know that a john crow can smell a dead lizard a mile away the girl had fired these questions like scornful jabs with a rapier now she stopped out of breath she said hopelessly oh youre just city folk like all the rest bond said honey now look here you know these things i cant help it that i live in towns id like to know about your things too i just havent had that sort of life i know other things instead like bond searched his mind he couldnt think of anything as interesting as hers he finished lamely like for instance that this chinaman is going to be more interested in your visit this time this time hes going to try and stop you getting away he paused and added and me for the matter of that she turned and looked at him with interest oh why but then it doesnt really matter one just hides during the day and gets away at night hes sent dogs after me and even a plane he hasnt got me yet she examined bond with a new interest is it you hes after well yes admitted bond im afraid it is you see we dropped the sail about two miles out so that their radar wouldnt pick us up i think the chinaman may have been expecting a visit from me your sail will have been reported and id bet anything hell think your canoe was mine id better go and wake my friend up and well talk it over youll like him hes a cayman islander name of quarrel the girl said well im sorry if the sentence trailed away apologies wouldnt come easy to someone so much on the defensive but after all i couldnt know could i she searched his face bond smiled into the questing blue eyes he said reassuringly of course you couldnt its just bad luckbad luck for you too i dont suppose he minds too much about a solitary girl who collects shells you can be sure theyve had a good look at your footprints and found clues like thathe waved at the scattered shells on the beach but im afraid hed take a different view of me now hell try and hunt me down with everything hes got im only afraid he may get you into the net in the process anyway bond grinned reassuringly well see what quarrel has to sayyou stay here bond got to his feet he walked along the promontory and cast about him quarrel had hidden himself well it took bond five minutes to find him he was lying in a grassy depression between two big rocks half covered by a board of grey driftwood he was still fast asleep the brown head stern in sleep cradled on his forearm bond whistled softly and smiled as the eyes sprang wide open like an animals quarrel saw bond and scrambled to his feet almost guiltily he rubbed his big hands over his face as if he was washing it mornin capn he said guess ah been down deep dat china girl come to me bond smiled i got something different he said they sat down and bond told him about honeychile rider and her shells and the fix they were in and now its eleven oclock bond added and weve got to make a new plan quarrel scratched his head he looked sideways at bond yo don plan we jess ditch dis girl he asked hopefully aintnuttin to do wit we suddenly he stopped his head swivelled round and pointed like a dogs he held up a hand for silence listening intently bond held his breath in the distance to the eastwards there was a faint droning quarrel jumped to his feet quick capn he said urgently beys a comin ix close shaves ten minutes later the bay was empty and immaculate small waves curled lazily in across the mirrored water inside the reef and flopped exhausted on the dark sand where the mauve shells glittered like shed toenails the heap of discarded shells had gone and there was no longer any trace of footprints quarrel had cut branches of mangrove and had walked backwards sweeping carefully as he went where he had swept the sand was of a different texture from the rest of the beach but not too different as to be noticed from outside the reef the girls canoe had been pulled deeper among the rocks and covered with seaweed and driftwood quarrel had gone back to the headland bond and the girl lay a few feet apart under the bush of seagrape where bond had slept and gazed silently out across the water to the corner of the headland round which the boat would come the boat was perhaps a quarter of a mile away from the slow pulse of the twin diesels bond guessed that every cranny of the coastline was being searched for signs of them it sounded a powerful boat a big cabin cruiser perhaps what crew would it have who would be in command of the search doctor no unlikely he would not trouble himself with this kind of police work from the west a wedge of cormorants appeared flying low over the sea beyond the reef bond watched them they were the first evidence he had seen of the guanay colony at the other end of the island these according to pleydellsmiths description would be scouts for the silver flash of the anchovy near the surface sure enough as he watched they began to backpedal in the air and then go into shallow dives hitting the water like shrapnel almost at once a fresh file appeared from the west then another and another that merged into a long stream and then into a solid black river of birds for minutes they darkened the skyline and then they were down on the water covering several acres of it screeching and fighting and plunging their heads below the surface cropping at the solid field of anchovy like piranha fish feasting on a drowned horse bond felt a gentle nudge from the girl she gestured with her head the chinamans hens getting their corn bond examined the happy beautiful face she had seemed quite unconcerned by the arrival of the search party to her it was only the game of hideandseek she had played before bond hoped she wasnt going to get a shock the iron thud of the diesels was getting louder the boat must be just behind the headland bond took a last look round the peaceful bay and then fixed his eyes through the leaves and grass on the point of the headland inside the reef the knife of white bows appeared it was followed by ten yards of empty polished deck glass windshields a low raked cabin with a siren and a blunt radio mast the glimpse of a man inside at the wheel then the long flat well of the stern and a drooping red ensign converted mtb british government surplus bonds eyes went to the two men standing in the stern they were paleskinned negroes they wore neat khaki ducks and shirts broad belts and deep visored baseball caps of yellow straw they were standing side by side bracing themselves against the slow swell one of them was holding a long black loudhailer with a wire attached the other was manning a machine gun on a tripod it looked to bond like a spandau the man with the loudhailer let it fall so that it swung on a strap round his neck he picked up a pair of binoculars and began inching them along the beach the low murmur of his comments just reached bond above the glutinous flutter of the diesels bond watched the eyes of the binoculars begin with the headland and then sweep the sand the twin eyes paused among the rocks and moved on they came back the murmur of comment rose to a jabber the man handed the glasses to the machine gunner who took a quick glance through them and gave them back the scanner shouted something to the helmsman the cabin cruiser stopped and backed up now she lay outside the reef exactly opposite bond and the girl the scanner again levelled the binoculars at the rocks where the girls canoe lay hidden again the excited jabber came across the water again the glasses were passed to the machine gunner who glanced through this time he nodded decisively bond thought now weve had it these men know their job bond watched the machine gunner pull the bolt back to load the double click came to him over the bubbling of the diesels the scanner lifted his loudhailer and switched it on the twanging echo of the amplifier moaned and screeched across the water the man brought it up to his lips the voice roared across the bay okay folks come on out and you wont get hurt it was an educated voice there was a trace of american accent now then folks the voice thundered make it quick weve seen where you came ashore weve spotted the boat under the driftwood we aint fools an we aint fooling take it easy just walk out with your hands up youll be okay silence fell the waves lapped softly on the beach bond could hear the girl breathing the thin screeching of the cormorants eame to them muted across the mile of sea the diesels bubbled unevenly as the swell covered the exhaust pipe and then opened it again softly bond reached over to the girl and tugged at her sleeve come close he whispered smaller target he felt her warmth nearer to him her cheek brushed against his forearm he whispered burrow into the sand wriggle every inchll help he began to worm his body carefully deeper into the depression they had scooped out for themselves he felt her do the same he peered out now his eyes were only just above the skyline of the top of the beach the man was lifting his loudhailer the voice roared okay folks just so as youll know this thing isnt for show he lifted his thumb the machine gunner trained his gun into the tops of the mangroves behind the beach there came the swift rattling roar bond had last heard coming from the german lines in the ardennes the bullets made the same old sound of frightened pigeons whistling overhead then there was silence in the distance bond watched the black cloud of cormorants take to the air and begin circling his eyes went back to the boat the machine gunner was feeling the barrel of his gun to see if it had warmed the two men exchanged some words the scanner picked up his loudhailer kay folks he said harshly youve been warned this is it bond watched the snout of the spandau swing and depress the man was going to start with the canoe among the rocks bond whispered to the girl all right honey stick it keep right down it wont last long he felt her hand squeeze his arm he thought poor little bitch shes in this because of me he leant to the right to cover her head and pushed his face deep into the sand this time the crash of noise was terrific the bullets howled into the corner of the headland fragments of splintered rock whined over the beach like hornets ricochets twanged and buzzed off into the hinterland behind it all there was the steady roaddrill hammer of the gun there was a pause new magazine thought bond now its us he could feel the girl clutching at him her body was trembling along his flank bond reached out an arm and pressed her to him the roar of the gun began again the bullets came zipping along the tideline towards them there was a succession of quick close thuds the bush above them was being torn to shreds zwip zwip zwip it was as if the thong of a steel whip was cutting the bush to pieces bits scattered around them slowly covering them bond could smell the cooler air that meant they were now lying in the open were they hidden by the leaves and debris the bullets marched away along the shoreline in less than a minute the racket stopped the silence sang the girl whimpered softly bond hushed her and held her tighter the loudhailer boomed okay folks if you still got ears well be along soon to pick up the bits and well be bringing the dogs bye for now the slow thud of the diesel quickened the engine accelerated into a hasty roar and through the fallen leaves bond watched the stern of the launch settle lower in the water as it made off to the west within minutes it was out of earshot bond cautiously raised his head the bay was serene the beach unmarked all was as before except for the stench of cordite and the sour smell of blasted rock bond pulled the girl to her feet there were tear streaks down her face she looked at him aghast she said solemnly that was horrible what did they do it for we might have been killed bond thought this girl has always had to fend for herself but only against nature she knows the world of animals and insects and fishes and shes got the better of it but its been a small world bounded by the sun and the moon and the seasons she doesnt know the big world of the smokefilled room of the bullion brokers parlour of the corridors and waitingrooms of government offices of careful meetings on park seatsshe doesnt know about the struggle for big power and big money by the big men she doesnt know that shes been swept out of her rock pool into the dirty waters he said its all right honey theyre just a lot of bad men who are frightened of us we can manage them bond put his arm round her shoulders and you were wonderful as brave as anything come on now well look for quarrel and make some plans anyway its time we had something to eat what do you eat on these expeditions they turned and walked up the beach to the headland after a minute she said in a controlled voice oh theres stacks of food about sea urchins mostly and there are wild bananas and things i eat and sleep for two days before i come out here i dont need anything bond held her more closely he dropped his arm as quarrel appeared on the skyline quarrel scrambled down among the rocks he stopped looking down they came up with him the girls canoe was sawn almost in half by the bullets the girl gave a cry she looked desperately at bond my boat how am i to get back dont you worry missy quarrel appreciated the loss of a canoe better than bond he guessed it might be most of the girls capital capn fix you up wit anudder an yo come back wit we us got a fine boat in de mangrove hit not get broke ahs bin to see him quarrel looked at bond now his face was worried but capn yo sees what i means about dese folk dey mighty tough men an dey means business dese dogs dey speak of dose is policehounspinschers deys called big bastards mah frens tell me as ders a pack of twenty or moh we better make plans quickan good all right quarrel but first we must have something to eat and im damned if im going to be scared off the island before ive had a good look well take honey with us he turned to the girl is that all right with you honey youll be all right with us then well sail home together the girl looked doubtfully at him i guess theres no alternative i mean id love to go with you if i wont be in the way i really dont want anything to eat but will you take me home as soon as you can i dont want to see any more of those people how long are you going to be looking at these birds bond said evasively not long ive got to find out what happened to them and why then well be off he looked at his watch its twelve now you wait here have a bathe or something dont walk about leaving footprints come on quarrel wed better get that boat hidden it was one oclock before they were ready bond and quarrel filled the canoe with stones and sand until it sank in a pool among the mangroves they smeared over their footprints the bullets had left so much litter behind the shoreline that they could do most of their walking on broken leaves and twigs they ate some of their rationsavidly the girl reluctantlyand climbed across the rocks and into the shallow water offshore then they trudged along the shallows towards the river mouth three hundred yards away down the beach it was very hot a harsh baking wind had sprung up from the northeast quarrel said this wind blew daily the year round it was vital to the guanera it dried the guano the glare from the sea and from the shiny green leaves of the mangroves was dazzling bond was glad he had taken trouble to get his skin hardened to the sun there was a sandy bar at the river mouth and a long deep stagnant pool they could either get wet or strip bond said to the girl honey we cant be shy on this trip well keep our shirts on because of the sun wear whats sensible and walk behind us without waiting for her reply the two men took off their trousers quarrel rolled them and packed them in the knapsack with the provisions and bonds gun they waded into the pool quarrel in front then bond then the girl the water came up to bonds waist a big silver fish leaped out of the pool and fell back with a splash there were arrows on the surface where others fled out of their way tarpon commented quarrel the pool converged into a narrow neck over which the mangroves touched for a time they waded through a cool tunnel and then the river broadened into a deep sluggish channel that meandered ahead among the giant spiderlegs of the mangroves the bottom was muddy and at each step their feet sank inches into slime small fish or shrimps wriggled and fled from under their feet and every now and then they had to stoop to brush away leeches before they got hold but otherwise it was easy going and quiet and cool among the bushes and at least to bond it was a blessing to be out of the sun soon as they got away from the sea it began to smell bad with the bad egg sulphuretted hydrogen smell of marsh gas the mosquitoes and sandflies began to find them they liked bonds fresh body quarrel told him to dip himself in the river water dem like dere meat wid salt on him he explained cheerfully bond took off his shirt and did as he was told then it was better and after a while bonds nostrils even got used to the marsh gas except when quarrels feet disturbed some aged pocket in the mud and a vintage bubble wobbled up from the bottom and burst stinking under his nose the mangroves became fewer and sparser and the river slowly opened out the water grew shallower and the bottom firmer soon they came round a bend and into the open honey said better watch out now well be easier to see it goes on like this for about a mile then the river gets narrower until the lake then theres the sandspit the birdmen lived on they stopped in the shadow of the mangrove tunnel and looked out the river meandered sluggishly away from them towards the centre of the island its banks fringed with low bamboo and seagrape would give only half shelter from its western bank the ground rose slowly and then sharply up to the sugarloaf about two miles away which was the guanera round the base of the mountain there was a scattering of quonset huts a zigzag of silver ran down the hillside tovthe hutsa decauville track bond guessed to bring the guano from the diggings down to the crusher and separator the summit of the sugarloaf was white as if with snow from the peak flew a smoky flag of guano dust bond could see the black dots of cormorants against the white background they were landing and taking off like bees at a hive bond stood and gazed at the distant glittering mountain of bird dung so this was the kingdom of doctor no bond thought he had never seen a more godforsaken landscape in his life he examined the ground between the river and the mountain it seemed to be the usual grey dead coral broken where there was a pocket of earth by low scrub and screwpalm no doubt a road or a track led down the mountainside to the central lake and the marshes it looked bad stuff to cross unless there was bond noticed that all the vegetation was bent to the westwards he imagined living the year round with that hot wind constantly scouring the island the smell of the marsh gas and the guano no penal colony could have a worse site than this bond looked to the east there the mangroves in the marshland seemed more hospitable they marched away in a solid green carpet until they lost their outline in the dancing heat haze on the horizon over them a thick froth of birds tossed and settled and tossed again their steady scream carried over on the harsh wind quarrels voice broke in on bonds thoughts deys a comin capn bond followed quarrels eyes a big lorry was racing down from the huts dust streaming from its wheels bond followed it for ten minutes until it disappeared amongst the mangroves at the head of the river he listened the baying of dogs came down on the wind quarrel said deyll come down de ribber capn demll know we caint move cept up de ribber assumin we aint dead deyll surely come down de ribber to de beach and look for de pieces den mos likely de boat come wit a dinghy an take de men and dogs off leastways dats what ahd do in dere place honey said thats what they do when they look for me its quite all right you cut a piece of bamboo and when they get near you go under the water and breathe through the bamboo till theyve gone by bond smiled at quarrel he said supposing you get the bamboo while i find a good mangrove clump quarrel nodded dubiously he started off upstream towards the bamboo thickets bond turned back into the mangrove tunnel bond had avoided looking at the girl she said impatiently you neednt be so careful of looking at me its no good minding those things at a time like this you said so yourself bond turned and looked at her her tattered shirt came down to the waterline there was a glimpse of pale wavering limbs below the beautiful face smiled at him in the mangroves the broken nose seemed appropriate in its animalness bond looked at her slowly she understood he turned and went on downstream and she followed him bond found what he wanted a crack in the wall of mangrove that seemed to go deeper he said dont break a branch he bent his head and waded in the channel went in ten yards the mud under their feet became deeper and softer then there was a solid wall of roots and they could go no farther the brown water flowed slowly through a wide quiet pool bond stopped the girl came close to him this is real hide and seek she said tremulously yes isnt it bond was thinking of his gun he was wondering how well it would shoot after a bath in the riverhow many dogs and men he could get if they were found he felt a wave of disquiet it had been a bad break coming across this girl in combat like it or not a girl is your extra heart the enemy has two targets against your one bond remembered his thirst he scooped up some water it was brackish and tasted of earth it was all right he drank some more the girl put out her hand and stopped him dont drink too much wash your mouth out and spit you could get fever bond looked at her quietly he did as she told him quarrel whistled from somewhere in the main stream bond answered and waded out towards him they came back along the channel quarrel splashed the mangrove roots with water where their bodies might have brushed against them kill da smell of us he explained briefly he produced his handful of bamboo lengths and began whittling and cutting them bond looked to his gun and the spare ammunition they stood still in the pool so as not to stir up more mud the sunlight dappled down through the thick roof of leaves the shrimps nibbled softly at their feet tension built up in the hot crouching silence it was almost a relief to hear the baying of the dogs x dragon spoor the search party was coming fast down the river the two men in bathing trunks and tall waders were having to run to keep up with the dogs they were big chinese negroes wearing shoulder holsters across their naked sweating chests occasionally they exchanged shouts that were mostly swearwords ahead of them the pack of big dobermann pinschers swam and floundered through the water baying excitedly they had a scent and they quested frenziedly the diamondshaped ears erect on the smooth serpentine heads may be aing crocodile yelled the leading man though the hubbub he was carrying a short whip which he occasionally cracked like a whipperin on the hunting field the other man converged towards him he shouted excitedly for my money its theing limey bet ya hes lying up in the mangrove mind he doesnt give us aing ambush the man took the gun out of its holster and put it under his armpit and kept his hand on the butt they were coming out of the open river into the mangrove tunnel the first man had a whistle it stuck out of his broad face like a cigar butt he blew a shrill blast when the dogs swapt on he laid about him with the whip the dogs checked whimpering as the slow current forced them to disobey orders the two men took their guns and waded slowly downstream through the straggly legs of the mangroves the leading man came to the narrow break that bond had found he grasped a dog by the collar and swung it into the channel the dog snorted eagerly and paddled forward the mans eyes squinted at the mangrove roots on either side of the channel to see if they were scratched the dog and the man came into the small enclosed pool at the end of the channel the man looked round disgustedly he caught the dog by the collar and pulled him back the dog was reluctant to leave the place the man lashed down into the water with his whip the second man had been waiting at the entrance to the little channel the first man came out he shook his head and they went on downstream the dogs now less excited streaming ahead slowly the noise of the hunt grew less and vanished for another five minutes nothing moved in the mangrove pool then in one corner among the roots a thin periscope of bamboo rose slowly out of the water bonds face emerged the forehead streaked with wet hair like the face of a surfacing corpse in his right hand under the water the gun was ready he listened intently there was dead silence not a sound or was there what was that soft swish out in the main stream was someone wading very quietly along in the wake of the hunt bond reached out on either side of him and softly touched the other two bodies that lay among the roots on the edge of the pool as the two faces surfaced he put his finger to his lips it was too late quarrel had coughed and spat bond made a grimace and nodded urgently towards the main stream they all listened there was dead silence then the soft swishing began again whoever it was was coming into the sidechannel the tubes of bamboo went back into the three mouths and the heads softly submerged again underwater bond rested his head in the mud pinched his nostrils with his left hand and pursed his lips round the tube he knew the pool had been examined once already he had felt the disturbance of the swimming dog that time they had not been found would they get away with it again this time there would have been less chance for the stirred mud to seep away out of the pool if this searcher saw the darker brown stain would he shoot into it or stab into it what weapons would he have bond decided that he wouldnt take chances at the first movement in the water near him he would get to his feet and shoot and hope for the best bond lay and focused all his senses what hell this controlled breathing was and how maddening the soft nibbling of the shrimps it was lucky none of them had a sore on their bodies or the damned things would have eaten into it but it had been a bright idea of the girls without it the dogs would have got to them wherever they had hidden suddenly bond cringed a rubber boot had stepped on his shin and slid off would the man think it was a branch bond couldnt chance it with one surge of motion he hurled him self upwards spitting out the length of bamboo bond caught a quick impression of a huge body standing almost on top of him and of a swirling rifle butt he lifted his left arm to protect his head and felt the jarring blow on his forearm at the same time his right hand lunged forward and as the muzzle of his gun touched the glistening right breast below the hairless aureole he pulled the trigger the kick of the explosion pent up against the mans body almost broke bonds wrist but the man crashed back like a chopped tree into the water bond caught a glimpse of a huge rent in his side as he went under the rubber waders thrashed once and the head a chinese negroid head broke the surface its eyes turned up and water pouring from its silently yelling mouth then the head went under again and there was nothing but muddy froth and a slowly widening red stain that began to seep away downstream bond shook himself he turned quarrel and the girl were standing behind him water streaming from their bodies quarrel was grinning from ear to ear but the girls knuckles were at her mouth and her eyes were staring horrorstruck at the reddened water bond said curtly im sorry honey it had to be done he was right on top of us come on lets get going he took her roughly by the arm and thrust her away from the place and out into the main stream only stopping when they had reached the open river at the beginning of the mangrove tunnel the landscape was empty again bond glanced at his watch it had stopped at three oclock he looked at the westering sun it might be four oclock now how much farther had they to go bond suddenly felt tired now hed torn it even if the shot hadnt been heardand it would have been well muffled by the mans body and by the mangrovesthe man would be missed when the others rendezvoused if quarrels guess was right at the river mouth to be taken off to the launch would they come back up the river to look for the missing man probably not it would be getting dark before they knew for certain that he was missing theyd send out a search party in the morning the dogs would soon get the body then what the girl tugged at his sleeve she said angrily itstime you told me what all this is about whys everybody trying to kill each other and who are you i dont believe all this story about birds you dont take a revolver after birds bond looked down into the angry wideapart eyes im sorry honey im afraid ive got you into a bit of a mess ill tell you all about it this evening when we get to the camp its just bad luck you being mixed up with me like this ive got a bit of a war on with these people they seem to want to kill me now im only interested in seeing us all off the island without anyone else getting hurt ive got enough to go on now so that next time i can come back by the front door what do you mean are you some sort of a policeman are you trying to send this chinaman to prison thats about it bond smiled down at her at least youre on the side of the angels and now you tell me something how much farther to the camp oh about an hour is it a good place to hide could they find us there easily theyd have to come across the lake or up the river itll be all right so long as they dont send their dragon after us he can go through the water ive seen him do it oh well said bond diplomatically lets hope hes got a sore tail or something the girl snorted all right mr knowall she said angrily just you wait quarrel splashed out of the mangroves he was carrying a rifle he said apologetically no harm n havin anudder gun capn looks like us may need hit bond took it it was a us army remington carbine these people certainly had the right equipment he handed it back quarrel echoed his thoughts dese is sly folks capn dat man mus of come sneakin down soffly behind de udders to ketch us comin out after de dawgs had passed he sho is a sly mongoose dat doctor feller bond said thoughtfully he must be quite a man he shrugged away his thoughts now lets get going honey says theres another hour to the camp better keep to the left bank soas to get what cover we can from the hill for all we know theyve got glasses trained on the river bond handed his gun to quarrel who stowed it in the sodden knapsack they moved off again with quarrel in the lead and bond and the girl walking together they got some shade from the bamboo and bushes along the western bank but now they had to face the full force of the scorching wind they splashed water over their arms and faces to cool the burns bonds eyes were bloodshot with the glare and his arm ached intolerably where the gun butt had struck and he was not looking forward to his dinner of soaking bread and cheese and salt pork how long would they be able to sleep he hadnt had much last night it looked like the same ration again and what about the girl she had had none he and quarrel would have to keep watch and watch and then tomorrow off into the mangrove again and work their way slowly back to the canoe across the eastern end of the island it looked like that and sail the following night bond thought of hacking a way for five miles through solid mangroves what a prospect bond trudged on thinking of ms holiday in the sunshine hed certainly give something for m to be sharing it with him now the river grew narrower until it was only a stream between the bamboo clumps then it widened out into a flat marshy estuary beyond which the five square miles of shallow lake swept away to the other side of the island in a ruffled bluegrey mirror beyond there was the shimmer of the airstrip and the glint of the sun on a single hangar the girl told them to keep to the east and they worked their way slowly along inside the fringe of bushes suddenly quarrel stopped his face pointing like a gundogs at the marshy ground in front of him two deep parallel grooves were cut into the mud with a fainter groove in the centre they were the tracks of something that had come down from the hill and gone across the marsh towards the lake the girl said indifferently thats where the dragons been quarrel turned the whites of his eyes towards her bond walked slowly along the tracks the outside ones were quite smooth with an indented curve they could have been made by wheels but they were vastat least two feet across the centre track was of the same shape but only three inches across about the width of a motor tyre the tracks were without a trace of tread and they were fairly fresh they marched along in a dead straight line and the bushes they crossed were squashed flat as if a tank had gone over them bond couldnt imagine what kind of vehicle if it was a vehicle had made them when the girl nudged him and whispered fiercely i told you so he could only say thoughtfully well honey if it isnt a dragon its something else ive never seen before farther on she tugged urgently at his sleeve look she whispered she pointed forward to a big clump of bushes beside which the tracks ran they were leafless and blackened in the centre there showed the charred remains of birds nests he breathed on them she said excitedly bond walked up to the bushes and examined them he certainly did he admitted why had this particular clump been burned it was all very odd the tracks swerved out towards the lake and disappeared into the water bond would have liked to follow them but there was no question of leaving cover they trudged on wrapped in their different thoughts slowly the day began to die behind the sugarloaf and at last the girl pointed ahead through the bushes and bond could see a long spit of sand running out into the lake there were thick bushes of seagrape along its spine and halfway perhaps a hundred yards from the shore the remains of a thatched hut it looked a reasonably attractive place to spend the night and it was well protected by the water on both sides the wind had died and the water was soft and inviting how heavenly it was going to be to take off their filthy shirts and wash in the lake and after the hours of squelching through the mud and stench of the river and the marsh be able to lie down on the hard dry sand the sun blazed yellowly and sank behind the mountain the day was still alive at the eastern tip of the island but the black shadow of the sugarloaf was slowly marching across the lake and would soon reach out and kill that too the frogs started up louder than in jamaica until the thick dusk was shrill with them across the lake a giant bull frog began to drum the eerie sound was something between a tomtom and an apes roar it sent out short messages that were suddenly throttled soon it fell silent it had found what it had sent for they reached the neck of the sandspit and filed out along a narrow track they came to the clearing with the smashed remains of the wattle hut the big mysterious tracks led out of the water on both sides and through the clearing and over the nearby bushes as if the thing whatever it was had stampeded the place many of the bushes were burned or charred there were the remains of a fireplace made of lumps of coral and a few scattered cooking pots and empty tins they searched in the debris and quarrel unearthed a couple of unopened tins of heinz pork and beans the girl found a crumpled sleepingbag bond found a small leather purse containing five onedollar notes three jamaica pounds and some silver the two men had certainly left in a hurry they left the place and moved farther along to a small sandy clearing through the bushes they could see lights winking across the water from the mountain perhaps two miles away to the eastward there was nothing but the soft black sheen of water under the darkening sky bond said as long as we dont show a light we should be fine here the first thing is to have a good wash honey you take the rest of the sandspit and well have the landward end see you for dinner in about half an hour the girl laughed will you be dressing certainly said bond trousers quarrel said capn while deres henough light ill get dese tins open and get tings fixed for de night he rummaged in the knapsack heres yo trousers and yo gun de bread dont feel so good but hit only wet hit eat okay an mebbe hit dry hout come de mornin guess wed better eat de tins tonight an keep de cheese an pork dose tins is heavy an we got plenty footin tomorrow bond said all right quarrel ill leave the menu to you he took the gun and the damp trousers and walked down into the shallow water and back the way they had come he found a hard dry stretch of sand and took off his shirt and stepped back into the water and lay down the water was soft but disgustingly warm he dug up handfuls of sand and scrubbed himself with it using it as soap then he lay and luxuriated in the silence and the loneliness the stars began to shine palely the stars that had brought them to the island last night a year ago the stars that would take them away again tomorrow night a year away what a trip but at least it had already paid off now he had enough evidence and witnesses to go back to the governor and get a fulldress inquiry going into the activities of doctor no one didnt use machine guns on people even on trespassers and by the same token what was this thing of doctor nos that had trespassed on the leasehold of the audubon society the thing that had smashed their property and had possibly killed one of their wardens that would have to be investigated too and what would he find when he came back to the island through the front door in a destroyer perhaps and with a detachment of marines what would be the answer to the riddle of doctor no what was he hiding what did he fear why was privacy so important to him that he would murder again and again for it who was doctor no bond heard splashing away to his right he thought of the girl and who for the matter of that was honeychile rider that he decided as he climbed out on to dry land was at least something that he ought to be able to find out before the night was over bond pulled on his clammy trousers and sat down on the sand and dismantled his gun he did it by touch using his shirt to dry each part and each cartridge then he reassembled the gun and clicked the trigger round the empty cylinder the sound was healthy it would be days before it rusted he loaded it and tucked it into the holster inside the waistband of his trousers and got up and walked back to the clearing the shadow of honey reached up and pulled him down beside her come on she said were starving i got one of the cooking pots and cleaned it out and we poured the beans into it theres about two full handfuls each and a cricket ball of bread and im not feeling guilty about eating your food because you made me work far harder than i would if id been alone here hold out your hand bond smiled at the authority in her voice he could just make out her silhouette in the dusk her head looked sleeker he wondered what her hair looked like when it was combed and dry what would she be like when she was wearing clean clothes over that beautiful golden body he could see her coming into a room or across the lawn at beau desert she would be a beautiful ravishing ugly duckling why had she never had the broken nose mended it was an easy operation then she would be the most beautiful girl in jamaica her shoulder brushed against him bond reached out and put his hand down in her lap open she picked up his hand and bond felt the cold mess of beans being poured into it suddenly he smelled her warm animal smell it was so sensually thrilling that his body swayed against her and for a moment his eyes closed she gave a short laugh in which there was shyness and satisfaction and tenderness she said there maternally and carried his laden hand away from her and back to him xi amidst the alien cane it would be around eight oclock bond thought apart from the background tinkle of the frogs it was very quiet in the far corner of the clearing he could see the dark outline of quarrel there was the soft clink of metal as he dismantled and dried the remington through the bushes the distant yellow lights from the guanera made festive pathways across the dark surface of the lake the ugly wind had gone and the hideous scenery lay drowned in darkness it was cool bonds clothes had dried on him the three big handfuls of food had warmed his stomach he felt comfortable and drowsy and at peace tomorrow was a long way off and presented no problems except a great deal of physical exercise life suddenly felt easy and good the girl lay beside him in the sleepingbag she was lying on her back with her head cradled in her hands looking up at the roof of stars he could just make out the pale pool of her face she said james you promised to tell me what this is all about come on i shant go to sleep until you do bond laughed ill tell if youll tell i want to know what youre all about i dont mind ive got no secrets but you first all right then bond pulled his knees up to his chin and put his arms round them its like this im a sort of policeman they send me out from london when theres something odd going on somewhere in the world that isnt anybody elses business well not long ago one of the governors staff in kingston a man called strangways friend of mine disappeared his secretary who was a pretty girl did too most people thought theyd run away together i didnt i bond told the story in simple terms with good men and bad men like an adventure story out of a book he ended so you see honey its just a question of getting back to jamaica tomorrow night all three of us in the canoe and then the governor will listen to us and send over a lot of soldiers to get this chinaman to own up i expect thatll mean hell go to prison hell know that too and thats why hes trying to stop us thats all now its your turn the girl said you seem to live a very exciting life your wife cant like you being away so much doesnt she worry about you getting hurt im not married the only people who worry about me getting hurt are my insurance company she probed but i suppose you have girls not permanent ones oh there was a pause quarrel came over to them capn ahll take de fust watch if dat suits be out on de point of de sandspit ahll come call yo around midnight den mebbe yo take on till five and den we all git goin need to get well away from dis place afore its light suits me said bond wake me if you see anything gun all right hims jess fine said quarrel happily he said sleep well missy with a hint of meaning and melted noiselessly away into the shadows i like quarrel said the girl she paused then do you really want to know about me its not as exciting as your story of course i do and dont leave anything out theres nothing to leave out you could get my whole life on to the back of a postcard to begin with ive never been out of jamaica ive lived all my life at a place called beau desert on the north coast near morgans harbour bond laughed thats odd so do i at least for the moment i didnt notice you about do you live up a tree oh i suppose youve taken the beach house i never go near the place i live in the great house but theres nothing left of it its a ruin in the middle of the cane fields i live in the cellars ive lived there since i was five it was burned down then and my parents were killed i cant remember anything about them so you neednt say youre sorry at first i lived there with my black nanny she died when i was fifteen for the last five years ive lived there alone good heavens bond was appalled but wasnt there anyone else to look after you didnt your parents leave any money not a penny there was no bitterness in the girls voicepride if anything you see the riders were one of the old jamaican families the first one had been given the beau desert lands by cromwell for having been one of the people who signed king charless death warrant he built the great house and my family lived in it on and off ever since but then sugar collapsed and i suppose the place was badly run and by the time my father inherited it there was nothing but debts mortgages and things like that so when my father and mother died the property was sold up i didnt mind i was too young nanny must have been wonderful they wanted people to adopt me the clergyman and the legal people did but nanny collected the sticks of furniture that hadnt been burned and we settled down in the ruins and after a bit no one came and interfered with us she did a bit of sewing and laundry in the village and grew a few plantains and bananas and things and there was a big breadfruit tree up against the old house we ate what the jamaicans eat and there was the sugar cane all round us and she made a fishpot which we used to go and take up every day it was all right we had enough to eat somehow she taught me to read and write there was a pile of old books left from the fire there was an encyclopedia i started with a when i was about eight ive got as far as the middle of t she said defensively i bet i know more than you do about a lot of things i bet you do bond was lost in the picture of the little flaxenhaired girl pattering about the ruins with the obstinate old negress watching over her and calling her in to do the lessons that must have been just as much a riddle to the old woman your nanny must have been a wonderful person she was a darling it was a flat statement i thought id die when she did it wasnt such fun after that before id led a childs life then i suddenly had to grow up and do everything for myself and men tried to catch me and hurt me they said they wanted to make love to me she paused i used to be pretty then bond said seriously youre one of the most beautiful girls ive ever seen with this nose dont be silly you dont understand bond tried to find words that she would believe of course anyone can see your nose is broken but since this morning ive hardly noticed it when you look at a person you look into their eyes or at their mouth thats where the expressions are a broken nose isnt any more significant than a crooked ear noses and ears are bits of facefurniture some are prettier than others but theyre not nearly as important as the rest theyre part of the background of the face if you had a beautiful nose as well as the rest of you youd be the most beautiful girl in jamaica do you mean that her voice was urgent do you think i could be beautiful i know some of mes all right but when i look in the glass i hardly see anything except my broken nose im sure its like that with other people who are who arewellsort of deformed bond said impatiently youre not deformed dont talk such nonsense and anyway you can have it put right by a simple operation youve only got to get over to america and it would be done in a week she said angrily how do you expect me to do that ive got about fifteen pounds under a stone in my cellar ive got three skirts and three shirts and a knife and a fishpot i know all about these operations the doctor at port maria found out for me hes a nice man he wrote to america do you know to have it properly done it would cost me about five hundred pounds what with the fare to new york and the hospital and everything her voice became hopeless how do you expect me to find that amount of money bond had already made up his mind what would have to be done about that now he merely said tenderly well i expect there are ways but anyway go on with your story its very excitingfar more interesting than mine youd got to where your nanny died what happened then the girl began again reluctantly well its your fault for interrupting and you mustnt talk about things you dont understand i suppose people tell you youre goodlooking i expect you get all the girls you want well you wouldnt if you had a squint or a harelip or something as a matter of fact he could hear the smile in her voice i think i shall go to the obeahman when we get back and get him to put a spell on you and give you something like that she added lamely then we should be more alike bond reached out his hand brushed against her ive got other plans he said but come on i want to hear the rest of the story oh well the girl sighed ill have to go back a bit you see all the property is in cane and the old house stands in the middle of it well about twice a year they cut the cane and send it off to the mill and when they do that all the animals and insects and so on that live in the cane fields go into a panic and most of them have their houses destroyed and get killed at cutting time some of them took to coming to the ruins of the house and hiding my nanny was terrified of them to begin with the mongooses and the snakes and the scorpions and so on but i made a couple of the cellar rooms into sort of homes for them i wasnt frightened of them and they never hurt me they seemed to understand that i was looking after them they must have told their friends or something because after a bit it was quite natural for them all to come trooping into their rooms and settling down there until the young cane had started to grow again then they all filed out and went back to living in the fields i gave them what food we could spare when they were staying with us and they behaved very well except for making a bit of a smell and sometimes fighting amongst each other but they all got quite tame with me and their children did too and i could do anything with them of course the canecutters found out about this and saw me walking about with snakes round my neck and so forth and they got frightened of me and thought i was obeah so they left us absolutely alone she paused thats where i found out so much about animals and insects i used to spend a lot of time in the sea finding out about those people too it was the same with birds if you find out what all these people like to eat and what theyre afraid of and if you spend all your time with them you can make friends she looked up at him you miss a lot not knowing about these things im afraid i do said bond truthfully i expect theyre much nicer and more interesting than humans i dont know about that said the girl thoughtfully i dont know many human people most of the ones i have met have been hateful but i suppose they can be interesting too she paused i hadnt every really thought of liking them like i like the animals except for nanny of course until she broke off with a shy laugh well anyway we all lived happily together until i was fifteen and nanny died and then things got difficult there was a man called mander a horrible man he was the white overseer for the people who own the property he kept coming to see me he wanted me to move up to his house near port maria i hated him and i used to hide when i heard his horse coming through the cane one night he came on foot and i didnt hear him he was drunk he came into the cellar and fought with me because i wouldnt do what he wanted me to do you know the things people in love do yes i know i tried to kill him with my knife but he was very strong and he hit me as hard as he could in the face and broke my nose he knocked me unconscious and then i think he did things to me i mean i know he did next day i wanted to kill myself when i saw my face and when i found what he had done i thought i would have a baby i would certainly have killed myself if id had a baby by that man anyway i didnt so that was that i went to the doctor and he did what he could for my nose and didnt charge me anything i didnt tell him about the rest i was too ashamed the man didnt come back i waited and did nothing until the next canecutting id got my plan i was waiting for the black widow spiders to come in for shelter one day they came i caught the biggest of the females and shut her in a box with nothing to eat theyre the bad ones the females then i waited for a dark night without any moon i took the box with the spider in it and walked and walked until i came to the mans house it was very dark and i was frightened of the duppies i might meet on the road but i didnt see any i waited in his garden in the bushes and watched him go up to bed then i climbed a tree and got on to his balcony i waited there until i heard him snoring and then i crept through the window he was lying naked on the bed under the mosquito net i lifted the edge and opened the box and shook the spider out on to his stomach then i went away and came home godalmighty said bond reverently what happened to him she said happily he took a week to die it must have hurt terribly they do you know the obeahmen say theres nothing like it she paused when bond made no comment she said anxiously you dont think i did wrong do you its not a thing to make a habit of said bond mildly but i cant say i blame you the way it was so what happened then well then i just settled down again her voice was matteroffact i had to concentrate on getting enough food and of course all i wanted to do was save up money to get my nose made good again she said persuasively it really was quite a pretty nose before do you think the doctors can put it back to how it was they can make it any shape you like said bond definitely what did you make money at it was the encyclopedia it told me that people collect seashells that one could sell the rare ones i talked to the local schoolmaster without telling him my secret of course and he found out that theres an american magazine called nautilus for shell collectors i had just enough money to subscribe to it and i began looking for the shells that people said they wanted in the advertisements i wrote to a dealer in miami and he started buying from me it was thrilling of course i made some awful mistakes to begin with i thought people would like the prettiest shells but they dont very often they want the ugliest and then when i found rare ones i cleaned them and polished them to make them look better thats wrong too they want shells just as they come out of the sea with the animal in and all so i got some formalin from the doctor and put it into the live shells to stop them smelling and sent them off to this man in miami i only got it right about a year ago and ive already made fifteen pounds id worked out that now i knew how they wanted them and if i was lucky i ought to make at least fifty pounds a year then in ten years i would be able to go to america and have the operation and then she giggled delightedly i had a terrific stroke of luck i went over to crab key id been there before but this was just before christmas and i found these purple shells they didnt look very exciting but i sent one or two to miami and the man wrote back at once and said he could take as many as i could get at five dollars each for the whole ones he said that i must keep the place where they live a dead secret as otherwise wed what he called spoil the market and the price would get cheaper its just like having ones private gold mine now i may be able to save up the money in five years thats why i was so suspicious of you when i found you on my beach i thought youd come to steal my shells you gave me a bit of a shock i thought you must be doctor nos girl friend thanks very much but when youve had the operation what are you going to do then you cant got on living alone in a cellar all your life i thought id be a call girl she said it as she might have said nurse or secretary oh what do you mean by that perhaps she had picked up the expression without understanding it one of those girls who has a beautiful flat and lovely clothes you know what i mean she said impatientlypeople ring them up and come and make love to them and pay them for it they get a hundred dollars for each time in new york thats where i thought id start of course she admitted i might have to do it for less to begin with until i learned to do it really well how much do you pay the untrained ones bond laughed i really cant remember its quite a long time since i had one she sighed yes i suppose you can have as many women as you want for nothing i suppose its only the ugly men that pay but that cant be helped any kind of job in the big towns must be dreadful at least you can earn much more being a call girl then i can come back to jamaica and buy beau desert id be rich enough to find a nice husband and have some children now that ive found these venus shells ive worked out that i might be back in jamaica by the time im thirty wont that be lovely i like the last part of the plan but im not so sure of the first anyway where did you find out about these call girls were they under g in the encyclopedia of course not dont be silly there was a big case about them in new york about two years ago there was a rich playboy called jelke he had a whole string of girls there was a lot about the case in the gleaner they gave all the prices and everything and anyway there are thousands of those sort of girls in kingston only of course not such good ones they only get about five shillings and they have no where to go and do it except the bush my nanny told me about them she said i mustnt grow up like them or id be very unhappy i can see that for only five shillings but for a hundred dollars bond said you wouldnt be able to keep all of that youd have to have a sort of manager to get the men and then youd have to bribe the police to leave you alone and you could easily go to prison if something went wrong i really dont think youd like the work ill tell you what with all you know about animals and insects and so on you could get a wonderful job looking after them in one of the american zoos or what about the jamaica institute im sure youd like that better youd be just as likely to meet a nice husband anyway you mustnt think of being a call girl any more youve got a beautiful body you must keep it for the men you love thats what people say in books she said doubtfully the trouble is there arent any men to love at beau desert she said shyly youre the first englishman ive ever talked to i liked you from the beginning i dont mind telling you these things at all i suppose there are plenty of other people i should like if i could get away of course there are hundreds and youre a wonderful girl i thought so directly i saw you saw my behind you mean the voice was getting drowsy but it was full of pleasure bond laughed well it was a wonderful behind and the other side was wonderful too bonds body began to stir with the memory of how she had been he said gruffly now come on honey its time to go to sleep therell be plenty of time to talk when we get back to jamaica will there she said sleepily promise promise he heard her stir in the sleepingbag he looked down he could just make out the pale profile turned towards him she gave the deep sigh of a child before it falls asleep there was silence in the clearing it was getting cold bond put his head down on his hunched knees he knew it was no good trying to get to sleep his mind was full of the day and of this extraordinary girl tarzan who had come into his life it was as if some beautiful animal had attached itself to him there would be no dropping the leash until he had solved her problems for her he knew it of course there would be no difficulty about most of them he could fix the operationeven with the help of friends find a proper job and a home for her he had the money he would buy her dresses have her hair done get her started in the big world it would be fun but what about the other side what about the physical desire he felt for her one could not make love to a child but was she a child there was nothing childish about her body or her personality she was fully grown and highly intelligent in her fashion and far more capable of taking care of herself than any girl of twenty bond had ever met bonds thoughts were interrupted by a tug at his sleeve the small voice said why dont you go to sleep are you cold no im fine its nice and warm in the sleepingbag would you like to come in theres plenty of room no thank you honey ill be all right there was a pause then almost in a whisper if youre thinking i meanyou dont have to make love to me we could go to sleep back to front you know like spoons honey darling you go to sleep itd be lovely to be like that but not tonight anyway ill have to take over from quarrel soon yes i see the voice was grudging perhaps when we get back to jamaica perhaps promise i wont go to sleep until you promise bond said desperately of course i promise now go to sleep honeychile the voice whispered triumphantly now you owe me slavetime youve promised good night darling james good night darling honey xii the thing the grip on bonds shoulder was urgent he was instantly on his feet quarrel whispered fiercely somepn comin across de water capn it de dragon fo sho the girl woke up she said anxiously whats happened bond said stay here honey dont move ill be back he broke through the bushes on the side away from the mountain and ran along the sand with quarrel at his elbow they came to the tip of the sandspit twenty yards from the clearing they stopped under cover of the final bushes bond parted them and looked through what was it half a mile away coming across the lake was a shapeless thing with two glaring orange eyes with black pupils from between these where the mouth might be fluttered a yard of blue flame the grey luminescence of the stars showed some kind of domed head above two short batlike wings the thing was making a low moaning roar that overlaid another noise a deep rhythmic thud it was coming towards them at about ten miles an hour throwing up a creamy wake quarrel whispered gawd capn whats dat fearful ting bond stood up he said shortly dont know exactly some sort of tractor affair dressed up to frighten its running on a diesel engine so you can forget about dragons now lets see bond spoke half to himself no good running away the things too fast for us and we know it can go over mangroves and swamps have to fight it here whatll its weak spots be the drivers of course theyll have protection we dont know how much quarrel you start firing at that dome on top when it gets to two hundred yards aim carefuhy and keep on firing ill go for its headlights when it gets to fifty yards its not running on tracks must have some kind of giant tyres aeroplane tyres probably ill go for them too stay here ill go ten yards along they may start firing back and weve got to keep the bullets away from the girl okay bond reached out and squeezed the big shoulder and dont worry too much forget about dragons its just some gadget of doctor nos well kill the drivers and capture the damn thing and ride it down to the coast save us shoeleather right quarrel laughed shortly okay capn since you says so but ah sho hopes de almighty knows hes no dragon too bond ran down the sand he broke through the bushes until he had a clear field of fire he called softly honey yes james there was reliefin the nearby voice make a hole in the sand like we did on the beach behind the thickest roots get into it and lie down there may be some shooting dont worry about dragons this is just a painted up motor car with some of doctor nos men in it dont be frightened im quite close all right james be careful the voice was high with fright bond knelt on one knee in the leaves and sand and peered out now the thing was only about three hundred yards away and its yellow headlights were lighting up the sandspit blue flames were still fluttering from the mouth they were coming from a long snout mockedup with gaping jaws and gold paint to look like a dragons mouth flamethrower that would explain the burned bushes and the wardens story the blue flames would be coming from some kind of an afterburner the apparatus was now in neutral what would its range be when the compression was unleashed bond had to admit that the thing was an awesome sight as it moaned forward through the shallow lake it was obviously designed to terrify it would have frightened him but for the earthy thud of the diesel against native intruders it would be devastating but how vulnerable would it be to people with guns who didnt panic he was answered at once there came the crack of quarrels remington a spark flew off the domed cabin and there was a dull clang quarrel fired another single shot and then a burst the bullets hammered ineffectually against the cabin there was not even a check in speed the thing rolled on swerving slightly to make for the source of the gunfire bond cradled the smith wesson on his forearm and took careful aim the deep cough of his gun sounded above the rattle of the remington one of the headlamps shattered and went out he fired four shots at the other and got it with the fifth and last round in the cylinder the thing didnt care it rolled straight on towards quarrels hiding place bond reloaded and began firing at the huge bulge of the tyres under the bogus black and gold wings the range was now only thirty yards and he could have sworn that he hit the nearest wheel again and again no effect solid rubber the first breath of fear stirred bonds skin he reloaded was the damn thing vulnerable from the rear should he dash out into the lake and try and board it he took a step forward through the bushes then he froze incapable of movement suddenly from the dribbling snout a yellowtipped bolt of blue flame had howled out towards quarrels hiding place there was a single puff of orange and red flame from the bushes to bonds right and one unearthly scream immediately choked satisfied the searing tongue of fire licked back into the snout the thing turned on its axis and stopped dead now the blue hole of its mouth aimed straight at bond bond stood and waited for his unspeakable end he looked into the blue jaws of death and saw the glowing red filament of the firer deep inside the big tube he thought of quarrels bodythere was no time to think of quarreland imagined the blackened smoking figure lying in the melted sand soon he too would flame like a torch the single scream would be wrung from him and his limbs would jerk into the dancing pose of burned bodies then it would be honeys turn christ what had he led them into why had he been so insane as to take on this man with his devastating armoury why hadnt he been warned by the long finger that had pointed at him in jamaica bond set his teeth hurry up you bastards get it over there came the twang of a loudhailer a voice howled metallically come on out limey and the doll quick or youll fry in hell like your pal to rub in the command the bolt of flame spat briefly towards him bond stepped back from the searing heat he felt the girls body against his back she said hysterically i had to come i had to come bond said its all right honey keep behind me he had made up his mind there was no alternative even if death was to come later it couldnt be worse than this kind of death bond reached for the girls hand and drew her after him out on to the sand the voice howled stop there good boy and drop the peashooter no tricks or the crabsll be getting a cooked breakfast bond dropped his gun so much for the smith wesson the beretta would have been just as good against this thing the girl whimpered bond squeezed her hand stick it honey he said well get out of this somehow bond sneered at himself for the lie there was the clang of an iron door being opened from the back of the dome a man dropped into the water and walked towards them there was a gun in his hand he kept out of the line of fire of the flamethrower the fluttering blue flame lit up his sweating face he was a chinese negro a big man clad only in trousers something dangled from his left hand when he came closer bond saw it was handcuffs the man stopped a few yards away he said hold out your hands wrists together then walk towards me you first limey slowly or you get an extra navel bond did as he was told when he was within sweatsmell of the man the man put his gun between his teeth and reached out and snapped the handcuffs o bonds wrists bond looked into the face gunmetalcoloured from the blue flames it was a brutal squinting face it sneered at him dumb bastard said the man bond turned his back on the man and started walking away he was going to see quarrels body he had to say goodbye to it there was the roar of a gun a bullet kicked up sand close to his feet bond stopped and turned slowly round dont be nervous he said im going to take a look at the man youve just murdered ill be back the man lowered his gun he laughed harshly okay enjoy yourself sorry we aint got a wreath come back quick or we give the doll a toastin two minutes bond walked on towards the smoking clumpof bushes he got there and looked down his eyes and mouth winced yes it had been just as he had visualized worse he said softly im sorry quarrel he kicked into the ground and scooped up a handful of cool sand between his manacled hands and poured it over the remains of the eyes then he walked slowly back and stood beside the girl the man waved them forward with his gun they walked round the back of the machine there was a small square door a voice from inside said get in and sit on the floor dont touch anything or you get your fingers broke they scrambled into the iron box it stank of sweat and oil there was just room for them to sit with their knees hunched up the man with the gun followed them in and banged the door he switched on a light and sat down on an iron tractor seat beside the driver he said okay sam lets get goin you can put out the fire its light enough to steer by there was a row of dials and switches on the instrument panel the driver reached forward and pulled down a couple of the switches he put the machine into gear and peered out through a narrow slit in the iron wall in front of him bond felt the machine turn there came a faster beat from the engine and they moved off the girls shoulder pressed against his where are they taking us the whisper trembled bond turned his head and looked at her it was the first time he had been able to see her hair when it was dry now it was disarrayed by sleep but it was no longer a bunch of rats tails it hung heavily straight down to her shoulders where it curled softly inwards it was of the palest ash blonde and shone almost silver under the electric light she looked up at him the skin round her eyes and at the corners of her mouth was white with fear bond shrugged with an indifference he didnt feel he whispered oh i expect were going to see doctor no dont worry too much honey these men are just little gangsters itll be different with him when we get to him dont you say anything ill talk for both of us he pressed her shoulder i like the way you do your hair im glad you dont cut it too short some of the tension went out of her face how can you think of things like that she half smiled at him but im glad you like it i wash it in coconut oil once a week at the memory of her other life her eyes grew bright with tears she bent her head down to her manacled hands to hide her tears she whispered almost to herself ill try to be brave itll be all right as long as youre there bond shifted so that he was right up against her he brought his handcuffed hands close up to his eyes and examined them they were the american police model he contracted his left hand the thinner of the two and tried to pull it through the squat ring of steel even the sweat on his skin was no help it was hopeless the two men sat on their iron seats with their backs to them indifferent they knew they had total command there wasnt room for bond to give any trouble bond couldnt stand up or get enough momentum into his hands to do any damage to the backs of their heads with his handcuffs if bond somehow managed to open the hatch and drop into the water where would that get him they would at once feel the fresh air on their backs and stop the machine and either burn him in the water or pick him up it annoyed bond that they didnt worry about him that they knew he was utterly in their power he also didnt like the idea that these men were intelligent enough to know that he presented no threat stupider men would have sat over him with a gun out would have trussed him and the girl with inexpert thoroughness might even have knocked them unconscious these two knew their business they were professionals or had been trained to be professionals the two men didnt talk to each other there was no nervous chatter about how clever they had been about their destination about how tired they were they just drove the machine quietly efficiently along finishing their competent job bond still had no idea what this contraption was under the black and gold paint and the rest of the fancy dress it was some sort of a tractor but of a kind he had never seen or heard of the wheels with their vast smooth rubber tyres were nearly twice as tall as himself he had seen no trade name on the tyres it had been too dark but they were certainly either solid or filled with porous rubber at the rear there had been a small trailing wheel for stability an iron fin painted black and gold had been added to help the dragon effect the high mudguards had been extended into short backswept wings a long metal dragons head had been added to the front of the radiator and the headlamps had been given black centres to make eyes that was all there was to it except that the cabin had been covered with an armoured dome and the flamethrower added it was as bond had thought a tractor dressed up to frighten and burnthough why it had a flamethrower instead of a machine gun he couldnt imagine it was clearly the only sort of vehicle that could travel the island its huge wide wheels would ride over mangrove and swamp and across the shallow lake it would negotiate the rough coral uplands and since its threat would be at night the heat in the iron cabin would remain at least tolerable bond was impressed he was always impressed by professionalism doctor no was obviously a man who took immense pains soon bond would be meeting him soon he would be up against the secret of doctor no and then what bond smiled grimly to himself he wouldnt be allowed to get away with his knowledge he would certainly be killed unless he could escape or talk his way out and what about the girl could bond prove her innocence and have her spared conceivably but she would never be let off the island she would have to stay there for the rest of her life as the mistress or wife of one of the men or doctor no himself if she appealed to him bonds thoughts were interrupted by rougher going under the wheels they had crossed the lake and were on the track that led up the mountain to the huts the cabin tilted and the machine began to climb in five minutes they would be there the codriver glanced over his shoulder at bond and the girl bond smiled cheerfully up at him he said youll get a medal for this the brown and yellow eyes looked impassively into his the purple blubbery lips parted in a sneer in which there was slow hate shut youring mouth the man turned back the girl nudged him and whispered why are they so rude why do they hate us so much bond grinned down at her i expect its because we made them afraid perhaps theyre still afraid thats because we dont seem to be frightened of them we must keep them that way the girl pressed against him ill try now the climb was getting steeper grey light showed through the slots in the armour dawn was coming up outside another day of brazen heat and ugly wind and the smell of marsh gas would be beginning bond thought of quarrel the brave giant who would not be seeing it with whom they should now be setting off for the long trek through the mangrove swamps he remembered the life insurance quarrel had smelled his death yet he had followed bond unquestioningly his faith in bond had been stronger than his fear and bond had let him down would bond also be the death of the girl the driver reached forward to the dashboard from the front of the machine there sounded the brief howl of a police siren it meandered into a dying moan after a minute the machine stopped idling in neutral the man pressed a switca and took a microphone off a hook beside him he spoke into it and bond could hear the echoing voice of the loudhailer outside okay got the limey and the girl other mans dead thats the lot open up bond heard a door being pulled sideways on iron rollers the driver put in the clutch and they rolled slowly forward a few yards and stopped the man switched off the engine there was a clang as the iron hatch was opened from the outside a gush of fresh air and a flood of brighter light came into the cabin hands took hold of bond and dragged him roughly out backwards on to a cement floor bond stood up he felt the prod of a gun in his side a voice said stay where you are no tricks bond looked at the man he was another chinese negro from the same stable as the others the yellow eyes examined him curiously bond turned away indifferently another man was prodding the girl with his gun bond said sharply leave the girl alone he walked over and stood beside her the two men seemed surprised they stood pointing their guns indecisively bond looked around him they were in one of the quonset huts he had seen from the river it was a garage and workshop the dragon had been halted over an examination pit in the concrete a dismantled outboard motor lay on one of the benches strips of white sodium lighting ran along the ceiling there was a smell of oil and exhaust smoke the driver and his mate were examining the machine now they sauntered up one of the guards said passed the message along the word is to send them through everything go okay the codriver who seemed to be the senior man present said sure bit of gunfire lights gone may be some holes in the tyres get the boys crackinfull overhaul ill put these two through and go get myself some shuteye he turned to bond okay git moving he gestured down the long hut bond said get moving yourself mind your manners and tell those apes to take their guns off us they might let one off by mistake they look dumb enough the man came closer the other three closed up behind him hate shone redly in their eyes the leading man lifted a clenched fist as big as a small ham and held it under bonds nose he was controlling himself with an effort he said tensely listen mister sometimes us boys is allowed to join in the fun at the end im just praying thisll be one of those times once we made it last a whole week an jees if i get you he broke off his eyes were alight with cruelty he looked past bond at the girl the eyes became mouths that licked their lips he wiped his hands down the sides of his trousers the tip of his tongue showed pinkly between the purple lips he turned to the other three what say fellers the three men were also looking at the girl they nodded dumbly like children in front of a christmas tree bond longed to run berserk among them laying into their faces with his manacled wrists accepting their bloody revenge but for the girl he would have done it now all he had achieved with his brave words was to get her frightened he said all right all right youre four and were two and weve got our hands tied come on we wont hurt you just dont push us around too much doctor no might not be pleased at the name the mens faces changed three pairs of eyes looked whitely from bond to the leader for a minute the leader stared suspiciously at bond wondering trying to fathom whether perhaps bond had got some edge on their boss his mouth opened to say something he thought better of it he said lamely okay okay we was just kiddin he turned to the men for confirmation right sure sure thing it was a ragged mumble the men looked away the leader said gruffly this way mister he walked off down the long hut bond took the girls wrist and followed he was impressed with the weight of doctor nos name that was something to remember if they had any more dealings with the staff the man came to a rough wooden door at the end of the hut there was a bellpush beside it he rang twice and waited there came a click and the door opened o reveal ten yards of carpeted rock passage with another door smarter and creampainted at the end the man stood aside straight ahead mister knock on the door the receptionistll take over there was no irony in his voice and his eyes were impassive bond led the girl into the passage he heard the door shut behind them he stopped and looked down at her he said now what she smiled tremulously its nice to feel carpet under ones feet bond squeezed her wrist he walked forward to the creampainted door and knocked the door opened bond went through with the girl at his heels when he stopped dead in his tracks he didnt feel the girl bump into him he just stood and stared xiii minklined prison it was the sort of reception room the largest american corporations have on the presidents floor in their new york skyscrapers it was of pleasant proportions about twenty feet square the floor was closecarpeted in the thickest winered wilton and the walls and ceiling were painted a soft dove grey colour lithograph reproductions of degas ballet sketches were well hung in groups on the walls and the lighting was by tall modern standard lamps with dark green silk shades in a fashionable barrel design to bonds right was a broad mahogany desk with a green leather top handsome matching desk furniture and the most expensive type of intercom two tall antique chairs waited for visitors on the other side of the room was a refectorytype table with shiny magazines and two more chairs on both the desk and the table were tall vases of freshly cut hibiscus the air was fresh and cool and held a slight expensive fragrance there were two women in the room behind the desk with pen poised over a printed form sat an efficientlooking chinese girl with hornrimmed spectacles below a bang of black hair cut short her eyes and mouth wore the standard receptionists smile of welcomebright helpful inquisitive holding the door through which they had come and waiting for them to move farther into the room so that she could cloge it stood an older rather matronly woman of about fortyfive she also had chinese blood her appearance wholesome bosomy eager was almost excessively gracious her square cut pincenez gleamed with the hostesss desire to make them feel at home both women were dressed in spotless white with white stockings and white suede brogues like assistants in the most expensive american beautyparlours there was something soft and colourless about their skins as if they rarely went out of doors while bond took in the scene the woman at the door twittered conventional phrases of welcome as if they had been caught in a storm and had arrived late at a party you poor dears we simply didnt know when to expect you we kept on being told you were on your way first it was teatime yesterday then dinner and it was only half an hour ago we heard you would only be here in time for breakfast you must be famished come along now and help sister rose fill in your forms and then ill pack you both straight off to bed you must be tired out clucking softly she closed the door and ushered them forward to the desk she got them seated in the chairs and rattled on now im sister lily and this is sister rose she just wants to ask you a few questions now let me see a cigarette she picked up a tooled leather box she opened it and put it on the desk in front of them it had three compartments she pointed with a little finger those are american and those are players and those are turkish she picked up an expensive desklighter and waited bond reached out his manacled hands to take a turkish cigarette sister lily gave a squeak of dismay oh but really she sounded genuinely embarrassed sister rose the key quickly ive said again and again that patients are never to be brought in like that there was impatience and distaste in her voice really that outside staff its time they had a talking to sister rose was just as much put out hastily she scrabbled in a drawer and handed a key across to sister lily who with much cooing and tuttutting unlocked the two pairs of handcuffs and walked behind the desk and dropped them as if they were dirty bandages into the wastepaper basket thank you bond was unable to think of any way to handle the situation except to fall in with what was happening on the stage he reached out and took a cigarette and lit it he glanced at honeychile rider who sat looking dazed and nervously clutching the arms of her chair bond gave her a reassuring smile now if you please sister rose bent over a long printed form on expensive paper i promise to be as quick as i can your name please misterer bryce john bryce she wrote busily permanent address care of the royal zoological society regents park london england profession ornithologist oh dear shedimpled at him could you please spell that bond did so thank you so much now let me see purpose of visit birds said bond i am also a representative of the audubon society of new york they have a lease of part of this island oh really bond watched the pen writing down exactly what he had said after the last word she put a neat query in brackets and sister rose smiled politely in the direction of honeychile your wife isshe also interested in birds yes indeed and her first name honeychile sister rose was delighted what a pretty name she wrote busily and now just your next of kin and then were finished bond gave ms real name as next of kin for both of them he described him as uncle and gave his address as managing director universal export regents park london sister rose finished writing and said there thats done thank you so much mr bryce and i do hope you both enjoy your stay thank you very much im sure we will bond got up honeychile rider did the same her face still expressionless sister lily said now come along with me you poor dears she walked to a door in the far wall she stopped with her hand on the cutglass doorknob oh deary me now ive gone and forgotten the number of their rooms its the cream suite isnt it sister yes thats right fourteen and fifteen thank you my dear and now she opened the door if youll just follow me im afraid its a terribly long walk she shut the door behind them and led the way the doctors often talked of putting in one of those moving stairway things but you know how it is with a busy man she laughed gaily so many other things to think of yes i expect so said bond politely bond took the girls hand and they followed the motherly bustling figure down a hundred yards of lofty corridor in the same style as the reception room but lit at frequent intervals by discreetly expensive wallbrackets bond answered with polite monosyllables the occasional twittering comments sister lily threw over her shoulder his whole mind was focused on the extraordinary circumstances of their reception he was quite certain the two women had been genuine not a look or a word had been dropped that was out of place it was obviously a front of some kind but a solid one meticulously supported by the decor and the cast the lack of resonance in the room and now in the corridor suggested that they had stepped from the quonset hut into the side of the mountain and that they were now walking through its base at a guess they would be walking towards the westtowards the cliffface with which the island ended there was no moisture on the walls and the air was cool and pure with a strongish breeze coming towards them a lot of money and good engineering had gone into the job the pallor of the two women suggested that they spent all their time inside the mountain from what sister lily had said it sounded as if they were part of an inside staff that had nothing to do with the strongarm squad outside and perhaps didnt even understand what sort of men they were it was grotesque concluded bond as they came nearer to a door at the end of the corridor dangerously grotesque but it was no good wondering about it he could only follow the lines of the gracious script at least this was better than the backstage of the island outside at the door sister lily rang they had been expected the door opened at once an enchanting chinese girl in a mauve and white flowered kimono stood smiling and bowing as chinese girls are supposed to do again there was nothing but warmth and welcome in the pale flowerlike face sister lily cried here they are at last may mr and mrs john bryce and i know they must be exhausted so we must take them straight to their rooms for some breakfast and a sleep she turned to bond this is may such a dear girl she will be looking after you both anything you want just ring for may shes a favourite with all our patients patients thought bond thats the second time shes used the word he smiled politely at the girl how do you do yes wed certainly both of us like to get to our rooms may embraced them both with a warm smile she said in a low attractive voice i do hope youll both be comfortable mr bryce i took the liberty of ordering breakfast as soon as i heard you had come in shall we corridors branched off to left and right of double liftdoors set in the wall opposite the girl led the way to the right bond and honeychile followed with sister lily taking up the rear numbered doors led off the corridor on either side now the decor was in the lightest pink with a dove grey carpet the numbers on the doors were in the tens the corridor came to an abrupt end with two doors side by side and may opened the door of and they followed her in it was a charming double bedroom in modern miami style with dark green walls dark polished mahogany floor with occasional thick white rugs and welldesigned bamboo furniture with a chintz of large red roses on a white background there was a communicating door into a more masculine dressingroom and another that led into an extremely luxurious modern bathroom with a stepdown bath and a bidet it was like being shown into the very latest florida hotel suiteexcept for two details which bond noticed there were no windows and no inside handles to the doors may looked hopefully from one to the other bond turned to honeychile he smiled at her it looks very comfortable dont you think darling the girl played with the edge of her skirt she nodded not looking at him there was a timid knock on the door and another girl as pretty as may tripped in with a loaded tray balanced on her upturned hand she put it down on the centre table and pulled up two chairs she whisked off the speckless linen cloth that covered the dishes and pattered out of the room there was a delicious smell of bacon and coffee may and sister lily backed to the door the older woman stopped on the threshold and now well leave you two dear people in peace if you want anything just ring the bells are by the bed oh and by the way youll find plenty of fresh clothes in the cupboards chinese style im afraid she twinkled apologetically but i hope theyre the right sizes the wardrobe room only got the measurements yesterday evening the doctor has given strict orders that youre not to be disturbed hed be delighted if youd join him for dinner this evening he wants you to have the whole of the rest of the day to yourselvesto get settled down you know she paused and looked from one to the other smiling inquiry shall i say you yes please said bond tell the doctor we shall be delighted to join him for dinner oh i know hell be so pleased with a last twitter the two women softly withdrew and closed the door behind them bond turned towards honeychile she looked embarrassed she still avoided his eyes it occurred to bond that she could never have met such soft treatment or seen such luxury in her life to her all this must be far more strange and terrifying than what they had gone through outside she stood and fiddled at the hem of her man friday skirt there were streaks of dried sweat and salt and dust on her face her bare legs were filthy and bond noticed that her toes were moving softly as they gripped nervously into the wonderful thick pile carpet bond laughed he laughed with real pleasure that her fear had been drowned in the basic predicament of clothes and how to behave and he laughed at the picture they madeshe in her rags and he in his dirty blue shirt and black jeans and muddy canvas shoes he went to her and took her hands they were cold he said honey were a couple of scarecrows theres only one problem shall we have breakfast first while its hot or shall we get out of these rags and have a bath and eat the breakfast when its cold dont worry about anything else were here in this wonderful little house and thats all that matters now then what shall we do she smiled uncertainly the blue eyes searched his face for reassurance youre not worried about whats going to happen to us she nodded at the room dont you think this is all a trap if its a trap were in it theres nothing we can do now but eat the cheese the only question is whether we eat it hot or cold he pressed her hands really honey leave the worrying to me just think where we were an hour ago isnt this better now come on and decide the really important things bath or breakfast she said reluctantly well if you think i meanid rather get clean first she added quickly but youve got to help me she jerked her head towards the bathroom door i dont know how to work one of those places what do you do bond said seriously its quite easy ill fix it all ready for you while youre having your bath ill have my breakfast ill keep yours warm bond went to one of the builtin clothes cupboards and ran the door back there were half a dozen kimonos some silk and some linen he took out a linen one at random you take off your clothes and get into this and ill get the bath ready later on you can choose the things you want to wear for bed and dinner she said gratefully oh yes james if youll just show me she started to unbutton her shirt bond wanted to take her in his arms and kiss her instead he said abruptly thats fine honey and went into the bathroom and turned on the taps there was everything in the bathroomfloris lime bath essence for men and guerlain bathcubes for women he crushed a cube into the water and at once the room smelled like an orchid house the soap was guerlains sapoceti fleurs des alpes in a medicine cupboard behind the mirror over the washbasin were toothbrushes and toothpaste steradent toothpicks rose mouthwash dental floss aspirin and milk of magnesia there was also an electric razor lentheric aftershave lotion and two nylon hairbrushes and combs everything was brand new and untouched bond looked at his filthy unshaven face in the mirror and smiled grimly into the grey sunburned castaways eyes the coating on the pill was certainly of the very finest sugar it would be wise to expect that the medicine inside would be of the bitterest he turned back to the bath and felt the water it would be too hot for someone who presumably had never had a hot bath before he let in some cold as he bent over two arms were thrown round his neck he stood up the golden body blazed in the white tiled bathroom she kissed him hard and clumsily on the lips he put his arms round her and crushed her to him his heart pounding she said breathlessly at his ear the chinese dress felt strange anyway you told that woman we were married bonds hand was on her left breast its peak was hard with passion her stomach pressed against his why not why not dont be a fool this is a crazy time for it youre both in deadly danger you must stay cold as ice to have any chance of getting out of this mess later later dont be weak bond took his hand away from her breast and put it round her neck he rubbed his face against hers and then brought his mouth round to hers and gave her one long kiss he stood away and held her at arms length for a moment they looked at each other their eyes bright with desire she was breathing fast her lips parted so that he could see the glint of teeth he said unsteadily honey get into that bath before i spank you she smiled without saying anything she stepped down into the bath and lay at full length she looked up the fair hair on her body glittered up through the water like golden sovereigns she said provocatively youve got to wash me i dont know what to do youve got to show me bond said desperately shut up honey and stop flirting just take the soap and the sponge and start scrubbing damn you this isnt the time for making love im going to have breakfast he reached for the door handle and opened the door she said softly james he looked back she was sticking her tongue out at him he grinned savagely back at her and slammed the door bond went into the dressingroom and stood in the middle of the floor and waited for his heart to stop pounding he rubbed his hands over his face and shook his head to get rid of the thought of her to clear his mind he went carefully over both rooms looking for exits possible weapons microphonesanything that would add to his knowledge there were none of these things there was an electric clock on the wall which said eightthirty and a row of bells beside the double bed they said room service coiffeur manicurist maid there was no telephone high up in a corner of both rooms was a small ventilator grille each was about two feet square useless the doors appeared to be of some light metal painted to match the walls bond threw the whole weight of his body against one of them it didnt give a millimetre bond rubbed his shoulder the place was a prisonan exquisite prison it was no good arguing the trap had shut tight on them now the only thing for the mice to do was to make the most of the cheese bond sat down at the breakfast table there was a large tumbler of pineapple juice in a silverplated bowl of crushed ice he swallowed it down and lifted the cover oil his individual hotplate scrambled eggs on toast four rashers of bacon a grilled kidney and what looked like an english pork sausage there were also two kinds of hot toast rolls inside a napkin marmalade honey and strawberry jam the coffee was boiling hot in a large thermos decanter the cream smelled fresh from the bathroom came the sound of the girl crooning marion bond closed his ears to the sound and started on the eggs ten minutes later bond heard the bathroom door open he put down his toast and marmalade and covered his eyes with his hands she laughed she said hes a coward hes frightened of a simple girl bond heard her rummaging in the cupboards she went on talking half to herself i wonder why hes frightened of course if i wrestled with him id win easily perhaps hes frightened of that perhaps hes really not very strong his arms and his chest look strong enough i havent seen the rest yet perhaps its weak yes that must be it thats why he doesnt dare take his clothes off in front of me hm now lets see would he like me in this she raised her voice darling james would you like me in white with pale blue birds flying all over me yes damn you said bond through his hands now stop chattering to yourself and come and have breakfast im getting sleepy she gave a cry oh if you mean its time for us to go to bed of course ill hurry there was a flurry of feet and bond heard her sit down opposite he took his hands down she was smiling at him she looked ravishing her hair was dressed and combed and brushed to kill with one side falling down the side of the cheek and the other slicked back behind her ear her skin sparkled with freshness and the big blue eyes were alight with happiness now bond loved the broken nose it had become part of his thoughts of her and it suddenly occurred to him that he would be sad when she was just an immaculately beautiful girl like other beautiful girls but he knew it would be no good trying to persuade her of that she sat demurely with her hands in her lap below the end of a cleavage which showed half her breasts and a deep vee of her stomach bond said severely now listen honey you look wonderful but that isnt the way to wear a kimono pull it up right across your body and tie it tight and stop trying to look like a call girl it just isnt good manners at breakfast oh you are a stuffy old beast she pulled her kimono an inch or two closer why dont you like playing i want to play at being married not at breakfast time said bond firmly come on and eat up its delicious and anyway im filthy im going to shave and have a bath he got up and walked round the table and kissed the top of her head and as for playing as you call it id rather play with you than anyone in the world but not now without waiting for her answer he walked into the bathroom and shut the door bond shaved and had a bath and a shower he felt desperately sleepy sleep came to him in waves so that from time to time he had to stop what he was doing and bend his head down between his knees when he came to brush his teeth he could hardly do it now he recognized the signs he had been drugged in the coffee or in the pineapple juice it didnt matter nothing mattered all he wanted to do was lie down on the tiled floor and shut his eyes bond weaved drunkenly to the door he forgot that he was naked that didnt matter either anyway the girl had finished her breakfast she was in bed he staggered over to her holding on to the furniture the kimono was lying in a pile on the floor she was fast asleep naked under a single sheet bond gazed dreamily at the empty pillow beside her head no he found the switches and turned out the lights now he had to crawl across the floor and into his room he got to his bed and pulled himself on to it he reached out an arm of lead and jabbed at the switch on the bedlight he missed it the lamp crashed to the floor and the bulb burst with a last effort bond turned on his side and let the waves sweep over his head the luminous figures on the electric clock in the double room said ninethirty at ten oclock the door of the double room opened softly a very tall thin figure was silhouetted against the lighted corridor it was a man he must have been six feet six tall he stood on the threshold with his arms folded listening satisfied he moved slowly into the room and up to the bed he knew the way exactly he bent down and listened to the quiet breathing of the girl after a moment he reached up to his chest and pressed a switch a flashlight with a very broad diffused beam came on the flashlight was attached to him by a belt that held it above the breast bone he bent forward so that the soft light shone on the girls face the intruder examined the girls face for several minutes one of his hands came up and took the sheet at her chin and softly drew the sheet down to the end of the bed the hand that drew down the sheet was not a hand it was a pair of articulated steel pincers at the end of a metal stalk that disappeared into a black silk sleeve it was a mechanical hand the man gazed for a long time at the naked body moving his chest to and fro so that every corner of the body came under the light then the claw came out again and delicately lifted a corner of the sheet from the bottom of the bed and drew it back over the girl the man stood for another moment gazing down at the sleeping face then he switched off the torch on his chest and moved quietly away across the room to the open door through which bond was sleeping the man spent longer beside bonds bed he scrutinized every line every shadow on the dark rather cruel face that lay drowned almost extinct on the pillow he watched the pulse in the neck and counted it and when he had pulled down the sheet he did the same with the area round the heart he gauged the curve of the muscles on bonds arms and thighs and looked thoughtfully at the hidden strength in the flat stomach he even bent down close over the outflung open right hand and examined its life and fate lines finally with infinite care the steel claw drew the sheet back up to bonds neck for another minute the tall figure stood over the sleeping man then it swished softly away and out into the corridor and the door closed with a click xiv come into my parlour the electric clock in the cool dark room in the heart of the mountain showed fourthirty outside the mountain crab key had sweltered and stunk its way through another day at the eastern end of the island the mass of birds louisiana herons pelicans avocets sandpipers egrets flamingoes and the few roseate spoonbills went on with building their nests or fished in the shallow waters of the lake most of the birds had been disturbed so often that year that they had given up any idea of building in the past few months they had been raided at regular intervals by the monster that came at night and burned down their roosting places and the beginnings of their nests this year many would not breed there would be vague movements to migrate and many would die of the nervous hysteria that seizes bird colonies when they no longer have peace and privacy at the other end of the island on the guanera that gave the mountain its snowcovered look the vast swarm of cormorants had passed their usual day of gorging themselves with fish and paying back the ounce of precious manure to their owner and protector nothing had interfered with their nesting season now they were noisily fiddling with the untidy piles of sticks that would be their nestseach pile at exactly sixty centimetres from the next for the guanay is a quarrelsome bird and this sixtycentimetre ring represents their sparring space soon the females would be laying the three eggs from which their masters flock would be increased by an average of two young cormorants below the peak where the diggings began the hundred or so negro men and women who were the labour force were coming to the end of the days shift another fifty cubic yards of guano had been dug out of the mountainside and another twenty yards of terrace had been added to the working level below the mountainside looked like terraced vineyards in upper italy except that here there were no vines only deep barren shelves cut in the mountainside and here instead of the stink of marsh gas on the rest of the island there was a strong ammoniac smell and the ugly hot wind that kept the diggings dry blew the freshly turned whitishbrown dust into the eyes and ears and noses of the diggers but the workers were used to the smell and the dust and it was easy healthy work they had no complaints the last iron truck of the day started off on the decauville track that snaked down the mountainside to the crusher and separator a whistle blew and the workers shouldered their clumsy picks and moved lazily down towards the highwired group of quonset huts that was their compound tomorrow on the other side of the mountain the monthly ship would be coming in to the deepwater quay they had helped to build ten years before but which since then they had never seen that would mean fresh stores and fresh goods and cheap jewellery at the canteen it would be a holiday there would be rum and dancing and a few fights life was good life was good too for the senior outside staffall chinese negroes like the men who had hunted bond and quarrel and the girl they also stopped work in the garage and the machine shops and at the guard posts and filtered off to the officers quarters apart from watch and loading duties tomorrow would also be a holiday for most of them they too would have their drinking and dancing and there would bea new monthly batch of girls from inside some marriages from the last lot would continue for further months or weeks according to the taste of the husband but for the others there would be a fresh choice there would be some of the older girls who had had their babies in the creche and were coming back for a fresh spell of duty outside and there would be a sprinkling of young ones who had come of age and would be coming out for the first time there would be fights over these and blood would be shed but in the end the officers quarters would settle down for another month of communal life each officer with his woman to look after his needs deep down in the cool heart of the mountain far below this welldisciplined surface life bond awoke in his comfortable bed apart from a slight nembutal headache he felt fit and rested lights were on in the girls room and he could hear her moving about he swung his feet to the ground and avoiding the fragments of glass from the broken lamp walked softly over to the clothes cupboard and put on the first kimono that came to his hand he went to the door the girl had a pile of kimonos out on the bed and was trying them on in front of the wall mirror she had on a very smart one in skyblue silk it looked wonderful against the gold of her skin bond said thats the one she whirled round her hand at her mouth she took it down oh its you she smiled at him i thought youd never wake up ive been to look at you several times id made up my mind to wake you at five its halfpast four and im hungry can you get us something to eat why not bond walked across to her bed as he passed her he put his arm round her waist and took her with him he examined the bells he pressed the one marked room service he said what about the others lets have the full treatment she giggled but whats a manicurist someone who does your nails we must look our best for doctor no at the back of bonds mind was the urgent necessity to get his hands on some kind of weapona pair of scissors would be better than nothing anything would do he pressed two more bells he let her go and looked round the room someone had come while they were asleep and taken away the breakfast things there was a drink tray on a sideboard against the wall bond went over and examined it it had everything propped among the bottles were two menus huge doublefolio pages covered with print they might have been from the savoy grill or the or the tour dargent bond ran his eye down one of them it began with caviar double de beluga and ended with sorbet d la champagne in between was every dish whose constituents would not be ruined by a deep freeze bond tossed it down one certainly couldnt grumble about the quality of the cheese in the trap there was a knock on the door and the exquisite may came in she was followed by two other twittering chinese girls bond brushed aside their amiabilities ordered tea and buttered toast for honeychile and told them to look after her hair and nails then he went into the bathroom and had a couple of aspirins and a cold shower he put on his kimono again reflected that he looked idiotic in it and went back into the room a beaming may asked if he would be good enough to select what he and mrs bryce could care to have for dinner without enthusiasm bond ordered caviar grilled lamb cutlets and salad and angels on horseback for himself when honeychile refused to make any suggestions he chose melon roast chicken a panglaise and vanilla icecream with hot chocolate sauce for her may dimpled her enthusiasm and approval the doctor asks if seven fortyfive for eight would be convenient bond said curtly that it would thank you so much mr bryce i will call for you at seven fortyfour bond walked over to where honeychile was being ministered to at the dressing table he watched the busy delicate fingers at work on her hairand her nails she smiled at him excitedly in the mirror he said gruffly dont let them make too much of a monkey out of you and went to the drink tray he poured himself out a stiff bourbon and soda and took it into his own room so much for his idea of getting hold of a weapon the scissors and files and probes were attached to the manicurists waist by a chain so were the scissors of the hairdresser bond sat down on his rumpled bed and lost himself in drink and gloomy reflections the women went the girl looked in at him when he didnt lift his head she went back into her room and left him alone in due course bond came into her room to get himself another drink he said perfunctorily honey you look wonderful he glanced at the clock on the wall and went back and drank his drink and put on another of the idiotic kimonos a plain black one in due course there came the soft knock on the door and the two of them went silently out of the room and along the empty gracious corridor may stopped at the lift its doors were held open by another eager chinese gui they walked in and the doors shut bond noticed that the lift was made by waygood otis everything in the prison was de luxe he gave an inward shudder of distaste he noticed the reaction he turned to the girl im sorry honey got a bit of a headache he didnt want to tell her that all this luxury playacting was getting him down that he hadnt the smallest idea what it was all about that he knew it was bad news and that he hadnt an inkling of a plan of how to get them out of whatever situation they were in that was the worst of it there was nothing that depressed bonds spirit so much as the knowledge that he hadnt one line of either attack or defence the girl moved closer to him she said im sorry james i hope it will go away youre not angry with me about anything bond dredged up a smile he said no darling i m only angry with myself he lowered his voice now about this evening just leave the talking to me be natural and dont be worried by doctor no he may be a bit mad she nodded solemnly ill do my best the lift sighed to a stop bond had no idea how far down they had gonea hundred feet two hundred the automatic doors hissed back and bond and the girl stepped out into a large room it was empty it was a highceilinged room about sixty feet long lined on three sides with books to the ceiling at first glance the fourth wall seemed to be made of solid blueblack glass the room appeared to be a combined study and library there was a big paperstrewn desk in one corner and a central table with periodicals and newspapers comfortable club chairs upholstered in red leather were dotted about the carpet was dark green and the lighting from standard lamps was subdued the only odd feature was that the drink tray and sideboard were up against the middle of the long glass wall and chairs and occasional tables with ashtrays were arranged in a semicircle round it so that the room was centred in front of the empty wall bonds eye caught a swirl of movement in the dark glass he walked across the room a silvery spray of small fish with a bigger fish in pursuit fled across the dark blue they disappeared so to speak off the edge of the screen what was this an aquarium bond looked upwards a yard below the ceiling small waves were lapping at the glass above the waves was a strip of greyer blueblack dotted with sparks of light the outlines of orion were the clue this was not an aquarium this was the sea itself and the night sky the whole of one side of the room was made of armoured glass they were under the sea looking straight into its heart twenty feet down bond and the girl stood transfixed as they watched there was the glimpse of two great goggling orbs a golden sheen of head and deep flank showed for an instant and was gone a big grouper a silver swarm of anchovies stopped and hovered and sped away the twentyfoot tendrils of a portuguese manowar drifted slowly across the window glinting violet as they caught the light up above there was the dark mass of its underbelly and the outline of its inflated bladder steering with the breeze bond walked along the wall fascinated by the idea of living with this slow endlessly changing moving picture a frig tulip shell was progressing slowly up the window from the floor level a frisk of demoiselles and angel fish and a rubyred moonlight snapper were nudging and rubbing themselves against a corner of the glass and a sea centipede quested along nibbling at the minute algae that must grow every day on the outside of the window a long dark shadow paused in the centre of the window and then moved slowly away if only one could see more obediently two great shafts of light from off the screen lanced out into the water for an instant they searched independently then they converged on the departing shadow and the dull grey torpedo of a twelvefoot shark showed up in all its detail bond could even see the piglike pink eyes roll inquisitively in the light and the slow pulse of the slanting gillrakers for an instant the shark turned straight into the converged beam and the white halfmoon mouth showed below the reptiles flat head it stood poised for a second and then with an elegant disdainful swirl the great sweptback tail came round and with a lightning quiver the shark had gone the searchlights went out bond turned slowly he expected to see doctor no but still the room was empty it looked static and lifeless compared with the pulsing mysteries outside the window bond looked back what must this be like in the colours of day when one could see everything perhaps for twenty yards or more what must it be like in a storm when the waves crashed noiselessly against the glass delving almost to the floor and then sweeping up and out of sight what must it be like in the evening when the last golden shafts of the sun shone into the upper half of the room and the waters below were full of dancing motes and tiny water insects what an amazing man this must be who had thought of this fantastically beautiful conception and what an extraordinary engineering feat to have carried it out how had he done it there could only be one way he must have built the glass wall deep inside the cliff and then delicately removed layer after layer of the outside rock until the divers could prise off the last skin of coral but how thick was the glass who had rolled it for him how had he got it to the island how many divers had he used how much god in heaven could it have cost one million dollars it was a cavernous echoing voice with a trace of american accent bond turned slowly almost reluctantly away from the window doctor no had come through a door behind his desk he stood looking at them benignly with a thin smile on his lips i expect you were wondering about the cost my guests usually think about the material side after about fifteen minutes were you i was still smiling doctor no came slowly out from behind the desk and moved towards them he seemed to glide rather than take steps his knees did not dent the matt gunmetal sheen of his kimono and no shoes showed below the sweeping hem bonds first impression was of thinness and erectness and height doctor no was at least six inches taller than bond but the straight immovable poise of his body made him seem still taller the head also was elongated and tapered from a round completely bald skull down to a sharp chin so that the impression was of a reversed raindropor rather oildrop for the skin was of a deep almost translucent yellow it was impossible to tell doctor nos age as far as bond could see there were no lines on the face it was odd to see a forehead as smooth as the top of the polished skull even the cavernous indrawn cheeks below the prominent cheekbones looked as smooth as fine ivory there was something daliesque about the eyebrows which were fine and black and sharply upswept as if they had been painted on as makeup for a conjurer below them slanting jet black eyes stared out of the skull they were without eyelashes they looked like the mouths of two small revolvers direct and unblinking and totally devoid of expression the thin fine nose ended very close above a wide compressed wound of a mouth which despite its almost permanent sketch of a smile showed only cruelty and authority the chin was indrawn towards the neck later bond was to notice that it rarely moved more than slightly away from centre giving the impression that the head and the vertebra were in one piece the bizarre gliding figure looked like a giant venomousworm wrapped in grey tinfoil and bond would not have been surprised to see the rest of it trailing slimily along the carpet behind doctor no came within three steps of them and stopped the wound in the tall face opened forgive me for not shaking hands with you the deep voice was flat and even i am unable to slowly the sleeves parted and opened i have no hands the two pairs of steel pincers came out on their gleaming stalks and were held up for inspection like the hands of a praying mantis then the two sleeves joined again bond felt the girl at his side give a start the black apertures turned towards her they slid down to her nose the voice said flatly it is a misfortune the eyes came back to bond you were admiring my aquarium it was a statement not a question man enjoys the beasts and the birds i decided to enjoy also the fish i find them far more varied and interesting i am sure you both share my enthusiasm bond said i congratulate you i shall never forget this room no again a statement perhaps with a sardonic inflection of fact but we have much to talk about and so little time please sit down you will have a drink cigarettes are beside your chairs doctor no moved to a high leather chair and folded himself down on to the seat bond took the chair opposite the girl sat between them and slightly back bond felt a movement behind him he looked over his shoulder a short man a chinese negro with the build of a wrestler stood at the drink tray he was dressed in black trousers and a smart white jacket black almond eyes in a wide moon face met his and slid incuriously away doctor no said this is my bodyguard he is expert in many things there is no mystery about his sudden appearance i always carry what is known as a walkietalkie here he inclined his chin towards the bosom of his kimono thus i can summon him when he is needed what will the girl have not your wife bond turned to honeychile her eyes were wide and staring she said quietly a cocacola please bond felt a moment of relief at least she was not being got down by the performance bond said and i would like a medium vodka dry martiniwith a slice of lemon peel shakenand not stirred please i would prefer russian or polish vodka doctor no gave his thin smile an extra crease i see you are also a man who knows what he wants on this occasion your desires will be satisfied do yoju not find that it is generally so when one wants a thing one gets it that is my experience the small things if you fail at the large things it means you have not large ambitions concentration focusthat is all the aptitudes come the tools forge themselves give me a fulcrum and i will move the worldbut only if the desire to move the world is there the thin lips bent minutely downwards in deprecation but this is chatter we are making conversation instead let us talk both of us i am sure prefer talk to conversation is the martini to your liking you have cigarettesenough and the right sort to cosset your cancer so be it samsam put the shaker beside the man and another bottle of cocacola beside the girl it should now be eightten we will have dinner at nine oclock precisely doctor no sat slightly more upright in his chair he inclined himself forward staring at bond there was a moments silence in the room then doctor no said and now mister james bond of the secret service let us tell each other our secrets first to show you that i hide nothing i will tell you mine then you will tell me yours doctor nos eyes blazed darkly but let us tell each other the truth he drew one steel claw out of the wide sleeve and held it upwards he paused i shall do so but you must do the same if you do not these he pointed the claw at his eyes will know that you are lying doctor no brought the steel claw delicately in front of each eye and tapped the centre of each eyeball each eyeball in turn emitted a dull ting these said doctor no see everything xv pandoras box james bond picked up his glass and sipped at it thoughtfully it seemed pointless to go on bluffing his story of representing the audubon society was anyway a thin one which could be punctured by anyone who knew about birds it was obvious that his own cover was in shreds he must concentrate on protecting the girl to begin with he must reassure her bond smiled at doctor no he said i know about your contact in kings house miss taro she is your agent i have recorded the fact and it will be divulged in certain circumstancesdoctor nos expression shewed no interestas will other facts but if we are to have a talk let us have it without any more stage effects you are an interesting man but it is not necessary to make yourself more interesting than you are you have suffered the misfortune of losing your hands you wear mechanical hands many men wounded in the war wear them you wear contact lenses instead of spectacles you use a walkietalkie instead of a bell to summon your servant no doubt you have other tricks but doctor no you are still a man who sleeps and eats and defecates like the rest of us so no more conjuring tricks please i am not one of your guano diggers and i am not impressed by them doctor no inclined his head a fraction bravely spoken mister bond i accept the rebuke i have no doubt developed annoying mannerisms fromliving too long in the company of apes but do not mistake these mannerisms for bluff i am a technician i suit the tool to the material i possess also a range of tools for working with refractory materials however doctor no raised his joined sleeves an inch and let them fall back in his lap let us proceed with our talk it is a rare pleasure to have an intelligent listener and i shall enjoy telling you the story of one of the most remarkable men in the world you are the first person to hear it i have not told it before you are the only person i have ever met who will appreciate my story and also doctor no paused for the significance of the last words to make itself feltkeep it to himself he continued the second of these considerations also applies to the girl so that was it there had been little doubt in bonds mind ever since the spandau had opened up on them and since even before then in jamaica where the attempts on him had not been halfhearted bond had assumed from the first that this man was a killer that it would be a duel to the death he had had his usual blind faith that he would win the duelall the way until the moment when the flamethrower had pointed at him then he had begun to doubt now he knew this man was too strong too well equipped bond said there is no point in the girl hearing this she has nothing to do with me i found her yesterday on the beach she is a jamaican from morgans harbour she collects shells your men destroyed her canoe so i had to bring her with me send her away now and then back home she wont talk she will swear not to the girl interrupted fiercely i will talk i shall tell everything im not going to move im going to stay with you bond looked at her he said icily i dont want you doctor no said softly do not waste your breath on these heroics nobody who comes to this island has ever left it do you understand nobodynot even the simplest fisherman it is not my policy do not argue with me or attempt to bluff me it is entirely useless bond examined the face there was no anger in it no obstinacynothing but a supreme indifference he shrugged his shoulders he looked at the girl and smiled he said all right honey and i didnt mean it id hate you to go away well stay together and listen to what the maniac has to say the girl nodded happily it was as if her lover had threatened to send her out of the cinema and now had relented doctor no said in the same soft resonant voice you are right mister bond that is just what i am a maniac all the greatest men are maniacs they are possessed by a mania which drives them forward towards their goal the great scientists the philosophers the religious leadersall maniacs what else but a blind singleness of purpose could have given focus to their genius would have kept them in the groove of their purpose mania my dear mister bond is as priceless as genius dissipation of energy fragmentation of vision loss of momentum the lack of followthroughthese are the vices of the herd doctor no sat slightly back in his chair i do not possess these vices i am as you correctly say a maniaca maniac mister bond with a mania for power thatthe black holes glittered blankly at bond through the contact lensesis the meaning of my life that is why i am here that is why you are here that is why here exists bond picked up his glass and drained it he filled it again from the shaker he said im not surprised its the old business of thinking youre the king of englandor the president of the united states or god the asylums are full of them the only difference is that instead of being shut up youve built your own asylum and shut yourself up in it but why did you do it why does sitting shut up in this cell give you the illusion of power irritation flickered at the corner of the thin mouth mister bond power is sovereignty clausewitzs first principle was to have a secure base from there one proceeds to freedom of action together that is sovereignty i have secured these things and much besides no one else in the world possesses them to the same degree they cannot have them the world is too public these things can only be secured in privacy you talk of kings add presidents how much power do they possess as much as their people will allow them who in the world has the power of life or death over his people now that stalin is dead can you name any man except myself and how do i possess that power that sovereignty through privacy through the fact that nobody knows through the fact that i have to account to no one bond shrugged that is only the illusion of power doctor no any man with a loaded revolver has the power of life and death over his neighbour other people beside you have murdered in secret and got away with it in the end they generally get their deserts a greater power than they possess is exerted upon them by the community that will happen to you doctor no i tell you your search for power is an illusion because power itself is an illusion doctor no said equably so is beauty mister bond so is art so is money so is death and so probably is life these concepts are relative your play upon words does not shake me i know philosophy i know ethics and i know logicbetter than you do i daresay but let us move away from this sterile debate let us return to where i began with my mania for power or if you wish it for the illusion of power and please mister bond again the extra crease in the fixed smile please do not imagine that half an hours conversation with you will alter the pattern of my life interest yourself rather in the history of my pursuit let us put it of an illusion go ahead bond glanced at the girl she caught his eyes she put her hand up to her mouth as if to conceal a yawn bond grinned at her he wondered when it would amuse doctor no to crack her pose of indifference doctor no said benignly i shall endeavour not to bore you facts are so much more interesting than theories dont you agree doctor no was not expecting a reply he fixed his eye on the elegant tulip shell that had now wandered half way up the outside of the dark window some small silver fish squirted across the black void a bluish prickle of phosphorescence meandered vaguely up by the ceiling the stars shone more brightly through the glass the artificiality of the scene inside the roomthe three people sitting in the comfortable chairs the drinks on the sideboardthe rich carpet the shaded lights suddenly seemed ludicrous to bond even the drama of it the danger were fragile things compared with the progress of the tulip shell up the glass outside supposing the glass burst supposing the stresses had been badly calculated the workmanship faulty supposing the sea decided to lean a little more heavily against the window doctor no said i was the only son of a german methodist missionary and a chinese girl of good family i was born in pekin but on what is known as the wrong side of the blanket i was an encumbrance an aunt of my mother was paid to bring me up doctor no paused no love you see mister bond lack of parental care he went on the seed was sown i went to work in shanghai i became involved with the tongs with their illicit proceedings i enjoyed the conspiracies the burglaries the murders the arson of insured properties they represented revolt against the father figure who had betrayed me i loved the death and destruction of people and things i became adept in the technique of criminalityif you wish to call it that then there was trouble i had to be got out of the way the tongs considered me too valuable to kill i was smuggled to the united states i settled in new york i had been given a letter of introduction in code to one of the two most powerful tongs in americathe hip sings i never knew what the letter said but they took me on at once as a confidential clerk in due course at the age of thirty i was made the equivalent of treasurer the treasury contained over a million dollars i coveted this money then began the great tong wars of the late twenties the two great new york tongs my own the hip sings and our rival the on lee ongs joined in combat over the weeks hundreds on both sides were killed and their houses and properties burned to the ground it was a time of torture and murder and arson in which i joined with delight then the riot squads came almost the whole police force of new york was mobilized the two underground armies were prised apart and the headquarters of the two tongs were raided and the ringleaders sent to jail i was tipped off about the raid on my own tong the hip sings a few hours before it was due i got to the safe and rifled the million dollars in gold and disappeared into harlem and went to ground i was foolish i should have left america gone to the farthest corner of the earth even from the condemned cells in sing sing the heads of my tong reached out for me they found me the killers came in the night they tortured me i would not say where the gold was they tortured me all through the night then when they could not break me they cut off my hands to show that the corpse was that of a thief and they shot me through the heart and went away but they did not know something about me i am the one man in a million who has his heart on the right side of his body those are the odds against it one in a million i lived by sheer willpower i survived the operation and the months in hospital and all the time i planned and planned how to get away with the moneyhow to keep it what to do with it doctor no paused there was a slight flush at his temples his body fidgeted inside his kimono his memories had excited him for a moment he closed his eyes composing himself bond thought now shall i leap at him and kill him break off my glass and do it with the jagged stem the eyes opened i am not boring you you are sure for an instant i felt your attention wandering no the moment had passed would there be others bond measured the inches of the leap noted that the jugular vein was in full view above the neck of the kimono the thin purple lips parted and the story went on it was mister bond a time for clear firm decisions when they let me out of the hospital i went to silberstein the greatest stamp dealer in new york i bought an envelope just one envelope full of the rarest postage stamps in the world i took weeks to get them together but i didnt mind what i paidin new york london paris zurich i wanted my gold to be mobile i invested it all in these stamps i had foreseen the world war i knew there would be inflation i knew the best would appreciate or at least hold its value and meanwhile i was changing my appearance i had all my hair taken out by the roots my thick nose made thin my mouth widened my lips sliced i could not get smaller so i made myself taller i wore built up shoes i had weeks of traction on my spine i held myself differently i put away my mechanical hands and wore hands of wax inside gloves i changed my name to julius nothe julius after my father and the no for my rejection of him and of all authority i threw away my spectacles and wore contact lensesone of the first pairs ever built then i went to milwaukee where there are no chinamen and enrolled myself in the faculty of medicine i hid myself in the academic world the world of libraries and laboratories and classrooms and campuses and there mister bond i lost myself in the study of the human body and the human mind why because i wished to know what this clay is capable of i had to learn what my tools were before i put them to use on my next goaltotal security from physical weaknesses from material dangers and from the hazards of living then mister bond from that secure base armoured even against the casual slings and arrows of the world i would proceed to the achievement of powerthe power mister bond to do unto others what had been done unto me the power of life and death the power to decide to judge the power of absolute independence from outside authority for that mister bond whether you like it or not is the essence of temporal power bond reached for the shaker and poured himself a third drink he looked at honeychile she seemed composed and indifferentas if her mind was on other things she smiled at him doctor no said benignly i expect you are both hungry pray be patient i will be brief so if you recall there i was in milwaukee in due course i completed my studies and i left america and went by easy stages round the world i called myself doctor because doctors receive confidences and they can ask questions without arousing suspicion i was looking for my headquarters it had to be safe from the coming war it had to be an island it had to be entirely private and it had to be capable of industrial development in the end i purchased crab key and here i have remained for fourteen years they have been secure and fruitful years without a cloud on the horizon i was entertained by the idea of converting bird dung into gold and i attacked the problem with passion it seemed to me the ideal industry there was a constant demand for the product the birds require no care except to be left in peace each one is a simple factory for turning fish into dung the digging of the guano is only a question of not spoiling the crop by digging too much the sole problem is the cost of the labour it was the simple cuban and jamaican labourer was earning ten shillings a week cutting cane i tempted a hundred of them over to the island by paying them twelve shillings a week with guano at fifty dollars a ton i was well placed but on one conditionthat the wages remained constant i ensured that by isolating my community from world inflation harsh methods have had to be used from time to time but the result is that my men are content with their wages because they are the highest wages they have ever known i brought in a dozen chinese negroes with their families to act as overseers they receive a pound a week per man they are tough and reliable on occasion i had to be ruthless with them but they soon learned automatically my people increased in numbers i added some engineers and some builders we set to work on the mountain occasionally i brought in teams of specialists on high wages they were kept apart from the others they lived inside the mountain until their work was done and then left by ship they put in the lighting and the ventilation and the lift they built this room stores and furnishings came in from all over the world these people built the sanatorium faзade which will cover my operations in case one day there is a shipwreck or the governor of jamaica decides to pay me a call the lips glazed into a smile you must admit that i am able if i wish to accord visitors a most fragrant receptiona wise precaution for the future and gradually methodically my fortress was built while the birds defecated on top of it it has been hard mister bond the black eyes did not look for sympathy or praise but by the end of last year the work was done a secure wellcamouflaged base had been achieved i was ready to proceed to the next stepan extension of my power to the outside world doctor no paused he lifted his arms an inch and dropped them again resignedly in his lap mister bond i said that there was not a cloud in the sky during all these fourteen years but one was there all the time below the horizon and do you know what it was it was a bird a ridiculous bird called a roseate spoonbill i will not weary you with the details mister bond you are already aware of some of the circumstances the two wardens miles away in the middle of the lake were provisioned by launch from cuba they sent out their reports by the launch occasionally ornithologists from america came by the launch and spent some days at the camp i did not mind the area is out of bounds to my men the wardens were not allowed near my compounds there was no contact from the first i made it clear to the audubon society that i would not meet their representatives and then what happens one day out of a clear sky i get a letter by the monthly boat the roseate spoonbills have become one of the bird wonders of the world the society gives me formal notification that they intend to build a hotel on their leasehold near the river up which you came bird lovers from all over the world will come to observe the birds films will be taken crab key they told me in their flattering persuasive letter would become famous mister bond the arms were raised and dropped back irony gathered at the edges of the set smile can you believe it this privacy i had achieved the plans i had for the future to be swept aside because of a lot of old women and their birds i examined the lease i wrote offering a huge sum to buy it they refused so i studied these birds i found out about their habits and suddenly the solution was there and it was easy man had always been the worst predator on these birds spoonbills are extremely shy they frighten easily i sent to florida for a marsh buggythe vehicle that is used for oil prospecting that will cover any kind of terrain i adapted it to frighten and to burnnot only birds but humans as well for the wardens would have to go too and one night in december my marsh buggy howled off across the lake it smashed the camp both wardens were reported killedthough one it turned out escaped to die in jamaicait burned the nesting places it spread terror among the birds complete success hysteria spread among the spoonbills they died in thousands but then i get a demand for a plane to land on my airstrip there was to be an investigation i decide to agree it seemed wiser an accident is arranged a lorry goes out of control down the airstrip as the plane is coming in the plane is destroyed all signs of the lorry are removed the bodies are reverently placed in coffins and i report the tragedy as i expected there is further investigation a destroyer arrives i receive the captain courteously he and his officers are brought round by sea and then led inland they are shown the remains of the camp my men suggest that the wardens went mad with loneliness and fought each other the survivor set fire to the camp and escaped in his fishing canoe the airstrip is examined my men report that the plane was coming in too fast the tyres must have burst on impact the bodies are handed over it is very sad the officers are satisfied the ship leaves peace reigns again doctor no coughed delicately he looked from bond to the girl and back again and that my friends is my storyor rather the first chapter of what i am confident will be a long and interesting tale privacy has been reestablished there are now no reseate spoonbills so there will be no wardens no doubt the audubonsociety will decide to accept my offer for the rest of their lease no matter if they start their puny operations again other misfortunes will befall them this has been a warning to me there will be no more interference interesting said bond an interesting case history so that was why strangways had to be removed what did you do with him and his girl they are at the bottom of the mona reservoir i sent three of my best men i have a small but efficient machine in jamaica i need it i have established a watch on the intelligence services in jamaica and cuba it is necessary for my further operations your mister strangways became suspicious and started ferreting about fortunately by this time the routines of this man were known to me his death and the girls were a simple matter of timing i had hoped to deal with you with similar expedition you were fortunate but i knew what type of a man you were from the files at kings house i guessed that the fly would come to the spider i was ready for you and when the canoe showed up on the radar screen i knew you would not get away bond said your radar is not very efficient there were two canoes the one you saw was the girls i tell you she had nothing to do with me then she is unfortunate i happen to be needing a white woman for a small experiment as we agreed earlier mister bond one generally gets what one wants bond looked thoughtfully at doctor no he wondered if it was worth while even trying to make a dent in this impregnable man was it worth wasting breath by threatening or bluffing bond had nothing but a miserable two of clubs up his sleeve the thought of playing it almost bored him casually indifferently he threw it down then youre out of luck doctor no you are now a file in london my thoughts on this case the evidence of the poisoned fruit and the centipede and the crashed motor car are on record so are the names of miss chung and miss taro instructions were left with someone in jamaica that my report should be opened and acted upon if i failed to return from crab key within three days bond paused the face of doctor no was impassive neither the eyes nor the mouth had flickered the jugular vein throbbed evenly bond bent forward he said softly but because of the girl and only because of her doctor no i will strike a bargain in exchange for our safe return to jamaica you may have a weeks start you may take your aeroplane and your packet of stamps and try to get away bond sat back any interest doctor no xvi horizons of agony a voice behind bond said quietly dinner is served bond swung round it was the bodyguard beside him was another man who might have been his twin they stood there two stocky barrels of muscle their hands buried in the sleeves of their kimonos and looked over bonds head at doctor no ah nine oclock already doctor no rose slowly to his feet come alone we can continue our conversation in more intimate surroundings it is kind of you both to have listened to me with such exemplary patience i hope the modesty of my cuisine and my cellar will not prove a further imposition double doors stood open in the wall behind the two whitejacketed men bond and the girl followed doctor no through into a small octagonal mahogany panelled room lit by a central chandelier in silver with storm glasses round the candles beneath it was a round mahogany table laid for three silver and glass twinkled warmly the plain dark blue carpet was luxuriously deep doctor no took the centre highbacked chair and bowed the girl into the chair on his right they sat down and unfolded napkins of white silk the hollow ceremony and the charming room maddened bond he longed to break it up with his own handsto wind his silk napkin round doctor nos throat and squeeze until the contact lenses popped out of the black damnable eyes the two guards wore white cotton gloves they served the food with a suave efficiency that was prompted by an occasional word in chinese from doctor no at first doctor no seemed preoccupied he slowly ate through three bowls of different soup feeding himself with a spoon with a short handle that fitted neatly between the pincers bond concentrated on hiding his fears from the girl he sat relaxed and ate and drank with a forced good appetite he talked cheerfully to the girl about jamaicaabout the birds and the animals and the flowers which were an easy topic for her occasionally his feet felt for hers under the table she became almost gay bond thought they were putting on sab excellent imitation of an engaged couple being given dinner by a detested uncle bond had no idea if his thin bluff had worked he didnt give much for their chances doctor no and doctor nos story exuded impregnability the incredible biography rang true not a word of it was impossible perhaps there were other people in the world with their private kingdomsaway from the beaten track where there were no witnesses where they could do what they liked and what did doctor no plan to do next after he had squashed the flies that had come to annoy him and ifwhenhe killed bond and the girl would london pick up the threads that bond had picked up probably they would there would be pleydellsmith the evidence of the poisoned fruit but where would bonds replacement get with doctor no not far doctor no would shrug his shoulders over the disappearance of bond and quarrel never heard of them and there would be no link with the girl in morgans harbour they would think she had been drowned on one of her expeditions it was hard to see what could interfere with doctor nowith the second chapter of his life whatever it was underneath his chatter with the girl bond prepared for the worst there were plenty of weapons beside his plate when the cutlets came perfectly cooked bond fiddled indecisively with the knives and chose the bread knife to eat them with while he ate and talked he edged the big steel meat knife towards him an expansive gesture of his right hand knocked over his glass of champagne and in the split second of the crash his left hand flicked the knife into the deep sleeve of his kimono in the midst of bonds apologies and the confusion as he and the bodyguard mopped up the spilled champagne bond raised his left arm and felt the knife slip back to below his armpit and then fall inside the kimono against his ribs when he had finished his cutlets he tightened the silk belt round his waist shifting the knife across his stomach the knife nestled comfortingly against his skin and gradually the steel grew warm coffee came and the meal was ended the two guards came and stood close behind bonds chair and the girls they stood with their arms crossed on their chests impassive motionless like executioners doctor no put his cup softly down on his saucer he laid his two steel claws down on the table in front of him he sat a fraction more upright he turned his body an inch in bonds direction now there was no preoccupation in his face the eyes were hard and direct the thin mouth creased and opened you have enjoyed your dinner mister bond bond took a cigarette from the silver box in front of him and lit it he played with the silver tablelighter he smelled bad news coming he must somehow pocket the lighter fire might perhaps be another weapon he said easily yes it was excellent he looked across at the girl he leant forward in his chair and rested his forearms on the table he crossed them enveloping the lighter he smiled at her i hope i ordered what you like oh yes it was lovely for her the party was still going on bond smoked busily agitating his hands and forearms to create an atmosphere of movement he turned to doctor no he stubbed out his cigarette and sat back in his chair he folded his arms across his chest the lighter was in his left armpit he smiled cheerfully and what happens now doctor no we can proceed to our afterdinner entertainment mister bond the thin smile creased and vanished i have examined your proposition from every angle i do not accept it bond shrugged his shoulders you are unwise no mister bond i suspect that your proposition is a gold brick people in your trade do not behave as you suggest they make routine reports to their headquarters they keep their chief aware of the progress of their investigations i know these things secret agents do not behave as you suggest you have done you have been reading too many novels of suspense your little speech reeked of greasepaint and cardboard no mister bond i do not accept your story if it is true i am prepared to face the consequences i have too much at stake to be turned from my path so the police come the soldiers come where are a man and a girl what man and what girl i know nothing please go away you are disturbing my guanera where is your evidence your search warrant the english law is strict gentlemen go home and leave me in peace with my beloved cormorants you see mister bond and let us even say that the worst comes to the worst that one of my agents talks which is highly improbable what have i to lose two more deaths on the charge sheet but mister bond a man can only be hanged once the tall pearshaped head shook gently from side to side have you anything else to say any questions to ask you both have a busy night ahead of you your time is getting short and i must get my sleep the monthly ship is putting in tomorrow and i have the loading to supervise i shall have to spend the whole day down on the quay well mister bond bond looked across at the girl she had gone deathly pale she was gazing at him waiting for the miracle he would work he looked down at his hands he examined his nails carefully he said playing for time and then what after your busy day with the bird dung what comes next on your programme what is the next chapter you think youre going to write bond didnt look up the deep quiet authoritative voice came to him as if it was coming down from the night sky ah yes you must have been wondering mister bond you have the habit of inquiry it persists even to the last even into the shadows i admire such qualities in a man with only a few hours to live so i will tell you i will turn over the next page it will console you there is more to this place than bird dung your instincts did not betray you doctor no paused for emphasis this island mister bond is about to be developed into the most valuable technical intelligence centre in the world really bond kept his eyes bent on his hands doubtless you know that turks island about three hundred miles from here through the windward passage is the most important centre for testing the guided missiles of the united states it is an important centre yes perhaps you have read of the rockets that have been going astray recently the multistage snark for instance that ended its flight in the forests of brazil instead of the depths of the south atlantic yes you recall that it refused to obey the telemetred instructions to change its course even to destroy itself it developed a will of its own i remember there have been other failures decisive failures from the long list of prototypesthe zuni matador petrel regulus bomarcso many names so many changes i cant even remember them all well mister bond doctor no could not keep a note of pride out of his voice it may interest you to know that the vast majority of those failures have been caused from crab key is that so you do not believe me no matter others do others who have seen the complete abandonment of one series the mastodon because of its recurring navigational errors its failure to obey the radio directions from turks island those others are the russians the russians are my partners in this venture they trained six of my men mister bond two of those men are on watch at this moment watching the radio frequencies the beams on which these weapons travel there is a million dollars worth of equipment up above us in the rock galleries mister bond sending fingers up into the heavyside layer waiting for the signals jamming them countering beams with other beams and from time to time a rocket soars up on its way a hundred five hundred miles into the atlantic and we track it as accurately as they are tracking it in the operations room on turks island then suddenly our pulses go out to the rocket its brain is confused it goes mad it plunges into the sea it destroys itself it roars off at a tangent another test has failed the operators are blamed the designers the manufacturers there is panic in the pentagon something else must be tried different frequencies different metals a different radio brain of course doctor no was fair we too have our difficulties we track many practice shoots without being able to get through to the brain of the new rocket but then we communicate urgently with moscow yes they have even given us a cipher machine with our own frequencies and routines and the russians get thinking they make suggestions we try them out and then one day mister bond it is like catching the attention of a man in a crowd up in the stratosphere the rocket acknowledges our signal we are recognized and we can speak to it and change its mind doctor no paused do you not find that interesting mister bond this little sideline to my business in guano it is i assure you most profitable it might be still more so perhaps communist china will pay more who knows i already have my feelers out bond lifted his eyes he looked thoughtfully at doctor no so he had been right there had been more much more in all this than met the eye this was a big game a game that explained everything a game that was certainly in the international espionage market well worth the candle well well now the pieces in the puzzle fell firmly into place for this it was certainly worth scaring away a few birds and wiping out a few people privacy of course doctor no would have to kill him and the girl power this was it doctor no had really got himself into business bond looked into the two black holes with a new respect he said youll have to kill a lot more people to keep this thing in your hands doctor no its worth a lot of money youve got a good property herea better one than i thought people are going to want to cut themselves a piece of this cake i wonder who will get to you first and kill you those men up there he gestured towards the ceiling who were trained in moscow theyre the technicians i wonder what moscow istelling them to do you wouldnt know that would you doctor no said you persist in underestimating me mister bond you are an obstinate man and stupider than i had expected i am aware of these possibilities i have taken one of these men and made him into a private monitor he has duplicates of the ciphers and of the cipher machine he lives in another part of the mountain the others think that he died he watches on all the routine times he gives me a second copy of all the traffic that passes so far the signals from moscow have been innocent of any sign of conspiracy i am thinking of these things constantly mister bond i take precautions and i shall take further precautions as i said you underestimate me i dont underestimate you doctor no youre a very careful man but youve got too many files open on you in my line of business the same thing applies to me i know the feeling but youve got some really bad ones the chinese one for instance i wouldnt like to have that one the fbi should be the least painfulrobbery and false identity but do you know the russians as well as i do youre a best friend at the moment but the russians dont have partners theyll want to take you overbuy you out with a bullet then theres the file youve started with my service you really want me to make that one fatter i shouldnt do it if i were you doctor no theyre a tenacious lot of people in my service if anything happens to me and the girl youll find crab keys a very small and naked little island you cannot play for high stakes without taking risks mister bond i accept the dangers and so far as i can i have equipped myself against them you see mister bond the deep voice held a hint of greed i am on the edge of still greater things the chapter two to which i referred holds the promise of prizes which no one but a fool would throw away because he was afraid i have told you that i can bend the beams on which these rockets fly mister bond i can make them change course and ignore their radio control what would you say mister bond if i could go further if i could bring them down into the sea near this island and salvage the secrets of their construction at present american destroyers far out in the south atlantic salvage these missiles when they come to the end of their fuel and parachute down into the sea sometimes the parachutes fail to open sometimes the selfdestruction devices fail to operate no one on turks island would be surprised if every now and then the prototype of a new series broke off its flight and came down near crab key to begin with at least it would be put down to mechanical failure later perhaps they would discover that other radio signals besides theirs were guiding their rockets a jamming war would start they would try and locate the origin of the false signals directly i found they were looking for me i would have one last fling their rockets would go mad they would land on havana on kingston they would turn round and home on miami even without warheads mister bond five tons of metal arriving at a thousand miles an hour can cause plenty of damage in a crowded town and then what there would be panic a public outcry the experiments would have to cease the turks island base would have to close down and how much would russia pay for that to happen mister bond and how much for each of the prototypes i captured for them shall we say ten million dollars for the whole operation twenty million it would be a priceless victory in the armaments race i could name my figure dont you agree mister bond and dont you agree that these considerations make your arguments and threats seem rather puny bond said nothing there was nothing to say suddenly he was back in the quiet room high up above regents park he could hear the rain slashing softly against the window and ms voice impatient sarcastic saying oh some damned business about birds holiday in the sunll do you good routine inquiry and he bond had taken a canoe and a fisherman and a picnic lunch and had gone offhow many days how many weeks agoto have a look well he had had his look into pandoras box he had found out the answers been told the secretsand now now he was going to be politely shown the way to his grave taking the secrets with him and the waif he had picked up and dragged along with him on his lunatic adventure the bitterness inside bond came up into his mouth so that for a moment he thought he was going to retch he reached for his champagne and emptied the glass he said harshly all right doctor no now lets get on with the cabaret whats the programmeknife bullet poison rope but make it quick ive seen enough of you doctor nos lips compressed into a thin purple line the eyes were hard as onyx under the billiardball forehead and skull the polite mask had gone the grand inquisitor sat in the highbacked chair the hour had struck for the peine forte et dure doctor no spoke a word and the two guards took a step forward and held the two victims above the elbows forcing their arms back against the sides of their chairs there was no resistance bond concentrated on holding the lighter in his armpit the whitegloved hands on his biceps felt like steel bands he smiled across at the girl im sorry about this honey im afraid were not going to be able to play together after all the girls eyes in the pale face were blueblack with fear her lips trembled she said will it hurt silence doctor nos voice was the crack of a whip enough of this foolery of course it will hurt i am interested in pain i am also interested in rinding out how much the human body can endure from time to time i make experiments on those of my people who have to be punished and on trespassers like yourselves you have both put me to a great deal of trouble in exchange i intend to put you to a great deal of pain i shall record the length of your endurance the facts will be noted one day my findings will be given to the world your deaths will have served the purposes of science i never waste human material the german experiments on live humans during the war were of great benefit to science it is a year since i put a girl to death in the fashion i have chosen for you woman she was a negress she lasted three hours she died of terror i have wanted a white girl for comparison i was not surprised when your arrival was reported i get what i want doctor no sat back in his chair his eyes were now fixed on the girl watching her reactions she stared back at him half hypnotized like a bush mouse in front of a rattlesnake bond set his teeth you are a jamaican so you will know what i am talking about this island is called crab key it is called by that name because it is infested with crabs land crabswhat they call ia jamaica black crabs you know them they weigh about a pound each and they are as big as saucers at this time of year they come up in thousands from their holes near the shore and climb up towards the mountain there in the coral uplands they go to ground again in holes in the rock and spawn their broods they march up in armies of hundreds at a time they march through everything and over everything in jamaica they go through houses that are in their path they are like the lemmings of norway it is a compulsive migra tion doctor no paused he said softly but there is a difference the crabs devour what they find in their path and at present woman they are running they are coming up the mountainside in their tens of thousands great red and orange and black waves of them scuttling and hurrying and scraping against the rock above us at this moment and tonight in the middle of their path they are going to find the naked body of a woman pegged outa banquet spread for themand they will feel the warm body with their feeding pincers and one will make the first incision with his fighting claws and then and then there was a moan from the girl her head fell forward slackly on to her chest she had fainted bonds body heaved in his chair a string of obscenities hissed out between his clenched teeth the huge hands of the guard were like fire round his arms he couldnt even move the chairlegs on the floor after a moment he desisted he waited for his voice to steady then he said with all the venom he could put into the words you bastard youll fry in hell for this doctor no smiled thinly mister bond i do not admit the existence of hell console yourself perhaps they will start at the throat or the heart the movement of the pulse will attract them then it will not be long he spoke a sentence in chinese the guard behind the girls chair leant forward and plucked her bodily out of the chair as if she had been a child and slung the inert body over his shoulder between the dangling arms the hair fell down in a golden shower the guard went to the door and opened it and went out closing it noiselessly behind him for a moment there was silence in the room bond thought only of the knife against his skin and of the lighter under his armpit how much damage could he do with the two pieces of metal could he somehow get within range of doctor no doctor no said quietly you said that power was an illusion mister bond do you change your mind my power to select this particular death for the girl is surely not an illusion however let us proceed to the method of your departure that also has its novel aspects you see mister bond i am interested in the anatomy of couragein the power of the human body to endure but how to measure human endurance how to plot a graph of the will to survive the tolerance of pain the conquest of fear i have given much thought to the problem and i believe i have solved it it is of course only a rough and ready method and i shall learn by experience as more and more subjects are put to the test i have prepared you for the experiment as best i could i gave you a sedative so that your body should be rested and i have fed you well so that you may be at full strength futurewhat shall i call thempatients will have the same advantages all will start equal in that respect after that it will be a question of the individuals courage and powers of endurance doctor no paused watching bonds face you see mister bond i have just finished constructing an obstacle race an assault course against death i will say no more about it because the element of surprise is one of the constituents of fear it is the unknown dangers that are the worst that bear most heavily on the reserves of courage and i flatter myself that the gauntlet you will run contains a rich assortment of the unexpected it will be particularly interesting mister bond that a man of your physical qualities is to be my first competitor it will be most interesting to observe how far you get down the course i have devised you should put up a worthy target figure for future runners i have high expectations of you you should go far but when as is inevitable you have finally failed at an obstacle your body will be recovered and i shall most meticulously examine the physical state of your remains the data will be recorded you will be the first dot on a graph something of an honour is it not mister bond bond said nothing what the hell did all this mean what could this test consist of would it be possible to survive it could he conceivably escape from it and get to the girl before it was too late even if it was only to kill her and save her from her torture silently bond gathered his reserves of courage steeling his mind against the fear of the unknown that already had him by the throat focusing his whole will on survival somehow above all else he must cling to his weapons doctor no rose and stepped away from his chair he walked slowly to the door and turned the menacing black holes looked back at bond from just below the lintel of the door the head was inclined a fraction the purple lips creased back run a good race for me mister bond my thoughts as they say will be with you doctor no turned away and the door closed softly behind the long thin gunmetal back xvii the long scream there was a man on the lift the doors were open waiting james bond his arms still locked to his sides was marched in now the diningroom would be empty how soon would the guards go back start clearing away the dinner notice the missing things the doors hissed shut the liftman stood in front of the buttons so that bond could not see which he had pressed they were going up bond tried to estimate the distance the lift sighed to a stop the time seemed rather less than when he had come down with the girl the doors opened on to an uncarpeted corridor with rough grey paint on the stone walls it ran about twenty yards straight ahead hold it joe said bonds guard to the liftman be right with you bond was marched down the corridor past doors numbered with letters of the alphabet there was a faint hum of machinery in the air and behind one door bond thought he could catch the crackle of radio static it sounded as if they might be in the engineroom of the mountain they came to the end door it was marked with a black q it was ajar and the guard pushed bond into the door so that it swung open through the door was a grey painted stone cell about fifteen feet square there was nothingin it except a wooden chair on which lay laundered and neatly folded bonds black canvas jeans and his blue shirt the guard let go of bonds arms bond turned and looked into the broad yellow face below the crinkly hair there was a hint of curiosity and pleasure in the liquid brown eyes the man stood holding the door handle he said well this is it bud youre at the starting gate you can either sit here and rot or find your way out on to the course happy landings bond thought it was just worth trying he glanced past the guard to where the liftman was standing beside his open doors watching them he said softly how would you like to earn ten thousand dollars guaranteed and a ticket to anywhere in the world he watched the mans face the mouth spread in a wide grin to show brownish teeth worn to uneven points by years of chewing sugarcane thanks mister id rather stay alive the man made to close the door bond whispered urgently we could get out of here together the thick lips sneered the man said shove it the door shut with a solid click bond shrugged his shoulders he gave the door a cursory glance it was made of metal and there was no handle on the inside bond didnt waste his shoulder on it he went to the chair and sat down on the neat pile of his clothes and looked round the cell the walls were entirely naked except for a ventilation grille of thick wire in one corner just below the ceiling it was wider than his shoulders it was obviously the way out into the assault course the only other break in the walls was a thick glass porthole no bigger than bonds head just above the door light from the corridor filtered through it into the cell there was nothing else it was no good wasting any more time it would now be about tenthirty outside somewhere on the slope of the mountain the girl would already be lying waiting for the rattle of claws on the grey coral bond clenched his teeth at the thought of the pale body spreadeagled out there under the stars abruptly he stood up what the hell was he doing sitting still whatever lay on the other side of the wire grille it was time to go bond took out his knife and the lighter and threw off the kimono he dressed in the trousers and shirt and stowed the lighter in his hip pocket he tried the edge of the knife with his thumb it was very sharp it would be better still if he could get a point on it he knelt on the floor and began whittling the rounded end on the stone after a precious quarter of an hour he was satisfied it was no stiletto but it would serve to stab as well as cut bond put the knife between his teeth and set the chair below the grille and climbed on to it the grille assuming he could tear it off its hinges the frame of quarterinch wire might straighten into a spear that would make a third weapon bond reached up with crooked fingers the next thing he knew was a searing pain up his arm and the crack of his head hitting the stone floor he lay stunned with only the memory of a blue flash and the hiss and crackle of electricity to tell him what had hit him bond got to his knees and stayed there he bent his head down and shook it slowly from side to side like a wounded animal he noticed a smell of burning flesh he lifted his right hand up to his eyes there was the red smear of an open burn across the inside of his fingers seeing it brought the pain bond spat out a fourletter word slowly he got to his feet he squinted up at the wire grille as if it might strike at him again like a snake grimly he set the chair upright against the wall he picked up his knife and cut a strip off the discarded kimono and tied it firmly across his fingers then he climbed up again on to the chair and looked at the grille he was meant to get through it the shock had been to soften him upa taste of pain to come surely he had fused the blasted thing surely they would have switched off the current he looked at it only for an instant then the fingers of his left hand crooked and went straight up to the impersonal wire mesh his fingers went through the wire rim and gripped nothing nothing at alljust wire bond grunted he felt his nerves slacken he tugged at the wire it gave an inch he tugged again and it came away in his hand and dangled down from two strands of copper flex that disappeared into the wall bond pulled the grille loose from the flex and gotdown from the chair yes there was a join in the frame he set to work unravelling the mesh then using the chair as a hammer he straightened the heavy wire after ten minutes bond had a crooked spear about four feet long one end where it had originally been cut by the pliers was jagged it would not pierce a mans clothes but it would be good enough for the face and neck by using all his strength and the crack at the bottom of the metal door bond turned the blunt end into a clumsy crook he measured the wire against his leg it was too long he bent it double and slipped the spear down a trouser leg now it hung from his waistband to just above the knee he went back to the chair and climbed up again and reached nervously for the edge of the ventilator shaft there was no shock bond heaved up and through the opening and lay on his stomach looking along the shaft the shaft was about four inches wider than bonds shoulders it was circular and of polished metalbond reached for his lighter blessing the inspiration that had made him take it and nicked it on yes zinc sheeting that looked new the shaft stretched straight ahead featureless except for the ridges where the sections of pipe joined bond put the lighter back in his pocket and snaked forward it was easy going cool air from the ventilating system blew strongly in bonds face the air held no smell of the seait was the canned stuff that comes from an airconditioning plant doctor no must have adapted one of the shafts to his purpose what hazards had he built into it to test out his victims they would be ingenious and painfuldesigned to reduce the resistance of the victim at the winning post so to speak there would be the coup de grвceif the victim ever got that far it would be something conclusive something from which there would be no escape for there would be no prizes in this race except oblivionan oblivion thought bond he might be glad to win unless of course doctor no had been just a bit too clever unless he had underestimated the will to survive that thought bond was his only hopeto try to survive the intervening hazards to get through at least to the last ditch there was a faint luminosity ahead bond approached it carefully his senses questing in front of him like antennae it grew brighter it was the glint of light against the end of the lateral shaft he went on until his head touched the metal he twisted over on his back straight above him at the top of fifty yards or so of vertical shaft was a steady glimmer it was like looking up a long gun barrel bond inched round the square bend and stood upright so he was supposed to climb straight up this shining tube of metal without a foothold was it possible bond expanded his shoulders yes they gripped the sides his feet could also get a temporary purchase though they would slip except where the ridges at the joints gave him an ounce of upward leverage bond shrugged his shoulders and kicked off his shoes it was no good arguing he would just have to try six inches at a time bonds body began to worm up the shaftexpand shoulders to grip the sides lift feet lock knees force the feet outwards against the metal and as the feet slipped downwards with his weight contract shoulders and raise them a few inches higher do it again and again and again and again stop at each tiny bulge where the sections joined and use the millimetre of extra support to get some breath and measure the next lap otherwise dont look up think only of the inches of metal that have to be conquered one by one dont worry about the glimmer of light that never grows brighter or nearer dont worry about losing your grip and falling to smash your ankles at the bottom of the shaft dont worry about cramp dont worry about your screaming muscles or the swelling bruises on your shoulders and the sides of your feet just take the silver inches as they come one by one and conquer them but then the feet began to sweat and slip twice bond lost a yard before his shoulders scalding with the friction could put on the brake finally he had to stop altogether to let his sweat dry in the downward draught of air he waited for a full ten minutes staring at his faint reflection in the polished metal the face split in half by the knife between the teeth still he refused to look up to see how much more there was it might be too much to bear carefully bond wiped each foot against a trouserleg and began again now half bonds mind was dreaming while the other half fought the battle he wasnt even conscious of the strengthening breeze or the slowly brightening light he saw himself as a wounded caterpillar crawling up a waste pipe towards the plughole of a bath what would he see when he got through the plughole a naked girl drying herself a man shaving sunlight streaming through an open window into an empty bathroom bonds head bumped against something the plug was in the plughole the shock of disappointment made him slip a yard before his shoulders got a fresh grip then he realized he was at the top now he noticed the bright light and the strong wind feverishly but with a more desperate care he heaved up again until his head touched the wind was coming into his left ear cautiously he turned his head it was another lateral shaft above him light was shining through a thick porthole all he had to do was inch himself round and grip the edge of the new shaft and somehow gather enough strength to heave himself in then he would be able to lie down with an extra delicacy born of panic that something might now go wrong that he might make a mistake and plummet back down the shaft to land in a crackle of bone bond his breath steaming against the metal carried out the manoeuvre and with his last ounce of strength jackknifed into the opening and crumpled full length on his face laterhow much laterbonds eyes opened and his body stirred the cold had woken him from the fringe of total unconsciousness into which his body had plunged painfully he rolled over on his back his feet and shoulders screaming at s him and lay gathering his wits and summoning more strength he had no idea what time it was or whereabouts he was inside the mountain he lifted his head and looked back at the porthole above the yawning tube out of which he had come the light was yellowish and the glass looked thick he remembered the porthole in room q there had been nothing breakable about that one nor he guessed would there be here suddenly behind the glass he saw movement as he watched a pair of eyes materialized from behind the electric light bulb they stopped and looked at him the bulb making a yellow glass nose between them they gazed incuriously at him and then they were gone bonds lips snarled back from his teeth so his progress was going to be observed reported back to doctor no bond said out loud viciously them all and turned sullenly back on his stomach he raised his head and looked forward the tunnel shimmered away into blackness come on no good hanging about he picked up his knife and put it back between his teeth and winced his way forward soon there was no more light bond stopped from time to time and used the lighter but there was nothing but blackness ahead the air began to get warmer in the shaft and perhaps fifty yards further definitely hot there was the smell of heat in the air metallic heat bond began to sweat soon his body was soaked and he had to pause every few minutes to wipe his eyes there came a righthand turn in the shaft round it the metal of the big tube was hot against his skin the smell of heat was very strong there came another rightangled turn as soon as bonds head got round he quickly pulled out his lighter and lit it and then snaked back and lay panting bitterly he examined the new hazard probing it cursing it his light had flickered on discoloured oysterhued zinc the next hazard was to be heat bond groaned aloud how could his bruised flesh stand up to thathow could he protect his skin from the metal but there wasnt anything he could do about it he could either go back or stay where he was or go on there was no other decision to make no other shift or excuse there was one and only one grain of consolation this would not be heat that would kill only maim this would not be the final killing groundonly one more test of how much he could take bond thought of the girl and of what she was going through oh well get on with it now lets see bond took his knife and cut off the whole front of his shirt and sliced it into strips the only hope was to put some wrapping round the parts of his body that would have to bear the brunthis hands and his feet his knees and elbows would have to get along with their single covering of cotton fabric wearily he set to work cursing softly now he was ready one two three bond turned the corner and forged forward into the heat stench keep your naked stomach off the ground contract your shoulders hands knees toes hands knees toes faster faster keep going fast so that each touch on the ground is quickly taken over by the next the knees were getting it worst taking the bulk of bonds weight now the padded hands were beginning to smoulder there was a spark and another one and then a worm of red as the sparks began to run the smoke from the stuff smarted in bonds sweating eyes god he couldnt do any more there was no air his lungs were bursting now his two hands shed sparks as he thrust them forward the stuff must be nearly gone then the flesh would burn bond lurched and his bruised shoulder hit the metal he screamed he went on screaming regularly with each contact of hand or knee or toes now he was finished now it was the end now he would fall flat and slowly fry to death no he must drive on screaming until his flesh was burned to the bone the skin must have already gone from the knees in a moment the balls of his hands would meet the metal only the sweat running dowrr his arms could be keeping the pads of stuff damp scream scream screamt it helps the pain it tells you youre alive go on go on it cant be much longer this isnt where youre supposed to die you are still alive dont give up you cant bonds right hand hit something that gave before it there was a stream of icecold air his other hand hit then his head there was a tinny noise bond felt the lower edge of an asbestos baffle scrape down his back he was through he heard the baffle bang shut his hands came up against solid wall they quested to left and right it was a rightangled bend his body followed blindly round the corner the cool air felt like daggers in his lungs gingerly he laid his fingers down on the metal it was cold with a groan bond fell on his face and lay still sometime later the pain revived him bond turned sluggishly over on his back vaguely he noticed the lighted porthole above him vaguely he took in the eyes gazing down on him then he let the black waves take him away again slowly in the darkness the blisters formed across the skin and the bruised feet and shoulders stiffened the sweat dried on the body and then on the rags of clothing and the cool air soaked down into the overheated lungs and began its insidious work but the heart beat on strongly and regularly inside the tortured envelope and the healing sorceries of oxygen and rest pumped life back into the arteries and veins and recharged the nerves years later bond awoke he stirred as his eyes opened and met the other pair inches away behind the glass pain took him and shook him like a rat he waited for the shock to die he tried again and then again until he had measured the strength of his adversary then bond to hide himself away from the witness turned over on his stomach and took the full blast of it again he waited exploring his body for its reactions testing the strength of the resolve that was left in the batteries how much more could he take now bonds lips drew back from his teeth and he snarled into the darkness it was an animal sound he had come to the end of his human reactions to pain and adversity doctor no had got him cornered but there were animal reserves of desperation left and in a strong animal those reserves are deep slowly agonizingly bond snaked a few yards away from the eyes and then reached for his lighter and lit it ahead there was only the black full moon the yawning circular mouth that led into the stomach of death bond put back the lighter he took a deep breath and got to his hands and knees the pain was no greater only different slowly stiffly he winced forward the cotton fabric at bonds knees and elbows had burned away numbly his mind registered the moisture as his blisters burst against the cool metal as he moved he flexed his fingers and toes testing the pain slowly he got the measure of what he could do what hurt most this pain is supportable he argued to himself if i had been in an aeroplane crash they would only diagnose superficial contusions and burns i would be out of hospital in a few days theres nothing wrong with me im a survivor from the crash it hurts but its nothing think of the bits and pieces of the other passengers be thankful put it out of your mind but nagging behind these reflections was the knowledge that he had not yet had the crashthat he was still on his way towards it his resistance his effectiveness reduced when would it come what shape would it take how much more was he to be softened up before he reached the killing ground ahead in the darkness the tiny red pinpoints might have been an hallucination specks before the eyes as a result of exhaustion bond stopped and screwed up his eyes he shook his head no they were still there slowly he snaked closer now they were moving bond stopped again he listened above the quiet thumping of his heart there was a soft delicate rustling the pinpoints had increased in number now there were twenty or thirty shifting to and fro some quickly some slowly all over the circle of blackness ahead bond reached for his lighter he held his breath as he lit the little yellow flame the red pinpoints went out instead a yard ahead of him very narrow mesh wire almost as fine as muslin blocked the shaft bond inched forward the lighter held before him it was some sort of a cage with small things living in it he could hear them scuttling back away from the light a foot away from the mesh he dowsed the light and waited for his eyes to get used to the dark as he waited listening he could hear the tiny scuttling back towards him and gradually the forest of red pinpoints gathered again peering at him through the mesh what was it bond listened to the pounding of his heart snakes scorpions centipedes carefully he brought his eyes close up to the little glowing forest he inched the lighter up beside his face and suddenly pressed the lever he caught a glimpse of tiny claws hooked through the mesh and of dozens of thick furry feet and of furry sacklike stomachs topped by big insect heads that seemed to be covered with eyes the things plopped hurriedly off the wire on to the tin and scurried back and huddled in a greybrown furry mass at the end of the cage bond squinted through the mesh moving the light back and forward then he dowsed the light to save fuel and let the breath come through his teeth in a quiet sigh they were spiders giant tarantulas three or four inches long there were twenty of them in the cage and somehow he had to get past them bond lay and rested and thought while the red eyes gathered again in front of his face how deadly were these things how much of the tales about them were myth they could certainly kill animals but how mortal to men were these giant spiders with the long soft friendly fur of a borzoi bond shuddered he remembered the centipede the touch of the tarantulas would be much softer they would be like tiny teddy bears paws against ones skinuntil they bit and emptied their poison sacs into you but again would this be doctor nos killing ground a bite or two perhapsto send one into a delirium of pain the horror of having to burst through the mesh in the darknessdoctor no would not have reckoned with bonds lighter and squash through the forest of eyes crushing some soft bodies but feeling the jaws of the others lance home and then more bites from the ones that had caught in the clothing and then the creeping agony of the poison that would have been the way doctor nos mind would have workedto send one screaming on ones way to what to the final fence but bond had the lighter and the knife and the wire spear all he needed was the nerve and infinite infinite precision bond softly opened the jaws of the lighter and pulled the wick out an inch with his thumb and fingernail to give a bigger flame he lit it and as the spiders scuttled back he pierced the thin wire mesh with his knife he made a hole near the frame and cut down sideways and round then he seized the flap of wire and wrenched it out of the frame it tore like stiff calico and came away in one piece he put the knife back between his teeth and snaked through the opening the spiders cowered before the flame of the lighter and crowded back on top of each other bond slid the wire spear out of his trousers and jabbed the blunt doubled wire into the middle of them he jabbed again and again fiercely pulping the bodies when some of the spiders tried to escape towards him he waved the light at them and smashed the fugitives one by one now the living spiders were attacking the dead and wounded and all bond had to do was bash and bash into the writhing sickening mess of blood and fur slowly all movement slackened and then ceased were they all dead were some shamming the flame of the lighter was beginning to die he would have to chance it bond reached forward and shovelled the dead mess to one side then he took his knife from between his teeth and reached out and slashed open the second curtain of wire bending the flap down over the heap of pulped bodies the light flickered and became a red glow bond gathered himself and shot his body over the bloody pile of corpses and through the jagged frame he had no idea what bits of metal he touched or whether he had put his knee or his foot among the spiders all he knew was that he had got through he heaved himself yards on along the shaft and stopped to gather his breath and his nerve above him a dim light came on bond squinted sideways and upwards knowing what he would see the slanting yellow eyes behind the thick glass looked keenly down at him slowly behind the bulb the head moved from side to side the eyelids dropped in mock pity a closed fist the thumb pointing downwards in farewell and dismissal inserted itself between the bulb and the glass then it was withdrawn the light went out bond turned his face back to the floor of the shaft and rested his forehead on the cool metal the gesture said that he was coming into the last lap that the observers had finished with him until they came for his remains it took an extra ounce of heart out of bond that there had been no gesture of praise however small that he had managed to survive so far these chigroes hated him they only wanted him to die and as miserably as possible bonds teeth ground softly together he thought of the girl and the thought gave him strength he wasnt dead yet damn it he wouldnt die not until the heart was torn from his body bond tensed his muscles it was time to go with extra care he put his weapons back in their places and painfully began to drag himself on into the blackness the shaft was beginning to slope gently downwards it made the going easier soon the slope grew steeper so that bond could almost slide along under the momentum of his weight it was a blessed relief not to have to make the effort with his muscles there was a glimmer of grey light ahead nothing more than a lessening of the darkness but it was a change the quality of the air seemed to be different there was a new fresh smell to it what was it the sea suddenly bond realized that he was slipping down the shaft he opened his shoulders and spread his feet to slow himself it hurt and the braking effect was small now the shaft was widening he could no longer get a grip he was going faster and faster a bend was just ahead and it was a bend downwards bonds body crashed into the bend and round it christ he was diving head downwards desperately bond spread his feet and hands the metal flayed his skin he was out of control diving down a gun barrel far below there was a circle of grey light the open air the sea the light was tearing up at him he fought for breath stay alive you fool stay alive head first bonds body shot out of the shaft and fell through the air slowly slowly down towards the gunmetal sea that waited for him a hundred feet below xviii killing ground bonds body shattered the mirror of the dawn sea like a bomb as he had hurtled down the silver shaft towards the widening disc of light instinct had told him to get his knife from between his teeth to get his hands forward to break his fall and to keep his head down and his body rigid and at the last fraction of a second when he glimpsed the uprushing sea he had managed to take a gulp of breath so bond hit the water in the semblance of a dive his outstretched clenched fists cleaving a hole for his skull and shoulders and though by the time he had shot twenty feet below the surface he had lost consciousness the fortymileanhour impact with the water failed to smash him slowly the body rose to the surface and lay head down softly rocking in the ripples of the dive the waterchoked lungs somehow contrived to send a last message to the brain the legs and arms thrashed clumsily the head turned up water pouring from its open mouth it sank again the legs jerked instinctively trying to get the body upright in the water this time coughing horribly the head jerked above the surface and stayed there the arms and legs began to move feebly paddling like a dog and through the red and black curtain the bloodshot eyes saw the lifeline and told the sluggish brain to make for it the killing ground was a narrow deep water inlet at the base of the towering cliff the lifeline towards which bond struggled hampered by the clumsy spear in his trouserleg was a strong wire fence stretched from the rock walls of the inlet ana caging it off from the open sea the twofeet squares of thick wire were suspended from a cable six feet above the surface and disappeared algae encrusted into the depths bond got to the wire and hung crucified for fifteen minutes he stayed like that his body occasionally racked with vomiting until he felt strong enough to turn his head and see where he was blearily his eyes took in the towering cliffs above him and the narrow vee of softly breathing water the place was in deep grey shadow cut off from the dawn by the mountain but out at sea there was the pearly iridescence of first light that meant that for the rest of the world the day was dawning here it was dark and gloomy and brooding sluggishly bonds mind puzzled over the wire fence what was its purpose closing off this dark cleft of sea was it to keep things out or keep them in bond gazed vaguely down into the black depths around him the wire strands vanished into nothingness below his clinging feet there were small fish round his legs below the waist what were they doing they seemed to be feeding darting in towards him and then backing away catching at black strands strands of what of cotton from his rags bond shook his head to clear it he looked again no they were feeding off his blood bond shivered yes blood was seeping off his body off the torn shoulders the knees the feet into the water now for the first time he felt the pain of the sea water on his sores and burns the pain revived him quickened his mind if these small fish liked it what about barracuda and shark was that what the wire fence was for to keep maneating fish from escaping to sea then why hadnt they been after him already to hell with it the first thing was to crawl up the wire afld get over to the other side to put the fence between him and whatever lived in this black aquarium weakly foothold by foothold bond climbed up the wire and over the top and down again to where he could rest well above the water he hooked the thick cable under his arms and hung a bit of washing on a line and gazed vaguely down at the fish that still fed from the blood that dripped off his feet now there was nothing much left of bond not many reserves the last dive down the tube the crash of impact and the halfdeath from drowning had squeezed him like a sponge he was on the verge of surrender on the verge of giving one small sigh and then slipping back into the soft arms of the water how beautiful it would be to give in at last and restto feel the sea softly take him to its bed and turn out the light it was the explosive flight of the fish from their feeding ground that shook bond out of his deathdreaming something had moved far below the surface there was a distant shimmer something was coming slowly up on the landward side of the fence bonds body tautened his hanging jaw slowly shut and the slackness cleared from his eyes with the electric shock of danger life flooded back into him driving out the lethargy pumping back the will to survive bond uncramped the fingers that a long time ago his brain had ordered not to lose his knife he flexed his fingers and took a fresh grip of the silverplated handle he reached down and touched the crook of the wire spear that still hung inside his trouserleg he shook his head sharply and focused his eyes now what below him the water quivered something was stirring in the depths something huge a great length of luminescent greyness showed poised far down in the darkness something snaked up from it a whiplash as thick as bonds arm the tip of the thong was swollen to a narrow oval with regular budlike markings it swirled through the water where the fish had been and was withdrawn now there was nothing but the huge grey shadow what was it doing was it was it tasting the blood as if in answer two eyes as big as footballs slowly swam up and into bonds vision they stopped twenty feet below his own and stared up through the quiet water at his face bonds skin crawled on his back softly wearily his mouth uttered one bitter fourlettered word so this was the last surprise of doctor no the end of the race bond stared down half hypnotized into the wavering pools of eye far below so this was the giant squid the mythical kraken that could pull ships beneath the waves the fiftyfootlong monster that battled with whales that weighed a ton or more what else did he know about them that they had two long seizing tentacles and ten holding ones that they had a huge blunt beak beneath eyes that were the only fishes eyes that worked on the camera principle like a mans that their brains were efficient that they could shoot backwards through the water at thirty knots by jetpropulsion that explosive harpoons burst in their jellied mantle without damaging them that but the bulging black and white targets of the eyes were rising up towards him the surface of the water shivered now bond could see the forest of tentacles that flowered out of the face of the thing they were weaving in front of the eyes like a bunch of thick snakes bond could see the dots of the suckers on their undersides behind the head the great flap of the mantle softly opened and closed and behind that the jellied sheen of the body disappeared into the depths god the thing was as big as a railway engine softly discreetly bond snaked his feet and then his arms through the squares in the wire lacing himself into them anchoring himself so that the tentacles would have either to tear him to bits or wrench down the wire barrier with him he squinted to right and left either way it was twenty yards along the wire to the land and movement even if he was capable of it would be fatal he must stay dead quiet and pray that the thing would lose interest if it didnt softly bonds fingers clenched on the puny knife the eyes watched him coldly patiently delicately like the questing trunk of an elephant one of the long seizing tentacles broke the surface and palped its way up the wire towards his leg it reached his foot bond felt the hard kiss of the suckers he didnt move he dared not reach down and lose the grip of his arms through the wire softly the suckers tugged testing the amount of yield it was not enough like a huge slimy caterpillar the tentacle walked slowly on up the leg it got to the bloody blistered kneecap and stopped there interested bonds teeth gritted with the pain he could imagine the message going back down the thick tentacle to the brain yes its good to eat and the brain signalling back then get it bring it to me the suckers walked on up the thigh the tip of the tentacle was pointed then it splayed out so that it almost covered the width of bonds thigh and then tapered off to a wrist that was bonds target he would just have to take the pain and the horror and wait for the wrist to come within range a breeze the first soft breeze of early morning whispered across the metal surface of the inlet it raised small waves that slapped gently against the sheer walls of the cliff a wedge of cormorants took off from the guanera five hundred feet above the inlet and cackling softly made out to sea as they swept over the noise that had disturbed them reached bondthe triple blast of a ships siren that means it is ready to take on cargo it came from bonds left the jetty must be round the corner from the northern arm of the inlet the tanker from antwerp had come in antwerp part of the world outsidethe world that was a million miles away out of bonds reachsurely out of his reach for ever just around that corner men would be in the galley having breakfast the radio would be playing there would be the sizzle of bacon and eggs th smell of coffee breakfast cooking the suckers were at his hip bond could see into the horny cups a stagnant sea smell reached him as the hand slowly undulated upwards how tough was the mottled greybrown jelly behind the hand should he stab no it must be a quick hard slash straight across like cutting a rope never mind about cutting into his own skin now bond took a quick glance into the two football eyes so patient so incurious as he did so the other seizing arm broke the surface and shot straight up at his face bond jerked back and the hand curled into a fist round the wire in front of his eyes in a second it would shift to an arm or shoulder and he would be finished now the first hand was on his ribs almost without taking aim bonds knifehand slashed down and across he felt the blade bite into the puddingy flesh and then the knife was almost torn from his grip as the wounded tentacle whipped back into the water for a moment the sea boiled around him now the other hand let go the wire and slapped across his stomach the pointed hand stuck like a leech all the power of the suckers furiously applied bond screamed as the suckers bit into his flesh he slashed madly again and again god his stomach was being torn out the wire shook with the struggle below him the water boiled and foamed he would have to give in one more stab this time into the back of the hand it worked the hand jerked free and snaked down and away leaving twenty red circles edged with blood across his skin bond had not time to worry about them now the head of the squid had broken the surface and the sea was being thrashed into foam by the great heaving mantle round it the eyes were glaring up at him redly venomously and the forest of feeding arms was at his feet and legs tearing the cotton fabric away and flailing back bond was being pulled down inch by inch the wire was biting into his armpits he could even feel his spine being stretched if he held on he would be torn in half now the eyes and the great triangular beak were right out of the water and the beak was reaching up for his feet there was one hope only one bond thrust his knife between his teeth and his hand dived for the crook of the wire spear he tore it out got it between his two hands and wrenched the doubled wire almost straight he would have to let go with one arm to stoop and get within range if he missed he would be torn to shreds on the fence now before he died of the pain now now bond let his whole body slip down the ladder of wire and lunged through and down with all his force he caught a glimpse of the tip of his spear lancing into the centre of a black eyeball and then the whole sea erupted up at him in a fountain of blackness and he fell and hung upside down by the knees his head an inch from the surface of the water what had happened had he gone blind he could see nothing his eyes were stinging and there was a horrible fish taste in his mouth but he could feel the wire cutting into the tendons behind his knees so he must be alive dazedly bond let go the spear from his trailing hand and reached up and felt for the nearest strand of wire he got a hold and reached up his other hand and slowly agonizingly pulled himself up so that he was sitting in the fence streaks of light came into his eyes he wiped a hand across his face now he could see he gazed at his hand it was black and sticky he looked down at his body it was covered with black slime and blackness stained the sea for twenty yards around then bond realized the wounded squid had emptied its ink sac at him but where was the squid would it come back bond searched the sea nothing nothing but the spreading stain of black not a movement not a ripple then dont wait get away from here get away quick wildly bond looked to right and left left was towards the ship but also towards doctor no but right was towards nothing to build the wire fence the men must have come from the left from the direction of the jetty there would be some sort of a path bond reached for the top cable and frantically began to edge along the swaying fence towards the rocky headland twenty yards away the stinking bleeding black scarecrow moved its arms and legs quite automatically the thinking feeling apparatus of bond was no longer part of his body it moved alongside his body or floated above it keeping enough contact to pull the strings that made the puppet work bond was like a cut worm the two halves of which continue to jerk forward although life has gone and been replaced by the mock life of nervous impulses only with bond the two halves were not yet dead life was only in abeyance in them all he needed was an ounce of hope an ounce of reassurance that it was still worth while trying to stay alive bond got to therock face slowly he let himself down to the bottom rung of wire he gazed vaguely at the softly heaving sheen of water it was black impenetrable as deep as the rest should he chance it he must he could do nothing until he had washed off the caking slime and blood the horrible stale fishsmell moodily fatalistically he took off the rags of his shirt and trousers and hung them on the wire he looked down at his brown and white body striped and pockmarked with red on an instinct he felt his pulse it was slow but regular the steady thump of life revived his spirits what the hell was he worrying about he was alive the wounds and bruises on his body were nothingabsolutely nothing they looked ugly but nothing was broken inside the torn envelope the machine was quietly solidly ticking over superficial cuts and abrasions bloody memories deathly exhaustionthese were hurts that an accident ward would sneer at get on you bastard get moving clean yourself and wake up count your blessings think of the girl think of the man youve somehow got to find and kill hang on to life like youve hung on to the knife between your teeth stop being sorry for yourself to hell with what happened just now get down into the water and wash ten minutes later bond his wet rags clinging to his scrubbed stinging body and his hair slicked back out of his eyes climbed over the top of the headland yes it was as he had guessed a narrow rocky track made by the feet of the workers led down the other side and round the bulge of the cliff from close by came various sounds and echoes a crane was working he could hear the changing beat of its engine there were iron shipnoises and the sound of water splashing into the sea from a bilge pump bond looked up at the sky it was pale blue clouds tinged with golden pink were trailing away towards the horizon far above him the cormorants were wheeling round the guanera soon they would be going off to feed perhaps even now they were watching the scout groups far out at sea locating the fish it would be about six oclock the dawn of a beautiful day bond leaving drops of blood behind him picked his way carefully down the track and along the bottom of the shadowed cliff round the bead the track filtered through a maze of giant tumbled boulders the noises grew louder bond crept softly forward watching his footholds for loose stones a voice called out startlingly close okay to go there was a distant answer okay the crane engine accelerated a few more yards one more boulder and another now bond flattened himself against the rock and warily inched his head round the corner xix a shower of death bond took one long comprehensive look and pulled back he leant against the cool face of rock and waited for his breathing to get back to normal he lifted his knife close up to his eyes and carefully examined the blade satisfied he slipped it behind him and down the waistband of his trousers up against his spine there it would be handy but protected from bitting against anything he wondered about the lighter he took it out of his hip pocket as a hunk of metal it might be useful but it wouldnt light any more and it might scrape against the rock he put it down on the ground away from his feet then bond sat down and meticulously went over the photograph that was in his brain round the corner not more than ten yards away was the crane there was no back to the cabin inside it a man sat at the controls it was the chinese negro boss the driver of the marsh buggy in front of him the jetty ran twenty yards out into the sea and ended in a t an aged tanker of around ten thousand tons deadweight was secured alongside the top of the t it stood well out of the water its deck perhaps twelve feet above the quay the tanker was called blanche and the ant of antwerp showed at her stern there was no sign of life on board except one figure lolling at the wheel in the enclosed bridge the rest of the crew would be below battened away from the guano dust from just to the right of the crane an overhead conveyorbelt in a corrugatediron housing ran out from the cliffface it was carried on high stanchions above the jetty and stopped just short of the hold of the tanker its mouth ended in a huge canvas sock perhaps six feet in diameter the purpose of the crane was to lift the wireframed mouth of the sock so that it hung directly over the hold of the tanker and to move it to right or left to give even distribution from out of the mouth of the sock in a solid downward jet the scrambledeggcoloured guano dust was pouring into the hold of the tanker at a rate of tons a minute below on the jetty to the left and to leeward of the drifting smoke of the guano dust stood the tall watchful figure of doctor no that was all the morning breeze feathered the deepwater anchorage still half in shadow beneath the towering cliffs the conveyorbelt thudded quietly on its rollers the cranes engine chuffed rhythmically there was no other sound no other movement no other life apart from the watch at the ships wheel the trusty working at the crane and doctor no seeing that all went well on the other side of the mountain men would be working feeding the guano to the conveyorbelt that rumbled away through the bowels of the rock but on this side no one was allowed and no one was necessary apart from aiming the canvas mouth of the conveyor there was nothing else for anyone to do bond sat and thought measuring distances guessing at angles remembering exactly where the crane drivers hands and feet were on the levers and the pedals slowly a thin hard smile broke across the haggard sunburned face yes it was on it could be done but softly gently slowly the prize was almost intolerably sweet bond examined the soles of his feet and his hands they would serve they would have to serve he reached back ana felt the handle of the knife shifted it an inch he stood up and took several slow deep breaths ran his hands through his saltand sweatmatted hair rubbed them harshly up and down his face and then down the tattered sides of his black jeans he gave a final flex to his fingers he was ready bond stepped up to the rock and inched an eye round nothing had changed his guess at the distances had been right the crane driver was watchful absorbed the neck above the open khaki shirt was naked offered waiting twenty yards away doctor no also with his back to bond stood sentry over the thick rich cataract of whityyellow dust on the bridge the watch was lighting a cigarette bond looked along the ten yards of path that led past the back of the crane he picked out the places he would put each foot then he came out from behind the rock and ran bond ran to the right of the crane to a point he had chosen where the lateral side of the cabin would hide him from the driver and the jetty he got there and stopped crouching listening the engine hurried on the conveyorbelt rumbled steadily out of the mountain above and behind him there was no change the two iron footholds at the back of the cabin inches away from bonds face looked solid anyway the noise of the engine would drown small sounds but he would have to be quick to yank the mans body out of the seat and get his own hands and feet on the controls the single stroke of the knife would have to be mortal bond felt along his own collarbone felt the soft triangle of skin beneath which the jugular pumped remembered the angle of approach behind the mans back reminded himself to force the blade and hold it in for a final second he listened then he reached behind his back for the knife and went up the iron steps and into the cabin with the stealth and speed of a panther at the last moment there was need to hurry bond stood behind the mans back smelling him he had time to raise his knife hand almost to the roof of the cabin time to summon every ounce of strength before he swept the blade down and into the square inch of smooth brownishyellow skin the mans hands and legs splayed away from the controls his face strained back towards bond it seemed to bond that there was a flash of recognition in the bulging eyes before the whites rolled upwards then a strangled noise came from the open mouth and the big body rolled sideways off its iron seat and crashed to the floor bonds eyes didnt even follow it ajs far as the ground he was akeady in the seat and reaching for the pedals and levers everything was out of control the engine was running in neutral the wire hawser was tearing off the drum the tip of the crane was bending slowly forwards like a giraffes neck the canvas mouth of the conveyorbelt had wilted and was now pouring its column of dust between the jetty and the ship doctor no was staring upwards his mouth was open perhaps he was shouting something coolly bond reined the machine in slowly easing the levers and pedals back to the angles at which the driver had been holding them the engine accelerated the gears bit and began to work again the hawser slowed on the spinning drum and reversed bringing the canvas mouth up and over the ship the tip of the crane lifted and stopped the scene was as before now bond reached forward for the iron wheel which the driver had been handling when bond had caught his first glimpse of him which way to turn it bond tried to the left the tip of the crane veered slightly to the right so be it bond spun the wheel to the right yes by god it was answering moving across the sky carrying the mouth of the conveyor with it bonds eyes flashed to the jetty doctor no had moved he had moved a few paces to a stanchion that bond had missed he had a telephone in his hand he was getting through to the other side of the mountain bond could see his hand frantically jiggling the receiver arm trying to attract attention bond whirled the director wheel christ wouldnt it turn any faster in seconds doctor no would get through and it would be too late slowly the tip of the crane arced across the sky now the mouth of the conveyor was spewing the dust column down over the side of the ship now the yellow mound was marching silently across the jetty five yards four three two dont look round you bastard arrh got you stop the wheel now you take it doctor no at the first brush of the stinking dust column doctor no had turned bond saw the long arms fling wide as if to embrace the thudding mass one knee rose to run the mouth opened and a thin scream came up to bond above the noise of the engine then there was a brief glimpse of a kind of dancing snowman and then only a mound of yellow bird dung that grew higher and higher god bonds voice gave back an iron echo from the walls of the cabin he thought of the screaming lungs stuffing with the filthy dust the body bending and then falling under the weight the last impotent kick of the heels the last flash of thoughtrage horror defeatand then the silence of the stinking tomb now the yellow mountain was twenty feet high the stuff was spilling off the sides of the jetty into the sea bond glanced at the ship as he did so there came three blasts on its siren the noise crashed round the cliffs there came a fourth blast which didnt stop bond could see the watch holding on to the lanyard as he craned out of the bridge window looking down bond took his hands off the controls and let them rip it was time to go he slipped off the iron seat and bent over the dead body he took the revolver out of the holster and looked at it he smiled grimlysmith wesson the regular model he slipped it down inside his waistband it was fine to feel the heavy cold metal against his skin he went to the door of the cabin and dropped down to the ground an iron ladder ran up the cliif behind the crane to where the conveyorhousing jutted out there was a small door in the corrugated iron wall of the housing bond scrambled up the ladder the door opened easily letting out a puff of guano dost and he clambered through inside the clanking of the conveyorbelt over its rollers was deafening but there were dim inspection lights in the stone ceiling of the tunnel and a narrow catwalk that stretched away into the mountain alongside the hurrying river of dust bond moved quickly along it breathing shallowly against the fishy ammoniac smell at all costs he must get to the end before the significance of the ships siren and of the unanswered telephone overcame the fear of the guards bond half ran and half stumbled through the echoing stinking tunnel how far would it be two hundred yards and then what nothing for it but to break out of the tunnel mouth and start shootingcause a panic and hope for the best he would get hold of one of the men and wring out of him where the girl was then what when he got to the place on the mountainside what would he find what would be left of her bond ran on faster his head down watching the narrow breadth of planking wondering what would happen if he missed his footing and slipped into the rushing river of guano dust would he be able to get off the belt again or would he be whirled away and down until he was finally spewed out on to the burial mound of doctor no when bonds head hit into the soft stomach and he felt the hands at his throat it was too late to think of his revolver his only reaction was to throw himself down and forward at the legs the legs gave against his shoulder and there was a shrill scream as the body crashed down on his back bond had started the heave that would hurl his attacker sideways and on to the conveyorbelt when the quality of the scream and something light and soft about the impact of the body froze his muscles it couldnt be as if in answer sharp teeth bit deeply into the calf of his right leg and an elbow jabbed viciously knowledgeably backwards into his groin bond yelled with the pain he tried to squirm sideways to protect himself but even as he shouted honey the elbow thudded into him again the breath whistled through bonds teeth with the agony there was only one way to stop her without throwing her on to the conveyorbelt he took a firm grip of one ankle and heaved himself to his knees he stood upright holding her slung over his shoulder by one leg the other foot banged against his head but halfheartedly as if she too realized that something was wrong stop it honey its me through the din of the conveyorbelt bonds shout got through to her he heard her cry james from somewhere near the floor he felt her hands clutch at his legs james james bond slowly let her down he turned and knelt and reached for her he put his arms round her and held her tightly to him oh honey honey are you all right desperately unbelieving he strained her to him yes james oh yes he felt her hands at his back and his hair oh james my darling she fell against him sobbing its all right honey bond smoothed her hair and doctor nos dead but now weve got to run for it weve got to get out of here come on how can we get out of the tunnel how did you get here weve got to hurry as if in comment the conveyorbelt stopped with a jerk bond pulled the girl to her feet she was wearing a dirty suit of workmens blue dungarees the sleeves and legs were rolled up the suit was far too big for her she looked like a girl in a mans pyjamas she was powdered white with the guano dust except where the tears had marked her cheeks she said breathlessly just up there theres a side tunnel that leads to the machine shops and the garage will they come after us there was no time to talk bond said urgently follow me and started running behind him her feet padded softly in the hollow silence they came to the fork where the side tunnel led off into the rock which way would the men come down the side tunnel or along the catwalk in the main tunnel the sound of voices booming far up the side tunnel answered him bond drew the girl a few feet up the main tunnel he brought her close to him and whispered im sorry honey im afraid im going to have to kill them of course the answering whisper was matter of fact she pressed his hand and stood back to give him room she put her hands up to her ears bond eased the gun out of his waistband softly he broke the cylinder sideways and verified with his thumb that all six chambers were loaded bond knew he wasnt going to like this killing again in cold blood but these men would be the chinese negro gangsters the strongarm guards who did the dirty work they would certainly be murderers many times over perhaps they were the ones who had killed strangways and the girl but there was no point in trying to ease his conscience it was kill or be killed he must just do it efficiently the voices were coming closer there were three men they were talking loudly nervously perhaps it was many years since they had even thought of going through the tunnel bond wondered if they would look round as they came out into the main tunnel or would he have to shoot them in the back now they were very close he could hear their shoes scuffing the ground that makes ten bucks you owe me sam not after tonight it wont be roll them bones boy roll them bones no dice for me tonight feller im goin to cut maself a slice of de white girl haw haw haw the first man came out then the second then the third they were carrying their revolvers loosely in their right hands bond said sharply no you wont the three men whirled round white teeth glinted in open mouths bond shot the rear man in the head and the second man in the stomach the front mans gun was up a bullet whistled past bond and away up the main tunnel bonds gun crashed the man clutched at his neck and spun slowly round and fell across the conveyorbelt the echoes thundered slowly up and down the tunnel a puff of fine dust rose in the air and settled two of the bodies lay still the man with the stomach shot writhed and jerked bond tucked his hot gun into the waistband of his trousers he said roughly to the girl come on he reached for her hand and pulled her after him into the mouth of the side tunnel he said sorry about that honey and started running pulling her after him by the hand she said dont be stupid then there was no sound but the thud of their naked feet on the stone floor the air was clean in the side tunnel and it was easier going but after the tension of the shooting pain began to crowd in again and take possession of bonds body he ran automatically he hardly thought of the girl his whole mind was focused on taking the pain and on the problems that waited at the end of the tunnel he couldnt tell if the shots had been heard and he had no idea what opposition was left his only plan was to shoot anyone who got in his way and somehow get to the garage and the marsh buggy that was their only hope of getting away from the mountain and down to the coast the dim yellow bulbs in the ceiling flickered by overhead still the tunnel stretched on behind him honey stumbled bond stopped cursing himself for not having thought of her she reached for him and for a moment she leaned against him panting im sorry james its just that bond held her to him he said anxiously are you hurt honey no im all right its just that im so terribly tired and my feet got rather cut on the mountain i fell a lot in the dark if we could walk a bit were nearly there and theres a door into the garage before we get to the machine shop couldnt we go in there bond hugged her to him he said thats just what im looking for honey thats our only hope of getting away if you can stick it till we get there weve got a real chance bond put his arm round her waist and took her weight he didnt trust himself to look at her feet he knew they must be bad it was no good being sorry for each other there wasnt time for it if they were to stay alive they started moving again bonds face grim with the extra effort the girls feet leaving bloody footsteps on the ground and almost immediately she whispered urgently and there was a wooden door in the wall of the tunnel and it was ajar and no sound came from the other side bond took out his gun and gently eased the door open the long garage was empty under the neon lights the black and gold painted dragon on wheels looked like a float waiting for the lord mayors show it was pointing towards the sliding doors and the hatch of the armoured cabin stood open bond prayed that the tank was full and that the mechanic had carried out his orders to get the damage fixed suddenly from somewhere outside there was the sound of voices they came nearer several of them jabbering urgently bond took the girl by the hand and ran forward there was only one place to fidein the marsh buggy the girl scrambled in bond followed softly pulling the door shut behind him they crouched waiting bond thought only three rounds left in the gun too late he remembered the rack of weapons on the wall of the garage now the voices were outside there came the clang of the door being slid back on its runners and a confusion of talk how dya know they were shootin couldnt been nuthen else i should know better take rifles here joe take that one lemmy an some pineapples box under da table there was the metallic noise of bolts being slid home and safety catches clicked some feller must a gone nuts couldnt ha been da limey you ever seen da big pusfeller in da creek cheessus an da rest of da tricks da doc fixed up in da tube an dat white gal she caint have been in much shape dis niornin any of you men bin to have a look nossir no no haw haw ise sho surprised at you fellers dats a fine piece of ass out dere on de crab walk more rattling and shuffling of feet then okay lets go two abreast till we gets to da main tunnel shoot at da legs whoevers makin trouble da docll sure want him to play wit teehee feet echoed hollowly on the concrete bond held his breath as they filed by would they notice the shut door of the buggy but they went on down the garage and into the tunnel and the noise of them slowly faded away bond touched the girls arm and put his finger to his lips softly he eased open the door and listened again nothing he dropped to the ground and walked round the buggy and went to the halfopen entrance cautiously he edged his head round there was no one in sight there was a smell of frying food in the air that brought the saliva to bonds mouth dishes and pans clattered in the nearest building about twenty yards away and from one of the further quonsets came the sound of a guitar and a mans voice singing a calypso dogs started to bark halfheartedly and then were silent the dobermann pinschers bond turned and ran back to the end of the garage no sound came from the tunnel softly bond closed the tunnel door and locked and bolted it he went to the armsrack on the wall and chose another smith wesson and a remington carbine he verified that they were loaded and went to the door of the marsh buggy and handed them in to the girl now the entrance door bond put his shoulder to it and softly eased it wide open the corrugated iron rumbled hollowly bond ran back and scrambled through the open hatch and into the drivers seat shut it honey he whispered urgently and bent and turned the ignition key the needle on the gauge swung to full pray god the damned thing would start up quickly some diesels were slow bond stamped his foot down on the starter the grinding rattle was deafening it must be audible all over the compound bond stopped and tried again the engine fluttered and died and again and this time the blessed thing fired and the strong iron pulse hammered as bond revved it up now gently into gear which one try this yes it bit brake off you bloody fool christ it had nearly stalled but now they were out and on the track and bond rammed his foot down to the floor anyone after us bond had to shout above the noise of the diesel no wait yes theres a man come out of the huts and another theyre waving and shouting at us now some more are corning out one of thems run off to the right anothers gone back into the hut hes come out with a rifle hes lying down hes firing close the slot lie down on the floor bond glanced at the speedometer twenty and they were on a slope there was nothing more to get out of the machine bond concentrated on keeping the huge bucking wheels on the track the cabin bounced and swayed on the springs it was a job to keep his hands and feet on the controls an iron fist clanged against the cabin and another what was the range four hundred good shooting but that would be the lot he shouted take a look honey open the slot an inch the mans got up hes stopped firing theyre all looking after usa whole crowd of them wait theres something else the dogs are coming theres no one with them theyre just tearing down the track after us will they catch us doesnt matter if they do come and sit by me honey hold tight mind your head against the roof bond eased up the throttle she was beside him he grinned sideways at her hell honey weve made it when we get down to the lake ill stop and shoot up the dogs if i know those brutes ive only got to kill one and the whole packll stop to eat him bond felt her hand at his neck she kept it there as they swayed and thundered down the track at the lake bond went on fifty yards into the water and turned the machine round and put it in neutral through the oblong slot he could see the pack streaming round the last bend he reached down for the rifle and pushed it through the aperture now the dogs were in the water and swimming bond kept his finger on the trigger and sprayed bullets into the middle of them one floundered kicking then another and another he could hear their snarling screams above the clatter of the engine there was blood in the water a fight had started he saw one dog leap on one of the wounded ones and sink its teeth into the back of its neck now they all seemed to have gone berserk they were milling around in the frothing bloody water bond emptied his magazine among them and dropped the gun on the floor he said thats that honey and put the machine into gear and swung it round and began rolling at an easy speed across the shallow lake towards the distant gap in the mangroves that was the mouth of the river for five minutes they moved along in silence then bond put a hand on the girls knee and said we should be all right now honey when they find the boss is dead therell be panic i guess some of the brighter ones will try and get away to cuba in the plane or the launch theyll worry about their skins not about us all the same well not take the canoe out until its dark i guess its about ten by now we should be at the coast in an hour then well rest up and try and get in shape for the trip weather looks all right and therell be a bit more moon tonight think you can make it her hand squeezed his neck of course i can james but what about you your poor body its nothing but burns and bruises and what are those red marks across your stomach tell you later ill be okay but you tell me what happened to you last night how in hell did you manage to get away from the crabs what went wrong with that bastards plan all night long i could only think of you out there being slowly eaten to death god what a thing to have dreamed up what happened the girl was actually laughing bond looked sideways the golden hair was tousled and the blue eyes were heavy with lack of sleep but otherwise she might just be coming home from a midnight barbecue that man thought he knew everything silly old fool she might have been talking about a stupid schoolteacher hes much more impressed by the black crabs than i am to begin with i dont mind any animal touching me and anyway those crabs wouldnt think of even nipping someone if they stay quite still and havent got an open sore or anything the whole point is that they dont really like meat they live mostly on plants and things if he was right and he did kill a black girl that way either she had an open wound or she must have died of fright he must have wanted to see if id stand it filthy old man i only fainted down there at dinner because i knew hed have something much worse for you well im damned i wish to heaven id known that i thought of you being picked to pieces the girl snorted of course it wasnt very nice having my clothes taken off and being tied down to pegs in the ground but those black men didnt dare touch me they just made jokes and then went away it wasnt very comfortable out there on the rock but i was thinking of you and how i could get at doctor no and kill him then i heard the crabs beginning to runthats what we call it in jamaicaand soon they came scurrying and rattling alonghundreds of them i just lay still and thought of you they walked round me and over me i might have been a rock for all they cared they tickled a bit one annoyed me by trying to pull out a bit of my hair but they dont smell or anything and i just waited for the early morning when they crawl into holes and go to sleep i got quite fond of them they were company then they got fewer and fewer and finally stopped coming and i could move i pulled at all the pegs in turn and then concentrated on my righthand one in the end i got it out of the crack in the rock and the rest was easy i got back to the buildings and began scouting about i got into the machine shop near the garage and found this filthy old suit then the conveyor thing started up not far away and i thought about it and i guessed it must be taking the guano through the mountain i knew you must be dead by then the quiet voice was matter of fact so i thought id get to the conveyor somehow and get through the mountain and kill doctor no i took a screwdriver to do it with she giggled when we ran into each other id have stuck it into you only it was in my pocket and i couldnt get to it i found the door in the back of the machine shop and walked through and into the main tunnel thats all she caressed the back of his neck i ran along watching my step and the next thing i knew was your head hitting me in the stomach she giggled again darling i hope i didnt hurt you too much when we were fighting my nanny told me always to hit men there bond laughed she did did she he reached out and caught her by the hair and pulled her face to him her mouth felt its way round his cheek and locked itself against his the machine gave a sideways lurch the kiss ended they had hit the first mangrove roots at the entrance to the river xx slavetime youre quite sure of all this the acting governors eyes were hunted resentful how could these things have been going on under his nose in one of jamaicas dependencies what would the colonial office have to say about it he already saw the long pale blue envelope marked personal for addressee only and the foolscap page with those very wide margins the secretary of state for the colonies has instructed me to express to you his surprise yes sir quite sure bond had no sympathy for the man he hadnt liked the reception he had had on his last visit to kings house nor the mean comments on strangways and the girl he liked the memory of them even less now that he knew his friend and the girl were at the bottom of the mona reservoir erwell we mustnt let any of this get out to the press you understand that ill send my report in to the secretary of state by the next bag im sure i can rely on your excuse me sir the brigadier in command of the caribbean defence force was a modern young soldier of thirtyfive his military record was good enough for him to be unimpressed by relics from the edwardian era of colonial governors whom he collectively referred to as featherhatted fuddyduddies i think we can assume that commander bond is unlikely to communicate with anyone except his department and if i may say so sir i submit that we should take steps to clear up crab key without waiting for approval from london i can provide a platoon ready to embark by this evening hms narvik came in yesterday if the programme of receptions and cocktail parties for her could possibly be deferred for fortyeight hours or so the brigadier let his sarcasm hang in the air i agree with the brigadier sir the voice of the police superintendent was edgy quick action might save him from a reprimand but it would have to be quick and in any case i shall have to proceed immediately against the various jamaicans who appear to be implicated ill have to get the divers working at mona if this case is to be cleaned up we cant afford to wait for london as misterercommander bond says most of these negro gangsters will probably be in cuba by now have to get in touch with my opposite number in havana and catch up with them before they take to the hills or go underground i think we ought to move at once sir there was silence in the cool shadowy room where the meeting was being held qn the ceiling above the massive mahogany conference table there was an unexpected dapple of sunlight bond guessed that it shone up through the slats of the jalousies from a fountain or a lily pond in the garden outside the tall windows far away there was the sound of tennis balls being knocked about distantly a young girls voice called smooth your serve gladys the governors children secretaries from one end of the room king george vi from the other end the queen looked down the table with grace and good humour what do you think colonial secretary the governors voice was hustled bond listened to the first few words he gathered that pleydellsmith agreed with the other two he stopped listening his mind drifted into a world of tennis courts and lily ponds and kings and queens of london of people being photographed with pigeons on their heads in trafalgar square of the forsythia that would soon be blazing on the bypass roundabouts of may the treasured housekeeper in his flat off the kings road getting up to brew herself a cup of tea of the first tube trains beginning to run shaking the ground beneath his cool dark bedroom of the douce weather of england the soft airs the heat waves the cold spellsthe only country where you can take a walk every day of the yearchesterfields letters and then bond thought ofcrab key of the hot ugly wind beginning to blow of the stink of the marsh gas from the mangrove swamps the jagged grey dead coral in whose holes the black crabs were now squatting the black and red eyes moving swiftly on their stalks as a shadowa cloud a birdbroke their small horizons down in the bird colony the brown and white and pink birds would be stalking in the shallows or fighting or nesting while up on the guanera the cormorants would be streaming back from their breakfast to deposit their milligramme of rent to the landlord who would no longer be collecting and where would the landlord be the men from the ss blanche would have dug him out the body would have been examined for signs of life and then put somewhere would they have washed the yellow dust off him and dressed him in his kimono while the captain radioed antwerp for instructions and where had doctor nos soul gone to had it been a bad soul or just a mad one bond thought of the burned twist down in the swamp that had been quarrel he remembered the soft ways of the big body the innocence in the grey horizonseeking eyes the simple lusts and desires the reverence for superstitions and instincts the childish faults the loyalty and even love that quarrel had given himthe warmth there was only one word for it of the man surely he hadnt gone to the same place as doctor no whatever happened to dead people there was surely one place for the warm and another for the cold and which when the time came would he bond go to the colonial secretary was mentioning bonds name bond pulled himself together survived is quite extraordinary i do think sir that we should show our gratitude to commander bond and to his service by accepting his recommendations it does seem sir that he has done at least threequarters of the job surely the least we can do is look after the other quarter the governor grunted he squinted down the table at bond the chap didnt seem to be paying much attention but one couldnt be sure with these secret service fellows dangerous chaps to have around sniffing and snooping and their damned chief carried a lot of guns in whitehall didnt do to get on the wrong side of him of course there was something to be said for sending the narvik news would leak of course all the press of the world would be coming down on his head but then suddenly the governor saw the headlines governor takes swift action islands strong man intervenes the navys there perhaps after all it would be better to do it that way even go down and see the troops off himself yes that was it by jove cargill of the gleaner was coming to lunch hed drop a hint or two to the chap and make sure the story got proper coverage yes that was it that was the way to play the hand the governor raised his hands and let them fall flat on the table in a gesture of submission he embraced the conference with a wry smile of surrender so i am overruled gentlemen well then the voice was avuncular telling the children that just this once i accept your verdict colonial secretary will you please call upon the commanding officer of hms narvik and explain the position in strict confidence of course brigadier i leave the military arrangements in your hands superintendent you will know what to do the governor rose he inclined his head regally in the direction of bond and it only remains to express my appreciation to commandererbond for his part in this affair i shall not fail to mention your assistance commander to the secretary of state outside the sun blazed down on the gravel sweep the interior of the hillman minx was a turkish bath bonds bruised hands cringed as they took the wheel pleydellsmith leant through the window he said ever heard the jamaican expression rarse no rarse man is a vulgar expression meaningerstuff it up if i may say so it would have been appropriate for you to have used the expression just now however pleydellsmith gave a wave of his hand which apologized for his chief and dismissed him is there anything else i can do for you you really think you ought to go back to beau desert they were quite definite at the hospital that they want to have you for a week thanks said bond shortly but ive got to get back see the girls all right would you tell the hospital ill be back tomorrow you got off that signal to my chief urgent rates well then bond pressed the selfstarter i guess thats the lot youll see the jamaica institute people about the girl wont you she really knows the hell of a lot about the natural history side of the island not from books either if theyve got the right sort of job like to see her settled ill take her up to new york myself and see her through the operation shed be ready to start in a couple of weeks after that incidentally bond looked embarrassed shes really the hell of a fine girl when she comes back if you and your wife you know just so theres someone to keep an eye on her pleydellsmith smiled he thought he had the picture he said dont worry about that ill see to it bettys rather a hand at that sort of thing shell like taking the girl under her wing nothing else see you later in the week anyway that hospitals the hell of a place in this heat you might care to spend a night or two with us before you go hoi mean to new york glad to have youerboth thanks and thanks for everything else bond put the car into gear and went off down the avenue of flaming tropical shrubbery he went fast scattering the gravel on the bends he wanted to get the hell away from kings house and the tennis and the kings and queens he even wanted to get the hell away from thekindly pleydellsmith bond liked the man but all he wanted now was to get back across the junction road to beau desert and away from the smooth world he swung out past the sentry at the gates and on to the main road he put his foot down the night voyage under the stars had been without incident no one had come after them the girl had done most of the sailing bond had not argued with her he had lain in the bottom of the boat totally collapsed like a dead man he had woken once or twice and listened to the slap of the sea against the hull and watched her quiet profile under the stars then the cradle of the soft swell had sent him back to sleep and to the nightmares that reached out after him from crab key he didnt mind them he didnt think he would ever mind a nightmare now after what had happened the night before it would have to be strong stuff that would ever frighten him again the crunch of a niggerhead against the hull had woken him they were coming through the reef into morgans harbour the first quarter moon was up and inside the reef the sea was a silver mirror the girl had brought the canoe through under sail they slid across the bay to the little fringe of sand and the bows under bonds head sighed softly into it she had had to help him out of the boat and across the velvet lawn and into the house he had clung to her and cursed her softly as she had cut his clothes off him and taken him into the shower she had said nothing when she had seen his battered body under the lights she had turned the water full on and taken soap and washed him down as if he had been a horse then she led him out from under the water and dabbed him softly dry with towels that were soon streaked with blood he had seen her reach for the bottle of milton he had groaned and taken hold of the washbasin and waited for it before she had begun to put it on him she had come round and kissed him on the lips she had said softly hold tight my darling and cry its going to hurt and as she splashed the murderous stuff over his body the tears of pain had run out of his eyes and down his cheeks without shame then there had been a wonderful breakfast as the dawn flared up across the bay and then the ghastly drive over to kingston to the white table of the surgery in the emergency ward pleydellsmith had been summoned no questions had been asked merthiolate had been put on the wounds and tannic ointment on the burns the efficient negro doctor had written busily in the duty report what probably just multiple burns and contusions then with promises to come into the private ward on the next day bond had gone off with pleydellsmith to kings house and to the first of the meetings that had ended with the fulldress conference bond had enciphered a short signal to m via the colonial office which he had coolly concluded with regret must again request sick leave stop surgeons report follows stop kindly inform armourer smith and wesson ineffective against flamethrower endit now as bond swung the little car down the endless sbends towards the north shore he regretted the gibe m wouldnt like it it was cheap it wasted cipher groups oh well bond swerved to avoid a thundering red bus with brownskin gal on the destination plate he had just wanted m to know that it hadnt quite been a holiday in the sun he would apologize when he sent in his written report bonds bedroom was cool and dark there was a plate of sandwiches and a thermos full of coffee beside the turneddown bed on the pillow was a sheet of paper with big childish writing it said you are staying with me tonight i cant leave my animals they were fussing and i cant leave you and you owe me slavetime i will come at seven your h in the dusk she came across the lawn to where bond was sitting finishing his third glass of bourbonontherocks she was wearing a black and white striped cotton skirt and a tight sugarpink blouse the golden hair smelled of cheap shampoo she looked incredibly fresh and beautiful she reached out her hand and bond took it and followed her up the drive and along a narrow welltrodden path through the sugar cane it wound along for quite a way through the tall whispering sweetscented jungle then there was a patch of tidy lawn up against thick broken stone walls and steps that led down to a heavy door whose edges glinted with light she looked up at him from the door dont be frightened the canes high and theyre most of them out bond didnt know what he had expected he had vaguely thought of a flat earthen floor and rather damp walls there would be a few sticks of furniture a broken bedstead covered with rags and a strong zoo smell he had been prepared to be careful about hurting her feelings instead it was rather like being inside a very large tidy cigarbox the floor and ceiling were of highly polished cedar that gave out a cigarbox smell and the walls were panelled with wide split bamboo the light came from a dozen candles in a fine silver chandelier that hung from the centre of the ceiling high up in the walls there were three square windows through which bond could see the dark blue sky and the stars there were several pieces of good nineteenthcentury furniture under the chandelier a table was laid for two with expensivelooking oldfashioned silver and glass bond said honey what a lovely room from what you said i thought you lived in a sort of zoo she laughed delightedly i got out the old silver and things its all ive got i had to spend the day polishing it ive never had it out before it does look rather nice doesnt it you see generally there are a lot of little cages up against the wall i like having them with me its company but now that youre here she paused my bedrooms in there she gestured at the other door its very small but theres room for both of us now come on im afraid its cold dinnerjust lobsters and fruit bond walked over to her he took her in his arms and kissed her hard on the lips he held her and looked down into the shining blue eyes honey youre a wonderful girl youre one of the most wonderful girls ive ever known i hope the worlds not going to change you too much dyou really want to have that operation i love your facejust as it is its part of you part of all this she frowned and freed herself youre not to be serious tonight dont talk about these things i dont want to talk about them this is my night with you please talk about love i dont want to hear about anything else promise now come on you sit there bond sat down he smiled up at her he said i promise she said heres the mayonnaise its not out of a bottle i made it myself and take some bread and butter she sat down opposite him and began to eat watching him when she saw that he seemed satisfied she said now you can start telling me about love everything about it everything you know bond looked across into the flushed golden face the eyes were bright and soft in the candlelight but with the same imperious glint they had held when he had first seen her on the beach and she had thought he had come to steal her shells the full red lips were open with excitement and impatience with him she had no inhibitions they were two loving animals it was natural she had no shame she could ask him anything and would expect him to answer it was as if they were already in bed together lovers through the tight cotton bodice the points of her breasts showed hard and roused bond said are you a virgin not quite i told you that man well bond found he couldnt eat any more his mouth waa dry at the thought of her he said honey i can either eat or talk love to you i cant do both youre going over to kingston tomorrow youll get plenty to eat there talk love bonds eyes were fierce blue slits he got up and went down on one knee beside her he picked up her hand and looked into it at the base of the thumb the mount of venus swelled luxuriously bond bent his head down into the warm soft hand and bit softly into the swelling he felt her other hand in his hair he bit harder the hand he was holding curled round his mouth she was panting he bit still harder she gave a little scream and wrenched his head away by the hair what are you doing her eyes were wide and dark she had gone pale she dropped her eyes and looked at his mouth slowly she pulled his head towards her bond put out a hand to her left breast and held it hard he lifted her captive wounded hand and put it round his neck their mouths met and clung exploring above them the candles began to dance a big hawkmoth had come in through one of the windows it whirred round the chandelier the girls closed eyes opened looked at the moth her mouth drew away she smoothed the handful of his hair back and got up and without saying anything took down the candles one by one and blew them out the moth whirred away through one of the windows the girl stood away from the table she undid her blouse and threw it on the floor then her skirt under the glint of moonlight she was a pale figure with a central shadow she came to bond and took him by the hand and lifted him up she undid his shirt and slowly carefully took it off her body close to him smelled of newmown hay and sweet pepper she led him away from the table and through a door the filtering moonlight shone down on a single bed on the bed was a sleepingbag its mouth laid open the girl let go his hand and climbed into the sleepingbag she looked up at him she said practically i bought this today its a double one it cost a lot of money take those off and come in you promised you owe me slavetime but do as youre told
