 prologue the woods echoed with war whoops and running feet troops were fully engaged in the battle peppering the fields beyond the trees with sporadic shelling the day rang with the crash of weapons and the cries of the wounded already dozens of lives had been lost and the survivors were out for blood leaves still lush and green from the dying summer formed a canopy overhead allowing only thin dusty beams of sunlight to trickle through the air was thick and humid and carried the rich scent of earth and animal in its blistering heat there was no place jared mackade was happier than in the haunted woods he was a union officer a captain he got to be captain because at twelve he was the oldest and it was his right his troops consisted of his brother devin who being ten had to be content with the rank of corporal their mission was clear annihilate the rebels because war was a serious business jared had plotted out his strategy hed chosen devin for his troops because devin could follow orders devin was also a good thinker and devin was a vicious takenoprisoners handtohand fighter rafe and shane the other mackade brothers were ferocious fighters too but they were jared knew impulsive even now they were racing through the woods whooping and hollering while jared waited patiently in ambush theyre going to separate you watch jared muttered as he and devin hunkered down in the brush rafe figures on drawing us out and clobbering us jared spit because he was twelve and spitting was cool he doesnt have a military mind shane doesnt have a mind at all devin put in with the expected disdain of brother for brother they grinned over that two young boys with disheveled black hair and handsome faces that were grimy with dirt and sweat jareds eyes a cool grassy green scanned the woods he knew every rock every stump every beaten path often he came here alone to wander or just to sit and to listen to the wind in the trees the rustle of squirrels and rabbits to the murmur of ghosts he knew others had fought here died here and it fascinated him hed grown up on the civil war battlefield of antietam maryland and he knew as any young boy would the maneuvers and mistakes the triumphs and tragedies of that fateful day in september a battle that had earned its place in history as the bloodiest day of the civil war was bound to tug at the imagination of a young boy he had combed every foot of the battlefield with his brothers played dead in bloody lane raced through his own cornfields where black powder had scorched the drying stalks so long ago he had brooded many a night over the concept of brother against brother for real and wondered what part he might have played if he had been born in time for those terrible and heroic days yet what fascinated him most was that men had given their lives for an idea often when he sat quietly with the woods around him he dreamed over the fighting for something as precious as an idea and dying proudly his mother often told him that a man needed goals and strong beliefs and pride in the seeking of them then she would laugh that deep laugh of hers tousle his hair and tell him that having pride would never be his problem he already had too much of it he wanted to be the best the faster the strongest the smartest it wasnt an easy target not with three equally determined brothers so he pushed himself studied longer fought more fiercely worked harder losing just wasnt an option for jared mackade theyre coming jared whispered devin nodded hed been listening to the crackle of twigs the rustle of brush biding his time rafes that way shane circled behind jared didnt question devins assessment his brother had instincts like a cat ill take rafe you stay here until were engaged shanell come running then you can take him out anticipation brightened jareds eyes the two brothers hands clutched in a brief salute victory or death jared caught his first sight of the faded blue shirt a blur of movement as the enemy dashed from tree to tree with the patience of a snake he waited waited then with a blood curdling cry leaped he brought rafe down in a flying tackle that had them both skittering over the rough dirt into the prickle of wild blackberries it was a good surprise attack but jared wasnt foolish enough to think that would be the end of it rafe was a vicious opponent as any kid at antietam elementary could attest he fought with a kind of fiendish enjoyment that jared understood perfectly there really was nothing better than pounding someone on a hot summer day when the threat of school was creeping closer and all the morning chores were behind you thorns tore at clothes and scratched flesh the two boys wrestled back to the path fists and elbows ramming sneakers digging in at the heels for purchase nearby a second battle was under way with curses and grunts and the satisfying crunch of bodies over aged dried leaves the mackade brothers were in heaven youre dead rebel scum jared shouted when he managed to grab rafe in a slippery headlock im taking you to hell with me bluebelly rafe shouted right back in the end they were simply too well matched and they rolled away from each other filthy breathless and laughing wiping the blood from a split lip jared turned his head to watch his troops engage the enemy it looked to him as though devin were going to have a black eye and shane had a rip in his jeans that was going to get them all in trouble he let out a long contented sigh and watched the sunlight play through the leaves going to break it up rafe asked without much interest nah casually jared wiped blood from his chin theyre almost finished im going to go into town energy still high rafe bounded up and brushed off his pants gonna get me a soda down at eds devin stopped wrestling shane and looked over got any money with a wolfish grin rafe jingled the change in his pocket maybe challenge issued he tossed the hair out of his eyes then took off at a dead run the delightful prospect of shaking quarters from rafes pockets was all the impetus devin and shane needed suddenly united they scrambled off each other and chased after him come on jare shane called over his shoulder were going to eds go on ill catch up but he lay there on his back staring at the sunlight flickering through the awning of leaves as his brothers pounding footsteps faded away he thought he could hear the sounds of the old battle the boom and crash of mortars the screams of the dead and dying then closer the ragged breathing of the lost and the frightened he closed his eyes too familiar with the ghosts of these woods to be unnerved by their company he wished hed known them could have asked them what it was like to put your life your soul at risk to love a thing an ideal a way of life so much you would give everything you were to defend it he thought he would for his family for his parents his brothers but that was different that was family one day he promised himself he would make his mark people would look at him and know that there was jared mackade a man who stood for something a man who did what had to be done and never turned his back on a fight chapter one jared wanted a cold beer he could already taste it that first long sip that would start to wash away the dregs of a lousy day in court an idiot judge and a client who was driving him slowly insane he didnt mind that she was guilty as sin had certainly been an accessory before and after the fact in the spate of petty burglaries in the west end of hagerstown he could swallow defending the guilty that was his job but he was getting damn sick and tired of having his client hit on him the woman had a very skewed view of lawyerclient relations he could only hope hed made it clear that if she grabbed his butt again she was out on hers and on her own under different circumstances he might have found it only mildly insulting even fairly amusing but he had too much on his mind and on his calendar to play games with an irritated jerk of the wrist he jammed a classical cd into his car stereo system and let mozart join him on the winding route toward home just one stop he told himself one quick stop and then a cold beer and he wouldnt even have had that one stop if this savannah morningstar had bothered to return his calls he rolled his shoulders to ease the tension and punched the gas pedal on a curve to please himself with a bit of illegal speed he drove along the familiar country road quickly barely noticing the first tender buds of spring on the trees or the faint haze of wild dogwood ready to bloom he braked for a darting rabbit passed a pickup heading toward antietam he hoped shane had supper started then remembered with an oath that it was his turn to cook the scowl suited his face with its sculptured lines the slight imperfection of a nose that had been broken twice the hard edge of thin behind shaded glasses under arching black brows his eyes were cool and sharply green though his lips were set in a line of irritation that didnt detract from the appeal of them women often looked at that mouth and wondered when it smiled and the dimple beside it winked they sighed and asked themselves how that wife of his had ever let him get away he made a commanding presence in a courtroom the broad shoulders narrow hips and tough rangy build always looked polished in a tailored suit but the elegant cover never quite masked the power beneath his black hair had just enough wave to curl appealingly at the collar of one of his starched white shirts in the courtroom he wasnt jared mackade one of the mackade brothers who had run roughshod over the south of the county from the day they were born he was jared mackade counseloratlaw he glanced up at the house on the hill just outside of town it was the old barlow place that his brother rafe had come back to town to buy he saw rafes car at the top of the steep lane and hesitated he was tempted to pull in to forget about this last little detail of the day and share that beer he wanted with rafe but he knew that if rafe wasnt working hammering or sawing or painting some part of the house that would be a bed and breakfast by fall he would be waiting for his new wife to come home it still amazed jared that the baddest of the bad mackades was a married man so he drove past took the left fork in the road that would wind him around toward the mackade farm and the small plot of land that bordered it according to his information savannah morningstar had bought the little house on the edge of the woods only two months before she lived there with her son and as the gossip mill was mostly dry where she was concerned obviously kept to herself jared figured the woman was either stupid or rude in his experience when people received a message from a lawyer they answered it though the voice on her answering machine had been low throaty and stunningly sexy he wasnt looking forward to meeting that voice facetoface this mission was a favor for a colleague and a nuisance he caught a glimpse of the little house through the trees more of a cabin really he mused though a second floor had been added several years ago he turned onto the narrow lane by the morningstar mailbox cutting his speed dramatically to negotiate the dips and holes and studied the house as he approached it was log built originally as he recalled as some city doctors vacation spot that hadnt lasted long people from the city often thought they wanted rustic until they had it the quiet setting the trees the peaceful bubbling of a creek topped off from yesterdays rain enhanced the ambience of the house with its simple lines untreated wood and uncluttered front porch the steep bank in front of it was rocky and rough and in the summer he knew tended to be covered with high tangled weeds someone had been at work here he mused and almost came to a stop the earth had been dug and turned worked to a deep brown there were still rocks but they were being used as a natural decorative landscaping someone had planted clumps of flowers among them behind them no he realized someone was planting clumps of flowers he saw the figure the movement as he rounded the crest and brought his car to a halt at the end of the lane beside a aging compact jared lifted his briefcase climbed out of the car and started over the freshly mowed swatch of grass he was very grateful for his dark glasses when savannah morningstar rose shed been kneeling amid the dirt and garden tools and flats of flowers when she moved she moved slowly inch by very impressive inch she was tall a curvy fiveten he estimated filling out a drab yellow tshirt and ripped jeans to the absolute limit of the law her legs were endless her feet were bare and her hands grimed with soil the sun glinted on hair as thick and black as his she wore it down her back in one loose braid her eyes were concealed as his were behind sunglasses but what he could see of her face was fascinating if a man could get past that truly amazing body he could spend a lot of time on that face jared mused carved cheekbones rose high and taut against skin the color of gold dust her mouth was full and unsmiling her nose straight and sharp her chin slightly pointed savannah morningstar yes thats right he recognized the voice from the answering machine hed never known a voice and a body that suited each other more perfectly im jared mackade she angled her head and the sun glanced off the amber tint of her glasses well you look like a lawyer i havent done anything lately that i need representation for im not going doortodoor soliciting clients ive left several messages on your machine i know she knelt again to finish planting a hunk of purple phlox the handy thing about machines is that you dont have to talk to people you dont want to talk to carefully she patted dirt around the shallow roots obviously i didnt want to talk to you lawyer mackade not stupid he declared just rude amused she tipped her face up to his thats right i am but since youre here you might as well tell me what youre so fired up to tell me a colleague of mine in oklahoma contacted me after he tracked you down the quick clutching in savannahs gut came and went deliberately she picked up another clump of phlox taking her time she shifted and hacked at the dirt with her hand spade i havent been in oklahoma for nearly ten years i dont remember breaking any laws before i left your father hired my colleague to locate you im not interested her flowerplanting mood was gone because she didnt want to infect the innocent blooms with the poison stirring inside her she rose again and rubbed her hands on her jeans you can tell your colleague to tell my father im not interested your fathers dead hed had no intention of telling her that way he hadnt mentioned her father or his death on the phone because he didnt have the heart to break such news over a machine jared still remembered the swift searing pain of his own fathers death and his mothers she didnt gasp or sway or sob standing straight savannah absorbed the shock and refused the grief once there had been love once there had been need and now she thought now there was nothing when seven months ago it took awhile to find you im sorry she interrupted him how a fall according to my information hed been working the rodeo circuit he took a bad fall hit his head he wasnt unconscious long and refused to go to the hospital for x rays but he contacted my colleague and gave him instructions a week later your father collapsed an embolism she listened without a word without movement in her mind savannah could see the man shed once known and loved clinging to the back of a bucking mustang one hand reaching for the sky she could see him laughing she could see him drunk she could see him murmuring endearments to an aging mare and she could see him burning with rage and shame as he turned his own daughter his only child away but she couldnt see him dead well youve told me with that she turned toward the house ms morningstar if he had heard grief in her voice he would have given her privacy but thered been nothing at all in her voice im thirsty she headed up the walkway that cut through the grass then climbed onto the porch and let the screen door slam behind her yeah jared thought fuming well so was he and he was damn well going to finish up this business and get a cold one himself he walked into the house without bothering to knock the small living room held furniture built for comfort chairs with deep sagging cushions sturdy tables that would bear the weight of resting feet the walls were a shade of umber that melded nicely with the pine of the floor there were vivid splashes of color to offset and challenge the mellow tones paintings pillows a scatter of toys over bright rugs that reminded him she had a child he stepped through into a kitchen with brilliantly white counters and the same gleaming pine floor where she stood in front of the sink scrubbing garden earth from her hands she didnt bother to speak but dried them off before she took a pitcher of lemonade from the refrigerator id like to get this over with as much as you he told her she let out a breath took her sunglasses off and tossed them on the counter wasnt his fault she reminded herself not completely anyway when you came down to it and added all the pieces together there was no one to blame you look hot she poured lemonade into a tall glass handed it to him after giving him one quick glimpse of almondshaped eyes the color of melted chocolate she turned away to get another glass thanks are you going to tell me he had debts that im obliged to settle if you are im going to tell you i have no intention of doing so the jittering in her stomach had nearly calmed so she leaned back against the counter and crossed her bare feet at the ankles ive made what ive got and i intend to keep it your father left you seven thousand eight hundred and twentyfive dollars and some change he watched the glass stop hesitate then continue to journey to her lips she drank slowly thoughtfully where did he get seven thousand dollars i have no idea but the money is currently in a passbook savings account in tulsa jared set his briefcase down on the small butcherblock table opened it you have only to show me proof of identity and sign these papers and your inheritance will be transferred to you i dont want it her first sign of emotion was the crack of glass against counter i dont want his money jared set the papers on the table its your money i said i dont want it patiently jared slipped off his own glasses and hooked them in his top pocket i understand you were estranged from your father you dont understand anything she shot back all you need to know is that i dont want the damn money so put your papers back in your fancy briefcase and get out well used to arguments jared kept his eyes and his temper level your fathers instructions were that if you were unwilling or unable to claim the inheritance it was to go to your child her eyes went molten leave my son out of this the legalities hang your legalities hes my son mine and its my choice we dont want or need the money ms morningstar you can refuse the terms of your fathers will which means the courts will get involved and complicate what should be a very simple straightforward matter hell do yourself a favor take it blow it on a weekend in reno give it to charity bury it in a tin can in the yard she forced herself to calm down not an easy matter when her emotions were up it is very simple and straightforward im not taking his money her head jerked around at the sound of the front door slamming my son she said and shot jared a lethal look dont you say anything to him about this hey mom connor and me he skidded to a halt a tall skinny boy with his mothers eyes and messy black hair crushed under a backward fielders cap he studied jared with a mix of distrust and cu riosity whos he manners ran in the family jared decided lousy ones im jared mackade a neighbor youre shanes brother the boy walked over picked up his mothers lemonade and drank it down in several noisy gulps hes cool thats where we were me and connor he told his mother over at the mackade farm this big orange cat had kittens again jared muttered this time im taking her to the vet personally and having her neutered you were with connor jared added connor dolin yeah suspicious the boy watched him over the rim of his glass his mothers a friend of mine jared said simply savannahs hand rested briefly comfortably on her sons shoulder bryan go upstairs and scrape some of the dirt off im going to start dinner okay nice to have met you bryan the boy looked surprised then flashed a quick grin yeah cool see you he looks like you jared commented yes he does her mouth softened slightly at the sound of feet clumping up the stairs im thinking about putting in soundproofing im trying to get a picture of him palling around with connor the amusement in her eyes fired into temper so quickly it fascinated him and you have a problem with that im trying to get a picture jared repeated of the live wire that just headed upstairs and the quiet painfully shy connor dolin kids as confident as your son dont usually choose boys like connor for friends temper smoothed out they just clicked bryan hasnt had a lot of opportunity to keep friends weve moved around a great deal thats changing what brought you here i was she broke off and her lips curved now youre trying to be neighborly so that ill soften up and take this little problem off your hands forget it she turned to take a package of chicken breasts out of the refrigerator seven thousand dollars is a lot of money if you put it in a college fund now it would give your son a good start when hes ready for it when and if bryans ready for college ill put him through myself i understand about pride ms morningstar thats why its easy for me to see when its misplaced she turned again and flipped her braid behind her shoulder you must be the patient bythebook polite type mr mackade the grin that beamed out at her nearly made her blink she was sure there were states where that kind of weapon was illegal dont get to town much do you jared murmured youd hear different ask connors mama about the mackades sometime ms morningstar ill leave the papers he slipped his sunglasses on again you think it over and get back to me im in the book she stayed where she was a frown on her face and a cold package of raw chicken in her hands she was still there when his cars engine roared to life and her son came darting back down the stairs quickly she snatched up the papers and pushed them into the closest drawer what was he here for bryan wanted to know how come he was wearing a suit a lot of men wear suits she would evade but she wouldnt lie not to bryan and stay out of the refrigerator im starting dinner with his hand on the door of the fridge bryan rolled his eyes im starving i cant wait for dinner savannah plucked an apple from a bowl and tossed it over her shoulder smiling to herself when she heard the solid smack of bryans catch shane said it was okay if we went by after school tomorrow and looked at the kittens some more the farms really cool mom you should see ive seen farms before yeah but this ones neat hes got two dogs fred and ethel fred and she broke off into laughter maybe i will have to see that and from the hayloft you can see clear into town connor says part of the battle was fought right there on the fields probably dead guys everywhere now that sounds really enticing and i was thinking bryan crunched into his apple tried to sound casual youd maybe want to come over and look at the kittens oh would i well yeah connor said maybe shane would give some away when they were weaned you might want one she set a lid on the chicken she was sauteing i would sure yeah for like company when im in school he smiled winningly so you wouldnt get lonely savannah shifted her weight onto her hip and studied him owlishly thats a good one bry really smooth that was what hed been counting on so can i she would have given him the world not just one small kitten sure her laughter rolled free when he launched himself into her arms with the meal over the dishes done the homework that terrified her finished and the child who was her life tucked into bed with his ball cap savannah sat on the frontporch swing and watched the woods she enjoyed the way night always deepened there first as if it had a primary claim later there might be the hoot of an owl or the rumbling low of shane mackades cattle sometimes if it was very quiet or thered been rain she could hear the bubble of creek over rocks it was too early in the spring yet for the flash and shimmer of fireflies she looked forward to them and hoped bryan wasnt yet beyond the stage where he would chase them she wanted to watch him run in his own yard in the starlight on a warm summer night when the flowers were blooming the air was thick with their perfume and the woods were a dense curtain closing them off from everyone and everything she wanted him to have a kitten to play with friends to call his own a childhood filled with moments that lasted forever a childhood that would be everything hers had never been setting the swing into motion she leaned back and drank in the absolute quiet of a country night it had taken her ten long hard years to get here on this swing on this porch in this house there wasnt a moment of it she regretted not the sacrifice the pain the worry the risk because to regret one was to regret all to regret one was to regret bryan and that was impossible she had exactly what she had strived for now and she had earned it herself despite odds brutally stacked against her she was exactly where she wanted to be who she wanted to be and no ghost from the past would spoil it for her how dare he offer her money when all shed ever wanted was his love so jim morningstar was dead the harddrinking hardliving hardheaded son of a bitch had ridden his last bronco roped his last bull now she was supposed to grieve now she was supposed to be grateful that at the end hed thought of her hed thought of the grandchild hed never wanted never even seen hed chosen his pride over his daughter and the tiny flicker of life that had been inside her now after all this time hed thought to make up for that with just under eight thousand dollars the hell with him savannah thought wearily and closed her eyes eight million couldnt make her forget and it sure as hell couldnt buy her forgiveness and no lawyer in a fancy suit with killer eyes and a silver tongue was going to change her mind jared mackade could go to hell right along with jim morningstar hed had no business coming onto her land as if he belonged there standing in her kitchen sipping lemonade talking about college funds smiling so sweetly at her boy hed had no right to aim that smile at her not so outrageously and stir up all those juices that shed deliberately let go flat and dry well she wasnt dead after all she thought with a heartfelt sigh some men seemed to have been created to stir a womans juices she didnt want to sit here on this beautiful spring night and think about how long it had been since shed held a man or been held she really didnt want to think at all but hed walked across her lawn and shaken her laboriously constructed world in less time than it took to blink her father was dead and she was very much alive lawyer mackade had made those two facts perfectly clear in one short visit however much she wanted to avoid it she was going to have to deal with both those facts eventually she would have to face jared again if she didnt seek him out she was certain hed be back he had that bull dog look about him pretty suit and tie or not so she would have to decide what to do and she would have to tell bryan he had a right to know his grandfather was dead he had a right to know about the legacy but just for tonight she wouldnt think she wouldnt worry she wouldnt wonder she wasnt aware for a long time that her cheeks were wet her shoulders were shaking the sobs were tearing at her throat curling into a ball she buried her face against her knees oh daddy chapter two jared wasnt opposed to farm work he wouldnt care to make it a living as shane did but he wasnt opposed to putting in a few hours now and again since hed put his house in town on the market and moved back home he pitched in whenever he had the time it was the kind of work you never forgot the rhythms easy to fall back into ones your muscles soon remembered the milking the feeding the plowing the sowing stripped down to a sweaty tshirt and old jeans he hauled out hay bales for the dairy stock the blackandwhite cows lumbered for the trough wide sturdy bodies bumping tails swishing the scent of them was a reminder of youth of his father most of all buck mackade had tended his cows well and had taught his boys to see them as a responsibility as well as a way of making a living for him the farm had been very simply a way of life and jared knew the same was true of shane he wondered now as he fell back into the routine of tending what his father would have thought of his oldest son the lawyer he probably would have been a little baffled by the choice of suit and tie of paper drafted and filed of appearances and appointments but jared hoped he would have been proud he needed to believe his father would have been proud but this wasnt such a bad way to spend a saturday he mused after a week of courtrooms and paperwork nearby shane whistled a mindless tune and herded the cows in to feed and looked jared realized very much as their father would have dusty jeans dusty shirt loose on a tough disciplined body worn cap over hair that needed a barbers touch what do you think of the new neighbor jared called out huh the new neighbor jared repeated and jerked a thumb in the direction of morningstar land oh you mean the goddess shane stepped away from the trough eyes dreamy i need a moment of silence he murmured and crossed his hands over his heart amused jared swiped a hand through his hair she is impressive shes built like i dont have words shane gave one of the cows an affectionate slap on the rump ive only seen her once ran into her and her kid going into the market talked to her for about two minutes drooled for the next hour how did she strike you like a bolt of lightning bro think you can keep your head out of your shorts for a minute i can try shane bent to help break up bales like a woman who can handle herself and isnt looking for company he decided good with the kid you can tell just by the way they stand together yeah i noticed that shanes interest was piqued when i was over there a couple of days ago had a little legal business oh shane wiggled his eyebrows privileged communication thats right jared hauled over another bale and nipped the twine whats the word on her there isnt much of anything from what i get she was in the frederick area saw the ad for the cabin in the paper down there then she blew into town snapped up the property put her kid in school and closed herself off on her little hill its driving mrs metz crazy i bet if mrs metz queen of the grapevine cant get any gossip on her nobody can if youre handling some legal deal for her you ought to be able to shake something loose shes not a client jared said and left it at that the boy comes around here now and again he and connor an odd pairing its nice seeing them togetner brys a pistol let me tell you hes got a million questions opinions arguments shane lifted a brow reminds me of somebody that so dad always said if there were two opinions on one subject youd have both of them the kids like that and he makes connor laugh its good to hear the boy hasnt had enough to laugh about not with a father like joe dolin shane grunted gathering up discarded twine well dolins behind bars and out of the picture shane stepped back checking over his herd and the land beyond hes not going to be beating up on cassie anymore or terrorizing those kids the divorce going to be final soon we should have a final decree within sixty days cant be soon enough i have to see to the hogs you want to get another bale out of the barn sure shane headed over to the pen prepared to mix feed at the sight of him the fat pigs began to stir and snort yeah daddys here boys and girls he talks to them all the time bryan announced from behind them they talk right back with a grin shane turned and saw that the boy wasnt alone savannah stood with one hand on her sons shoulder and an easy smile her hair was loose falling like black rain over the shoulders of a battered denim jacket shane decided the pigs could wait and leaned on the fence good morning good morning she stepped forward looked into the pen they look hungry theyre always hungry thats why we call them pigs she laughed and propped a foot on the bottom rung of the fence she was a woman used to the sight sound and smell of animals that one there certainly looks well fed he shifted closer so he could enjoy the scent of her hair shes full of piglets ill have to separate her soon spring on the farm she murmured so whos the daddy that smuglooking hog over there ah the one whos ignoring her typical still smiling she tossed back her hair were here on a mission mr mackade shane shane rumor is youve got kittens shane grinned down at bryan talked her into it huh all innocence bryan shrugged but his quick triumphant grin betrayed him she needs company when im at school thats a good one theyre in the barn ill show you no to stop him savannah put a hand on his arm there was a glint in her eyes that told him she knew exactly where his thoughts were heading we wont interrupt your work your pigs are waiting and im sure bryan knows exactly where to find the kittens sure i do come on mom he had her by the hand tugging theyre really cool shanes got all kinds of neat animals bryan told her mmhmm with a last amused glance she let herself be hauled away magnificent animals and she thought as she watched jared stride out of the barn with a bale over his shoulder here was another one now his eyes met hers held as he stopped tossed the bale down the suit had been deceiving she realized though he hadnt looked soft in it hed looked elegant there was nothing elegant about the man now he was all muscle if shed been a lesser woman her mouth might have watered instead she inclined her head and spoke coolly mr mackade ms morningstar his tone was just as cool but it took a focused effort to unknot the tension in his stomach hi bryan i didnt know you worked here bryan began ive never seen you working here now and again how come you were wearing a suit he asked shane never wears a suit not unless you knock him unconscious first when the boy grinned jared noticed a gap in his teeth that hadnt been there the day before lose something proudly bryan pressed his tongue in the gap it came out this morning its good for spitting i used to hold the record around here nine feet three inches without the wind impressed and challenged bryan worked up saliva in his mouth concentrated and let it fly jared pursed his lips nodded not bad i can do better than that youre one of the tops in your division bry savannah said dryly but mr mackade has work to do and were supposed to be looking at kittens yeah theyre right in here he took off into the barn at a run savannah followed more slowly nine feet she murmured with a glance over her shoulder and three inches you surprise me mr mackade she had a way of sauntering on those long legs he thought that gave a mans eyes a mind of their own after a quick internal debate he gave up and went in after her arent they great bryan plopped right down in the hay beside the litter of sleeping kittens and their very boredlooking mama they have to stay with her for weeks and weeks very gently he stroked a fingertip over the downy head of a smokegray kitten but then we can take one she couldnt help it savannah went soft all over oh theyre so tiny crouching down she gave in to the need and lifted one carefully into her hand look bry it fits right in my palm oh arent you sweet murmuring she nuzzled her face against the fur arent you pretty i like this one best bryan continued to stroke the tiny gray bundle im going to call him cal like for cal ripkin oh the soft orange ball in her hand stirred and mewed thinly her heart was lost all right the gray one you could take two jared stepped into the stall her face he thought was an open book its nice for them to have company two the idea burst like a thousand watts in bryans brain yeah mom well take two one would be lonely bry and it wouldnt be any more trouble weve got lots of room now cals going to want somebody to play with to hang around with thanks mackade my pleasure and anyway bryan went on because hed come out of his own excitement long enough to see the way his mother was cuddling the orange kitten this way we could each pick one thats the fair way right smiling bryan reached out to brush his finger over the orange kitten he likes you see hes trying to lick your hand hes hungry savannah told him but she knew there was no possible way she was going to be able to resist the little bundle rooting in her hand i suppose they would be company for each other all right mom bryan sprang up kissed her without any of the embarrassment many nineyearold boys might feel im going to tell shane which ones are ours with a clatter of feet bryan dashed out of the barn you know you wanted it jared said im old enough to know i cant have everything i want but she sighed and set the kitten down so that it could join its siblings in a morning snack but two cats cant be that much more trouble than one she started to rise flicking a glance upward when jared put a hand under her arm and helped her up thanks she stepped around him and headed for the light so are you a farm boy moonlighting as a lawyer or a lawyer moonlighting as a farm boy it feels like both these days i spent the last few years living in hagerstown he matched his pace to her long lazy one when i moved back a couple of months ago i had a lot of things to deal with in the city so i havent been able to give shane and devin much of a hand devin she paused outside where the sun was strong and warming quickly oh the sheriff yes bryans mentioned him he lives here too he sleeps here now and again jared said he lives in the sheriffs office fighting crime in a town with two stoplights devin takes things seriously he looked over to where bryan was dancing around shane as shane herded the cows back to pasture have you given any more thought to your fathers estate estate now thats a very serious word yes ive thought about it i have to talk to bryan at jareds cocked brow she spoke quietly were a team mr mackade he gets a vote in this we have a little league game this afternoon and i dont want to distract him from that ill have an answer for you by monday fine jareds eyes shifted from hers again narrowed the warning glint in them had savannahs lips curving let me guess your brothers looking at my butt again intrigued jared looked back at her you can tell her laugh was quick and rich honey women can always tell sometimes we let you get away with it thats all she cast a lightning grin over her shoulder winked at shane come on bryan youve got chores to finish up before the game she walked back through the woods with bryan listening to him chatter endlessly about the kittens the ball game the animals at the mackade farm he was happy was all she could think he was safe shed done a good job on her own she caught herself before she could sigh and alert her son to the troubles in her mind it was often so hard to know what was right why dont you run ahead bry get those chores done and change into your uniform i think ill sit here awhile he stopped kicked at a pebble how come you sit here so much because i like it here he studied her face looked for signs were really going to stay in this place her heart broke a little as she bent down and kissed him yes were really going to stay his grin was quick and bright cool he raced off leaving her standing alone in the path she sat on a fallen log closed her eyes and emptied her mind so much tried to intrude memories mistakes doubts she willed them away concentrating on the quiet and that place in her own head that was safe from worry it was a trick shed learned as a child when the confusion of life had been too overwhelming to face there had been long rides in a rattling pickup endless hours in smelly paddocks loud voices the gnaw of real hunger the cries of fretful babies the chill of underheated rooms they could all be faced again and again if she could just escape into herself for a few minutes decisions became clearer confidence could be rebuilt as fascinated as if hed come across some mythical creature in the woods jared watched her that exotic face was utterly peaceful her body utterly still he wouldnt have been surprised to see a butterfly or a bright bird land on her shoulder these woods had always been his his personal place his intimate place yet seeing her here didnt feel like an intrusion it seemed expected as if in some part of his mind hed known hed find her here if he just knew when to look he realized he was afraid to blink as if in that fraction of a second she might vanish never to be found again she opened her eyes slowly and looked directly into his for a moment neither of them could speak savannah felt the breath rush into her throat and stick there she was used to men staring at her they had done so even when she was a child it annoyed amused or interested her by turns but it had never left her speechless as this one long unblinking stare out of eyes the color of summer grass did he moved first stepping closer and the world started again i hate stating the obvious because he wanted to and because his knees were just a little weak he sat on the log beside her but you are staggering steadier now she inclined her head arent you supposed to be plowing a field or something shanes gotten proprietary about his tractor over the years arent you supposed to be going to a ball game its not for a couple hours savannah took a deep breath relieved that it went smoothly in and out so whos trespassing you or me technically both of us jared took out a slim cigar and found a match this is my brothers property i assumed the farm belonged to all of you it does he took a drag watched the smoke drift into the sunlight this strip here is rafes land rafe her brows shot up dont tell me there are more of you four altogether he tried to smother his surprise when she plucked the cigar out of his fingers and helped herself to a casual drag four mackades she mused its a wonder the town survived and none of the women managed to rope you in rafes married i was oh she handed him back the cigar and now youre back on the farm that right actually if i hadnt waffled id be living in your cabin is that so yep my place in towns on the market and im looking for something around here but you already had a contract on your place by the time i started looking he picked up a stick and drew in the dirt the farm he said sketching lines rafes the cabin savannah pursed her lips at the triangle hmm and the mackades would have owned a nice chunk of the mountain you missed your shot lawyer mackade so it seems ms morningstar i suppose you can call me savannah since were neighbors taking the stick from him she tapped the point of the triangle this place its the stone house you can see on the hill from the road into town thats right the old barlow place its haunted youve heard the stories no interested she looked over at him are there stories it only took him a moment to see she wasnt playing games why did you say it was haunted you can feel it she said simply just like these woods theyre restless when he continued to stare at her she smiled indian blood im part apache my father liked to claim he was fullblooded but she let words trail off looked away but theres italian mexican even a little french mixed in your mother anglo and mex she was a barrel racer rodeo champion she was in a car accident when i was five i dont remember her very clearly both of mine are gone too companionably he offered her the cigar its tough she drew in smoke this one shouldnt have been for me i lost my father ten years ago when he booted me out i was sixteen and pregnant with bryan im sorry savannah hey i got by she passed back the cigar she didnt know why shed told him except that it was quiet here and he listened well the thing is jared ive been thinking more about my father in the last day or so than i have in years you cant imagine what eight thousand dollars would have meant to me ten years ago five with a shrug she pushed back her hair hell there was a time eight dollars would have made the difference between well it doesnt matter without thinking he laid a hand over hers sure it does she frowned down at their hands then slowly casually slipped hers away and stood the thing is i have bryan to think of so ill talk this over with him let me state the obvious again youve done a terrific job raising your son she smiled weve raised each other but thanks ill be in touch savannah he rose faced her on the path this is a good town mostly a kind one no one has to be alone here unless they want to thats something else i have to think about ill see you around lawyer mackade jared hadnt been to a little league game in years when he pulled up at the park just outside of town and absorbed the scents and sounds he wondered why the single swatch of wooden stands was crowded and noisy and kids who werent on the field were running and racing behind the low chainlink fence or wrestling under the shade of the stands the concession hut drew others with the smell of steaming hot dogs and sloppy joes he pulled his car behind the long line of others along the bumpy shoulder of the narrow road and walked across the uneven grass he had an eye peeled for savannah but it was little connor dolin who caught his gaze the palehaired boy was waiting quietly in line for food staring at his feet as a couple of burly older kids harassed him hey its nerd brain dolin hows your old man like his cell connor stood stoically as they bumped and shoved him the woman ahead of him in line turned and clucked her tongue at them which had no effect at all why dont you bake him a cake with a file in it butthead bet a wussy like you bakes a real good cake hey connor jared stepped up aimed one look that had the two bullies scrambling away hows it going okay humiliation had stained his cheeks fear of abuse had dampened his palms around the money he clutched im supposed to get hot dogs and stuff mmhmm in the way of males jared knew better than to mention what hed just seen how come youre not playing ball im not any good it was said matteroffactly he was much too used to being told he wasnt any good to question it but bryans playing bryan morningstar hes the best on the team is he touched by the sudden light in those shy gray eyes jared reached out to flip up the visor of connors ball cap the boy jerked instinctively went still and reminded jared that life had not been all ball games and hot dogs for this nineyearold im looking forward to watching him jared continued as if the moment had never happened what position does he play ashamed of his own cowardice connor studied the ground again shortstop yeah i used to play short you did astonished by the idea connor just stared thats right devin played third and sheriff mackade played baseball now the astonishment was mixed with a pure case of hero worship i bet he was real good he was okay it pricked the pride just a little to remember hed never been able to outhit or outfield devin how many dogs you want connor ive got money mom gave me money and ms morningstar he fumbled with the bills im supposed to get one for her too with mustard its my treat jared held up three fingers at the vendor as bryan worried his lip and stared at his money this way i get to hang out with you and ms morningstar jared handed the boy the first hot dog watched him carefully deliberately squeeze on a line of bright yellow mustard are your mother and sister here no sir moms working and emmas with her down at the diner she said it was okay for me to come down and watch though jared added drinks to the order and packed the whole business up in a flimsy cardboard box can you handle this yes sir sure pleased to have been given the job connor walked toward the stands holding the box as if the hot dogs were explosives and the soft drinks a lit match were way up at the top cause ms morningstar says you can see everything better from up high and he could see her jared mused as they approached the stands she sat with her elbows on her knees her chin cupped in her hands and her eyes though he had to imagine as they were shielded with dark glasses focused on the field he was wrong about that she was watching him walking beside the boy flashing that killer smile or giving a quick salute whenever someone hailed him and noticing several women of varying ages who put their shoulders back or patted at their hair as he passed that was what a man who looked like that did to a woman savannah supposed made her instinctively aware of herself on a purely physical level it was like pheromones she decided the scent of sex those long legs of his carried him up the stands behind the small boy now and again his hand touched a shoulder or shook a hand savannah picked up the jacket shed set in connors place and squeezed over toward the rail nice day for a ball game jared said as he sat beside her he took the box from connor and to make room for the boy shifted closer to the woman crowded it is now thanks con mr mackade bought them connor told her and solemnly handed her back her money she started to tell him to keep it but she understood pride thanks mr mackade whats the score were down one bottom of the third she took a healthy bite of her hot dog but the top of our batting orders coming up bryan bats third connor chewed and swallowed politely before he spoke he has the most rbis jared watched the first boy come out in the bright orange uniform of the team sponsored by eds cafe have you met edwina crump jared murmured near savannahs ear not yet she owns the diner where cassandra works doesnt she yeah be grateful your boys not wearing lipstick pink savannah started to comment then let out an encouraging shout when the bat cracked the crowd hollered with her when the batter raced to first tying runs on right con yesm thats j d bristol hes a good runner she devoured her hot dog fueling her nerves while the second batter struck out swinging someone shouted abuse at the ump and several hot debates erupted in the stands apparently these games are taken as seriously as ever jared commented baseballs a serious business savannah muttered her stomach did a fast boogie as bryan stepped toward the plate now the crowd murmured thats the morningstar kid someone announced got a hot bat way that pitchers hurling hes going to need a torch nobodys getting a good piece of that ball today savannah lifted her chin and bumped the man in front of her with her knee you just watch she told him when he glanced around hell get all of it jared grinned and leaned back on the iron rail yeah a serious business she winced when bryan took a hard swing and met air ive got a buck says he knocks the tying run in i dont like to bet against your boy or the home team jared mused but mackades are betting men a buck it is savannah held her breath as bryan went through his little batters routine out of the box kicking at dirt with his left foot then his right adjusting his helmet taking two practice swings eye on the ball bry she murmured when he stepped to the plate keep your eye on the ball he did as it sailed past him and into the catchers mitt strike two what the hell kind of call is that she demanded that was low and outside anybody could see that was low and outside the man in front of her turned around nodded seriously it surely was bo perkinss got eyes like my grandma and she needs glasses to see her own opinion well somebody ought to give bo perkins a kick in the she let the words trail off remembering connor who was watching her with huge eyes strike zone she decided good save jared said under his breath and watched bryan step to the plate again the pitcher wound up delivered and bryan gave a mighty swing that caught the ball on the meat of the bat it flew above the leaping gloves of the infield and rose beautifully over the outfield grass its gone savannah shouted leaping to her feet with the rest of the crowd thats the way bry her victory dance wiggled her hips in a way that distracted jared from watching the running of the bases she kept shouting her hands cupped to carry the sound while bryan rounded the bases and stomped on home plate for the hell of it she grabbed her new friend in front of her and kissed him full on his mouth he got a piece of it didnt he the man thirty years her senior blushed like a schoolboy yes maam he sure did not exactly the shy retiring type are you jared said when she dropped back onto her seat pay up she stuck out her hand palm up jared took out a bill held it out it was worth it you aint seen nothing yet lawyer mackade jared thought about the promise of those agile curvy hips and sincerely hoped not chapter three it was probably a mistake savannah thought to be sitting across a booth at eds from jared mackade eating ice cream but hed been very persuasive and bryan and connor had been so excited when he offered to treat them to a victory sundae after the antietam cannons batted their way to a win and it did give her a chance to see him with cassandra dolin connors mother was a frail little thing savannah mused blonde and pretty as a china doll with eyes so haunted they could break your heart jared was very gentle with her very sweet coaxing smiles from her evidently the shy vulnerable type was right up his alley come on cassie have some ice cream with us i cant cassie paused by their table long enough to brush a hand over her daughters hair as little emma ate her hot fudge with tiny serious bites were swamped but i appreciate you treating the kids jared she was thin enough to blow away in a spring breeze jared thought and held up a spoonful of sundae have a bite anyway she flushed but opened her mouth as obediently as a child when he held the spoon to her lips its wonderful hey cass burgers up right there cassie hurried off to pick up the orders from the counter where edwina crump reigned supreme the owner of the diner sent jared a lusty wink the fact that she was twenty years his senior didnt stop her from appreciating a finelooking man hey big fellow dont see you in here often enough she patted her frizzed red bowling ball of a hairdo when you taking me dancing whenever you say ed she gave a chickencackle laugh wiggled her bony body got a hot band over at the legion tonight im ready and waiting she told him before she swung back into the kitchen amused savannah propped her elbows on the table the legion huh i bet it gets pretty wild youd be surprised he cocked a brow wanna go ill pass thanks bry do you think you can shovel any more into your mouth at one time he scooped up a dripping spoon of ice cream butterscotch and sprinkles its great he said around it whats yours taste like con to see for himself bryan reached over the table to dip his spoon into connors strawberrys okay he decided but butterscotch is the best willing to be wrong he eyed emmas hot fudge avariciously no savannah said mildly and watched with approval as the fiveyear old emma curled a hand protectively around her bowl she might be a quiet one savannah mused but the kid knew what was hers pack it away honey savannah told her i bet you can eat these boys under the table i like ice cream emma said with one of her rare smiles me too with a grin savannah scooped up some of her own and hot fudge is the best right uhhuh and the whipped cream miss ed gives you lots of it she put her spoon down carefully beside her empty bowl and announced i can go to regans now my mama said whats regans bryan wanted to know shes friends with my mom connor told him she has a shop just down the street it has lots of neat things to look at lets go see before he could dart from the booth savannah laid a hand on his arm bryan it took him a minute oh yeah thanks mr mackade the ice cream was great come on con thanks mr mackade since emma already had his hand and was tugging on it connor slid from the booth he looked down at his sister wrinkled his brow thank you she said keeping an iron grip on her brothers hand youre welcome say hi to regan we will mama connor called out were going down to regans dont touch anything cassie told them balancing two plates on one arm and serving another and come right back if shes busy yesm bryan was already out of the door and connor followed hampered by his sisters sedate pace id say you hit a home run savannah commented leaning back to drape an arm over the back of the booth you hit one yourself thats one of the longest conversations ive ever heard out of emma it must be hard being shy she looks like an angel like her mother angels whod already been through hell jared thought cassies doing a terrific job with them on her own youd appreciate that yes i would savannah glanced over to where cassie was busy wiping down a booth youre close ive known her most of my life but no not the way you mean shes a friend pleased she was interested enough to ask he took out a cigar and a client anything beyond friendship wouldnt be ethical when im representing her and youd be a very ethical man wouldnt you lawyer mackade thats right you know youve never mentioned what you do about what about making a living ive done all sorts of things with a sizzling look she took the cigar from him ill just bet you have he murmured right now im an illustrator kids books mostly laughing she passed the cigar back to him doesnt quite fit the image does it i dont know id have to see some of your illustrations he glanced up and his lips curved hey dev savannah shifted to see the man who had just come in he had the same dark gotohell looks as jared a body that was tall and tough and rangy the eyes were green as well but they were different she recognized the way they swept the room checked for details looked for trouble instinctively her muscles tightened her face went blank she didnt need the badge on his chest to tell her this was the sheriff she could spot a cop at half a mile on a speeding horse she could smell one at twenty paces saw your car after one quick scan of the room one quick smile for cassie devin dropped into the booth beside his brother savannah morningstar devin mackade nice to meet you an eyeful was devins first impression then he caught the chill and wondered about it you bought the cabin the doctors place thats right its my place now not just a chill he mused ice was forming that must be your kid ive run into out at the farm bryan right yes bryans my son hes well fed hes in school and hes had his shots excuse me id better go see what the kids are up to and straight into frostbite devin mused as she slid from the booth he winced as the door swung to behind her ouch what the hell was that about i dont know jared murmured but im going to find out he pulled bills out of his pocket you want a guess devin made way so that jared could climb out of the booth the ladys had trouble with the law damn damn damn on the sidewalk savannah struggled to regain her composure that had been stupid she berated herself that had been foolish the trouble with letting yourself relax she reminded herself was that all sorts of nasty things could sneak up and bite you in the back now that she was outside her fists jammed into the snug pockets of her jeans she realized that she didnt know what this regans shop was much less where it was all she wanted was to get her son and take him home you want to tell me what just happened jared stepped up behind her touched a hand to her shoulder savannah made herself take a careful breath before turning i finished my ice cream then maybe you should walk it off he twined his fingers around her arm and had them quickly and fiercely shaken off dont take hold of me unless i ask you he felt the mackade temper stir and clamped down on it fine why dont you tell me why you were rude im often rude she shot back especially to cops i dont like cops theyre one step down from lawyers im not interested in socializing with either one which way are the kids it seems to me we were just socializing up a storm now were not go back and talk law and order with your brother the old fury the old fears wouldnt quite let go you can tell him to go ahead and run a make on me im clean i have valid employment and money in the bank good for you jared said equably why should devin run a make on you because cops and lawyers love to stick their noses in other peoples business thats what youve been doing with me ever since you drove up my lane the way i live and the way i raise my son are my concern and nobody elses so back off it was fascinating even through his own bubbling temper it was fascinating to watch her simmer and spew i havent gotten in your way yet savannah youll know when i do believe me youll know right now im just asking for an explanation she didnt know how he did it how he could look searing daggers at her and still speak in that controlled reasonable voice she hated people who could manage that youve just got the only one im giving now wheres my son jared kept his eyes on hers past times two doors behind you but when she started to whirl away he took her arm again i told you not to you listen to me youre not going to charge in there like some firebreathing amazon the heat in her eyes could have boiled the skin off a man youd better take your hand off me before i damage that pretty face of yours he only tightened his grip under different circumstances he might have enjoyed seeing her try there are two abused kids in that shop he began and watched her face change fury to surprise surprise to painful sympathy connor and emma i should have seen it her gaze darted to the wide glass window of eds cassandra those kids watched their mother get beaten by their father and thats more violence in those two short lives than anyone deserves you go storming in there youll i dont make a habit of frightening children savannah snapped back whatever you bythebook types think im a good mother bryans never done without hes had the best i could give him and she shut her eyes and fought back the rage jared thought it was like watching a volcano capping itself let go of my arm she said calmly now im going to take my son home jared studied her face another moment saw the licks of temper just behind the molten brown of her eyes he released her watched her walk to regans shop take one more calming breath before pulling open the door and going inside devin strolled out he stopped beside jared and scratched his head that was quite an interesting show i have a feeling it was just the overture intrigued jared tucked his hands in his pockets rocked back on his heels theres a lot going on in there a woman like that could make a man forget his own name with a faint smile devin looked over at his brother you remember yours yeah just barely i think you were right about her having problems with the law devins eyes narrowed the law the town and everyone in it were his responsibility i could run a make on her no dont do that its just what she expects thoughtfully jared turned toward his car ive got an urge to give the lady the unexpected well see what happens your call devin murmured as jared climbed behind the wheel your call he thought again as long as the lady stays out of trouble bryan stared out the car window his face averted coolly from his mothers he didnt see why connor couldnt spend the night it was still saturday and there were hours and hours left until the dumb bell rang for school on lousy monday what was a guy supposed to do with all those hours without his best bud chores he thought rolling his dark brown eyes homework might as well be in jail might as well be in jail he said aloud turning his face now in challenge yeah they play a lot of baseball eat a lot of butterscotch sundaes in the joint but ive got nothing to do at home he said the desperate lament of every nineyearold ill give you something to do savannah shot back the typical response of every frustrated parent and when she heard that come out of her mouth she nearly groaned im sorry bry ive got a lot on my mind and its just not a good night for a sleepover i couldve stayed at cons his mother wouldnt care direct hit she thought grimly as she turned up the lane well yours does ace and youre stuck with me you can start by taking out the trash you didnt take out this morning cleaning that black hole that passes as your room then studying your math so you dont end up in summer school great the minute she stopped the car he slammed out he muttered another comment about it being worse than jail that had smoke coming out of her ears bryan morningstar his name lashed out when he pivoted back they stood glaring at each other angry color riding high on each set of cheekbones eyes almost black with passionate temper why the hell are you so much like me she demanded she threw her face up to the sun i could have had a nice quiet wellmannered little girl if id tried really hard why did i think id like having some snotty badtempered boy with big feet it made his lips twitch because then youd have to take out the trash yourself a girl would whine and say it was too messy i could take the trash out she said consideringly in fact i think i will after i put you in it she made a grab but he danced back laughing at her youre too old to catch me oh yeah she streaked forward pounded up the bank after him he stood hooting at her taunting which was his mistake she snagged him making the catch more from her advantage of reach and experience than from speed and tumbled with him to the grass whos old smart mouth you are he shrieked with laughter as her fingers dug mercilessly into his ribs youre almost thirty i am not take it back she whipped him into a headlock rubbed her knuckles over his hair take it back and do the math einstein whats twentysix from thirty nothing he shouted zero then fearing he might wet his pants if she kept tickling he surrendered its four okay its four remember that and remember who can still take you down she pulled him back against her hugged him so suddenly so fiercely he blinked i love you bryan i love you so much jeez mom he wriggled in mortification i know im sorry i snapped at you he rolled his eyes but trickles of remorse found their way through the embarrassment i guess im sorry too you and connor can have a sleepover next weekend i promise okay thats cool when she didnt release him he frowned but it wasnt so bad letting her hold him since none of the guys were around to see she smelled nice and her arms were soft there were flickers of memory of being rocked and soothed he was simply too young to do anything but take them for granted shed always been there she always would he let his head rest on her shoulder and didnt feel like squirming when she stroked his hair could we maybe cook out on the grill later sure want superburgers yeah and french fries whats a superburger without fries she murmured then sighed bryan has con said anything to you about his father she felt her son go still and pressed a light kiss to his hair is it a secret sort of i dont want you to betray a confidence i found out today that connors father used to hit his mother i thought if con had talked to you about it you might want to talk to me hed wanted to ever since connor had told him but connor had cried some even though bryan had pretended not to notice and a guy just didnt tell his mother things like that cons said hes in jail for hitting her con said he used to hurt her real bad and he drank a lot and gave her bruises and everything theyre getting divorced i see shed seen plenty of men who were joe dolins type in her life but that didnt stop her from despising them did he hit con too and emma not emma here was another dicey part but bryan heard himself blurting it out before he could stop but he hit con not when his mom was around and could see hed call him names and shove him he said con was a sissy cause he liked to read books and write stories cons no sissy of course hes not hes just real smart he doesnt hardly have to study to get the answers right but he doesnt raise his hand in class very much the teacher calls on him anyway as he stared off into the woods bryans face darkened with rage some of the kids give him a hard time about things about his father and how hes teachers pet and how he cant throw a baseball very far but they back off when im around savannah closed her eyes laid on cheek on bryans head youre quite a guy hell heck he corrected himself quickly bullies are just wimps underneath right right cons not the only ones whos smart she let out a sigh bryan i need to talk to you do you remember the other day when you came home and mr mackade was here sure hes a lawyer and he came here on business are we in trouble no she turned him so that they were facetoface were not in trouble were fine he came about my father died bryan oh he felt nothing but mild surprise himself hed never met his grandfather knew of him only because his mother had explained that jim morningstar was a rodeo rider who moved around a lot i guess he was pretty old yeah fifty she wondered sixty she didnt have a clue i never really explained things to you exactly your grandfather and i had a fight a long time ago and i left home how could she tell this child her beautiful child that hed been the cause of it no that she wouldnt do that she would never do anyway i left and we sort of lost touch how did mr mackade know he was dead did he know him no its a lawyer thing your grandfather got hurt and it started him thinking i guess he hired this lawyer out in oklahoma to find us and the lawyer called mr mackade it all took awhile then mr mackade came out to tell me and to let me know that your grandfather left some money wow really its about seven thousand dollars bryan finished for her eyes popping it was all the money in the world enough for a new bike a new mitt the cal ripkin rookie baseball card he lusted for we get to keep it just like that i have to sign some papers the dollar signs faded from his eyes long enough for bryan to read his mothers face how come you dont want it i oh bryan defeated she curled up her legs and rested her brow on them i dont know how to explain it to you ive been so mad at him all these years now im mad at him for waiting until he was dead bryan patted her head and thought it over is it like him saying hes sorry and if you take it youd be saying you were sorry too she let out a half laugh at the simplicity of it why couldnt i have thought of that wearily she lifted her head studied his face you think we should take it i guess we dont need to he watched cal ripkin fly gracefully away i mean youve got your job and weve got a house now no she murmured we dont need to she felt the weight slip from her shoulders they didnt need to and that was exactly why they could ill go see mr mackade on monday and tell him to put the money through cool bryan leaped to his feet im going to call con and tell him were rich no he skidded to a halt but mom no bragging about money is very uncool and i might as well break it to you now ace it doesnt make us rich and im dumping it into a college fund his mouth dropped open nearly scraping his shoes college thats a hundred years away maybe i wont even go thatll be up to you but the moneyll be there oh man at nine bryan was experiencing the pain of a fortune won and lost all of it all his shattered face changed her mind in midstep except some you can have one thing itll be like a present from your grandfather hope bloomed one anything one any reasonable thing a goldplated corvette slides over to the unreasonable side he let out a whoop leaped over to hug her ive gotta go look up something in my baseballcard price guide she watched him go full steam catapulting onto the porch streaking into the house with the screen door slamming like a gunshot behind him later while she grilled burgers on the porch with bryan curled up with his price guide and dreams of glory jared sat on the other side of the haunted woods and thought of her he was tempted very tempted to stride through those woods and finish the altercation she had started that afternoon out on the sidewalk in front of eds prickly women werent his style jared reminded himself and set the chair rocking prickly women with lightning tempers and murky pasts were even less so not that she wasnt interesting and not that he didnt like fitting puzzle pieces together but his life was cruising along at a very comfortable pace at the moment he would have enjoyed her companionship on a purely superficial level of course a few dates leading to physical contact after all a dead man would fantasize about rolling around with a woman who looked like that and jared mackade wasnt dead he also wasnt stupid the woman whod blasted him that afternoon was nothing but trouble the last thing one hot temper needed was to crash up against another that was why he preferred his women cool composed and reasonable like his exwife he thought with a grimace shed been so cool there were times he wanted to hold a mirror in front of her mouth to see if she was still breathing but that was another story first thing monday morning he was going to draft a nice formal letter advising savannah morningstar of her inheritance and the steps she was required to take to accept or decline it he didnt mind getting his hands dirty for a client sweating for one even losing sleep for one but she wasnt his damn client and hed taken professional courtesy to his colleague out west as far as he intended to he was out of it hell the woman had a kid a very appealing kid but that was beside the point if he pursued a personal relationship with her it would involve the kid as well there was no way around that one and jared admitted there shouldnt be one then there was that fact that beneath that scorching beauty the woman was tough as shoe leather there was no doubt that shed been around knew the ropes and had probably climbed plenty of them a woman didnt get eyes that aware by spending all her time baking biscuits he imagined she could chew a man up spit him out and have him come crawling back for more well not this man he could handle her of course if he wanted to that exotic unbelievable face zipped straight to the center of his mind and taunted him god he wanted to in disgust jared sprang up and headed into the woods he needed to walk he decided and he preferred the company of ghosts to his own thoughts chapter four good afternoon mackade law offices sissy bleaker jareds secretary answered the phone on the fly it was quarter to five she had a hot date in exactly one hour and the boss had been like a bear with a sore tooth all day oh yes hello mr brill no mr mackade is in conference sissy could have spit nails when the front door opened how the devil was she supposed to look irresistibly sexy in an hour if she couldnt get out of here ill be happy to take a message as she picked up a pad she glanced up and decided she could have a week at her disposal and not pull off the kind of inyourface sexy that had just walked into jared mackades outer office savannah hated being here she hated that shed felt obliged to change out of jeans into pleated trousers and a jacket something about visiting official places compelled her to put on a front and this place certainly looked official the pretty plants and bland pastel paintings on mattewhite walls didnt hide the fact that law was the order here the carpet was a muted gray the deepertoned chairs in the waiting area were likely just the wrong side of comfortable we wouldnt want people to be at their ease now would we she thought bitterly shed never known a den of authority social services a principals office an unemployment line to offer comfort still shed thought the man had more style than to choose such a cold formal setting for his work the secretary behind the polished receptionarea desk was young brighteyed and savannah was sure fiercely efficient the quick greeting smile she sent in savannahs direction was carefully empty of curiosity and perfectly balanced between warm and cool savannah had no idea sissy was curdling with envy inside yes mr brill ill see that he gets your message youre welcome goodbye wondering just where the mystery visitor had come across that terrific jacket all sweeping lines and bold colors sissy hung up the phone and aimed her most professional smile good afternoon may i help you id like to see mr mackade do you have an appointment sissy knew very well she did not jareds schedule was filed in her brain right alongside her own no i was damn she hated this i was in town and i thought id take a chance hed be free for a minute im afraid hes in conference ms morningstar of course he was in conference savannah thought nastily where else was a lawyer when he wasnt on the putting green but in conference then id like to leave a message the name morningstar rang all sorts of bells in sissys brain it had been said through gritted teeth that morning when jared dictated a briskly formal letter with all kinds of interesting hums between the lines certainly if its personal you could write it down and ill oh sissy beamed at her phone mr mackades just finished his conference call i see why dont i buzz him see if he can squeeze you in fine great restless savannah turned away to pace sissy decided that if she grew six inches in height filled out several more in the right places she might just look that impressive on the move mr mackade theres a ms morningstar to see you if you have a moment yes sir shes in the office now yes sir careful to keep her lips from sliding into a smile sissy hung up the phone hell see you ms morningstar its right up those stairs and to the left first door thanks savannah turned toward the short curve of stairs put one hand on the pristine white rail and climbed must have been a town house at one time she decided or a duplex though she wouldnt have called the place homey savannah admitted it had class if you went in for snooty and nondescript there was a short hallway at the top of the steps a print of a spray of white orchids in a white vase that was so soulless and ordinary it offended her artists eye and two doors facing each other she strode to the one on the left rapped once and opened it of course hed look terrific in charcoal gray she thought a lot better than the office did with its dull grays and punishing whites someone should tell him work was more pleasant in an environment with a little color and life but it wouldnt be her he rose elegant in his threepiece suit and carefully knotted tie a tie hed just jerked back into place she thought with an inner sense of rebellion that he looked like more of a lawyer than ever ms morningstar he inclined his head he thought that her stepping into the room was like having some brilliant bolt of lightning strike a placid pond have a seat it wont take long she remained standing stubbornly i appreciate you taking the time to see me i had the time to illustrate the point he moved a file from the center of his desk to the side and sat what can i do for you in answer she pulled papers out of her purse tossed them on his desk i signed them in triplicate and had them notarized her drivers license landed with a plop on top of the papers thats my id she threw in her social security card for good measure i dont have a birth certificate mmhmm taking his time jared pulled brown hornrims out of his jacket pocket and slipped them on to study the papers savannah stared at him swallowed hard it didnt seem to matter that she told herself it was ridiculous her heart had skipped a beat he looked gorgeous intellectually sexy in those damn glasses and made her feel like a fumbling fool its all in order she began afraid not thoughtfully he picked up her drivers license perused it this is invalid the hell it is i just had it renewed a couple of months ago that may be he continued studying her now but as the picture actually looks like you and is in fact flattering this drivers license is obviously a fraud and therefore invalid she closed her mouth jammed her hands in her pockets are you making a joke is that allowed in hallowed halls sit down savannah please with a badtempered shrug she sat did you ever hear of color she demanded this place is dull as a textbook and your art is pathetically ordinary it is isnt it he agreed easily my exwife decorated the place she was a tax accountant had the office across the hall he leaned back and scanned the room ive gotten used to not seeing the place but youre right it could use something it could use an obituary annoyed with herself she pushed a hand through her hair i hate being here i can see that he picked up the papers again skimmed through them you understand that youre agreeing to accept a payment by cashiers check that equals the total cash balance of your fathers estate yes and his effects i thoughti thought that meant the money what else is there apparently there are a few personal effects i can get you an itemized list if you like so that you can decide if you want them sent or discarded the shipping would be deducted from the estate discarded she thought as she had been no just have them sent all right methodically he made notes on a yellow legal pad ill have my secretary draft a letter tomorrow confirming the status and apprising you that youll receive full disbursement of the estate within fortyfive days why do you need a letter when youve just told me he glanced up from the papers the eyes behind the lenses amused the law likes to cover its butt with as much paperwork as humanly possible he signed the papers himself as proxy for his colleague then handed savannah back her license and social security card thats it then thats it well feeling awkward and relieved she rose it wasnt as painful as i expected i suppose if im ever in the market for a lawyer ill give you a call i wouldnt have you as a client savannah her eyes fired as he took off his glasses and stood to come around the desk thats very neighborly of you i wouldnt have you as a client he repeated standing behind her because then this would be unethical he caught her off guard shed had no idea any man could still catch her off guard but she was in jareds arms and being thoroughly kissed before she had a chance to evade if shed wanted to evade there was heat of course she expected that enjoyed that but it was the lushness of it that surprised her the silky sumptuous spread of it that bloomed in that meeting of lips flowering through her body he held her close in a smooth confident embrace no fumbling no grappling he gave her room to resist and as that clever widepalmed hand skimmed lightly up her spine she thought only a fool would step away from that caress that mouth that heat so she stepped into it sliding her own hands up his back until they were hooked over his shoulders hed wondered what he would find here from the moment she stood clumps of flowers at her feet and looked at him hed wondered now he knew there was strength in those long lovely arms fire in that soft full mouth she opened for him as if hed touched her hundreds of times and her taste was gloriously familiar the press of her body against his every firm generous curve was an erotic homecoming he tangled his fingers in her hair slowly tugging her head back to savor and as her mouth moved warm on his he discovered what it was to be savored in turn gradually thoughtfully he drew back to study her face her eyes were steady calm darker yes he mused he knew by the way her heart had jumped against his that whatever had moved through him had moved through her as well but she didnt tremble what would it take to make a woman like this tremble he knew he would have to discover that secret and all the others she kept hidden behind those dark unreadable eyes but he said i can certainly recommend a lawyer for you if you find you need one she lifted a brow oh he was a cool one she thought carrying on the conversation as if her insides werent sizzling appreciating it she smiled why thank you excuse me a minute he said when his phone rang yes sissy his gaze left savannahs only long enough for a glance at his watch so it is he murmured noting that it was just after five you go ahead ill lock up and sissy the letter i dictated this morning the first letter yes dont mail that i need to make some changes savannah watched him consideringly he was sending his secretary off for the day and they would be alone she understood what it meant when a man looked at a woman the way jared was looking at her she understood what happened between men and women after theyd shared a mutually lusty kiss over the years shed learned to be very careful very selective the responsibility of raising a child alone wasnt a small one men could come and go but her son was forever she wasnt a woman who stepped blindly into affairs who scratched every itch or accepted every advance but she was also realistic the man currently dismissing his secretary the man flipping through his daily calendar to coordinate his schedule was about to become her lover my secretarys got a date jared commented when he hung up the phone so it looks like were closing the office on time today tilting his head he studied savannah im supposed to ask you discreetly where you got your jacket my jacket bemused savannah glanced down i made it youre kidding her bottom lip moved into an expression somewhere between a pout and a sneer and her chin rose in a gesture he now recognized as an indicator of temper simmering what i dont look like the type who can sew i dont fit the happyhomemaker image intrigued he rested a hip on the edge of his desk reached out to rub the brilliantly hued lapel of her jacket between his fingers nice work what else can you do whatever i need to do she didnt bother to protest when he tugged her toward him instead she rested her hands on his shoulders and leaned down into the kiss its early he murmured relatively wheres bryan at cassies mildly surprised hed bothered to ask she changed the angle of the kiss and let herself sink in im going to pick him up about six ive got about a half an hour its going to take longer he shifted took her by the hips and drew her intimately between his legs why dont you call her and see if he can stay until seven his teeth nipped gently over that lovely bottom lip seventhirty she was going to enjoy getting him out of that tie savannah thought i suppose i could good you clear it then well go across the street across the street for an early dinner she drew back stared at him dinner yes almost certain his legs would support him jared stood before he could give in to the urge to tear off her clothes drag her to the floor and have her id like to take you to dinner why because id enjoy spending an hour or two with you on top of you he thought inside you god with every appearance of calm he skirted the desk and flipped through his address file heres cassies number i know cassies number it was demoralizing to realize she had to take a good deep breath to steady herself when he was just standing there so coolly so easily whats going on here jared we both know dinner isnt necessary his stomach twisted into tight slick knots he could take her right here right now it was just that simple and anything too simple was suspect id like to have dinner with you savannah and conversation picking up the phone he dialed cassies number himself held out the receiver all right filled with mistrust she hesitated with a shrug she took the phone all right the restaurant was casual the menu basic american grill savannah toyed with her drink and waited for jareds next move so you make clothes sometimes smiling he leaned back in the wooden booth sometimes he repeated looking at her expectantly he wanted to make conversation she determined she could make conversation i learned because homemade is cheaper than storebought and i didnt want to be naked now i make something now and again because i enjoy it but you make your living as an illustrator not as a seamstress i like to work with color and design i got lucky lucky wary of the friendly probing she moved her shoulders you dont want the story of my life jared but i do he smiled at the waitress who set their meals in front of them start anywhere he said invitingly she shook her head cut into the spicy blackened chicken hed recommended youve lived here all your life havent you thats right big family old friends and neighbors roots yeah im going to give my son roots not just a roof over his head but roots he was silent for a moment there had been a fierceness in her voice a fiery determination that he had to admire even as he wondered at it why here because its not the west thats first i wanted to get away from the dust the plains and all those sunbaked little towns that was for me she admitted ive been moving east for ten years this seemed far enough when he said nothing she relaxed a little it was difficult to combat that quiet way he had of listening i didnt want the city for bryan but i wanted to give him a sense of belonging of community yeah small town kids people whod get to know him by name but i still wanted a little distance that was for me again and and i was drawn here she said at length maybe its the mysticism in my blood and my heritage but i felt i knew that this would be home the land the hills the woods your woods called to me amused at herself she smiled hows that for weird theyve called to me all my life jared said so simply her smile faded i could never be happy anywhere else i moved to the city because it seemed practical and small towns and long walks through the woods werent my exwifes style if he could probe so could she why did you marry her because it seemed practical now it was his turn to wince which doesnt say much for either of us we were reasonably attracted respected each other and entered into a very civilized intelligent and totally passionless contract of marriage two years later we had a very civilized intelligent and totally passionless divorce it was difficult all but impossible to visualize the man who had kissed her being passionless about anything no blood spilled absolutely not we were both much too reasonable for combat there were no children her choice he remembered only slightly bitter shed kept her own name a modern professional marriage youve got it we split everything down the middle and went our separate ways no harm no foul curious savannah tilted her head it bothered you that she didnt take your name he started to correct her then shrugged yeah it bothered me not very modern or professional of me just one of those things that would have made the commitment emotional instead of reasonable thats just pride partly savannah agreed but part of you wanted to give her that piece of you that you were most proud of that had been passed to you and that you wanted to pass to your children youre astute he murmured lawyers arent the only ones who can read people and i understand the importance of names when bryan was born i stared at the form they give you for names and i thought what do i put where it says father if i put the name down then im giving that name to my son my son she repeated quietly what did you put down she brought herself back from that moment when shed been barely seventeen and alone completely alone unknown she said because hed stopped being important my name was enough hes never seen bryan no he packed up his gear and lit out like a rocket the day i told him i was pregnant dont say youre sorry she said anticipating him he did me a favor its easy for a sixteenyearold girl to be dreamyeyed and hotblooded over a goodlooking cowboy but it isnt easy to live with one what have you told bryan the truth i always tell him the truth or as close to it as i can without hurting him im not ashamed that i was once foolish enough to imagine myself in love and im grateful that sometimes foolishness is rewarded by something as spectacular as bryan youre a remarkable woman it touched and embarrassed her that he should think so no im a lucky one it couldnt have been easy i dont need things to be easy he considered that and thought it was more that she didnt care for things to be easy that he understood what did you do when you left home when i got kicked out she said you dont have to pretty it up my father gave me the back of his hand called me all sorts of things its impolite to repeat to a man wearing such a nice suit and showed me the door wasnt much of a door she remembered surprised to see that jared had reached out to link his fingers with hers we were living in a trailer at the time he was appalled probably shouldnt be he realized hed heard stories as bad and worse in his own office but he was appalled at the image of savannah at sixteen pregnant and facing the world alone didnt you have anyone you could go to no there was no one i didnt know my mothers family hed have probably changed his mind in a day or two he was like that but the things hed called me had hurt a lot more than the slap so i put on my backpack stuck out my thumb and didnt look back got a job waiting tables in oklahoma city she picked up her drink thats probably why cassie and i hit it off we both know what its like to stand on your feet all day and serve people but she does a better job of it oh there was plenty she was skimming over jared thought miles of road she wasnt taking him over how did you get from waiting tables in oklahoma city to illustrating childrens books by taking a lot of detours well fed she leaned back and smiled at him youd be surprised at some of the things ive done her smile widened at his bland look oh yes you would name some served drinks to drunks in a dive in wichita youre going to have to do better than that if you want to shock me worked a strip joint in abilene there she chuckled and plucked the thin cigar hed just taken out of his pocket from his fingers thats got you thinking determined not to goggle he struck a match held it to the tip of the cigar when she leaned over you were a stripper erotic dancer she blew out smoke and grinned you are shocked im intrigued mmhmm to pop the fantasy a bit i never got down to the bare essentials youd see women on the beach wearing about as much as i shook down to only i got paid for it not terribly well casually she handed him back the cigar i made more money designing and sewing costumes for the other girls than i did peeling out of them so i retired from the stage youre leaving out chunks savannah thats right they were her business lets say i didnt like the hours i worked a dog and pony show for awhile a dog and pony show a poor mans circus took a breather in new orleans selling paintings of bayous and street scenes and doing charcoal sketches of tourists i liked it great food great music but you didnt stay he pointed out i never stayed long in one place habit just about the time i was getting restless i got lucky one of the tourists who sat for me was a writer kids books shed just ditched her illustrator creative differences she said she liked my work and offered me a deal id read her manuscript and do a few illustrations if her publisher went for it id have a job if not shed pay me a hundred for my time how could i lose you got the job i got a life she told him the kind where i didnt have to leave bryan with sitters worry about how i was going to pay the rent that month or if the social workers were going to come knocking to check me out and decide if i was a fit mother the kind where cops dont roust you to see if youre selling paintings or yourself after a while i had enough put together that i could buy my son a yard a nice school little league games a community she tipped back her glass again and here we are and here we are he repeated where do you suppose were going thats a question ill have to ask you why are we having dinner and conversation instead of sex to his credit he didnt choke but blew out smoke smoothly thats blunt lawyers like to use twenty words when one will do she countered i dont then lets just say you expected sex i dont like being predictable behind the haze of smoke his eyes flashed on hers with a power that jarred when we get around to sex savannah it wont be predictable youll know exactly who youre with and youll remember it in that moment she didnt have the slightest doubt perhaps that was what worried her all your moves lawyer mackade your time and place thats right his eyes changed lightened with a humor that was hard to resist im a traditional kind of guy chapter five a traditional kind of guy savannah mused one day after her impromptu dinner with jared and she was standing in her kitchen her hands on her hips staring at the florists box hed sent her roses a dozen longstemmed red beauties traditional certainly even predictable in their way she supposed unless you factored in that no one in her life had ever sent her a long glossy white box filled with red roses she was certain he knew it then there was the card until your garden blooms how did he know flowers were one of her biggest weaknesses that she had pined for bright fragrant blooms in those years when she was living in tiny cramped rooms in noisy crowded cities that shed promised herself that one day she would have a garden of her own planted and tended by her own hands because he saw too much she decided and circled the flowers as warily as a dog circling a stranger she was so intent on them she actually jumped when the phone rang cursing herself she yanked up the receiver yes hello bad time jared asked she scowled at the flowers lying beautifully against the green protective paper im busy if thats what you mean then i wont keep you i thought you might like to bring bryan over to the farm for dinner tonight still frowning she reached into the box took out a single rose it didnt bite why why not for starters ive already got sauce on for spaghetti she waited a beat so did he i suppose you expect me to ask you to come here to dinner yep twirling the rose she tried to think of a good reason not to all right but bryan has baseball practice after school i have to pick him up at six so ill pick him up its on my way see you tonight then something seemed to be slipping out of her hands i told you all of this wasnt necessary she muttered the flowers do you like them sure theyre beautiful well then that seemed to settle the matter ill see you a bit after six befuddled she hung up after another long stare at the roses she decided shed better dig up a vase at sixfifteen she heard the sound of a car coming up her lane carefully she finished a detail on the illustration of her wicked queen for a reissue of traditional fairy tales then turned away from her worktable bryan was already clattering up the steps by the time she walked from her small studio into the kitchen then he popped up and that klutzoid tommy couldnt get his glove under it his mom had two cows when the ball came down and smacked him in the face blood was spurting out of his nose it was so cool hi mom bryan she lifted a brow at the state of his clothes red dirt streaked every inch do some sliding today yeah he headed straight to the refrigerator for a jug of juice tommy mardson got a bloody nose jared put in so i hear his mom was really screaming excited by the memory bryan nearly forgot to bother with a glass until he caught his own mothers steely eye it wasnt broke just smashed real good were going to work on that grammar tonight ace bryan rolled his eyes nobody talks like the books say anyway i got a b on the spelling test drinks are on the house math bryan swallowed juice in a hurry hey i gotta clean up he declared and dashed for the stairs in a strategic retreat recognizing evasive action savannah winced we hate long division who doesnt jared handed her a bottle of wine but a b in spellings not chump change neither she thought was the fancy french label on the bottle this is going to humble my spaghetti jared took a deep appreciative sniff of the air it was all spice and bubbling red sauce i dont think so well at least take off that tie she turned to root out a corkscrew its intimidating you can he turned her by the shoulders lowered his head slowly and covered her mouth with his the top of her head lifted gently away kiss she finished on a long breath you can sure as hell kiss after picking up the corkscrew that had clattered to the counter she opened the wine with the quick competent moves of a veteran bartender fancy wine and fancy flowers all in one day youre going to turn my head thats the idea she stretched for the wineglasses on the top shelf id have thought after the condensed version of the life and times of savannah morningstar youd have gotten the picture that im not the wineandflowers type he brushed a finger over the petals of the roses shed set in the center of the table they seem to suit you as he folded his tie into his pocket loosened the collar of his shirt she poured the wine it was rude of me not to thank you for them so she handed him a glass thanks my pleasure bryans going to hide out until he thinks ive forgotten about the math more fool he if youre hungry i can call him down no hurry sipping wine he wandered into the front room he wanted a better look at the paintings the colors were bold often just on the edge of clashing the brush strokes struck him as the same bold sweeps temperamental lines the subject matter varied from still lifes of flowers in full riotous bloom to portraits of vivid livedin faces to landscapes of gnarled trees rocky hills and stormy skies not quiet parlor material he mused and not something it was easy to look away from like the artist he decided the work made a fullthrottle impression no wonder you turned your nose up at whats hanging in my office he murmured ive never thought art was supposed to be cool she moved a shoulder but thats just my opinion whats it supposed to be in your opinion alive then youve certainly succeeded he turned back to her do you still sell if the price is right ive been thinking about having regan do something about my office my sisterinlaw he reminded her shes done an incredible job with the inn she and my brother are rehabing would you be willing to handle the art she took it slow watching him sipping wine the idea had an old deeply buried longing battling for air painting was just a hobby she reminded herself what else could it be for a woman with no formal training ive already told you id sleep with you he managed a laugh though it nearly stuck in his suddenly dry throat yes you have but were talking about your painting are you interested in selling some you want to put my art in your office i believe ive established that one step at a time savannah reminded herself dont let him see just how much it would mean wouldnt you be more comfortable with some nice pastels you have a nasty streak savannah i like it she laughed enjoying him lets see what your sisterinlaw comes up with first then well talk she walked back into the kitchen to put on water for the pasta fair enough why dont you drop by the inn see what she and rafe have done there id love to get a look at the place she admitted i could drive you over after dinner homework she shook her head with real regret i have a feeling im going to be doing long division in that case he picked up the wine and topped off both their glasses let me offer a little dutch courage she hadnt expected him to stay after the meal was over certainly hadnt been prepared for him to wind things around so that he was sitting beside her son at the kitchen table poring over the problems in an open arithmetic book she served him coffee as he translated the problems into baseball statistics and why savannah wondered as her son leaped at the ploy and ran with it hadnt she thought of that because she admitted figures terrified her schooling terrified her the knowledge that her son would one day soon go beyond what she had learned was both thrilling and shaming not even bryan knew about the nights she stayed up late long after he slept and studied his books determined that she would be able to give help whenever he asked her for it so you divide the total score by the number of times at bat jared suggested adjusting his hornrims in a way that made savannahs libido hitch yeah yeah the lights of knowledge were bursting in bryans head this is cool with his tongue caught between his teeth he wrote the numbers carefully almost reverently after all they were ball players now check this out mom when she did laboriously going over the steps of the problem her smile bloomed good job she brushed a kiss over bryans tousled hair both of you how come i didnt get a kiss jared wanted to know she obliged him chastely enough but bryan still made gagging noises man do you have to do that at the dinner table close your eyes jared suggested and kissed savannah again im out of here bryan shut his book with a snap out of here and into the tub savannah finished aw come on he looked beseechingly at jared actually jared began i believe my client is entitled to a short recess oh really but savannahs dry comment was drowned out by bryans whoop of delight yeah a recess like an hours tv with the courts indulgence jared shot bryan a warning look laid a hand on his shoulder what my client means is thirty minutes of recreational television viewing is appropriate after serving his previous sentence and taking steps toward rehabilitation after which he will voluntarily and without incident accept the courts decision savannah hissed a breath through her teeth lights out at ninethirty she muttered all right bryan pumped his fist in the air you should have gone for the hour he told jared this was your best deal trust me im your lawyer a grin split bryans face cool thanks mr mackade night mom very fast fancy talking savannah said under her breath as her son dashed upstairs to the little portable in her bedroom i couldnt help myself feeling a little sheepish jared tucked his hands in his pockets he reminded me of what it was like to be a nineyearold boy and desperate for another hour are you going to hold me in contempt she sighed picked up the empty coffee cups took them to the sink no it was nice of you to stand up for him besides hed have wrangled the half hour out of me anyway he deserved it jared grinned when she glanced over her shoulder so do i after all we slogged straight through that math assignment you want thirty minutes of what was it recreational television viewing no he took his glasses off slipped them into the pocket of his shirt i want you to walk in the woods with me when her brow creased and she glanced toward the stairs jared took her hand we wont go far hey bry he called out your mom and i are going for a walk cool came the absent obviously uninterested answer jared took her denim jacket from a hook by the kitchen door it gets chilly after sundown just to the woods she insisted as she shrugged into the jacket from there she could hear bryan if he called her just to the woods jared agreed and closed his hand over hers do you get lonely out here during the day by yourself no i like being by myself she walked outside with him where the air had a faint snap and the sky was so clear the stars almost hurt the eyes i like the quiet they went down the uneven steps that had been hacked into the bank then across the narrow lane to where the woods began with shadows i kissed my first girl in here the justgreening trees opened to welcome them in did you yep cousin joanie cousin third cousin jared elaborated on my mothers side she had long golden curls eyes the color of the sky in june and my heart i was eleven comfortable with shadows and starlight she laughed a late bloomer she was twelve so you liked older women now that you mention it that might have been part of the attraction i lured her into the woods one balmy summer evening when the sun was going down red behind the mountain and the whippoorwills were starting to call very romantic it was an epiphany i drew together all my sweaty courage and kissed her near the first bend in the creek when the air was full of summer twilight and the smell of honeysuckle thats very sweet it would have been he mused if my brothers hadnt followed us and hidden to watch they screamed like banshees cousin joanie went tearing back to the farm of course my brothers ragged on me for weeks after so i had to take on each of them to save my honor devin broke my finger and i lost interest in cousin joanie thats sweet too the rites of passage ive learned a few things since then about kissing pretty girls in the woods when he turned her into his arms and his mouth moved over hers she had to admit he was right hed learned quite a number of things where is cousin joanie now in a nice splitlevel in the burbs of virginia with three kids and a parttime job selling real estate with a sigh he pressed his curved lips to savannahs brow she still has those gold curls and summer eyes one more ghost in the mackade woods she looked back through the trees she could see the lights shed left on in her cabin her son was safe there tell me about the others the two corporals are the most famous one wore blue the other gray during the battle of antietam they were separated from their companies he slipped an arm over her shoulders so that they walked companionably their strides matched they came upon each other here in the woods two boys barely old enough to shave in fear or duty or maybe both they attacked each other each one was badly wounded each one crawled off in a different direction one to the farm your farm hmmm a union soldier torn open by the enemys bayonet my greatgrandfather no friend of the north found him by the smokehouse the story is that he saw his own son who hed lost at bull run in that dying boy so he carried him into the house they did what they could for him but it was too late he died the next day and afraid of reprisals they buried him in one of the fields in an unmarked grave so hes lost savannah murmured and haunts the woods because he cant find his way home that would be close enough and the other corporal made it to the barlow house a servant took him inside and the mistress was preparing to tend to him when her husband shot him she didnt shudder she was well used to cruelties small and large because he didnt see a boy but the wrong color uniform thats right so the mistress of the house abigail barlow turned from her husband and went into seclusion she died a couple of years later a sad story useless deaths make for uneasy ghosts still it always feels she closed her eyes let the air dance over her face inviting here they just dont want to be forgotten do you want to know where they fought something in her tone had him looking down at her why she opened her eyes again they were darker than the shadows more mysterious than the night to the west fifty yards by a clump of rocks and a burled tree he felt cool fingers brush the nape of his neck but her hands were in his yes ive sat on the rocks there and heard the bayonets clash so have i but i wondered who and why is that usual for you his voice had roughened perhaps it was what they spoke of in the night wood or perhaps it was her eyes so dark so depthless that he knew any man would blissfully drown in them your greatgrandfather was a farmer who saw a young boy dying and tried to save him mine was a shaman who saw visions in the fire and tried to understand them you still try to save people dont you jared and i still try to understand the visions are you psychic she laughed quickly richly no i feel things we all do the strongest part of my heritage accepts those feelings respects them honors them i followed my feelings when i left oklahoma i knew that id find where i belonged and i took one look at that cabin at those rocks these woods and i knew i was home i watched you walk across the grass that first time and i knew id end up wanting you she leaned forward touched her lips to his and now i know i have to get back and put my son to bed before he raids the refrigerator savannah he caught her hands again before she could turn away his gaze was intense on her face almost fierce what do you feel about where were going she felt the heat then the cold then the heat once more slide up her spine but she kept her voice easy i find that when you look too far ahead you end up tripping over the present lets just worry about the now jared when he lifted her hand to his lips savannah realized that now was going to be trouble enough she waited until the end of the week before she acted on jareds suggestion and detoured by the barlow place the mackade place she corrected amused at herself for having picked up the towns name for the old stone house on the hill the barlows hadnt lived in it for over fifty years the last family a couple from the north of the county had bought it lived in it briefly then abandoned it twenty years ago it had been up for sale off and on during those decades but no one had taken the plunge until rafe mackade savannah considered that as she turned off the road and up the steep lane someone had begun to clear the overgrowth of brush and brambles but it was going to be heavy going someone she decided was going to need a lot of vision the house itself was three stories of beautiful stone tall windows arched windows mullioned windows gleaming most had been boarded up only months before or so savannah had been told when she was cornered by mrs metz in the market there were double porches the one that graced the second floor was in the process of being torn down it needed to be savannah mused it was rotted and sagging and undoubtedly treacherous but the lower one was obviously new still unpainted and straight as a military band on parade day scaffolding ran up the east wing and piles of material sat under plastic tarps in the overgrown yard she pulled up beside a pickup that was loaded with debris and shut off her engine when she knocked she heard an answering shout faintly irritated by the tone of it she stepped inside and stood shocked and swamped by the deluge of sensation laughter and tears and horror and happiness the emotions rolled over her then ebbed like a breaking wave she saw the man at the top of the steps smiled stepped forward jared i didnt expect to see you oh she saw her mistake immediately not jared the eyes were a darker green the hair slightly longer and definitely less wellgroomed jareds face was just a bit more narrow his eyebrows had more of an arch but that mackade grin was identical as sharp and lethal as an arrow from a masters bow im betterlooking rafe told her as he started down hard to say the family resemblance is almost ridiculous she held out a hand youd be rafe mackade guilty im savannah morningstar he didnt shake her hand just held it while he gave her a long practiced onceover regan was dead on he decided excuse me you met my wife last weekend at her shop she told me to think of isis that didnt do me a hell of a lot of good so she said to think of a woman whod stop a mans heart at ten paces and have him on his knees at five thats quite an endorsement and dead on he repeated jared said you might be coming by he tucked his thumbs in his tool belt i dont want to interrupt your work please interrupt my work he aimed that grin again im just killing time until regan gets home from the shop were living here temporarily want a beer this was the kind of man she understood and was at ease with now that you mention it but she hadnt taken two steps behind him when she stopped dead in her tracks and stared at the curve of the staircase intrigued rafe watched her problem there it was there on the stairs i take it jared told you about our ghosts she felt weak inside jittery at the fingertips he told me there had been a young confederate soldier that barlow had shot him after a servant had brought him into the house but he didnt say he didnt tell me where her legs felt heavy as she walked to the stairs as she followed the compulsion to go up the cold was like a blade through the heart through to the bone her knuckles went white on the rail here she could barely get the words out here on the stairs he could smell roses and hope and then he only wanted to go home she shook herself stepped back one step then two before turning i could use that beer yeah rafe let out a long breath me too do you ah do that kind of thing often rafe asked as he popped the tops on two beers in the kitchen no savannah told him very definitely there are some places around this area this house the woods out there she let the words trail off as she looked out the window theres a spot on my bank where i planted columbine and areas of the battlefield that break your heart with an effort she shook off the mood and took the beer rafe offered leftover emotions the strong ones can last centuries ive had a dream hed only told regan of it but it seemed appropriate now im running through the woods my battle gray splattered with blood i only want to go home im ashamed of it but im terrified then i see him the other soldier the enemy we stare at each other for a dozen heartbeats then charge its bad the fight its brutal and stupid and useless after i come here crawl here i think im home when i see her when she speaks to me and tells me its going to be all right i believe her shes right beside me when someone carries me up the stairs i can smell her the roses then she shouts looks at someone coming toward us down the stairs when i look up i can see him and the gun then its over rafe took a long drink what stays with me the longest after its over is that i just wanted to go home i havent had it in a couple of months maybe thats because you are home looks that way suddenly he grinned and tapped his bottle against hers a hell of an introduction are you up to seeing the place or do you want to pass no id like to see it youve done some work in here yeah the kitchen had a long way to go rafe mused but the counters had been built and were topped by a warm slate blue that showed off the creamy ivory of new appliances and gleaming glassfronted cabinets of yellow pine regan put her foot down he explained a workable kitchen and a finished bath and shed handle living in a construction site for a while sounds like a practical woman that she is come on ill give you the tour he took her arm and started back down the hallway id like to start upstairs she told him before he could open the door to the right sure most people liked to start with the parlor or the library but he was flexible as they started up he felt her hesitate brace just as he felt the hard shudder move through her as they continued no one feels it anymore he said not in weeks lucky for them savannah managed grateful when they reached the top of the landing she looked beyond the tarps the buckets and tools and saw sturdy walls that had been built to last we finished he broke off as she turned away from the bedroom he and regan shared a room that had belonged to the mistress of the house and had been lovingly repaired redone and furnished saying nothing he followed her to the opposite wing the door had been removed from this room a room with long windows that faced the outskirts of town the walls had been painted a deep green the wide ornately carved trim a bone white to match the marble of the fireplace the floors had been recently sanded she could smell the wood dust the little room beyond the valets room she wondered had been roughed in as a bath the masters room she murmured we thought it was likely fascinated rafe watched her walk from door to window from window to hearth oh it had been his master barlows she was sure of it he would have studied the town from here and thought his thoughts he would have taken one of the young maids to bed in here willing or not then slept the dreamless sleep of the conscienceless he was a bastard savannah said mildly well he didnt leave much behind with a smile she turned back to rafe youre doing a wonderful job rafe rubbed his chin thanks youre a spooky woman savannah occasionally i read palms in a carnival for a while pretty tedious work really this is much more interesting she moved past him back into the hall and headed straight for the mistresss room this is beautiful she murmured were jazzed about it from the doorway rafe scanned the room himself he could smell roses and he could smell regan its going to be our honeymoon suite its perfect she meant exactly that in all her travels she had never seen anything as lovely rosebud wallpaper as delicate as a tea garden was trimmed with rosetoned wood there were beautiful arched windows framed in lace that had the sunlight streaming in patterns on the highly polished floor a fourposter with a lacy canopy dominated the space there were candles slim tapers of ivory and rose burned downed to varying lengths that stood on the mantel in crystal holders an elegant ladys desk was topped by a globe lamp petitpoint chairs curved edged tables a pale pink vase crowded with sunny daffodils no shed never seen anything so lovely how could she have she reminded herself her life had been dingy trailers cramped rooms and highway motels envy snaked through her so quickly she winced jared said your wife did the decorating for the most part what would it be like savannah wondered to have such exquisite taste to know exactly what should go where its beautiful she said again when youre ready to open youll have to beat off guests with a stick were shooting for september its a little optimistic but we might pull it off his head turned his eyes changed at the sound of the door opening downstairs thats regan savannah had a firsthand view of what a mackade looked like when he was very much in love another surprising snake of envy curled through her up here darling rafe called out im in the bedroom with a gorgeous woman thats supposed to surprise me regan strolled into the room hello savannah it was all she managed to get out before rafe cupped a hand behind her neck and drew her up for a lengthy welcoming kiss hello rafe hi they beamed at each other savannah could think of no other word for it unless the word was perfect regan mackade with her swing of glossy brown hair her elegant face with its charming little mole beside the mouth her lovely blue eyes the color of summer skies seemed perfect as she slipped an arm around her husband her clothes were beautifully tailored the teal blazer and pleated slacks the smart white shirt with the copper bar pin at the collar she had a sexylady scent about her not prim not overt just perfect savannah felt like a grubby amazon whod stumbled on a princess ive been giving savannah the tour rafe explained great regan pushed back the right curtain of her hair and rings glittered on her fingers what do you think so far its wonderful savannah remembered the beer in her hand and lifted to it her lips lets not stop here with a friendly smile regan led the way out jared called the shop this morning and said hed like us to work on redoing his offices about damn time rafe commented the place is as cheerful as a mausoleum white and gray might as well work in a tomb well fix that with boundless confidence and enthusiasm regan showed off the house every room whether it was complete or in progress and filled with nothing more than dust and cobwebs scraped at savannahs confidence she knew nothing of fine antiques expensive rugs or window treatments she didnt want to know jareds really impressed with your art regan went on as they wound their way down to the first floor obviously it inspired him to do something about his work space id love to see some of what youve done its no big deal i dont have any training savannah took one long scan of the front parlor with its curvy settee and elegant side tables and jammed her hands in the pockets of her jeans a marble fireplace gleamed like glass set off with polished brass tools and andirons and everything down to the last candlestick was pictureperfect nothing of mine would fit in here thats for sure or a lawyers office either thanks for the tour and the beer she added handing rafe the empty bottle ive got to go pick up my kid oh surprised by the abrupt exit regan followed her to the door if youve got some time over the weekend i can fiddle with my schedule we could work on color schemes and treatments ive got a lot of work savannah pulled open the door suddenly desperate to escape youd better handle it on your own see you around all right but regan broke off with a huff when the door closed in her face she had definitely and none too subtly been brushed off and what she asked turning to rafe was that all about dont ask me thoughtfully he ran a hand over his wifes glossy hair thats a spooky lady darling lets go sit down and ill tell you about it chapter six when jared pulled up in front of the cabin he was puzzled mildly annoyed and quite intrigued it hadnt taken long for word to get to him that savannah had all but raced out of his brothers house shrugging off the job jared had offered her as she fled he intended to get an explanation spotting bryan and connor in the side yard he gave a wave they responded with an answering shout before they went back to the important business of throwing a baseball his rap on the door went unanswered so he walked in without invitation he doubted hed have heard one over the screaming rock and roll that shook the cabin he followed a gutbursting guitar riff through the kitchen and into an adjoining room she was bent over a worktable the white of the oversize mens undershirt she wore was streaked with paint her hair was twisted back in a braid her jeans were riddled with holes and her feet were bare his mouth watered hey she didnt look up a look of fierce concentration remained on her face as she worked delicately with a slim brush dipped in brilliant red he glanced around the cluttered room it had probably been intended as a mudroom as there was a door leading to the outside obviously she didnt need or have time for ambience in her work space he mused the light was full and bright through the windows and showed every speck of dust the floor was aging linoleum decorated with paint spills unframed canvases were propped carelessly against the unfinished log walls steel utility shelves overflowed with bottles and jars tubes and cans he could smell turpentine and with relief he could see the dented portable stereo that was threatening to split his eardrums he strode over switched it off and almost shuddered at the sudden exquisite silence keep your hands off my music savannah snapped obviously you didnt hear me come in obviously im working she tossed her brush into a jar of solution chose another take off his eyes lit but he spoke with measured politeness yes i believe i will have a beer thanks can i get you one im working she repeated so i see ignoring the curse she hurled at him he leaned over her worktable the wicked queen was nearly finished and her face was terrible in its beauty her body was long elegant draped in purple and ermine her golden crown was as sharp as blades and glittered with wickededged jewels and in her narrow regal hand she held a vivid red apple gorgeous jared murmured evil to the bone is this from snow white no its from the three stooges youre in my light sorry he shifted slightly knowing it wasnt what she wanted i cant work with an audience she said between her teeth i thought you used to paint on street corners this is different savannah patient he rubbed a slight red smudge from her cheek did rafe or regan say something to upset you why should they thats what id like to know they were perfectly polite perfectly when he only cocked a brow she huffed out a breath i like your brother i loved seeing the house it was fascinating and your sisterinlaws just adorable it was a woman thing he realized and took a cautious step back youve got a problem with regan who could have a problem with regan we just wouldnt work well together and besides i dont want my art in your office oh why is that because i dont i had time to think about it and i decided im not interested she aimed a cool level look at him all the way not interested jared so beat it he moved fast lawyer suit notwithstanding she should have expected him to move fast he had her up from her stool his hand clamped on her arm before she could blink that didnt mean she couldnt speak ive told you not to grab me unless i ask you to yeah youve told me youve told me a lot of things for the hell of it he took a firm hold on her other arm and watched her eyes flame now why dont you tell me whats going on here i dont have to explain myself to you you think because i let you kiss me a couple of times i owe you ive let plenty of men kiss me ace and i dont owe anyone shed aimed the arrow well he felt it hit home stunned by just how sharp the point was you owe me the courtesy of an explanation courtesy doesnt interest me fine then he wouldnt let it stop him he yanked her close and crushed his mouth to hers in an angry frustrated kiss she didnt struggle instinct warned her it would be worse if she struggled instead she kept herself stiff and turned her mind off cold rejection she knew was more effective than heated protest but both her body and her mind betrayed her and she trembled it thrilled him that quick involuntary shiver that low helpless moan but temper was still sparking through him when he jerked away her face was flushed her breath fast he knew by the look in her eyes that she wanted as he wanted at the moment that fact only infuriated him i owed you that he said tightly now you can tell me again how much youre not interested she was interested interested in having a man look at her just once the way she had seen rafe look at regan and oh it was demoralizing to realize she had that vulnerable need inside her in a quick tumble jared in a deliberately insulting gesture she brushed her fingers over his cheek sure baby when ive got the time damn it savannah you see she sighed shook her head i knew youd take it personally youre the type and like i said thats not my type youre terrific to look at and youve got a lot of heat but she lifted a hand tugged on his tie just too traditional and bythebook now lawyer mackade you know all about the laws against trespassing the sanctity of someones home im going to ask you real nice since you like things real nice to leave you wouldnt want me to have to call your brother the big bad sheriff would you what the hell has gotten into you a dose of reality now go away jared before i stop asking nice hed be damned if hed beg damned if hed let her see that shed wounded him where hed never expected to be wounded iron pride chilled his eyes he turned and left without a word when she heard his car start and the sound of it going down her lane she sank back onto her stool and shut her eyes she gave bryan permission for his promised sleepover and enjoyed the noise and bother of two active boys lasting late into the night she was in the bleachers on saturday cheering on her son and his team and if she looked around now and again scanning for a tall man with dark hair and green eyes no one else knew at cassies insistence she dropped both boys at connors late saturday afternoon home alone she paced the house fidgeted in the quiet and finally went back to work the queen was finished but she still had the prince to sketch no wimpy softeyed dreamer for her snow white savannah mused as she began running the pencil over the thick white pad her snow white deserved some fire some passion some promise of a happyeverafter with heat it was hardly a wonder that her first rough sketch resembled a mackade dragonslayers she thought with a grim smile troublemakers who said a prince had to be polite hadnt most of them won their thrones in battle first yes she could see jared as a fairy tale prince her kind of fairy tale the kind of story that had inspired the legends that had been passed down through the ages before they became softened and misted to lull children rather than frighten them warrior avenger adventurer yes that was the prince she wanted to create she began to enjoy herself the familiar process of bringing something to life through her heart and mind and hand was always fascinating if not always soothing if things had been different she wouldnt have made her living from assignments but from that heart and mind painting what she saw what she felt what she wanted for the joy of it she was lucky she reminded herself to have this much there had been no art classes in her life only stolen moments with a pad and colored pencils dreams no one had ever understood yes she was lucky because her work and the payment for it allowed her to take time for painting to justify it as a harmless not terribly expensive hobby quickly fueled by instinct she began to add details to the sketch the diamondbright dimple at the corner of that sensual mouth the arrogant arch of an eyebrow a hint of muscle beneath the cloak more than a hint of danger in the eyes she would certainly have to paint a grass green hell she reflected if nothing else her brush with jared mackade had given her the perfect model for her assignment the illustration would be a good one she couldnt have asked for more she should never had let herself get caught up in the idea of painting for jared or selling him work that she had done for herself the sound of a car had her bracing and fighting to squash a little flutter of hope but when she went to the door she saw regan mackade the two women studied each other coolly after a long moment savannah opened the door and stepped back i dont know whats between you and jared regan said without preamble and if you think its none of my business youre wrong hes family but id like to know why youve decided you cant stand me to the point where you wont even take a potentially lucrative job just because wed rub elbows occasionally i dont want the job thats a lie savannahs eyes went molten now look sister no you look revved regan jabbed a finger at savannahs chest we dont have to be friends ive got friends though im baffled at how we could both manage to be friends with someone as sweet as cassie dolin she finds you admirable and its not my place to tell her youre just plain rude you were interested in the job when jared suggested it interested enough to come to the house and according to rafe everything was just dandy until i walked in now whats your problem sister savannah found her temper warring with amusement and reluctant admiration didnt the woman realize savannah was big enough to break her in half i guess you told me so why dont you tell me regan shot back i dont like the way you look you i beg your pardon or the way you talk pleased with herself savannah smiled let me guess private education dances at the country club debutante ball i was never a debutante if she hadnt been so baffled regan would have been insulted and whats that got to do with anything you look like you just stepped out of one of those classy womens magazines regan threw up her hands thats it yeah thats it well you look like one of those statues men sacrificed virgins to i dont hold it against you exactly they frowned at each other for a minute then savannah sighed shrugged ive got some ice tea id love some by the time she was sipping her second glass regan was up and wandering the front room she stopped by a landscape all rocky hills and trees gone violent with autumn this one she decided he needs this one where that horrible whiteorchid still life is hanging id have thought youd go for the orchids when regan turned her eyes narrowed blandly savannah smiled fully for the first time yeah i can see id have been wrong greens and mauves regan announced deep greens and those chairs in the outer office have got to go ive got a couple of library chairs in mind deepcushioned highbacked leather and i figure hardwood with area rugs instead of that gray sea of walltowall yes of course savannah could already see it regan mackade was obviously a woman who knew what she wanted look im not a humble person but can you actually see my paintings jibing with your taste or jareds yes and i think all things considered that you and i will work together very well regan held out a hand waited well are we going to give jared a break and get him out of that tomb yeah savannah took the pretty hand with its glittering rings in hers why the hell not later savannah walked toward the woods she had to admit shed done something she detested in others she had looked at the surface and made a decision all she had seen maybe all shed wanted to see when she looked at regan mackade was elegance privilege and class but who could have guessed thered be such grit under all that polish she should have savannah realized and when she saw jared sitting on a rock smoking quietly she realized she had known shed find him here he said nothing when she sat down beside him and took the cigar the silence was lovely filled with birdsong and breezes i owe you an apology it didnt quite stick in her throat but she handed him back the cigar i was you caught me at a bad time the other day did i dont make it easy mackade i wont with a quick badtempered shrug she swung her legs up crossed them under her i wasnt completely truthful with you there are a lot of things i dont mind doing but lies dont sit well with me i wanted the job i can use it but i felt intimidated she muttered as the word sat distastefully on her tongue intimidated it was the last reason or excuse hed have expected to hear out of her by what your sisterinlaw to start regan sheer astonishment ran up hard against the foul mood hed been mired in for twentyfour hours give me a break it was his quick dismissive laugh that snapped it temper soaring savannah bolted up from the rock and whirled on him ive got a right to be intimidated by whatever i please ive got a right to feel exactly how i chose to feel dont you laugh at me sorry wisely jared cleared his throat then looked up at her why would regan intimidate you because shes shes classy and lovely and smart and successful shes everything im not im comfortable with who i am what i am but when you come up against someone like that its a kickinthebutt reminder of what youre never going to be never going to have i dont like feeling inadequate or stupid disgusted with herself savannah jammed her hands in her pockets and i didnt expect to like her so much she came by to see me a little while ago i thought she might regan likes to confront things headon thoughtful he studied the tip of his cigar ask her sometime about the night she waltzed into duffs tavern in a tight red miniskirt and had rafe gnawing his pool cue into toothpicks fascinated by the image savannah nearly smiled ill have to do that id like to handle the art for your office jared if youre still interested im interested he turned the cigar around offering it when she shook her head he took a last puff and carefully tamped it out on the rock i wasnt completely truthful about a couple of other things the situation was a first and she wasnt quite sure how to phrase things so she decided to keep it simple i have feelings for you jared they just sort of popped up they worried me he was watching her now his wonderful eyes very focused very cool she wondered how many witnesses had broken apart on the stand under that strong gaze men are a lot easier to deal with when feelings arent involved she continued i could be reading this wrong but i got the idea you were aiming for a relationship kind of deal and ive had lousy luck with relationships so i started thinking about that and some other things and figured it was best all around to bail when he said nothing absolutely nothing she gave in and kicked at the dirt on the path are you just going to sit there im listening he said mildly okay look ive got a kid to worry about i cant afford to get involved with someone who might start to mean something to him thats not realistic i know how to be careful about that how to keep things in line he stood now his eyes never leaving his youre going to keep me in line savannah if he touched her she was very much afraid shed go off like a rocket i dont think so thats the thing ive got these feelings for you thats interesting he hadnt known she could look so vulnerable because i have these feelings for you you do her hands stayed balled in her pockets well well he repeated and stepped forward he put his hand on her cheek and his mouth on hers she wasnt used to being kissed this way as if that were all as if she were all that mattered it made her weak and woozy those tensed fingers went limp and her heart surrendered are we straight now he murmured she nodded and found that feeling of pleasure could be huge just having a mans shoulder ready to cradle your head i hate feeling stupid so you said i dont want to feel stupid about this his lips curved as he brushed them over her hair neither do i so well make a pact whatever happens neither of us will make the other feel stupid i can agree to that he lifted her chin for another kiss why dont i walk home with you all right she couldnt help it she felt stupid and sentimental walking hand in hand with him through the woods aware of every beam of sunlight every scent every sound she would have sworn that she could hear the leaves growing overhead and the wildflowers struggling toward the sun love she mused honed the senses i have to pick up bryan in a little while she glanced over i can call cassie and rearrange things he knew what she was offering and could feel the blood humming under his skin when he brought their joined hands to his lips he saw the flash of surprised pleasure in her eyes not yet he told himself not quite yet well both pick him up what do you say to an early movie and pizza after she couldnt look at him now not the way her throat was aching she knew what he was offering id say great she managed thanks jareds cool bryan bounced into the top bunk of his bed his mind full of scenes from the action flick his belly stuffed with pepperoni pizza i mean man he knows everything about baseball and stuff about the farm and the battlefield hes even smarter than connor youre no slouch ace she tousled his hair jared says everybodys got a special talent interested savannah leaned on the edge of the bed so that her face was level with her sons he did yeah when we went to get popcorn he said how everybodys got something inside than makes them different he knows on account of he has three brothers and theyre a lot alike but theyre different too he said im a natural she grinned a natural what mom rolling his eyes bryan sat up in bed at baseball and you know what else he said no what else did he say he said how even if i decided not to be a majorleaguer i could use the stuff i know in other things of course im going to be a majorleaguer but maybe id be like a lawyer too a lawyer she felt a little flutter of panic her son was falling in love as quickly as she was yeah cause you get to go to court and argue with people and put criminals in jail but you have to go to school forever i mean until youre old jared went to college and to law school and everything so can you if thats what you want well im going to think about it he flopped back down curled into his pillow in a way that comforted her as much as him it was the gesture of a child he was still her little boy night good night bry she pressed her lips to his temple and lingered over it a moment or two longer than usual long enough to make him squirm sleepily she rose turned off his light then closed his door because he liked his privacy her son the lawyer she thought and rubbed her hands over her face with a mother whod never finished high school then as the panic gave way to a warm glow of pride for what her son might one day achieve she smiled she walked quietly to her own room and moved to the window to look out at the woods through them she could see the lights of the mackade farm and there she thought was the man shed fallen in love with she smiled again and laid a hand on the cool glass of the window all in all she decided it had been pretty smart of her to wait to fall until shed found jared mackade chapter seven he sent her yellow tulips and she was dreamyeyed for an hour after she slipped them stem by stem into numerous old bottles he took her and bryan to a minorleague ball game in the neighboring county where the stands were hard as iron and the crowd was rowdy and won her sons heart absolutely by snagging a foul they had pizza at a place with worn wooden booths a loud jukebox and a pinball machine the three of them ate sloppily shouted over the music and competed like fiends over the speeding silver balls he took her to dinner at a restaurant where there was candlelight and champagne fizzing in crystal flutes and held her hand on the snowywhite tablecloth he brought her a truckload of mulch for her garden and she was lost youre being courted cassie told her over lemonade and paint samples at savannahs kitchen table what courted cassie sighed over it the misery of her years with joe dolin hadnt quashed her romantic nature not when it concerned someone else isnt she regan bigtime yellow tulips regan added glancing up from her samples to the flowers that marched down the center of the table its a dead giveaway were developing a relationship voice casual savannah rubbed her suddenly damp palms on her jeans thats all he brought you mulch and helped you spread it didnt he cassie pointed out reasonably yeah it made savannah smile foolishly to remember it and to remember the way hed kissed her senseless when the two of them were grimy with dirt and sweat and chipped bark shes got it bad regan commented maybe i do damping the smile savannah snatched up her lemonade so what so nothing what do you think of this shade too yellow regan blew out a breath youre right filled with admiration cassie watched the way her two friends chose and discarded colors she hoped when she had just a little more put aside regan would help her pick out new paint for her living room shed washed those white walls so often scrubbed till her shoulders sang but she couldnt make them bright again then if savannah could help her pick the right material she could make new curtains for emmas room something cheerful something special for a little girl it was hard harder than she could admit to anyone to take on these little challenges to accomplish things that she imagined were just everyday things to some women how could she explain that for the first time in her life her entire life there was no one to tell her yes or no no one to complain or criticize or humiliate her constantly she had to remind herself that she was in charge and that if she tried if she kept at it step by step she could change the tiny rented house into a home a real home where her kids wouldnt remember the shouting and the beatings and the smell of soured beer wistfully she looked around savannahs cabin it was no larger than the house where cassie lived with her children but it was so much more bright colors carelessly tossed cushions dust she still attacked dust like a maniac afraid joe would walk in the door and pounce on her for forgetting no matter how often she told herself he wouldnt couldnt because he was locked up she still lay awake at night shuddering at every creak and woke up every morning relieved and ashamed her ears pricked the kids are coming back she announced and pushed all those old fears aside is it all right if i make more lemonade savannah merely grunted and studied the colors regan had selected for jareds law library then the kids burst in like rockets only three more weeks bryan shouted and waved both fists in triumph the kittens can come in three more weeks happy days savannah murmured but she smiled when emma darted over to wrap an arm around cassies leg hi angel face hello bryan let me pet his kittens theyre soft she wants one shyness had never been a problem for bryan he scooped a hand into the cookie jar and hauled out a fistful can she have one mrs dolin what he stuffed a cookie into his mouth and eyed the lemonade cassie was making can emma have one of the kittens shanes got extra a kitten automatically cassie put a protective hand on emmas head we cant have animals in the house because she broke off her gaze darting to connors even as her son dropped his head to stare at his feet because joe doesnt like them shed nearly said it so ingrained was the habit a habit she realized that had prevented her from seeing how longingly connor spoke of bryans expected pets how much emma liked to play with the neighbors little brown dog i dont see why we couldnt her reward was a brilliant and grateful look from her son really the disbelief and hope in his voice almost made her weep can we really sure we can she scooped emma into her arms and nuzzled you want one of shanes kittens emma theyre soft emma said again so are you it was time she did this cassie told herself made simple decisions without worrying about what joe would do tell shane youd like one connor cool unaware of the drama bryan chomped down another cookie then you can bring him over sometimes so he can play with his brothers lets go work on your pitching arm con okay connor darted after his friend skidded to a halt thanks mama whoa at the door rafe barely avoided a headon collision with connor he pretended he didnt see the way the boy stiffened and paled and patted his shoulder very casually you guys are quick jared and i lost you in the woods im sorry next year youll have to try running bases with that speed he stepped inside grinned at the ladies this was worth a tramp through the woods were nearly done regan told him and tilted her face up for a kiss no hurry hey gorgeous hello handsome savannah picked up one of her sons forgotten cookies and offered it thanks cassie just the woman i want to see oh is something wrong ive got a problem to bribe a smile out of emma he held out his cookie would you give me a kiss right here for this he asked keeping an eye on the cookie emma leaned forward and touched her pursed lips to his nose a problem cassie repeated nerves humming she set emma down and told her to go out and watch the boys play what is it well ill tell you he leaned back on the counter regan and i found this place a little farther out of town on the quarry road needs some work he grinned at his wife were thinking of moving over in a couple months probably around june thats nice well the thing is cassie we need somebody at the inn a what did you call it darling chatelaine fancy word for manager if you ask me somebody to look after the place rafe explained and the guests once weve got them somebody who can cook breakfast manage the housekeeping somebody who wouldnt mind living in and running things oh nerves settled cassie smiled you want me to ask around we could put the word out at the diner no weve already got somebody in mind eagleeyed rafe spotted the cookie jar and helped himself we want someone we know someone we trust he paused to chug down the full glass of lemonade cassie handed him so how about it how about it she repeated thats not the way you offer someone a position rafe regan said with a sigh cassie wed like you to move in and manage the inn for us we just cant do it between my shop and rafes work you want me if shed still been holding the glass it would have been smashed on the floor i dont know anything about managing an inn youd have to have experience and you manage a house and two kids rafe pointed out you cook almost as good as i do you know how to handle all the customers at eds run the kitchen there when you have to and you have a soothing personality those are qualifications in my book but youll want to think about it regans interruption was smooth as silk i know its a big favor cassie and youve worked at eds so long that it would be a big decision to switch jobs but rafes fixing up a nice apartment on the third floor with its own kitchen that would be part of the salary youd have privacy maybe you and the kids could come by and take a look wed really appreciate it an apartment privacy no rent payment that beautiful house on the hill a manager it all whirled in cassies head like blurred and colorful dreams id like to help but great flashing a grin at his wife rafe patted cassies shoulder you just come give the place a onceover and well talk about it some more all right dazed she shifted emma on her hip ill come by i have to get along i promised connor and bryan wed have hot dogs on the grill go on and round them up savannah suggested ill run and get bryans backpack she waited until cassie was out the screen door you make a very good team she murmured looking at regan and rafe and very good friends she was nearly at the steps when she saw devin on her porch talking to cassie her back snapped straight something i can do for you sheriff only mildly annoyed at the interruption he looked through the screen no i just walked over with jared and rafe youve done a nice job on the bank thanks when emma held out her precious cookie to share savannahs brow furrowed she watched devin lean forward take a small bite you taste better he announced and made emma giggle by nuzzling the gentle curve of her neck you can hold me she told him tossing out her arms and wrapping them around his neck thank you maam he took her brushing his cheek over her hair before settling her on his hip as cassie hurried away to call the boys devin looked back through the screen emma in his arms some women like me eyes cool savannah inclined her head so it seems im not packing heat ms morningstar that lethal mackade grin flashed all power and charm just taking in a spring evening with my best girl youre wearing a badge savannah pointed out habit ive got no problem with you im going to keep it that way she looked across her yard to where jared was hitting popups for the boys ive got no problem with that devin said quietly and drew her gaze back to his all right she nodded and headed up to get her sons overnight bag holding emma devin stepped off the porch he managed to draw cassie into a brief conversation and charmed one hesitant smile out of her before he had to pass emma back and watch her and the kids head for their car she wasnt quite so thin as shed been those last months before he was finally able to collar joe devin thought though she still looked as though one careless shout would topple her a man had to be careful with her the shadows had faded from under her eyes but the eyes were still haunted he worried about her and wondered when the car was gone he tucked his thoughts away and strolled over to jared your lady doesnt like me jared gave the bat a last swing she doesnt like your badge like i said she doesnt like me jared looked toward the porch where savannah stood watching them and felt his heart beat off rhythm shes had a rough road i dont doubt it hed seen a few miles of it in her eyes she what you want bro looks that way well then devin rubbed his chin in his thoughtful way still holding savannahs cool gaze it would take a hell of a lot more than a shout to topple that one he mused i have to say your taste in women has improved mightily since your timely divorce surprised jared leaned on the bat i thought you liked barbara devin snorted out a laugh yeah right you never said different you never asked me devin picked up the ball from the grass tossed it high made a one handed catch that would have had bryan cheering i like this one bemused jared shook his head you just said you didnt i said she didnt like me devins grin was sly and slow i find that very attractive in a woman jared had him in a headlock in a blink experienced in such matters devin overbalanced and sent them both rumbling to the ground with the faintest of frowns savannah watched them wrestle much as bryan and connor were prone to do behind her rafe and regan stepped out of the house well hell they got started without me were going regan took a firm grip on rafes arm you promised to take me to dinner but darling you can fight with them tomorrow bye savannah mmhmm at rafes shout devin rolled aside and rose narrowly avoiding the hand that snaked out to trip him after brushing off his jeans he jogged down to join rafe and regan he sent one quick salute to savannah and disappeared into the woods what was that a bit winded jared climbed onto the porch he winced a little and rubbed his ribs he got me a couple of good ones were you playing or fighting whats the difference she had to laugh what were you playing and or fighting about you got anything cold me she was in the house behind him like a shot what do you mean he said jared let the words trail off sighed lustily over the icy beer hed snagged from the refrigerator popped it open then drank deeply he said he found you attractive so i had to pound on him a little your brother sheriff mackade finds me attractive yeah he leaned over the sink to splash cold water on his face he likes you he likes me savannah repeated baffled why partly because you dont like him dev can be perverse partly because i do and hes loyal he rubbed his dripping face with a dish towel and partly because hes got good instincts and a fair mind are you trying to make me ashamed no im telling you about my brother rafes cocky and driven shanes goodhearted and laidback devins fair thoughtfully he laid the towel aside i guess it bothers me that you cant see that old habits die hard but she could see it had seen it he was sweet with emma satisfied that hed found a chink he grinned weve all got a way with the ladies so ive noticed she took the beer from him and helped herself would you like to stay for dinner i thought youd like to go out no she smiled at the yellow tulips on the table beside him id like to stay in big mae who had run the tiltawheel in the carnival where savannah had worked one educational season had always said if she ever found a man who could cook and who didnt turn her stomach at the breakfast table she would give up the high life and settle down after being treated to jared mackades cajun chicken and rice savannah thought big mae had had a very valid point she sipped the wine jared had gotten into the habit of tucking into her refrigerator and studied him over the candles on her dining room table whered you learn to cook at my sainted mothers knee he grinned she made us all learn and as she had the most accurate and swift wooden spoon in the county we learned good close family yeah we were lucky that way my parents made it easy natural i guess is a better word growing up on a farm everybody has to pull their weight depend on each other his eyes changed and looked savannah thought somewhere else i still miss them a little jab of envy reminded her that she hadnt known either of her parents well enough to miss they did a good job with you with all of you some people in town would have said differently once some still would the smile was back in his eyes we got our reps the oldfashioned way we earned them oh ive been hearing stories about those bad mackade brothers smiling over the thought she rested her chin on her fist swaggering around town is how mrs metz puts it she would his smile changed edged toward the arrogant shes crazy about us i thought as much i was getting the car filled the other day at the gas and go when she pulled into the station and got sharilyn out there by the pumps to reminisce and savannah remembered to try to pump out a little gossip oh jared cleared his throat sharilyn huh who has some very fond memories of you and a dodge to his credit he didnt wince hell of a car hows old sharilyn doing oh shes fine and dandy says hey amused she switched gears so which one of you bad mackade brothers was it who stuffed the potato in the tail pipe of the sheriffs cruiser jared ran his tongue around his teeth rafe got blamed for it he lifted his wine but i did it we always figured whatever one of us did all of us did so whoever took the heat deserved it very democratic she rose to put the dishes in the sink i could have used a few siblings on the rodeo circuit there was never anyone to pass the blame to your father was rough on you no not really he was how could she describe jim morningstar larger than life and hard as a brick he liked a good horse and a bottle of cheap whiskey he could handle the first but he didnt do quite so well with the second he didnt know what to do with me so he did his best it just wasnt good enough for either of us she leaned back when jareds hands came to her shoulders as he asked did you learn to ride so early i dont even remember learning could rope and tie a calf too pulled in a few prizes she laughed and turned to set her hands comfortably on his hips honey i learned to do all kinds of wild wicked things while you were busy steaming up the windows of a dodge and sticking potatoes in tail pipes oh yeah he tipped up her chin so they were eyetoeye oh yeah i could take a horse that looked like two miles of bad road and groom him up till he shined i liked the ones with temper she drawled rubbing her hands up his sides over his hips the ones with fire in their eyes and just a little mean in the heart id make him come to me right to me then id ride him eyes open she scraped her teeth over his bottom lip id ride him hard and long and when i was done hed be spoiled for anybody else his blood went instantly to boil are you trying to seduce me somebodys got to taking a good firm grip she fused her mouth to his until the heat burning through her engulfed him like a flash fire his hands gripped like vises on the edge of the sink behind her his body pressing against hers and then she was moving against him sliding rocking turning him to iron while her mouth took big hungry gulps jared touch me desperate she yanked his hand free closed it over her breast where her heart was pounding like steel on an anvil touch me touch me she repeated even as his hands streaked under her shirt and filled with her she was like some dark forbidden dream warm limbs straining against him sliding tight denim against tight denim in painful friction the flesh in his greedy hands was firm and full and hot he pressed his mouth to her throat he could have sunk his teeth into it such was his sudden outrageous hunger he knew that if he didnt have her now tonight hed be insane by morning when he pulled back dizzy with appetite she moaned for gods sake are you trying to make me crazy he stared fighting for his breath as she fought for hers though his hands were at his sides now he could feel her on his fingertips that was the first part of the plan he said as he took a deep gulp of air then added im finished with the first part hallelujah he could almost have laughed bryans staying at connors yes impatient edgy she grabbed his hands come upstairs no her smile was slow and willing all right but when she lifted her arms happy to take him where they were he caught her hands no jared dont make me hurt you he could laugh im hoping you will get a blanket a blanket i want you in the woods he turned her hand over in his caught her wrist in his teeth ive always wanted you in the woods ill get a blanket she managed and nearly tripped over her own feet in her rush she had herself under control again as they walked together under the arching canopy of trees tender with spring under the dazzle of stars and the glow of a threequarter moon shed meant to seduce him tonight to draw him slowly cleverly in to surprise him she hadnt meant to eat him alive then he stopped where the ground was soft and flipped the blanket down and she was very much afraid she wouldnt be able to stop herself tell me something lawyer mackade he looked over the blanket at her where she stood hip shot out chin angled eyes full of power and sex hed have chewed through glass to get to her whats that is your health insurance uptodate his teeth flashed white you dont scare me honey you wont be able to get your tongue around your own name when im finished with you she lunged agile as a trick pony her legs wrapped around his waist her hands fisted in his hair he swung her around once so that his body would cushion hers when they fell laughing to the blanket it knocked the breath out of him and gave her first advantage her hands were everywhere at once tugging the shirt over his head running down his chest to yank at the snap of his jeans and to his giddy amazement her mouth was chasing after them hold it in selfdefense he rolled on top of her keep that up and thisll last about twenty seconds he kept her pinned until his libido could remember it wasnt sixteen anymore ive been saving up for you savannah he lowered his head and the kiss was staggeringly deep the sound she made was a feral purr that shuddered into his mouth and out the soles of his feet while his lips devoured hers he gave his hands the pleasure of learning that long lush body firm and smooth it moved under his touch sinuously inviting him to linger she smelled like the woods dark mysterious full of secrets and hidden pleasures the taste of that mouth feeding avidly on his was full of spice and heat her hands were working on his back tensing his muscles nails nipping into his flesh to urge him to press harder grip tighter to take and take and take her breath came in low throaty moans so erotic he knew he would hear them again in his sleep when he reared back she arched and crossed her arms over her body with her eyes on his face she pulled her shirt over her head and tossed it aside she saw the fresh wild desire bolt into his eyes and reveled in it in her youth her body had been a curse some had said her downfall but now watching the man she loved look at her for the first time it filled her with a sense of soaring pride it should be illegal his voice was hoarse and thick looking like you he didnt touch her not yet fascinated he unsnapped her jeans drew them down and away his oath was reverent then his hands skimmed up from ankle to knee to thigh and hip over the muscled stomach that quivered unexpectedly youre the most terrifyingly beautiful woman ive ever seen her smile was slow confident she sat up hooked an arm around his neck and brought his ready mouth to hers her murmur was approving as he explored her inch by slow delicious inch she thought he had wonderful hands firm and just rough enough her eyes fluttered closed dreamily when he used his thumb to torment the tip of her breast she could wallow in the lovely feel of flesh sliding on flesh of the light breeze whispering the hot blanket beneath there were owls hooting in the trees ghosts walking in the air never in her life had she known the magic and the generosity of love she knew only that she would give him anything here whatever he asked whatever he wanted when he twisted her hair around his fist pulled her head back she was prepared for anything but he only pressed his lips to her shoulder rubbed them gently over the curve and she trembled like a startled doe surprised darkly pleased he lifted his head and looked into her confused clouded eyes you have beautiful shoulders this time he laved his tongue over them one by one her breath caught on two indrawn gasps sensitive shoulders they look like they should be carved in marble but theyre soft he nipped lightly at her collarbone and would have sworn it melted enthralled with the discovery he exploited it lifting her into his lap so that he cradled her rather than the ground when she was limp when he knew she was utterly open he quickly and with concentrated skill ripped her ruthlessly to a peak she cried out bucking hard then pouring into his hand love and pleasure burned through her unbearable heat she turned to him turned on him in a wild frenzy of hands and lips later he would think that they had both gone completely mad but for the moment what they did to and for each other was all that made sense she made him hiss out her name and the sound of it sang through her like music when his heart pounded like thunder under her mouth she knew it was for her and only for her the taste of salty sweat on his skin bewitched her he lifted her as though she weighed nothing she opened arched took him deep so deep that her hands reached out to grip his from the sheer joy of it she who cried only when there was no one to see no one to hear let the tears fall she rocked matching his rhythm matching the savage fearless beat of her own pulse endlessly endlessly with the stars raining over them and the moonlight slicing through the tender leaves they took each other he was nearly blind from the beauty of her face electrified from what her body brought to his he thought he felt something break inside him around his heart then like some ancient goddess summoning her forces she lifted her arms high gleaming in the stardust her body went taut and tightened around him like a velvet fist and tore him over the edge chapter eight savannah awoke with a moan and flung her arm over her eyes to shield them from the blast of sunlight her body felt as though shed ridden a wild bronc over rocky ground and then she remembered shed pretty much done just that her lips curved as the night reeled through her mind she had thought she knew what it was like to want a home a life a man shed been certain shed experienced every kind of hunger for food for shelter for love but nothing she had felt before matched what had churned through her for jared mackade there had been men in her life before some had passed through some had stirred her blood but she had never needed one and that she realized was both the risk and the wonder of this there would never be another man he was the first and he would be the last to take her heart as both mind and body woke she heard the song of the birds the faroff yip of shanes dogs she felt the strength of the sun beaming through the spring leaves and the chill of the early breeze with her eyes still shielded she stretched lazily feeling like a cat waiting to be stroked you have a tattoo she made a long contented sound flung her arm over her head and at last opened her eyes he was sitting beside her his hair was tousled from sleep and her hands his eyes were heavy and focused thoughtfully on an area high on her right thigh she wondered if there was any other woman in the world lucky enough to wake to such a sight you look good in the morning she murmured reaching out to stroke him naked and rumpled he wasnt sure how long hed watched her sleep but he did know that when he tugged the blanket away from her to pleasure himself with a long study of her body in the sunlight hed discovered the colorful little bird on her thigh he simply hadnt been able to get past it you have a tattoo he repeated i know that with a little laugh she rose on her elbows those darkchocolate eyes were heavy and touched with humor its a phoenix she explained amused at the way his brows drew together as he focused on it you know rising from the ashes i got it in new orleans when i realized i wasnt going to be poor for the rest of my life a tattoo some men think theyre sexy of course she hadnt gotten it for a man but for herself a brand to remind her that she could remake herself rise above what she had been how about you ill have to take it under advisement he couldnt say why he was so fascinated by it so jarred what other secrets did she have what other permanent marks from her past he looked away from it into her face and was shaken all over again the sleepy smile in her eyes the curve of those lips howre you feeling like i spent the night having wild sex in the woods laughing she moved to link her arms around his neck i feel wonderful her lips found his and lingered soft and warm how about you exactly the same she hoped so she hoped he could she would have lived her life in bliss if he could feel for her even a fraction of what she felt for him he gathered her close and held her as no one else had ever held her as if it mattered i dont suppose we could stay here forever she murmured no but we can come back he needed to think and knew it was impossible as long as he held her there were responsibilities at the farm that he was neglecting he reminded himself i have to go but he buried his face in her hair and his arms stayed around her farms dont take sundays off i have to pick up bryan soon but her head nestled into his shoulder and her arms stayed around him why dont you bring him over andjust bring him over all right savannah hmm he caught her hair in his hand drew her head back his mouth crushed desperately over hers just once more he murmured as he lowered her to the blanket when he walked back to the farm his mind was fogged from her hed never known a woman who could leave him so dazed so weakkneed he passed the pigsty where the stock caught the scent of man and grunted hopefully in the chicken coop hens clucked and fluttered over their feed distracted jared nearly tripped over one of the barn cats whod come out to stretch in the sun rubbing a hand over his face he made it to the back door the smells of breakfast hit him hard and his stomach realized it was ravenous he could have eaten the sausages devin was grilling and the skillet along with it coffee he nearly whimpered the word as he stumbled to the counter devin glanced at him then over at shane who was already gulping down his second cup a look of pure enjoyment passed between them your shirts inside out devin said mildly jared scalded his tongue on the coffee cursed then collapsed at the kitchen table with a grin cracking his face shane leaned on the counter near the stove where devin was frying up breakfast brother jared looks a little rough this morning looks like he spent the night crawling through the woods i guess i should have sent out that search party enjoying himself devin cracked eggs into the pan its tough on a man spending the night in the haunted woods alone i feel real bad about it let me get you some more coffee jare all solicitude shane brought the pot to the table then you can tell us all about it dont leave out a thing were here for you jared picked up the coffee shane had just topped off and scalded his tongue again im in love with a former erotic dancer with a tattoo with an experts finesse devin flipped eggs she was a stripper wheres the tattoo shane wanted to know it earned him a halfhearted jab in the gut okay just give me the general area im in love with her jared repeated weighing each word well hell youve been in love before shane strolled over to take biscuits out of the oven at least youve picked one thats interesting this time shut up devin muttered he heaped food on a platter and came to the table then he sat and studied jareds face a long moment later he leaned back and took a considering breath all the way in love experimentally jared rubbed the heel of his hand over his breastbone which ached from the way his heart was swelling feels like it with a shake of his head shane dumped biscuits into a bowl man were dropping like flies first rafe now you he brought the biscuits to the table sat and propped his head on his hands its getting scary did you tell her devin asked ive got to work it out next thing you know well have to put on suits again and get married grumbling at the thought shane started to fill his plate i didnt say anything about marriage jared said quickly panic reared up and kicked him in the throat ive been there i didnt say anything about marriage you werent married you were contracted cheering up shane shoveled in a mansize mouthful of eggs a good solid breakfast always lifted his mood you might as well have cuddled up with a spreadsheet what the hell do you know about it shane washed down the eggs with coffee because i never saw you look then the way you look now bro devin ate slowly and nodded in agreement is it the kid that bothers you no bryans great frowning jared helped himself to what was left on the platter he liked the boy liked spending time with him talking with him and the truth was that one of the reasons his marriage had been doomed was that hed wanted children and his wife hadnt no the boy didnt bother him it was the man who had helped create him who stuck in his craw and he realized the other men since he just couldnt intellectualize them away and he didnt like himself for it he caught devins look that quiet knowing look and jerked his shoulders restlessly i just have to get used to it devin dashed some salt on his eggs the trouble with lawyers is they like to gather up all the little facts every little piece then they can argue either side you were always good at that jare dad used to say you could twist something simple around from right to wrong and back again maybe this is one of those times you should just take it as it is jared wanted to and he hoped he could he didnt move in with her technically but he spent most of his nights there and some of his clothes found their way into her closet his books onto her shelves he got into the habit of swinging by after work to pick up bryan on practice nights more often than not they lingered on the field tossing the ball if a case kept him late at the office he phoned her sometimes he phoned her just to hear her voice with casual regularity he brought her flowers and baseball cards or some other treasure for bryan they were a trio on outings and they gave the town a great deal to buzz about bryan accepted him without question a fact that both pleased and distressed jared he wanted to believe it was because the boy cared for him considered them a kind of family but he wondered if bryan was simply accustomed to having a man stake a claim when that nasty toad of a thought jumped into his head jared did what he could to bat it away it was after all the now the mattered the way she looked at him the way she laughed when she watched him and bryan tussle on the lawn the way he thought she arched her back after shed been bending over the flowers she tended or how complete her concentration was when she worked in her studio it was the way she smelled that mattered when she walked out of a steaming bath it was the way she strained against him night after night in bed as if she could never get enough and the way she would reach for his hand when they sat together on the porch swing in the evening court had kept him late and the strain of the day refused to be shaken off hed brought work home and he knew that the headache that was drumming behind his eyes would be violent before it was over he stopped off in town to pick up aspirin searching the shelves in the general store for something that promised to kick big holes in the drums in his head hi there jared mrs metz armed with a loaf of bread and a box of ring dings cornered him she was an expert at the ebb and flow of gossip mrs metz the rhythm of small towns was too ingrained for him to hurry on and he liked her had fond memories of her feeding him homemade cookies and chasing him off with a broom hows it going fair to middling need some rain thats for sure springs been too dry shanes a little worried about it were going to get some tonight she predicted a storms brewing heard that morningstar boy played a good game saturday three rbis initiated two double plays she gave a cackling laugh that sent her trio of chins waggling you sound like a proud daddy before he could comment she hurried on seen you and the boy and his mama here and there shes what my boy pete would call a stunner yes she is jared chose a painkiller at random hard though mrs metz continued shifting her ample weight to block his retreat raising a boy on her own i mean not that lots of women dont find themselves in that kind of fix today shes from out west isnt she i guess the boys fathers still out there i couldnt say because it was the literal truth the pounding in his head increased youd think the man would want to see his son now and again wouldnt you theyve been here close on four months now youd think hed want to come around and visit a finelooking boy like that youd think jared said careful now course some men just dont give two hoots much less a holler about their children like joe dolin her cheerfully homely face puckered up on the name im happy as i can be youre handling cassies divorce and making it smooth for her mostly theyre not smooth i know when my sisters second boy got his the feathers flew id wager savannah morningstars divorce was a rough go oh no you dont he thought he wasnt going to give her any fuel by saying thered never been a divorce since thered never been a marriage she hasnt mentioned it you used to be more curious jared before he could snarl at her she beamed a smile at him and just look at you now a lawyer carrying a briefcase ive come up to watch you in court a time or two his anger with her deflated yes i know hed seen her there in her large flowered dress and sensible shoes like his own personal cheering section bettern watching perry mason thats what i told mr metz that jared mackades bettern perry mason your folks would be right proud of you and here we thought the lot of you would never be on the right side of the law she found that so funny she almost doubled over with laughter lord you were bad boy dont think i dont know who blackened my petes eye after the spring dance in high school the memory was very sweet he tried to muscle in on my girl sharilyn got around in those days it was sharilyn in high school wasnt it briefly anyway she got around and so did you as i recall girls always fluttering around you and your brothers young bryans mother must be right pleased to have hooked herself a mackade and i got to say the three of you look real nice together i got a feeling your mama wouldve taken to that girl yeah jared felt a clutching in the stomach what would his mama have said about a woman like savannah he thought about it on the way home and it added weight to his headache if his mother were alive how would he explain savannah unwed mother erotic dancer carnival worker calf roper street artist pick one he thought and rubbed at his temple the problem was he could imagine it all could see her in each stage of her evolution and it was too easy to see how each layer was part of the whole that was the woman who was waiting for him he was tempted to stop off at rafes or go straight to the farm just to prove he could that bryans mama didnt have her hooks in him but he turned up her lane because it seemed that anything less would be cowardly no mackade was a coward she was playing the music at full volume again usually it amused him the way she would crank up that old stereo and blast rock out over the hills now he sat in the car rubbing his aching head he walked to the porch his heavy briefcase weighing him down though the screen door he could see her back in the kitchen washing dishes singing along with the stereo in a lusty throaty voice that would sizzle a mans blood her hips were grinding to the beat she sure knew how to move he thought jealousy and temper slashing through him at the same time the first flash of lightning blazed in the west before he could stop himself hed slammed the door behind him like a pistol shot it boomed over the music she swung around her loose hair following the flow of her movement you want to turn that damn thing down he shouted sure hips still rotating she sauntered over and flipped it off sorry didnt hear you drive up you wouldnt have heard a freight train drive up she only lifted a brow at the edge in his voice and wiped her damp hands on tight jeans rough day he stalked over dropped his briefcase on the table where the daisies hed brought her a few days before still smiled sunnily is that how you danced for money the blow was so quick so sudden and sharp she couldnt even gasp it shivered through her once viciously before she gathered herself and rolled over the pain no i wouldnt have made much if thats all id put into it she walked to the refrigerator for a beer she didnt want because if there was something in her hands they might not shake want one no didnt it bother you being stared at drooled over not especially she look a slow deliberate swallow of beer so you enjoyed it he was prodding very much as he would prod a witness whod been sworn in enjoyed the dancing the staring the drooling it paid the rent men liked to look at my body and i figured they could pay for it and if theyd pay to look theyd pay to he broke off staggered by what had nearly come out of his mouth hed had no idea it was in there she didnt so much as flinch this time it wasnt unexpected now that you brought it up her shoulders moved in a lazy careless shrug i thought about it there was a time that that was all i had to bargain with so i thought about selling myself the horrified apology that was on the tip of his tongue dried up and did you she stared at him her eyes cool and blank im going up to say goodnight to my son her eyes went from cool to ballistic when jared snagged her arm dont mess with me mackade stay or go its up to you but dont mess with me she jerked free and strode quickly up the stairs he wanted to break something preferably something sharp that he could stab himself with afterward instead he ripped open the box of aspirin fought off the lid then downed three with what was left of her beer upstairs savannah settled bryan in for the night when shed closed his door she locked herself in the bathroom where she could bathe her hot face over and over again with frigid water how stupid shed been she thought berating herself how blind not to have seen what he was holding back how careless not to have built a defense against what he thought of her underneath it all she would build one now she promised herself she would not allow herself to be hurt by the questions he asked or the ones that were in his eyes she would not she swore she would not allow him to make her feel ashamed of the answers she had fought too long and too hard to let anyone make her feel less than what she was but though she tried she couldnt find that place inside herself that quiet untroubled place where she could escape it seemed he could follow her there methodically she dried her face and tidied the sink all the while she listened for the sound of his car leaving but there was nothing but the crack of lightning the mumble of thunder and the mutters of old ghosts he was at the kitchen table when she came back down his papers spread out he slipped his glasses off when she hesitated but she turned her back on him and walked outside to wait for the storm it came slowly from the west and built like temper simmering the wind kicked up and sent the trees waving the roar of it rain wind thunder rolled over the hills screamed through the woods and exploded there was a smell of ozone in the air a magic smell a violent smell savannah threw her head back and drew it in when the wind lashed the rain under the shelter of the porch to slap at her face she stayed where she was when lightning flashed so close it seemed to singe the trees she welcomed it at length jared put his work aside and walked out to her she was drenched hair dripping shirt clinging the air was cool but she wasnt shivering finally she turned leaned back against the post and crossed her bare feet at the ankles something else on your mind hed taken off his tie and rolled up his sleeves but he was feeling very much like a lawyer the question was crudely put he began despising the measured tone of his own voice i apologize for that but not for wanting an answer im asking you if you prostituted thats whats called rephrasing the question right counselor i have a right to know why damn it im sleeping with you im all but living with you as her stomach clutched and twisted she angled her head have i charged you anything ace her eyes flashed a warning as he stepped toward her dont put your hands on me now youve got a nerve mackade waltzing in here like it all belonged to you tossing my past up in my face like you were part of it well it doesnt all belong to you and you werent a part of it he stepped closer until he was toetotoe with her the storm flashed and burned in him around him yes or no when she started to shove him aside he pressed her back grabbed her chin in his hand she bared her teeth and her eyes shot daggers at him you think i want to know i have to know and im prepared to deal with whatever the answer is because im in love with you he jerked her chin higher im in love with you savannah her eyes filled overflowed so quickly his fingers went numb from the shock she reared back and shoved him with all her strength this is how you tell me she shouted were you a whore savannah i love you well go to hell jared i wont have you cheapening what i feel for you i hate that youd make me feel cheap when i hear it when i tell you what i wasnt sure you wanted to hear from me i love you so much id settle for anything you gave me even this dont he had to stop himself from springing forward when she reached for the door he couldnt touch her now knew he didnt deserve to please dont walk away youre right youre exactly right she stared through the screen at the home shed fought all of her life to make she closed her eyes and thought of the man behind her a man shed never have believed she could have suddenly she was exhausted beaten by her own heart i never sold myself she said quietly in a voice carefully picked free of emotion not even when i had to go hungry i could have there were plenty of opportunities and plenty of people who assumed i did but i didnt i didnt make the choice for myself i made it for bryan because he didnt deserve a mother who would sell herself for food or a nights rent she drew in a deep breath before she turned does that satisfy you jared he would have taken it all back if he could yet he knew that if it hadnt come out it would have festered and poisoned everything they had just as he knew that there was still more that had to be said had to be asked but not tonight can you understand that i hate knowing you had to make the choice that you were alone and in trouble i cant change anything about the last ten years and i wouldnt he stepped toward her slowly testing can you understand that i love you that ive just come to realize ive never loved a woman before and this terrible need i have for you is making me crazy he lifted a hand touched just the tips of her wet hair let me hold you savannah just hold you he took her gently closed her in his arms and rocked relief coursed through him when her arms finally came up from her sides and circled him i hurt you im sorry i didnt even know i could ashamed he pressed his lips to her hair i thought it was all me its gotten so huge i didnt think anybody else could feel like this let me plead insanity it doesnt matter she thought she would have crawled inside him if she could it doesnt matter now let me tell you again gently he tipped her head back looked into those dark damp eyes i love you savannah im so desperately in love with you he touched his lips to hers felt the tremor so helplessly in love with you it takes my breath away every time i see you she couldnt speak this was how she had once dreamed he would look at her with violent love in his eyes these were words shed refused to let herself dream of hearing she threw her arms around his neck and clung for her life youre trembling he murmured youre cold no no oh i love you i dont know how else to say it thatll do storms passing he could hear the thunder rolling away were going to have a good farmers rain a soaker the kind that means something he hooked an arm under her knees lifted her i want to make love with you and listen to the rain he was so gentle it seared her heart kissing her cheek her throat as he carried her to the room they shared when the door was closed he walked through the shadows and laid her down she heard the hiss of a match then candlelight flickered he peeled off her damp clothes stroked his hand over her skin and suddenly she felt fragile and nervous she knelt on the bed to unbutton his shirt and her fingers were clumsy he took them pressed them one by one to his lips there was the smell of rain and wet earth the whisper of thunder moving off the give of the mattress beneath her then there was only him murmurs and sighs drifted through the sound of pattering rain he was so tender with her so gentle her body seemed to flow through his hands like fragrant heated wax each time their lips met it was deeper and truer each time their bodies pressed it was softer and wanner a brush of fingertips the trail of quiet kisses and flesh quivered dazed with love they watched each other listened to the quickening rhythm of hearts he slid into her silkily his sigh merging with hers his body rising and falling with hers his lips meeting hers he felt her crest sweep through him a long slow undulating wave that carried him off in its wake chapter nine bryan loved spending time on the farm the animals the men the open air he still remembered the confusion and confinement of cities the places where they had moved and lived in small rooms where the windows always seemed to pulse with noise and the walls were so thin you could hear every laugh or curse from the people next door he hadnt minded the city really there had always been something to do somewhere to go and his mother had taken him to parks and playgrounds whenever she wasnt working he had vague memories of times when she had worked late into the night or late into the morning times when shed been tired a lot and sad too though he hadnt really understood why he remembered new orleans with the pulsing music and the slowtalking people he remembered his mother had kept a pot of red flowers on the windowsill sometimes hed sat at his mothers feet playing cars or reading picture books while she painted things painted people whod come by to sit in a little folding chair while she sketched their faces on big sheets of paper with charcoal or colored chalk that was when things had changed things had gotten better shed stopped working at night and that sad tired look had left her eyes now this was best of all having a house the way shed always promised having a yard and friends who could stay your friends because you were staying too friends like connor who was definitely cool even though some of the kids at school teased him and said rotten things about his old man maybe bryan sometimes thought it was because they didnt know what it was like to have no father at all the way he did but mom was enough she always made things work out always made sure they were a team as moms went he figured she was the coolest like the way shed asked him if he wanted to live in the cabin in the woods she hadnt just told him they would live there the way he knew some parents did things then when they had the cabin which was in his opinion the best place in the whole world shed let him pick out the stuff for his room the neat bunk beds the posters for the walls the big wood chest for his toys now he got to visit the farm whenever he wanted mostly shane was great he never minded if bryan wanted to hang out and ask question about things devin was okay too even if he was the sheriff he liked rafe and the way rafe would sometimes plunk himself down and wrestle with the dogs jared was kind of scary because he made bryan think about how it would be to have him around all the time like a father a guy to play ball with a man who came home after work every day and listened to what you wanted to say a man who kissed your mother in the kitchen like it was no big deal he wanted jared most of all and because he did bryan wished for him hard every night somehow whatever he wished for hard almost always came true on the farm the sun was bright warming ground that was damp from the nights rain the earlymorning fog had burned off and left the air clear and moist he was happy sitting on the dirt with the dogs and connor with the sound of adult voices never far off they were going to have sunday dinner at the mackades the men were cooking which bryan thought was a little weird but interesting do you think fred and ethelll have babies connor continued to stroke the golden fur of the dog nearest him as he considered the question they probably will thats what happens when people are married its the same for dogs i guess bryan gave a snort and delivered a punch to connors shoulder people dont have to be married to have a kid they just have to be stuck on each other if anyone else had made the comment connor would have flushed but because it was bryan he only nodded wisely then fred and ethel can have pups because theyre stuck on each other bryan looked toward the farmhouse through the kitchen window came the sound of mixed laughter i think jareds stuck on my mom connors pale gray eyes went wide are they having a baby no bryan hooked an arm around ethels neck it was a possibility hed given some thought to itd be cool if they did i mean you like having emma around dont you sure a brother would be neater but even a sister would be okay i think if there was one you know a baby jared would hang around like live with us sometimes its bad connor said quietly sometimes when a man lives with you its bad they argue and fight and they get drunk and things the idea of that had bryans brow furrowing but not all of them i guess not but connor was far from sure i dont want a man to live with us ever again connors voice was low and fierce not ever again understanding bryan shifted his arm from ethels neck to connors if your father tries to come back after he gets out of jail youll be ready well be ready he added with a dazzling smile you and me con yeah connor almost wished he had a chance to prove it you and me looks like theyre talking big talk savannah commented from the kitchen window connors never really had a close friend before hadnt been able to cassie thought with the way joe hassled everyone who came to the house neither has bry theyre good for each other she grinned when the boys started wrestling each other and the dogs all four would be filthy she was sure by the time dinner was ready that looks familiar devin stepped up behind the women tucked his hands in the back pockets of his jeans savannah did her best not to stiffen we spent a lot of sunday afternoons kicking up dirt we spent a lot of every afternoon kicking up dirt rafe said remember that sunday mom turned the hose on us with a sigh shane popped a radish into his mouth those were the days she was so ticked because gran and pop were coming to dinner and wed gotten into a fight wearing our best clothes you started it jared remembered swiped my baseball and lost it in the cornfield i borrowed your baseball shane told him and devin lost it in the field rafe lost it devin said mildly he was supposed to catch it you hit it wide pulled it rafe explained in disgust he could never pick his spot hell i couldnt before devin could take the argument any further regan held up her hands timeout i believe with this obvious example of family solidarity its an excellent time to make an announcement she smiled at rafe dont you think i think rafe took her hand brought it to his lips before pulling her close his grin was quick as lightning were having a baby there was a moment of utter silence before the explosion there was a quick whoop from shane who took it upon himself to scoop regan off her feet she had to be kissed rafe had to be punched and pummeled give me my wife rafe demanded in a minute shane kissed her again heartily then started to pass her to rafe jared intercepted gave her a quick swing regan was still laughing when she found herself in devins arms damn it give me my woman as they tussled and argued over the expectant mother savannah leaned back against the counter the mackades the next generation she murmured to cassie scary thought shell handle it cassie blinked back tears she can handle anything because everyone else was busy she scooted over to check on the pot roast herself savannah stepped forward leaned in to kiss jared on the cheek congratulations uncle jare he couldnt stop grinning rafes going to be a daddy with one brow arched savannah glanced over to where regan was still being passed from brother to brother and this i take it is the way you guys celebrate tossing women around we dont have a precedent its our first baby when he swung an arm around her shoulders savannah realized hed just said it all it would be a mackade baby and would belong to all of them it was something she thought about quite a bit as the celebration continued through dinner with constant and often ridiculous suggestions for child care baby names and fatherly duties it was odd for her to fully realize now when she was finally settled into a home of her own finally confident that bryan had the best she could give him that neither of them had ever known the fullness of family they had each other and that was important vital he was a happy welladjusted child she could see that as he sat beside her shoveling in food giggling at shanes idea of lulubelle mackade if the baby was a girl there was no doubt in her heart that her son was exactly as he should be and yet he had never known the joy or the problems of having uncles aunts grandparents siblings those were things she couldnt give him she hoped it was only she who had suddenly come to sense the lack are you feeling all right regan cassies voice was quiet amid the chaos of maledominated conversation wonderful i dont think ive ever felt better no queasiness no fatigue not any of the things the books warn us about i had them all running an absent hand over emmas curls cassie smiled not too bad really just enough so that when it came around the second time i knew what to expect how about you savannah sick as a dog for three months before bryan could reach over her plate she passed him the bowl of roast potatoes hed aimed for it was almost worth it though she winked at bryan three months regan gave a heartfelt shudder every day rain or shine savannah said cheerfully bry if you opened your mouth just a little wider you could probably fit three potatoes in at once he managed a sloppy grin with a full mouth its good just like mom used to make devin put in and heaped another helping of potatoes on bryans plate we used to have contests to see who could eat more of them jared usually won right jare yeah but hed stopped eating and he was looking at savannah oddly the kids going to break your record shane tossed a biscuit that jared was just quick enough to catch intrigued with the maneuver bryan snatched one and aimed it at connor who nabbed it before it hit the floor good save rafe commented sign him up you gonna play ball next year con i dont know connor broke off an end of the biscuit and shot a look at his mother under his lashes cons a better pitcher than any of our starters bryan cheerfully helped himself to another biscuit and buttered it lavishly he can drill it right in the pocket connor you never said you wanted to play ball the moment the words were out of cassies mouth she regretted them of course hed said nothing there had never been anyone to play ball with him and his academic achievements had equaled failure as a man in his fathers opinion i cant hit hardly anything connor mumbled reddening i can just throw a little since bryans been showing me how well have to work on your batting devin spoke casually after dinner we could start on your stance connors lips fluttered into a smile and that was answer enough a short time later the sounds of shouts and arguments rolled in from the barnyard and into the kitchen window with her hands filled with dishes cassie looked out devin was crouched behind connor and their hands were meshed on a wooden bat as jared threw underhand pitches its awfully nice of them to play with the kids like this and leave us stuck with the dishes savannah pointed out he who cooks doesnt clean regan filled the sink with hot water mackade rules its fair enough savannah allowed but as she glanced around the cluttered disordered kitchen with its piles of pots and mountains of dishes she wasnt sure whod come out on top of the deal do you mind if i ask regan caught herself laughed nervously its stupid savannah grabbed a dishcloth and prepared to dig in what well brows knit regan attacked the first plates i was just wondering since youve both been through it what its like the big guns i mean savannah glanced at cassie and grinned wickedly labor and delivery or a march through the valley of death oh its not that bad dont scare her immediately solicitous cassie set down stacked plates to rub regans shoulder really its not you want to tell her its a walk on the beach savannah asked then she can curse you and rafe during transition its a natural part of life cassie insisted then struggled with a chuckle that hurts like hell sorry i asked but regan blew out a breath when she realized she couldnt let it go so how long did it take for connor just over twelve hours for emma less than ten in other words savanna put in helpfully the rest of your life id tell you to shut up but i want to know how long it took you regan wrinkled her nose ten minutes right savannah picked up a dish thirtytwo funfilled hours thirtytwo stunned regan nearly bobbled a wet plate thats inhuman the luck of the draw savannah said lightly and the maternity ward i was in wasnt exactly firstclass wouldnt have mattered she shrugged it off babies come when they come youll get through it fine regan rafell be right there and unless your doctor has a line of profootball blockers holding them off the rest of the mackades will be there too you were alone regan murmured thats the way it shook down she glanced over when she spotted jared at the screen door game over no his eyes stayed on hers unreadable and deep i lost the draw to fetch beer ill get it cassie was already hurrying to the fridge do the kids want anything whatever they can get he took the sixpack and boxes of juice cassie handed him then left without another word no quicker way to get rid of a man than for women to talk about childbirth savannahs voice was light but there was a knot of worry at the back of her neck something had been in those eyes she thought that he hadnt wanted her to see i mentioned lamaze classes to rafe and he went dead white amused regan slipped another dish in the drainer but then he gritted his teeth hell do fine with a last glance at the screen door savannah picked up another plate he loves you thats the big one isnt it yeah with a dreamy little sigh regan plunged into the dishwater again thats the big one on the walk home savannah spied her first firefly glinting in the woods summer was coming she thought watching bryan dart ahead charging invisible foes she wanted it to come she wanted the heat the long hazy days the close airless nights what she wanted savannah realized was the passing of time a full year four full seasons in this place in this home with this man somethings on your mind she said quietly ive got a lot on my mind jared wished they could stay in the woods for a time stay where they could both feel the sorrows and needs of people who had died before either of them were born couple of cases driving me crazy painters cluttering up the office finalizing cassies divorce contemplating becoming an uncle youre being a lawyer mackade using words to cloud the basics i am a lawyer okay lets start there hold on a minute bry hit the tub she called out aw mom and hit it hard ace im right behind you he raced ahead and from the edge of the woods savannah watched the lights switch on one by one as bryan streaked through the house through the open window she could hear him singing miserably offkey and was satisfied that he was in his bathtime mode why are you a lawyer the question stumped him mainly because his mind was so far removed from it why am i a lawyer and try to answer in twenty thousand words or less because i like it the first answer was the simplest i like figuring out the best arguments wading through and studying both sides until i find the right arguments i like winning he moved his shoulders and because justice is important the system of justice however flawed is vital were nothing without it so you believe in justice and you like to argue and win she tilted her head at him which puts all of that into one sentence see how easy it is whats your point my point is that you also like to complicate things she touched a hand to his cheek what are you complicating now jared nothing because he needed to he took her wrist and pressed his lips into her palm im not complicating a thing i liked having you at the farm you and bryan crowded around the kitchen table with too many people talking at once and throwing biscuits and throwing biscuits i liked hearing you and regan and cassie clattering around the kitchen while we were playing ball outside typical she smiled a little youd say traditional malefemale placement sue me he gathered her close and there in the quiet he thought he could hear the struggle stranger against stranger hand to hand eternally right perhaps against right feel it he murmured yes fear she thought closing her eyes desperation and constant bleeding hope perhaps she could feel the echoes of it in the woods because shed known all those emotions so well have you ever asked yourself why theyre still here what they might have left to say or do the fights not over it never is she shook her head the needs not over the need to find home to find peace i suppose it never is but im finding it here when she started to draw back he tightened his grip i listened outside the door to the three of you talking in the kitchen it bothered me savannah hearing about you being alone when you had bryan it bothered me imagining that the way it bothered me when you said youd been sick all that time morning sickness is pretty common among pregnant women being sixteen alone sick and pregnant isnt common it sure as hell shouldnt be feeling sorry for me is a waste of time it was a long time ago now she did draw back and she saw his face but thats not exactly what youre feeling i dont know what im feeling nothing frustrated him more than not being able to see inside himself for the answers ive got questions i havent figured out yet how to ask you make me ask because you dont tell and yes i do feel sorry for you for the kid who was left to fend for herself and make choices for herself that no child should have to make i wasnt a child her voice was measured her shoulders were suddenly stiff i was old enough to get pregnant so i was old enough to face the consequences and the choice i made was mine alone no one else could have made it for me having bryan was one of the few right decisions i made i didnt mean that i didnt mean bryan seeing the heat in her eyes he gave her a quick shake i meant where to go what to do how to live god how to eat and damn it savannah you were a child you deserved better than what you got i got bryan she said simply i got better than i deserved he couldnt make her see what he wanted her to see for once he simply didnt have the words perhaps they were too simple i wonder what it would be like to create something like that boy and to love without restriction without ego she could smile now wonderful just wonderful are you coming home with me yeah he took her hand im coming home with you he thought about that kind of love and her kind of life as she slept beside him he would never have gone out and searched for a woman like her it bothered him a great deal to admit it even to himself she wasnt polished or cultured had no sheen of the sophistication he usually looked for in a woman that he had looked for jared reminded himself once and that had certainly been a pathetic mistake and yet didnt a man need a woman he understood a woman he knew there were huge pockets in savannahs life he neither understood nor knew large pieces of her that were separate from him tucked away in her memories a young girl pregnant and alone deserted by everyone she should have been able to count on he felt pity for that girl as well as and it scalded him to realize it a vague distrust where had she gone what had she done who had she been as much as he wanted to get beyond that his pride held him fast shed borne another mans child been other mens fantasies that thought stuck in the pride in the ego and refused to be shaken free his problem he knew it rationalized it debated it as she shifted beside him turning away rather than towards him he worried over it how many other men had she loved how many had lain beside her each wishing he was the only one yet even as he thought it he reached out to hold to possess her her body curled warm against his and he could smell her skin that earthy sensual fragrance she carried without the aid of perfumes he knew her routine now in the morning she would wake early but slowly as if sleep were something to eased out of like a warm bath she would touch him long strokes over the shoulders the back the arms and just when he began to tingle and heat she would rise out of bed she would arch her back with a lazy feline movement lift that long thick black hair up let it fall then as if there were no difference between a sleepy siren and a sleepy mother she would slip into a faded blue cotton robe and go out to wake bryan for school and often very often jared would lie in bed for long long moments after she padded across the hall aching he almost wanted to believe shed woven some sort of spell over him with her gypsy eyes and sultry smile and that gotohellandbackagain attitude she knew him better than he knew her knew his ghosts recognized them felt them she was the first woman who had walked in what he considered his woods and heard the murmurs of the doomed it linked her with him in a way that went beyond the physical even the emotional attraction it lifted it into the spiritual it lifted it beyond what he could fight even if he wanted to fight whatever it was that bound him to her gave him no choice but to keep moving on the same path toward her so he fell asleep with his arm hooked around her waist holding her close and dropped weightlessly into dreams there was pain in his hip where a mortar blast had sent him flying into the air and hurled him down again his head was aching his eyes were tearing it was so hard to focus hard to force himself to set one foot in front of the other he didnt remember entering the woods had he crawled to the trees or run into them all he knew was that he was terribly lost and terribly afraid his lieutenant was dead there were so many dead the boy from connecticut with whom hed shared last nights dinner with whom hed whispered long after the fires burned out was in pieces in a shallow ditch where the fighting had been so fierce that hell would have been a relief now he was alone he knew he had to find somewhere to rest someplace safe just for a while just for a little while his home wasnt so very far away just north into pennsylvania the maryland woods werent so very different from those near his farm maybe he could be safe here until he could find his way home again until this war that was supposed to have been an adventure and had become a thousand nightmares was over he had turned seventeen the month before and he had never tasted a womans lips unbearably weary he stopped to lean against a tree drew in ragged breath after ragged breath how could the woods be so beautiful so full of color and the smells of autumn how could that horrible noise keep going why wouldnt the guns stop blasting the men stop screaming when were they going to let him go home with a shuddering sigh he pushed off the tree he skirted a rock and with a burst of relief spotted a path just as he stepped toward it he saw the confederate gray he hesitated only a moment but whole worlds revolved inside him this was the enemy this was death this was the obstacle in the path leading to what he wanted most he shouldered his rifle even as the boy facing him mirrored the movement they shot poorly both of them but he heard the whine of the shell close enough to his ear to stop his heart for a full beat then he was charging even as his mirror image charged their terrified war cries echoed each other bayonets clashed the enemys eyes were blue like the sky that thought intruded as he felt the first agony of blade in flesh the enemys eyes were young and full of fear they fought each other like wild dogs even in the short time he had left he would remember little of it he remembered the smell of his own blood the feel of it as it poured out of his wounds he remembered waking alone alone in those beautiful autumn woods and then stumbling down the path crawling crying he would remember for all of the hours he had left he would remember the sight of the farmhouse just beyond the clearing the color and glint of the stone the slope of the roofline the smell of animals and growing things and he wept again for home someone was with him the face was older weathered set in a frown under a softbrimmed hat he thought of his father tried to speak but the pain as he was lifted was worse than death there were women around him shouts then whispers soft hands and firelight cool cloths and the pain slipped into numbness every word he spoke was a searing flame in his throat but he had so much to say and someone listened someone who smelled like lilacs and held his hand he needed to tell her hed been proud to be a soldier proud to serve and to fight he was trying to be proud to die even though the longing for home was fiercer than any of his wounds when he died jared woke his heart stuttering savannah stirred beside him and this time this time turned to him in sleep her arms came around him for tonight it was enough chapter ten with a stack of three paintings balanced in her arms savannah muscled open the door to jareds offices rain dripped from the bill of one of bryans baseball caps which shed slapped on before making the drive to hagerstown sissy glanced over then hopped up from her keyboard let me give you a hand with those thanks grateful savannah passed the three wrapped bundles over ive got more in the car ill just put these down and help you bring them in no no use both of us getting wet she took a quick scan of the freshly painted tealcolored walls the deep mauve settee and the leather library chairs coming along youre telling me sissy set the paintings down on the coffee table i feel like ive been working in a box and someone just opened the lid and let in air let me get you an umbrella at least i wouldnt be able to hold it besides im already wet be right back savannah dashed out and sprinted the half block to her car it was a hard driving rain but at least it was warm no one seemed to be worried about a spring drought anymore as mrs metz had been happy to inform her when they ran into each other at the post office this morning the weather however inconvenient at the moment was causing savannahs flowers to thrive by the time she got back in with the last of the paintings she was soaked to the skin and squishing in her shoes is the boss in she set the paintings down then took off the cap to run her fingers through her damp hair he might want to take a look before i hang these hes with a client sissy flashed a smile but im dying to take a look she snatched scissors off her desk okay sure youve got to live with them too i cant believe how fast all this has moved quickly she cut the twine on the top bundle once the boss makes up his mind he moves no fiddle no faddle no i love this she ended on a high tone of enthusiasm as she pulled back the heavy paper it was a street scene and the people in it were splashes of vivid color and movement the buildings were jumbled giving it a carelessly cheerful theme and they were awash with lacy balconies alive with trailing and spreading flowers on closer inspection sissy picked out a toetapping fiddler an enormous black woman in a flowing red caftan three small boys racing after a yellow dog she could almost hear the shouts and the music its wonderful tell me this ones going out here that was the idea surprised and flattered by the reaction savannah dragged a hand through her hair again its new orleans the french quarter i thought it would liven things up a bit in the waiting area i cant tell you how tired i was of looking at pale pink flowers in a gray vase i kept hoping id come in one morning and theyd have died during the night sissy chuckled to herself now this i could look at forever did you take art in college the innocent question had savannahs smile freezing no no i didnt go to college i had one semester of art sissy went on cheerfully holding up the painting and was told i had absolutely no sense of perspective squeaked by with a c when the phone rang she huffed a bit then tilted the painting against the table and went back to her desk to answer it foolish foolish savannah told herself to feel inadequate no she hadnt gone to college but she knew how to paint hadnt sissys reaction just proven it odd savannah thought that she should still be nervous after her work had been viewed and appreciated for most of her life shed had to convince herself that painting was could be nothing more than a hobby a personal indulgence those times when shed had to choose between buying paints and having lunch paints had usually won those days were over long over shed been incredibly lucky with her illustrations and enjoyed doing them intended to continue but the paintings were her selling bayou scenes and charcoal sketches to tourists was a far cry from selling something that had meant something to her when she saw it when she painted it smiling and damppalmed she dug through the tote shed brought along for her hammer and measuring tape shed already measured the wall on an earlier trip and now she found the center marked her spot lightly with a pencil and waited for sissy to hang up the phone should i wait or can i pound this in there now she held up a hanger now im dying to see it up with brisk efficiency savannah hammered in the support the frame was a simple natural cherry regans choice savannah had to admit as she adjusted the painting on the wall that it had been a good one bring the left corner up just a tad yeah good hands on hips sissy nodded good perfect its about time this place started looking more like the boss and less like his exwife savannah finished with a glance over her shoulder sissy wrinkled her nose lets just say she was very lowkey the kind of woman who never has a hair out of place never raises her voice never chips a nail she must have had something to have attracted jared cautious sissy cast a look up the steps she was beautiful in that donttouchmeivejustbeenpolished sort of way very classic sort of grace kelly without the warmth and humor and she was brilliant really not only in her profession but she spoke perfect french and played the piano beautifully she read kafka oh savannah struggled not to frown she wasnt entirely sure she knew who or what kafka was but she was sure shed never read it in her way she was admirable but about as entertaining as a dead frog in a millpond sissy beamed at savannah no one can accuse you of that she said and with a quick laugh picked up the ringing phone no savannah mused no one could accuse her of that not of being polished or brilliant or of reading kafka she could speak a little french if you counted the cajun variety refusing to be intimidated by the image of the woman jared had once chosen for his wife she unwrapped the next painting she hung a trio of small still lifes in the entranceway while sissy went back to work while the rain pounded outside and sissys keyboard clattered savannah began to enjoy the simple pleasure of decorating of choosing a space and bringing it to life by the time shed gotten to the second floor she was humming under her breath unwilling to hammer there while jared was with a client she leaned paintings against the walls shed chosen for them moving down the hallway and eventually into the office across from jareds the former office she thought of the former mrs mackade no she remembered not mrs mackade jared had said she hadnt taken his name the walls here were a deep rose the trim almost a jade reversing the theme from the lower office regan had turned it into a comfortable and efficient sitting room there was a desk of course but there were cozy chairs tables books and when she poked into a cabinet a coffee maker cups here savannah supposed jared could entertain or interview clients in a less formal atmosphere or perhaps he could use it to relax unwind or maybe he was considering taking on an associate it occurred to her then that she knew very little about his work or his plans or what his workday was like shed never asked savannah reminded herself and why should he discuss cases with her she knew nothing about the law except the problems shed had with it fighting to stay one step ahead of the system and keep her child he would have discussed them with his wife she thought then cursed herself for falling into that typical and pathetic mindset setting her thoughts on the job at hand again she stepped out into the hall just as jareds door opened ill have a draft of the contract sent out to you in a couple of days jared was saying then stopped looked and smiled hello savannah hello im sorry i was arranging the paintings you going to introduce me to this beautiful young woman jared or do i have to make my own moves savannah morningstar howard beels savannah morningstar thats a name that suits you the big barrel chested man of about fifty shot out a hand the size of a small ham and gripped savannahs his eyes a twinkling blue set in pockets and folds of creased skin were alight with male admiration you working for this shyster in a manner of speaking savannah recognized the look the squeeze shed seen and felt it hundreds of times before and after a quick survey she judged howard beels as harmless she let her smile warm because she knew he would take it home with him and sigh you hire this shyster howard he gave a gutrattling laugh a man needs a clever lawyer in this dirty old world howard told her jared heres been mine for what is now five years just about jared murmured intrigued by the easy way savannah handled and entertained one of his top clients what do you do howard oh a little of this a little of that he had yet to let go of her hand and he winked im a dabbler how about you im a dabbler myself savannah told him and made him laugh again savannahs an artist jared put in the next time you come in howard youll see her work on the walls is that so his sharp eyes homed in on the painting leaning against the wall behind her that your work there yes he released her hand to cross to it despite his size he hunkered down easily to study it its right nice he decided liking the way the colors flowed and the way the flowers shed chosen to paint seemed crowded together more alive than perfect how much something like this go for savannah shifted her weight to one hip as much as i think i can get she said dryly howard slapped his knee appreciatively before he straightened i like this girl jared im going to give you my card honey he reached in his jacket pocket and pulled one out you give me a call hear i think we could have ourselves a negotiation over a picture or two ill do that howard she glanced at the card but it gave no clue to his profession ill be sure to do that dont let any grass grow under your feet either he gave her a last wink before turning to jared ill expect those papers savannah smiled at his retreating back quite a character she murmured you sure handled him jared observed im used to handling characters she tucked the card away ive finished downstairs if i wouldnt be in your way i could finish up here sure he leaned against the doorway watching her as she lifted the painting behind her a little more to the right he suggested howards got an eye for the ladies yes i gathered that satisfied savannah set the painting down and prepared to hammer in the hanger and id venture to say hes been faithful to his wife for oh twentyfive years twentysix in may three kids four grandchildren he has an eye for the ladies jared repeated but hes one of the shrewdest businessmen i know real estate mostly buys and sells develops he owns a couple of small hotels and the lions share of a fivestar restaurant really hmm hes on the arts council works with the western maryland museum as the card in her pocket suddenly took on more weight savannah nearly bashed her thumb thats interesting carefully she set down the hammer it looks like i was in the right place at the right time he wouldnt have told you to call him if he didnt mean it im not sure how an artist might feel about having her work in hotels and restaurants and law offices she closed her eyes a moment id feel fine about it she hung the painting stepped back to study it id feel just fine no artistic temperament ive never been able to afford artistic temperament and if you could id still feel fine about it she turned then to study his face why wouldnt i i suppose im wondering why you wouldnt want or ask for more she wasnt sure it was only art that he was speaking of now but the answer had to remain the same because im happy with what ive got his lips curved slowly as he reached out to touch her face youre a complicated woman savannah and amazingly simple its a fascinating mix why dont i take you to lunch thats a nice offer but i want to get this done if youre going i could hang the pieces in your office while youre out why dont i stay and we can order in ill watch you hang the pieces in my office that would work she tucked her restless hands into her pockets then pulled them out actually theres something id like you to see you didnt pick it but i thought if you liked it you might want it in your office curious he watched the nerves jitter in her eyes lets take a look okay she walked down the hallway to where shed left the painting still wrapped if you dont like it its no big deal she shrugged and shifted past him to carry it into his office herself either way its a gift she set it on his desk stepped away jammed her hands into her pockets again no charge a present he stroked a hand over her shoulder ts he went to the desk for scissors to cut the twine the idea of a present from her delighted him but when he folded back the protective paper and saw it the quick smile faded and savannahs heart sank the woods were deep and thick filled with mystery and moonlight black trunks gnarled burled rose up into twisted branches that held leaves just unfurled with spring there were hints of color wild azalea and dogwood gleamed in that ghostly light the rocky ground was carpeted with leaves that had fallen the autumn before and the autumn before that a sign of the continuous ebb and flow of life he could see the trio of rocks where he often sat the fallen trunk where he had once sat with her and in the distance just a hint through the shadows was a glow of light that signaled his home for a moment he wasnt sure he could speak when did you do this i just finished it a few days ago a mistake she thought cursing herself a sentimental foolish mistake its just something ive worked on in my spare time like i said its no big deal if you dont like it before she could finish his head came up and his eyes swirling with emotion met hers i cant think of anything ive ever been given that could mean more its the way it looked the night we made love for the first time the way its looked countless times ive been there alone her heart stuttered then crept up to lodge in her throat i was going to paint it the way it would have been in autumn during the battle but i wanted to do it this way first i wasnt sure youd im glad you like it he reached out cupped her face in his hands i love you savannah her lips curved under the gentle caress of his then parted heated as he steadily deepened the kiss his fingers tangled in her hair still damp from the rain her arousal was slow and sweet i should hang it for you mmm quite suddenly as her body pressed to his and her mouth began to move he had a much better idea he tucked an arm around her to hold her steady and reached over his desk to pick up the phone sissy why dont you go to lunch now yeah take your time savannahs gaze followed his hand as he replaced the receiver then her eyes shifted blandly to his face if you think youre going to seduce me here in your office have me rolling over your fancy new carpet with you while your secretarys out to lunch jared walked over closed the door locked it arched a brow yes she tossed her hair back leaned a hip on the desk youre absolutely right he shrugged off his jacket hung it on the brass coat hook by the door his tie followed keeping his eyes on hers he crossed back one by one he loosened the buttons of her shirt your clothes are damp its raining very slowly very deliberately he peeled the bright cotton away his eyes never left hers as he slipped a finger under the front hook of her bra never left hers when he felt the quick quiver of her skin and heard the little catch in her breathing i want you every time i see you i want you when i dont see you with a flick of his thumb and forefinger he unsnapped the hook i want you even after ive had you lightly he traced his fingertips over the curve of her breast you obsess me savannah the way no one and nothing ever has she reached out for him but he shook his head and lowered her arms to her sides again no let me just let me his thumbs brushed over her nipples his eyes stayed focused on her face i lose my mind when i touch you he murmured this time i want to watch you lose yours fingers thumbs palms cruised over her rough then gentle tender then demanding as if he was refusing to let any one mood rule driven she pulled at him tried to tug him closer but each time she did he stopped patiently lowered her arms until she had no choice but to grip the edge of the desk and let him have his way no one had ever made love to her like this as if she were essential as if she were all there was and all there needed to be as if her pleasure were paramount pinpoint sensations percolated along her skin chased by others whispersoft then still more that seeped slyly through flesh to blood and bone she arched back on a keening moan when he closed his teeth over her shot her to some rugged ground on the border between pleasure and pain just take me her arms whipped around him her body straining pulsing but he took her hands locked them to his as he kissed her toward delirium her mouth was a feast full of hot flavor and a hunger that matched his own but this time he wasnt content to sink into it or her he used his teeth to torment his tongue to tease until her breath came in tearing gasps let me touch you she demanded not this time not yet he closed her hands over the edge of the desk again held them there while his mouth raced to her throat down her neck over those tensed and beautiful shoulders im going to take you savannah he eased back because he wanted her to see his face and the unshakable purpose there im going to take you inch by inch the way no one ever has for her pleasure he told himself but he knew a part of it was his own pride he wanted to show her that no man before and no man after could make her feel what he could so he showed her traveling like lightning down her torso her flesh damp now not from rain but from passion she gave herself over to him as she had never done with any man surrender complete she braced herself on the desk and let him ravage her body and mind he tugged off her shoes she let her head fall back let herself moan deep as he eased her jeans low on her hips caressed that revealed flesh with his lips she shuddered nearly sobbed as his hands kneaded and his mouth closed over her fire to fire she crested fast and hard terrifying wonderful he never stopped and as the pleasure whipped her ruthlessly higher she prayed he never would naked stripped of clothes and all defenses she could do nothing but experience absorb and give hed never known this kind of desire to take and to take knowing as he did that he was filling her with unspeakable pleasure the blood swam in his head as he felt her peak yet again heard that breathless cry catch in her throat the strong muscles in her legs were quivering he ran his tongue over them lingering over the symbol shed branded herself with before making his way purposely greedily up that long body her eyes were closed he used his mouth only to keep her poised and ready for him as he stripped off his shirt he toed off his shoes whipped his trousers aside and dragged her to the floor the animal that had been pacing restlessly inside him sprang free he drove himself into her mindlessly shuddering with a dark thrill when she cried out his name hissing with hot pleasure as her nails scraped his back it was all heat and speed and plunging bodies a rhythmic tribal beat of flesh against flesh the blood hammered in his head his heart his loins relentlessly she arched up to him straining straining his vision grayed his world contracted he emptied himself into her savannah thought if she really tried she might be able to crawl to where her clothes were heaped and she would try she told herself in just another minute or two right now it was so lovely and decadent to lie there on the antique carpet in jareds quietly elegant office with his body heavy on hers she had been she realized thoroughly and mindnumbingly ravished as exciting as making love with him had been before this was a different level entirely she certainly hoped they would strive for it now and again in the future i have to get up she murmured why to make certain im not paralyzed did i hurt you she kept her eyes closed let her lips curve another few minutes of that and youd have killed me making the effort she found the energy to stroke a hand through his hair thank you anytime he let out a long heartfelt sigh before he pressed a kiss to her throat of course i dont know how im ever going to work in here again moaning a little he rolled off her ill have a client sitting in the chair while i go over the details of his case and ill get a flash of you leaning naked against the desk she laughed then discovered she really did have to crawl her legs might never support her again hell get suspicious when you get a stupid grin on your face and start drooling spent jared reached for his shirt he angled his head to get a glimpse of her tattoo hell of a way to kick off the new color scheme didnt you ever kick off the old one he had to concentrate on remembering how to button his shirt so it took him a minute the snort of laughter came first you mean me and barbara im not sure she ever unbuttoned her doublebreasted blazer in here not her style in her underwear savannah turned to study him you were married to her right thats what it said on the license why it has to say that its the law why were you married to her we had a lot in common i thought he shrugged it off we both wanted to establish ourselves in our respective professions knew a lot of the same people attended a lot of the same functions it disturbed him still how empty it sounded when he pulled things apart and looked at all the pieces she was a sensible reasonable and sophisticated woman thats what i wanted or thought i did a kind of contrast to the hotheadedtroublemaker image id carved out for myself when i was younger you wanted dignity still sitting on the floor savannah buttoned her shirt thats accurate enough it seemed important then its still important it always is though she realized it would sound a bit foolish while she tugged herself into her jeans she said it anyway i always wanted it too not in the doublebreastedsuit sort of way not my style just in the way people look at you what they see when they do she pulled on a shoe thats why i like living here i can start fresh we all look back he walked over to the coatrack for his tie its human nature i dont she said it almost fiercely as she pulled on the second shoe not anymore he gave his full attention to the tying of his tie theres no one of all the people youve known the people whove touched you she started to answer lightly but then it struck her he didnt mean people he meant men and she remembered what he had said as he made love to her made her churn and shiver the way no one ever has and so she thought hurt that was the crux of it you mean lovers you said lovers i said people i know what you said jared no theres no one who was important enough to look back to bryans father he nearly said it nearly asked but it stuck in his throat in his pride youre angry he stated noting the glint in her eye it just crossed my mind that what happened here was a kind of demonstration a chestbeating male sort of thing to illustrate that youre better than anyone i might have had before now his own eyes glinted thats a remarkably stupid observation dont tell me im stupid she snapped it out then managed to pull herself back under control dont let it matter she reminded herself dont let it sting you can relax jared you proved your point youre an extraordinary lover right over the top she sauntered over to brush a hand over his tensed jaw i enjoyed every minute of it but now i dont have time to hang your paintings ive got some errands to run before i head back home he put a hand on her arm he understood her well enough now to know that careless arrogance was one of her ways of covering anger i think we have something to talk about itll have to wait reaching behind him she flipped open the lock weve eaten up your lunch hour and i imagine sissyll be breezing back any minute she gave him a light careless kiss before shaking her arm free we have something to talk about he repeated fine you get it all worked out in your head and well talk about it tonight knowing she was goading him she curved her lips in a cocky smile thanks for the demonstration mackade it was memorable she wouldnt have gotten two feet if sissy hadnt rushed in below hey savannah she called up cheerfully the way its coming down out there youre going to want to trade your car in for an ark then id better get moving savannah said and walked down the stairs without looking back chapter eleven he bought flowers jared wasnt sure whether he was apologizing or hed simply gotten into the habit of picking them up once or twice a week because savannah always looked so surprised and pleased when he walked in with a bouquet he didnt like to think the clutch of latespring blooms was an apology because he didnt think hed been completely wrong technically he hadnt asked hed only intimated a question and why the hell shouldnt he ask he wanted to know more about her the who and what and why of her past not just the pieces she let drop from time to time but the whole picture of course his timing and delivery had been poor he could admit that he could even admit that it had nipped at his temper that shed seen through him so easily but the bottom line was he had a right to know they were going to have a calm reasonable talk about just that perhaps because he was so primed so ready he found himself simmering when he drove up the lane and saw that her car was gone where the hell was she it was after six he stood by his car frowning looking over the land the rain had left the tumbling flowers on the bank vivid and wet the azaleas shed planted had lost most of their blossoms but their leaves were a rich and glossy green he remembered the first day hed seen her digging in the earth with pots of flowers surrounding her and the rocky neglected bank waiting shed done something here he thought those roots shed talked about were still shallow but shed dug them in he needed to believe that she had made that commitment and found comfort in the green of the grass she preferred to mow herself in the mixed colors of the blooms she tended religiously in the woods beyond that they both seemed to share on such a deep personal level he saw bryans bike standing beside the walkway a bright orange frisbee that had ended its flight in the middle of the sloping lawn a wheelbarrow full of mulch parked beside the porch details he mused little details that made a home and it hit him suddenly and forcefully that he wanted needed it to be his home not just a place where he left a few of his things so that it was convenient to spend the night home he didnt want savannah to be just the woman he loved and made love with hed failed at marriage once and had been sure so sure that he would never put himself in the position where he could fail at something so personal and public again hadnt he told himself he would be content to drift along in this relationship but hed been lying to himself almost from the beginning because he hadnt been content and didnt want to drift so he poked at her prodded subtly and not so subtly for those answers to who she was where shed been while part of him the part that was pride and heart was wounded every time she didnt simply volunteer the answers he wanted her to confide in him to share with him every part of her that had been that was that would be he needed her to turn to him when she was troubled or sad or when she was happy he wanted jared realized drawing a slow steady breath he wanted her to marry him have children with him grow old with him he started up the walkway pausing to lay a hand on bryans bike he wanted the boy that too was fresh and revealing news he didnt want bryan to be savannahs son but their son helping bryan with his homework boning up on baseball cheering from the bleachers at a game jared realized hed gotten used to those things looked forward to them looked forward to that quick grin the shouted greeting but it wasnt enough it didnt make them family love would hed grown to love the boy in a very short time without even realizing it marriage would not just the legal contract jared reflected the promise he and barbara had broken that promise and had proceeded to negate the legal contract without flinching with another all very clean very tidy very civilized wasnt that the core of it there was nothing very civilized about the way he felt about savannah or bryan he felt protective proprietary possessive they were difficult emotions untidy emotions wonderful calmer now that hed sorted through the problem and its solution he went into the house there were shoes where there shouldnt be books and glasses and toys scattered instead of in their proper place a pair of earrings tossed on a table a trail of mud that hadnt been quite scraped off on the mat it was home but where the hell were they hed grown accustomed to finding them there bryan in the yard or poring over his baseballcard collection in bis room the radio should have been blaring or the tv turned up too loud she should have been in the kitchen or in her little studio in the back or taking one of her cat naps on the sofa he went into the kitchen laid the flowers down on the table no note no hastily scrawled explanation tacked to the refrigerator frowning he laid his briefcase beside the flowers the least she could have done was leave him a note theyd agreed to talk hadnt they he had reams to talk about and she wasnt even here he looked in her studio a half glass of watereddown lemonade stood on her worktable near a clever sly sketch of a flying frog under other circumstances it would have made him smile his mood darkening by the minute he headed up and upstairs dragging off his tie he walked into her bedroom her bedroom he thought sizzling by god that was going to change he tossed the tie on the bed followed it with his suit coat they were going to have a long serious discussion he and savannah and she was going to listen he grumbled to himself as he changed into jeans and hung his suit in the closet amid her clothes his teeth were set one of the first things they were going to do was add another closet a man deserved his own damn closet in fact they were going to add on another bedroom one big enough for his things as well as hers and another bathroom while they were at it because they were going to have more children and an office she wasnt the only one who needed work space then he was going to build bryan a tree house the kid should have a tree house they needed a garden shed for her tools and the lane needed work well he would see to those things hed see to them because he was going insane jared admitted and sat down on the edge of the bed he hadnt even told her they were getting married and he already he was adding on to the house what was he getting so worked up about why was he so angry with her with himself panic he wondered little licks of fear worry that when he mentioned marriage she would laugh and tell him that wasnt the kind of thing that interested her dragging his hands through his hair he rose she was going to have to get interested he decided and fast he might have calmed again might have gone reasonably downstairs and started dinner for the three of them he might have done that it was in his mind when he noticed the box on her dresser he caught the glint of belt buckles big showy buckles rodeo he lifted one and studied the embossed horse and rider her fathers things shed received her fathers assets and she hadnt told him there wasnt much the prizes jim morningstar had won years before bits and pieces of a man who had obviously traveled light and without too much sentiment there was a larger box beside the dresser old worn boots a battered hat a few articles of clothing that were still folded as if she hadnt touched them he saw the letter from his colleague in oklahoma the standard cover for the dispensation of effects the itemized list the offer to assist if there were any questions jared shifted it aside and found the photographs most were crinkled as if theyd been carelessly shoved in drawers badly packed in a move he saw jim morningstar for the first time an impressive candid shot of a man face hard and set eyes narrowed as he sat a horse in a high narrow stall the dark coloring the high cheekbones savannah had inherited but there was little else in this tough leathery face that had been passed to her unless it was the set of that chin he mused the set that warned that if life aimed a fist this one would meet it straight on he found another poorly framed of the same man standing beside a young savannah jareds lips curved as he studied her she was maybe thirteen fourteen he thought tall her body tucked into jeans and a plaid shirt already curving her hair raining out of a cowboy hat she looked straight at the camera her lips hinting at that knowing womans smile shed have in later life she stood hipshot a certain arrogance in the stance one of her hands rested lightly on her fathers shoulder jim morningstar had his arms folded over his chest he didnt touch his daughter there was another of savannah a still younger savannah astride a horse it was a classic pose the buckskincolored horse rearing up the rider with her hat swept off her head and lifted high in one hand she looked jared thought as if she would dare anything there were more of morningstar with other mengrinning leatherfaced men in hats and boots and denim backgrounds of corrals stables horses always horses it played through his mind that they might clear space for a paddock use the barn at the farm and get a horse or two savannah obviously loved them and bryan might every thought leaked out of his head as he stared at the last photo yes she would have been about sixteen though her body was fully a womans clad in a snug tshirt tucked into tight jeans yet the face had a softness a slight fullness that announced that the girl hadnt quite finished becoming a woman yet she was laughing the camera had frozen her in that fullthroated moment he could almost hear it she was wrapped around a man and the man was wrapped around her their arms were entwined their faces were laughing at the camera the mans hat was pushed back on his head revealing curls of shaggy blond hair he was tanned lean tall his eyes would have been blue or perhaps green it was hard to tell from the snapshot but they were light the corners crinkled with the smile the mouth that was cocked crookedly in that smile had been passed on to bryan this was bryans father jared felt his anger begin to pulse this was the man a man he repeated in his head not a boy the face was undeniably handsome even striking but it didnt belong to a teenager this man had seduced a sixteenyearold girl then abandoned her and nothing had been done morningstar had kept the photo because jared thought with a tightlipped snarl hed known and nothing had been done savannah watched him from the doorway her emotions had been on a roller coaster all day this looked like one more dip shed wanted to forget the edginess the anger shed felt when she left jareds office shed hoped to come home find him here and share with him her small triumph in selling howard beels three paintings with a very good possibility of more she and bryan had cackled about it all the way home over howard himself and the way hed hemmed and hawed over what she considered a highly inflated asking price and settled on an amount that had been considerably more than shed anticipated shed even stopped off and bought a bottle of champagne so that she and jared could celebrate so that she could celebrate with him the fact that her longburied wish of painting for a living was working its way to the surface but she could see there would be no celebration now not with that look on jareds face as he studied what her father had left her she didnt know where his anger came from but she had a feeling she was going to find out the hell with it she thought and pushed away from the door jamb lets get it over with not much of an estate huh she waited until his head came up until his gaze shifted to hers the fury in them almost buckled her knees i imagine most of your clients have a bit more to deal with he knew how to take things one step at a time to start at one point and work his way to the heart when did you get the shipment a week or two ago she shrugged then walked over to the window to look down brys down in the yard we picked up the kittens hes in heaven jared mackade also knew how to stay on a point a week or two you didnt mention it what was to mention i took out the check and gave it to that broker you recommended i didnt feel like dealing with the rest so i put it aside until this morning i guess ill put the buckles away for bryan he might want them one day the clothesll go to charity i suppose why didnt you tell me why should i have she turned back vaguely annoyed vaguely curious its not a big deal no longlost lottery tickets or pouch of gold dust just some old clothes older boots and papers and photographs yeah a few he wasnt big on souvenirs theres one of him in the chute i like it shows who he was always gearing up for the next ride i figured bryan might like to have that too and this one jared held up the snapshot of savannah and the cockily smiling cowboy she lifted a brow shook her head i dont know how i got into those jeans look im going to throw some burgers on the grill when jared shifted into her path she was genuinely surprised she tilted her head studied him and waited have you shown this to bryan no do you intend to no i dont think he cares what his mother looked like at sixteen he would care what his father looked like she could almost feel her blood slow go sluggish he doesnt have a father damn it savannah are you going to tell me this isnt bryans father im going to tell you that isnt bryans father a couple of rolls in the hay doesnt make a man a father dont slice words with me its a very important distinction in my book lawyer mackade and since this seems to be a crossexamination ill make it clear and easy i had sex with the man in the picture youre holding i got pregnant end of story the hell it is furious he slapped the picture down on the dresser your father knew he wouldnt have kept this otherwise yeah that occurred to me when i found it and the hurt had come with it but it had been slight and easily dispatched so what so why wasnt anything done this isnt a kid were talking about he had to be over twentyone i think he was twentyfour maybe twentyfive its hard to remember and you were a minor he should have been prosecuted after your father broke his neck savannah took a deep breath in the first place my father knew me he knew that if id slept with someone it was my choice i was a minor technically but i knew exactly what i was doing it wasnt a mistake or an accident i wasnt forced and i dont appreciate you casting blame of course theres blame jared shot back that son of a bitch had no right touching a girl your age then taking off when there were consequences her eyes lit bryan is not a consequence you know damn well thats not what i meant pulling both hands through his hair he paced away theres no going back and righting wrongs at this point i want to know what you intend to do now i intend to cook hamburgers youre welcome to stay or youre welcome to go dont take that attitude with me its the attitude ive got then she sighed jared why are you gnawing at this thing i slept with a man ten years ago i forgot him he forgot me to illustrate she picked up the photo and dropped it carelessly in the wastebasket beside the dresser thats that just that simple it was that jared realized exactly that that gnawed at him he didnt mean anything to you thats right you conceived a child with him savannah that boy whos down in the yard playing with his kittens how can you just dismiss that temper streaked through her youd prefer a different story wouldnt you jared a different story you could live with one about the poor innocent neglected girl looking for love seduced by an older man betrayed abandoned isnt that what happened you dont know who i was what i was or what i wanted you dont want to know not really because when you do when you hear it itll stick in your craw how many men has she been with can i believe her when she tells me she didnt sell herself even her own father didnt stand by her so what does that tell me now that i look back i remember she was ready to hit the sheets with me from the getgo what kind of a woman have i got myself tangled up with isnt that what youre wondering jared im wondering why there are so many things you dont tell me why you shrug off ten years of your life and how they affected you and yes im wondering what kind of woman you are she threw her head back figure it out she started to storm out then came up hard toetotoe with him keep out of my way im in your way and youre in mine and its long past time to settle this you say you love me but you pull back every time i touch a nerve every time i want a clear picture of what brought you to this point in your life i brought me here thats all you need to know its not all i need to know you cant build a future without drawing on the past i can i have if you cant jared its your problem you know what youre doing she tossed the question at him youre harping on a face in a photograph youre insulted by it threatened by it thats ridiculous is it its all right for you to have been married before to have had other women in your life i havent asked you how many or who or why have i its all right for you to have been wild and reckless to have sauntered around town with your brothers looking for trouble or making it thats just dandy boys will be boys but with me its different the problem is you got tangled up with me before you thought it through now you want to shift the pieces around see if you can make me into more of what seems suitable to the man you are now youre putting words in my mouth and youre wrong i say im right and i say the hell with you mackade the hell with you you want a victim or you want a flower or someone who looks just right at some fundraiser or professional event youve come to the wrong place i dont read kafka what in the sweet hell are you talking about im talking about reality the reality is i dont need this kind of grief from you his eyes narrowed its not just about what you need not anymore thats reality savannah i dont have to justify wanting to know how you could toss out that photograph or dismiss your fathers things and not even tell me you had them i dont have to justify asking you what you want from yourself from me from us or telling you what i want what i expect and intend to have thats everything everything or nothing down to ultimatums are we looks that way think about it he suggested and strode furiously out steaming she stood where she was she listened to the door slam below it took every ounce of willpower she had not to race to the window to watch him maybe to call him back minutes later she heard the sound of his car so that was that savannah thought all or nothing he had a nerve demanding she give him all leave herself nothing to fall back on nothing to cushion a fall shed been there once and the bruises had plagued her for years by god she wasnt going back steadying herself she went downstairs she ignored the flowers on the table the champagne chilling in the refrigerator maybe shed drink it herself later she mused as she took out some hamburger maybe shed drink the whole damn bottle and get herself a nice fizzy buzz it would be better than thinking better than hurting better even than this simmering anger that was still hot in her blood but when the door slammed and she looked around she hated herself for the stab of disappointment when she realized it was her son is jared mad at you why i could tell uneasy bryan sat down propped his elbows on the table he stopped to look at the kittens and stuff but he wasnt paying attention and he said he couldnt stay i guess hes mad at me are you mad at him too yeah slapping patties together was a fine way to release a little violence pretty mad does that mean youre not stuck on him anymore she looked over and her own temper cleared enough that she could see the worry in bryans eyes what are you getting at bry he moved his shoulders kicked his feet well youve never been stuck on anybody before hes mostly always here and he brings you flowers and hangs around with me you kiss each other and stuff thats true well con and i thought maybe you were going to get like married a quick arrow shot straight into her heart oh i thought it would be kind of cool you know because jareds cool she put the patties aside to give herself time she ran water washed her hands and dried them thoroughly all the while all she could think was what had she done to her little boy bry you know that people kiss each other all the time without getting married youre smart enough to know that adults have relationships close relationships without getting married either yeah but if theyre really stuck on each other they do right sometimes she skirted the table to lay a hand on his shoulder but its not always enough to love someone how come because where was the answer because people are complicated anyway jareds mad at me not at you you can still be pals i guess youd better go out and make sure those kittens keep out of trouble im going to fire up the grill okay he dragged his feet a little as he started toward the door i was thinking if you got married hed be sort of like sort of like what she asked sort of like my father bryan moved his shoulders again in a gesture so very much like her own when she blocked off hurt another shaft of pain shot through her i just thought it would be cool chapter twelve bryans wistful statement dragged at her mind and spirits all through the evening to make it up to him for a disappointment she felt unable to control she made the casual meal into their own private celebration all the soda he could drink french fries made from scratch wild involved and ridiculous plans on how they would spent the fortune they would amass from selling her paintings trips to disney world werent enough they decided they would own disney world box seats at ball games for pikers they would purchase the baltimore orioles and bryan would naturally play at short savannah kept up the game until she was reasonably sure both of them had forgotten that what bryan really wanted was jared then she spent the night staring at the ceiling thinking of all the wonderful hideous ways to pay jared mackade back for putting a dent in her boys heart hers wasnt all that important she knew how to hammer it out time and work and the home shed continue to make would all help she didnt need a man to make her whole never had she would see to it that her son never felt the lack of a father but she would punish jared for raising bryans hopes the bastard had made himself part of their lives flowers damn him playing catch in the yard taking bryan over to the farm awakening her in bed the way no one damn him again no one ever had then looking down at her from his lofty lawyers height questioning her morals and her actions and her motives making her feel more then making her feel less than shed ever been making her question herself he wasnt going to get away with it without realizing it she shifted to the center of the bed so that it wouldnt feel so empty he couldnt worm his way into their lives then start making demands who was she where had she been what did she want she didnt owe him any answers and she was going to prove it hed wormed his way in all right she thought scowling at the ceiling hed made her feel foolish and inadequate and for the first time in ten very long years vulnerable now he thought he could worm his way out again because she wasnt just exactly what he preferred in a she sneered at the word in a wife she hated him for that really hated him for making her start to think start to hope and even plan along those lines without her even being aware of it until bryan brought it up she hadnt realized she was dreaming just a little about happyeverafter like the fairy tales she illustrated with their strong and passionate princes it was embarrassing it was humiliating a woman like her a woman who had managed through sheer will and grit to shrug off the bruises life handed out to be brought this low by a man shed survived alone shed gone hungry worked until she was dizzy with fatigue had taken jobs that scraped at her pride shed been turned out by her own father when she needed him most and none of that not one of the painful or difficult experiences in her life had ever left her as low as this and none of that she had made certain had ever brought bryan one moments sadness she took a deep breath then another she would show jared mackade just what kind of woman she was the kind of woman who didnt need him jared decided brooding on the front porch with a beer on a saturday afternoon wasnt such a bad thing he was almost enjoying it it was a beautiful day and he was pleasantly fatigued from the mornings work his brothers were with him and it was a good feeling to have all of them there just passing an hour he mused at home watching the grass grow and the dogs race over it maybe just maybe in a little while hed stroll on over to the cabin he figured hed given her time enough to stew to calm down and see reason hed given himself almost enough time as well he was almost ready not quite but almost ready to admit hed been somewhat heavyhanded maybe just the slightest bit unreasonable still shed been ridiculous accusing him of being threatened by a photograph of wanting a different kind of woman of not being satisfied with her because she didnt read kafka god knew where shed come up with that he didnt appreciate the comparison of her life with his either made him sound like a narrowminded sexist which he certainly was not it was different that was all talking to himself devin commented as he whittled as a piece of wood been doing it since he got here yesterday shane yawned and kicked back in his chair you ask me savannah kicked his butt out that and rafes snorting laugh snagged jareds attention she did not i left to make a point yeah rafe winked at devin what point was that eyes narrowed jared tipped back his beer that shed better start seeing things the way they are this statement was greeted by hoots his way rafe pointed out it always has to be his way or no way bull unoffended jared crossed his ankles it just has to be the right way from his perch on the top step devin shifted leaned his back against the post so what was she doing wrong she holds back i get a call from howard beels this morning thanking me for introducing them seems she went over there yesterday and he bought three of her paintings just thinking of it had him simmering again does she tell me no what kind of relationship is that i dont get anything out of her without a direct question and then she only answers half the time amused shane stretched his arms and i just bet youve been full of questions too what happened then what did you do what chain of events led to that and where were you on the night in question jareds punch would have been stronger if shane hadnt been a full arms length away i dont interrogate her i ask i want to know about her a man has a right to know the woman hes going to marry rafe choked on a gulp of beer when did that happen i knew it with a heavy sigh shane flipped the top of the cooler and got out a beer for himself i just knew it eyes bland devin studied jared you asked savannah to marry you no i didnt get a chance to tell her tell her now devin grinned typical you might try to see my side of it jared grumbled i realized thats what i want i was thinking about it going over it and then i see shes gotten the effects from her father she hadnt told me it had come there was a photograph of her with bryans father hmm rafes comment went for all of them when i asked her about it she got defensive hostile witness shane murmured and earned a glare she tossed it out jared continued like it meant nothing maybe thats just what it meant devin put in look the bastard got her pregnant then abandoned her her father kicks her out shes sixteen for gods sake it means something but she wont come out with it she wont tell me what she does is start accusing me of idiotic things then she says get this she says that i figure it was all right for me to sow wild oats or whatever to get in trouble and kick some butt but i expect her to be untouched or a victim or words to that effect its insulting rafe regarded the lip of his beer bottle its true the hell it is sorry bro you pass the bar buy yourself a couple lawyer suits do you want me to break your nose again in a minute anyway after a while you decide its time to get married so you pick out an ice queen one with no baggage no secrets no noticeable flaws you know why temper percolating jared eyed him why dont you tell me because the image worked for you it didnt take you long to realize the woman didnt because youre pretty sharp most of the time now savannah theres a woman with baggage some secrets a few flaws the image is a little hard to tuck into a box but the woman works he wanted to argue to debate to tear the hypothesis to shreds and discovered he couldnt so he swore instead kafka he muttered as a light dawned barbara read kafka doesnt surprise me rafe said cheerfully trying it all from a new angle jared took out a cigar the argument is still valid that if two people want to build a future together they have to trust each other enough to share the past i want the boy too he said blowing out a stream of smoke are you going to let a photograph stop you devin asked quietly no im not going to let anything stop me two down shane complained you know women start getting ideas when your brothers get married live with it jared told him all of them glanced over at the sound of a car coming up the lane fast so shed come to her senses he decided proud of the fact that hed given her the night to think it over now she was here sorry shed lost her temper he imagined ready to sit down and discuss it all reasonably he rose moved over to lean on the post opposite devin hed be big enough to apologize as well he thought and to explain himself more coherently he was sure that years from now theyd laugh over the whole foolish mess he lifted the cigar to his lips ready to welcome her when she squealed to a halt at the end of the lane the woman who unfolded herself from the car didnt look conciliatory she looked wild glowing and stunning ohoh was all shane said but he rolled his eyes merrily at rafe she didnt speak but stood with her hands on her hips scanning the four men an audience she thought even better didnt they all look smug and pleased with themselves just for being men she swaggered around to the trunk unlocked it the box came first the dogs jumped and circled around her in excited greeting as she carried it to the side of the car with a wide smile she overturned it several articles of clothing tumbled out suits ties shirts socks still smiling she gave the heap a couple of good solid kicks to spread things out delighted the dogs trampled over the clothes sniffing and barking fred proved his recognition of jareds scent by lifting his leg on the porch four men watched in silence with varying degrees of emotion ah jareds favorite tie was snagged on her foot she discovered eyes on his she ground her heel into it rafe grinned like a loon shane let out one full belly laugh devin watched in rapt admiration jared just watched she wasnt finished not by a long shot back to the trunk she pulled out a leatherbound address book hed left on the nightstand her smile cool she held it open as if to demonstrate then tore the pages out and let them flutter onto the heap of the now dirty doghaired clothes she took out his shoes the good italian leather first holding them down for ethel to sniff savannah let the first one fly then the second and the dogs gave grateful chase tennis shoes went next two pairs one of which she was delighted to note was only two weeks old she hoped the dogs chewed them to shreds there was shaving gear to deal with she pitched a piece here a piece there drawing out the event until shane simply rolled out of his chair onto the deck of the porch helpless with laughter but shed saved the coup de grace the wine there had only been one bottle open but shed tossed that before she left she uncorked all three all fine vintages expensively french chin up eyes challenging she walked back to what was left of his clothes she tilted her head first darkly pleased when his eyes went to green slits with a veteran waitresss skill savannah poured them out all at once over his best suit done she let the bottles fall with a clink on the grass still without having uttered a word she strolled back to the car slid behind the wheel with a final smile an arrogant salute she backed up swung around and drove down the lane other than shanes helpless laughter there wasnt a sound until devin finally cleared his throat he studied the mess on the lawn carefully even patted freds head when the dog devotedly brought him one of jareds mauled shoes well he said at length id say she made her point too shes a spooky woman shane managed mopping his streaming eyes i think im in love with her because he knew what it was like to be at the mercy of his own heart rafe rose and slapped a hand on jareds shoulder you know jare you got two choices he was all but quivering with fury which are run like hell or go get her i know which one id choose jared didnt do anything for a couple of hours he knew himself well enough to understand that his temper could be dangerous he worked off some steam and worked up a sweat in the barn before washing up when he finally headed out his anger was still there but strapped in she figured she was dumping him he thought like shed dumped his things but she was going to figure again hey jare from the side yard where he was playing tugofwar with the dogs over one of jareds shoes shane sent up a shout tell savannah we really enjoyed the show okay remind me to kick your butt later shed humiliated him he fumed in front of his brothers seeking control he jammed his hands into his pockets and veered toward the woods not to mention that shed ruined a good portion of his wardrobe thought she was damn clever he was sure he imagined shed sat up half the night planning it all out if he hadnt been the brunt of it hed have admired her finesse the sheer nerve of it but he had been the one who took the brunt of it the woods closed around him but he didnt experience the usual sense of peace and companionship his mind was on the other side of them on savannah and he thought with relish on revenge lets see how she liked it when he went into her closet and he stopped himself took another deep breath look what the woman had brought him to he was actually considering vandalizing her belongings in some sort of juvenile oneupmanship wasnt going to happen he would gain revenge by showing her that despite her outrageous behavior he was a reasonable man to make certain he would be jared detoured off the path and sat down on the rocks he couldnt feel them the ghosts that haunted this place with their sorrows and hopes and fears perhaps he thought because for the first time in a long time he was plagued with too many of his own hed known loss the jarring devastating loss of his parents hed lived with that because he didnt have a choice and because he thought there were so many good solid important memories to draw on for comfort and of course hed always had his brothers hed known sorrow he had been struck with it when he finally admitted his marriage had been a mistake not a disaster somehow that would have been better less pale than a simple easily rectifiable mistake hope of course his life had been full of it a gift from his parents from his roots wherever there was hope there was fear the price to be paid for the sweetness hed known all those emotions used them or overcome them but until savannah hed never known anything so sharp so vital so frightening the wind changed as he sat there picked up where it had been calm before it fluttered the trees whispered through the leaves that filtered sunlight and chilled they came here he sat very still as he thought of it the two boys wearing different colors came here each of them wanted only to find home again to escape from the madness into the recognizable the familiar to find the sense of it all again the meaning of it the continuity of family of people who knew and loved them accepted them maybe in some odd way that was what theyd fought for for home what an idiot hed been jared realized and closed his eyes as the wind scooped up dead leaves and swirled them around him the two boys had never had a chance once they chose their path but he had a chance the same fate that had doomed those two soldiers so long ago had placed savannah and bryan right in front of him instead of accepting hed questioned instead of rejoicing hed doubted because what frightened him most was this blinding love a love that demanded he protect defend treasure and he couldnt protect the girl she had been defend that girl against the cruel and thoughtless blows of life when no one else would help shed had to face it alone without him and if necessary she still could that left him feeling impotent and scorched his pride so he was an idiot but she wasnt going to get rid of him easily he heard a rustling and when he opened his eyes he wouldnt have been surprised to see a young confederate soldier bayonet ready fear bright as the sun in his eyes step off the path instead he saw bryan head down feet scuffling leaves he would have laughed at his overactive imagination if the boys pose hadnt been one of such abject dejection hey ace hows it going bryans head came up the smile a bit more cautious than jared was used to fluttered around his mouth hi just out walking moms in a mood i know in an unspoken invitation jared patted the rock beside him shes pretty steamed at me she said you were steamed at her too i guess i was instinctively jared draped an arm over bryans shoulders when the boy settled beside him im over it mostly shes not ready for male bonding bryan rolled his eyes she kicked me out no kidding me too the idea of that had bryan chuckling he didnt think his mother had told jared to go play outside for gods sake we can go live at the farm till she cools off we could jared said consideringly or i could go on over and try to smooth things out can you jared looked down and for the first time saw the worry in the boys eyes shes not really mad at you bry shes mad at me yeah i know can you make her not mad at you anymore i hope so when you tick her off does she stay that way long nah she cant cause there was no way to explain it she just cant but shes never let a guy hang around like you so maybe she can stay mad at you shes never he stopped himself it was wrong to ask the child maybe you should give me some pointers well bryan pursed his lips as he thought about it she really digs the flowers you bring her no one ever did that before except once i brought her some little ones for her birthday she got all mushy about it no one ever brought her flowers jared murmured he wasnt just an idiot he was a champion idiot nuhuh bryan continued warming up no one ever took us out to ball games or for pizza and she likes that too this time he could ask because it was for the boy no one ever took you to ball games or for pizza nah i mean mom and me went sure but not with a guy who like set it up and stuff bryan was thinking that over how much he liked it when inspiration struck oh yeah and when youre going to take her out like on a date she sings in the shower she went out on dates before and all but she never sang when she was getting ready so maybe you should take her on a date girls like that stuff jared determined there were going to be lots of ball games lots of pizza lots of dates and lots of flowers in savannah and bryans future yeah they do have you got any love words excuse me like in the movies bryan explained you know how the woman gets all mooneyed when the guy says love words only the guy has to be kind of mooneyed too to make it work she might like that she might bryan sighed at the thought its probably embarrassing not if you mean them heres the thing bryan jared scooted away just enough that he could face the boy fully i figure i ought to run this by you since youve been the man of the house for so long im in love with your mother as his stomach clutched and jittered bryan lowered his gaze i kind of figured you were stuck on her no im in love with her mooneyed im going to ask her to marry me bryans gaze whipped back up and this time it held steady and searching for real for very real how does that fly with you he wasnt ready to commit though he liked the strong weight of the arm on his shoulders his stomach was still jumping would you like live with us not like i would live with you and youd live with me but theres a catch that was what hed been afraid of he braced himself kept his eyes level yeah what im going to ask you to take my name bryan and to take me on as your father i dont just want your mother you see i want both of you so you both have to want me there was an odd pressure on his chest as if someone had just sat on him you want to be my father yes very much i know youve gotten along just fine without one up till now and maybe i need you more than you need me but i think id be good at it bryans eyes goggled you need to be my father i do jared murmured realized hed rarely spoken truer words i really do id be bryan mackade thats the deal while he hesitated jareds universe simply ground to a halt if the boy rejected him he knew it would cut straight to his heart but bryan didnt know for sure how things were done between men he knew what to do when his mother offered him something wonderful something hed hardly dared to dream of but had wished for hard really hard at night so in the end that was what he did jared found his arms full of boy the breath jared had been holding whistled out in almost painful relief have a cigar he thought giddily youve got yourself a son this is so cool bryan said his voice muffled against jareds chest i thought maybe you didnt want somebody elses kid gently for he suddenly felt very gentle jared cupped the boys chin and lifted it you wont be somebody elses wed make it legal but thats just a paper what really counts is whats between you and me ill be bryan mackade youll make her go for it wont you youll talk her into it talk is my business furious at herself for snapping at bryan savannah ruined two illustrations before admitting that work was hopeless shed been so pleased with herself when she drove away from the mackade farm drunk with the power of causing fury to run hot and cold over jareds face now she was miserable miserably angry miserably frustrated miserable she wanted to kick something but wasnt so far gone shed take it out on the two kittens napping in the corner of the kitchen she wanted to break something but after a frustrated search through the living room she discovered she didnt have anything valuable enough to be satisfying she wanted to scream but there was no one to scream at until jared strode through the door you dont have so much as a cuff link left here mackade everythings in your front yard i noticed that was quite a show savannah i enjoyed it she crossed her arms angled her chin sue me i might yet why dont we sit down why dont you go to hell she drawled and be sure the door kicks you on your way out sit down he repeated in a tone just firm enough just reasonable enough to light a very short fuse dont you tell me what to do in my own house she shouted at him dont you tell me what to do period im sick to death of you making me feel like some slowwitted backwater bimbo i dont have a fancy degree hell i dont have a high school diploma but im not stupid i muddled through with my life just fine before you came along and ill do just fine after youve gone i know he acknowledged that with a slight inclination of his head thats whats been worrying me and i dont think youre stupid savannah on the contrary i dont think ive ever met a smarter woman dont play that tune with me i know what you think of me and i can live up to most of it i think you can he said quietly i think you can live up to everything i think of you if youd sit down ill tell you what that is ill say what i have to say she tossed back you want to know about me jared ill tell you about me a parting gift for all the good times you sit down she demanded and stabbed a finger at a chair all right but this isnt why im here i dont need to know you asked for it she said interrupting him smartly by god youll get it my mother died young but she left my father and me first she didnt go far just across the corral so to speak another smoothtalking cowboy my father never got over it never forgave never gave an inch certainly not to me he never loved me the way i wanted him to he couldnt even if hed tried he couldnt i wasnt a nice polite little girl i grew up hard and i liked it getting the picture savannah please sit down you dont have to do this enraged she stalked over to him listen i havent even gotten started so you just shut up and listen we didnt have much money but then a lot of people dont and they get by so did we he liked to take risks and he broke a lot of bones theres more than manure on the rodeo circuit more than sweat theres desperation too but we got by things got a little interesting when i grew breasts men like to stare at them or sneak a feel most of the guys on the circuit had known me since i was a kid so there wasnt much trouble i knew when to smile and when to use my elbow i was never innocent the way i lived youd better grow up knowing he didnt interrupt now but sat quietly his eyes unreadable and her hands were cold i was sixteen when i took that tumble into the hay i wasnt innocent but i was a virgin i knew but i let myself forget because because he was goodlooking exciting charming and of course he told me hed take care of everything no one had no one had ever taken care of you before jared murmured thats right and i was just young and stupid enough to believe him but i knew what i was doing knew the chance i was taking so i got pregnant he didnt want me or the baby neither did my father i was just like my mother cheap easy he told me to get out he might have thought differently the next day he had a quick temper but i wasnt cheap and i wasnt easy and i wanted the baby nobody was going to take that baby away from me nobody was going to tell me to be ashamed they tried social services sheriffs state cops whenever they could catch me they tried they wanted me in the system so they could tell me how to act how to raise my child or better for everyone to give him away but that wasnt better for me and it wasnt better for bryan no the systems flawed savannah overburdened but it tries i didnt need it she lashed back at him i got work and i worked hard i waited tables i served drinks i cleaned up slop it didnt matter what kind of work as long as it paid he never went hungry my son never went hungry and he always had a roof over his head he always had me he always knew i loved him and that he came first the way you never did the way i never did whatever it took i was going to give him a decent life if that meant taking off most of my clothes and dancing for a bunch of howling idiots what difference did it make i didnt have an education i didnt have any skills if id been able to go to art school she bit off the thought with a furious shake of her head is that what you wanted he kept his voice neutral as he would have with a fragile or highstrung witness to go to art school it doesnt matter it does matter savannah i wanted bryan everything else was secondary you wanted to know about men there were a few scores less than youve imagined im sure i wasnt dead just driven i never took money from them but i took food a couple of times and theres not much difference and damn you im not ashamed of it the only reason i didnt steal was because if id been caught they might have taken bryan but i would have stolen if id been sure id have gotten away with it i didnt know i could peddle my paintings until one of the girls at the club asked me if id do one of her for her boyfriend and offered me a twenty thats when i got the idea to take bry to new orleans she was pacing the room as she spoke her words rushed and hurried in her effort to get them out and over but now she stopped slowed herself thats all there is at least any other finer details escape me at the moment she turned to him again her face calm now and cold crossexamine counselor you could have taken other routes sure safer ones he added easier ones for you maybe i didnt want safer ones i didnt want easier what did you want savannah what do you want it doesnt matter it matters he rose but didnt go to her it very much matters to me i want a home i want a place where people dont look at me like im dirt where the people who think theyre decent dont whisper behind their hands you have that here and im keeping it he had to sacrifice his pride to ask but he discovered it wasnt so very difficult do you want me taken by surprise she only stared for a moment thats not the issue then maybe i should put it another way he reached into his pocket drew out the small box hed tucked in it before he left the farm after lifting the lid he held it out i came here to give this to you the ring was a simple traditional diamond in an outdated and lovely gold setting mesmerized savannah gaped at it before slowly stepping back it was my mothers jared said in a voice that betrayed none of the raw nerves inside him it went to me as im the oldest im asking you to marry me savannah she couldnt breathe bryan would have recognized the weight that had dropped down on her chest didnt you hear anything ive just told you yes everything and im grateful you told me even under the circumstances this way i can tell you i love what you were what you are and what you will be youre the only woman ive ever loved and its so amazing to find you admire someone as much as you love them she stepped back again as if he were holding a gun instead of a promise i dont understand you i dont understand you at all is this some sort of vicious payback because i ruined your clothes savannah his voice was patient now look at me she did and the weight on her chest doubled and pushed tears into her eyes oh god you mean it youre going to cry he almost shuddered with relief thank the lord i thought you were going to toss it in my face i thought you didnt think i was good enough for you the smile that had beamed onto his face froze do i deserve that he murmured sweet god i hope not im supposed to be good at making my case but ive sure as hell screwed this one i was afraid its hard for me to admit that im a mackade and were not supposed to be afraid of anything im the oldest mackade and im supposed to be able to handle anything but i couldnt handle how i feel for you i was afraid of what was behind you of what you wouldnt say to me i thought it might explode in my face and ruin what i wanted to build with you and bryan and part of me was afraid terrified really that youd be able to toss me aside the way you did that photograph bryan the weight on her chest dissolved like water you want bryan am i going to have to get down on my knees here no dont she wiped impatiently at the tears i couldnt handle it i was worried that it seemed that i wouldnt want him because it wasnt me who rolled in the hay with you ten years ago that wasnt it maybe it was part of it for a while pride gets in the way what bothered me most is thinking of you being hurt of the two of you scraping by i cant help wanting to go back and save you to protect you and bryan i cant help feeling well a little unmanned really because i cant go back and because i know you dont need me to and maybe it bothered me some that youd managed to turn it all around into something admirable you see i wanted to take care of you both of you but youve done just fine without me wed do better with you emotions trembled through him stepping forward he laid a hand on her wet cheek thats the best thing youve ever said to me thats the second incredible thing thats happened to me today she managed a smile there was another when i talked to bryan in the woods we were sitting on the rocks where two lost boys met trying to find their way home its a strong place yes not as sad after today as it once was bryan was giving me advice on how to coax you out of being mad at me i was supposed to bring you flowers which i will and take you on a date so that you could sing in the shower while you get ready she gave a watery embarrassed chuckle hes got a big mouth then im supposed to come up with some love words like in the movies girls like that stuff im told i guess im going to have to start keeping an eye on those girls im glad you talked to him jared that wasnt the best part i told him i was going to ask you to marry me and that i wanted to be his father he hugged me jared murmured struck by it all over again it was just that easy he had a lot of faith that id be able to talk you into it i hope im not going to disappoint him she did the simple thing and leaned into him resting her head on his shoulder before i answer the question id better warn you i dont believe in quiet civilized divorces if you try to worm out of this ill just have to kill you sounds fair as long as it holds true for both sides he turned his face into her hair and knew he was home ah morning sickness and thirtytwo hours of labor might put you off from trying again she squeezed her eyes tight squeezed him tighter he was offering her more children he was offering her a future dont be an ass mackade im tougher than that and this time around id have someone to swear at in the delivery room i want to be there for you through everything youre going to have to learn how to need me too late she murmured i already know all about that take my name savannah take me savannah mackade closing her eyes again she held on tight i think it suits me just fine
