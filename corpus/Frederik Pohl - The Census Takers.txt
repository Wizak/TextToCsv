 the census takers it gets to be a madhouse around here along about the end of the first week thank heaven we only do this once a year thats what i say six weeks on and fortysix weeks offthats pretty good hours most people think but they dont know what those six weeks are like its bad enough for the field crews but when you get to be an area boss like me its frantic you work your way up through the ranks and then they give you a whole ca of your own and you think youve got it made fifty threeman crews go out covering the whole census area a hundred and fifty men in the field and twenty or thirty more in area commandand you boss them all and everything looks great until census period starts and youve got to work those hundred and fifty men and six weeks is too unbearably long to live through and too im possibly short to get the work done and you begin living on black coffee and thiamin shots and dreaming about the vacation hostel on point loma anybody can panic when the pressure is on like that your best field men begin to crack up but you cant afford to because youre the area boss take witeck we were enumerators together and he was as good a man as you ever saw absolutely nerveless when it came to processing the overs i counted on that man the way i counted on my own right arm i always bracketed him with the greenest shakiest new cadet enumerators and he never gave me a moments trouble for years maybe it was too good to last maybe i should have figured he would crack i set up my area command in a plush penthouse apart ment the people who lived there were pretty well off you know and they naturally raised the dickens about being shoved out blow it i told them get out of here in five minutes and well count you first well that took care of that they were practically kissing my feet on the way out of course it wasnt strictly by the book but you have to be a little flexible thats why some menbecome area bosses and others stay enumerators like witeck along about day eight things were really hotting up i was up to my neck in hurryups from regional control we were running a little slowwhen witeck called up chief he said ive got an in i grabbed the rotary file with one hand and a pencil with the other blue card number i asked witeck sounded funny over the phone well chief he said he doesnt have a blue card he says no blue card i couldnt believe it come in to a strange ca without a card from your own area boss and youre one in thats a cinch to be an over what kind of a crazy ca does he come from without a blue card witeck said he dont come from any ca chief he says you mean he isnt from this country thats right chief he hold it i pushed away the rotary file and grabbed the immigration roster there were only a couple of dozen names on it of coursewe have enough trouble with our own overs without taking on a lot of foreigners but still there were a handful every year who managed to get on the quotas id number i demanded well chief witeck began he doesnt have an id number the way it looks to me well you can fool around with these irregulars for a month if you want to but its no way to get the work done i said over him and hung up i was a little surprised though witeck knew the ropes and it wasnt like him to buck an irregular on to me in the old days when we were both starting out id seen him over a whole family just because the spelling of their names on their registry cards was different from the spelling on the checklist but we get older i made a note to talk to witeck as soon as the rush was past we were old friends i wouldnt have to threaten him with being overed himself or any thing like that hed know and maybe that would be all he would need to snap him back i certainly would talk to him i promised myself as soon as the rush was over or anyway as soon as i got back from point loma i had to run up to regional control to take a little talkingto myself just then but i proved to them that we were catching up and they were only medium nasty when i got back witeck was on the phone again chief he said real unhappy this in is giving me a headache i witeck i snapped at him are you bothering me with another in cant you handle anything by yourself he said its the same one chief he says hes a kind of ambassador and oh i said well whythe devil dont you get your facts straight in the first place give me his name and ill check his legation well chief he began again he uh doesnt have any legation he says hes from the he swallowed from the middle of the earth youre crazy id seen it happen before good men breaking under the strain of census taking they say in cadets that by the time you process your first five hundred overs youve had it either you take a voluntary over yourself or you split wide open and they carry you off to a giggle farm and witeck was past the five hundred mark way past there was a lot of yelling and crying from the filter center which id put out by the elevators and it looked like jumpers i stabbed the transfer button on the phone and called to carias my numbertwo man witecks flipped or something handle it and then i forgot about it while carias talked to witeck on the phone because it was jumpers all right a whole family of them there was a father and a mother and five kidsfive of them arent some people disgusting the field enumer ator turned them over to the guardsthey were moaning and cryingand came up and gave me the story it was bad youre the head of the household i demanded of the man he nodded looking at me like a sick dog wewe werent jumping he whined honest to heaven mister youve got to believe me we were i cut in you were packed and on the doorstep when the field crew came by right he started to say some thing but i had him dead to rights thats plenty friend i told him thats jumping under the law packing with intent to move while a census enumeration crew is oper ating in your locale got anything to say well he had plenty to say but none of it made any sense he turned my stomach listening to him i tried to keep my temperyoure not supposed to think of indi viduals no matter how worthless and useless and generally unfit they are thats against the whole principle of the censusbut i couldnt help telling him ive met your kind before mister five kids if it wasnt for people like you we wouldnt have any overs did you ever think of that sure you didntyou people never think of anything but yourself five kids and then when census comes around you think you can get smart and jump i tell you i was shaking you keep your little beady eyes peeled sneaking around watching the enumerators trying to count how m ny it takes to make an over and then you wait until they get close to you so you can jump ever stop to think what trouble that makes for us i demanded census is supposed to be fair and square everybody an even chanceand how can we make it that way unless every body stands still to be counted i patted old betsy on my hip i havent overed anybody myself in five years i told him but i swear id like to handle you personally he didnt say a word once i got started on him he just stood there taking it i had to force myself to stop finally i could have gone on for a long time because if theres one thing i hate its these lousy stinking breeders who try to jump when they think one of them is going to be an over in the countoff regular jumpers are bad enough but when its the people who make the mess in the first place anyway time was wasting i took a deep breath and thought things over actually we werent too badly off wed started off overing every twohundredandfiftieth person and it was beginning to look as though onr pre liminary estimate was high wed just cut back to overing every threehundredth so we had a little margin to play with i told the man dead serious you know i could over the lot of you on charges dont you he nodded sickly all right ill give you a chance i dont want to bother with the red tape if youll take a voluntary over for your self well start the new count with your wife call me soft if you want to but i still say that it was a lot better than fussing around with charges and a hear ing you get into a hearing like that and it can drag on for half an hour or more and then regional control is on your tail because youre falling behind it never hurts to give a man a break even a jumper i always sayas long as it doesnt slow down your census carias was waiting at my desk when i got back he looked worried about something but i brushed him off while i initialed the overage report on the man wed just processed hed been an in i found out when i canceled his blue card i cant say i was surprised hed come from denver and you know how they keep exceeding their census figures no doubt he thought hed have a better chance in my ca than anywhere else and no doubt he was right because we certainly dont encourage breeders like himactually if he hadnt tried to jump it was odds on that the whole damned family would get by without an over for years carias was hovering right behind me as i finished i hate these voluntaries i told him basketing the canceled card im going to talk to regional control about it theres no reason why they cant be processed like any other over instead of making me okay each one individ ually now whats the matter he rubbed his jaw chief he said its witeck now what another in carias glanced at me then away uh no chief its the same one he claims he comes from uh the center of the earth i swore out loud so he has to turn up in my ca i complained bitterly he gets out of the nuthouse and right away carias said chief he might not be crazy he makes it sound pretty real i said hold it carias nobody can live in the center of the earth its solid like a potato sure chief carias nodded earnestly but he says it isnt he says theres a what he calls neutronium shell whatever that is with dirt and rocks on both sides of it we live on the outside he lives on the inside his people t carias i yelled youre as bad as rteck this guy turns up no blue card no id number no credentials of any kind whats he going to say please sir im an over please process me naturally not so he makes up a crazy story and you fall for it i know chief carias said humbly neutronium shell i would have laughed out loud if id had the time neutronium my foot dont you know its hot down there he says its hot neutronium carias said eagerly i asked him that myself chief he said its just the shell that get back to work i yelled at him i picked up the phone and got witeck on his wristphone i tell you i was boiling as soon as witeck answered i lit into him i didnt give him a chance to get a word in i gave it to him up and down and sidewise and i finished off by giving him a direct order you over that man i told him or ill personally over you you hear me there was a pause then witeck said jerry will you listen to me that stopped me it was the first time in ten years since id been promoted above him that witeck had dared call me by my first name he said jerry listen this is some thing big this guy is really from the center of the earth no kidding he witeck i said youve cracked no jerry honest and it worries me hes right there in the next room waiting for me he says he had no idea things were like this on the surface hes talking wild about cleaning us off and starting all over again he says say hes an over i yelled no more talk witeck youve got a direct ordernow carry it out so that was that we got through the census period after all but we had to do it shorthanded and witeck was hard to replace im a sentimentalist i guess but i couldnt help remem bering old times we started even he might have risen as far as ibut of course he made his choice when he got married and had a kid you cant be a breeder and an officer of the census both if it hadnt been for his record he couldnt even have stayed on as an enumerator i never said a word to anyone about his crackup carias might have talked but after we found witecks body i took him aside carias i said reasonably we dont want any scandal do we heres witeck with an hon orable record he cracks and kills himself and thats bad enough we wont let loose talk make it worse will we carias said uneasily chief wheres the gun he killed himself with his own processor wasnt even fired you can let a helper go just so far i said sharply carias we still have at least a hundred overs to process you can be on one end of the processingor you can be on the other you understand me he coughed sure chief i understand we dont want any loose talk and thats how it is when youre an area boss but i didnt ever get my vacation at point loma the tsunami there washed out the whole town the last week of the census and when i tried baja california they were having that crazy volcanic business and the yellowstone park bureau wouldnt even accept my reservation because of some trouble with the geysers so i just stayed home but the best vacation of all was just knowing that the census was done for another year carias was all for looking for this in that witeck was talking about but i turned him down waste of time i told him by now hes a dozen cas away well never see him again him or anybody like himill bet my life on that
