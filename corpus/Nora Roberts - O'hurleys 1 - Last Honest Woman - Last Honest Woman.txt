 prologue you can yell all you want mrs ohurley her breath came in gasps sweat rolled down her temples as she dug her fingers into the side of the gurney and braced herself molly ohurley doesnt yell her babies into the world she wasnt a big woman but her voice even at a normal tone reached all corners of the room it had a lilting musical sound though she had to dig for the strength to use it shed been rushed into the hospital by her husband only minutes before in the last stages of labor thered been no time to prep her no time for comforting words or handholding the obstetrician on call had taken one look and had her rolled into the delivery room fully dressed most women would have been afraid surrounded by strangers in a strange town depending on them for her life and for the life of the baby that was fighting its way into the world she was but shed be damned if shed admit it a tough one are you the doctor signaled for a nurse to wipe his brow the heating in the delivery room was working overtime all the ohurleys are tough she managed to say but she wanted to yell god she wanted to as the pain screamed through her the baby was coining early she could only pray it wasnt too early the contractions piled one on top of another giving her no time to recharge for the next we can be grateful your train wasnt five minutes later or youd be having this baby in the club car she was fully dilated and the baby was crowning dont bear down yet pant she cursed him with all the expertise shed developed in seven years of living with her francis and seven more of playing the clubs in every grimy town from la to the catskills he only clucked his tongue at her as she breathed like a steam engine and glared thats fine thats fine now and here we go push mrs ohurley lets bring this baby out with a bang ill give you a bang she promised and pushed through the last dizzying pain the baby came out with a wail that echoed off the walls of the delivery room molly watched tears streaming as the doctor turned the small head the shoulders then the torso its a girl laughing she fell back a girl shed done it and wouldnt francis be proud exhausted molly listened to her daughters first cries of life didnt have to give this one a slap on the bottom the doctor commented small he thought maybe five pounds tops shes no heavyweight mrs ohurley but she looks good as gold of course she is listen to those lungs shell knock them out of the back row a few weeks ahead of schedule but oh sweet god as the new contraction hit molly pushed herself up hold her the doctor passed the baby to a nurse and nodded to another to brace mollys shoulders looks like your daughter had company another between pain and delirium molly started to laugh there was nothing hysterical about it but something robust and daring damn you frank you always manage to surprise me the man in the waiting room paced but there was a spring to his step even as he checked his watch for the fifth time in three minutes he was a man who spent as much time dancing as walking he was slim and spry with a perpetual optimism gleaming in his eyes now and again hed pass by the little boy half dozing in a chair and rub his hand over the top of his nodding head a baby brother or sister for you trace theyll be coming out any minute to tell us im tired pop tired with a great carrying laugh the man whisked the boy out his chair and into his arms this is no time for sleeping boy its a great moment another ohurleys about to be born its opening night trace settled his head on his fathers shoulder we didnt make it to the theater theres other nights for that he suffered only a moments pang over the canceled show but there were clubs even in duluth hed find a booking or two before they caught the next train hed been born to entertain to sing to dance his way through life and he thanked his lucky stars that his molly was the same god knew they didnt make much of a living following the circuit and playing in secondclass clubs and smoky lounges but there was time yet the big break was always just one show away before you know it well bill ourselves as the four ohurleys therell be no stopping us no stopping us the boy murmured having heard it all before mr ohurley frank stopped his hands tightened on his son as he turned to the doctor he was only a man and terrifyingly ignorant of what went on in childbirth im ohurley his throat was dry there wasnt even any spit to swallow molly is molly all right grinning the doctor lifted a hand to rub his chin your wifes quite a woman relief came in a wave overcome by it frank kissed his son hard hear that boy your moms quite a woman and the baby i know it was early but the babys all right strong and beautiful the doctor began every one of them strong and beautiful beside himself with joy frank went into a quick twostep my molly knows how to have babies she might get her cues mixed up but she always comes through like a trouper isnt that his words trailed off and he stared at the doctor who was continuing to smile at him every one of them this is your son yes this is trace what do you mean every one of them mr ohurley your son has three sisters three with trace still in his arms frank sank into the chair his wiry dancers legs had turned to water three of them all at once a couple minutes apart but three at last count he sat a minute stunned three he hadnt yet figured out how they were going to feed one more three all girls as the shock wore off he started to laugh hed been blessed with three daughters francis ohurley wasnt a man who cursed fate he embraced it you hear that boy your moms gone and had herself triplets three for the price of one and im a man who loves a bargain springing up he grabbed the doctors hand and pumped it bless you if theres a man luckier than francis xavier ohurley tonight im damned if i know him congratulations youve got a wife yes i do whats her name its abigail then abigail it is for one of them when can i see my family in just a few minutes ill have one of the nurses come down and look after your son oh no frank caught traces hand in his he goes with me it isnt every day a boy gets three sisters the doctor started to explain the rules then caught himself are you as stubborn as your wife mr ohurley he poked his slight chest out she took lessons from me come this way he saw them first through the glass walls of the nursery three tiny forms lying in incubators two slept while the other wailed in annoyance shes letting the world know shes here those are your sisters trace awake now and critical trace studied them pretty scrawny so were you little baboon the tears came he was too irish to be ashamed of them ill do my best for you for each and every one of you he placed a hand on the glass and hoped it would be enough somehow chapter one it wasnt going to be an ordinary day now that the decision had been made it would be a long time before things settled down to the merely ordinary again she could only hope she was doing the right thing in the quiet animal scented air of the barn abby saddled her horse maybe it was wrong to steal this time in the middle of the day when there was still so much to be done but she needed it an hour alone away from the house away from obligations seemed like an enormous luxury abby hesitated then shook her head and fastened the cinch if you were going to steal you might as well go for the luxurious because it was something her father might have said she laughed to herself besides if mr jorgensen really wanted to buy the foal hed call back the books needed balancing and the feed bill was overdue she could deal with it later right now she wanted a fast ride to nowhere two of the barn cats circled then settled back into the hay as she led the roan gelding outside his breath puffed out in a cloud of mist as she doublechecked his cinch lets go judd with the ease of long experience she swung herself into the saddle and headed south there would be no fast ride here where the snow and mud had mixed itself into a slushy mire the air was cold and heavy with damp but she felt a sense of anticipation things were changing and wasnt that all anyone could ask they kept to a fast walk with both of them straining for what always seemed just out of reach freedom perhaps agreeing to be interviewed for this book would bring some portion of it she could only hope but the doubts shed lived with ever since the arrangements had been made still hovered what was right what was wrong what were the consequences shed have to assume the responsibility no matter what occurred she rode over the land she loved yet never quite considered her own the snow was melting in the pasture in another month she thought the foals could play on the new grass shed plant hay and oats and this yearmaybe this yearher books would inch over into the black chuck would never have worried hed never thought about tomorrow only about the next moment the next car race she knew why hed bought the land in rural virginia perhaps shed always known but at the time shed been able to take his gesture of guilt as a gesture of hope her ability to find and hold on to thin threads of hope had gotten her through the last eight years chuck had bought the land then had spent only a few scattered weeks on it hed been too restless to sit and watch the grass grow restless careless and selfish that was chuck shed known that before shed married him perhaps that was why shed married him she couldnt claim hed ever pretended to be anything else it was simply that shed looked and seen what shed wanted to see hed swept into her life like the comet he was and blinded with fascination shed followed the eighteenyearold abigail ohurley had been stunned and thrilled at being romanced by the dramatic chuck rockwell his name had been frontpage news as hed raced his way through the grand prix circuit his name had been in bold type on the scandal sheets as hed raced his way through the hearts of women the young abigail hadnt read the tabloids hed spun her into his life in miami charmed and dazzled her hed offered excitement excitement and a freedom from responsibilities shed been married before shed been able to catch her breath though a light drizzle was falling now abby stopped her horse she didnt mind the rain that dampened her face and jacket it added another quality shed needed that morning isolation a cowards way she knew but shed never thought herself brave what she had donewhat she would continue to dowas survive the land curved gently patched with snow misted with a fog that hovered over it when judd pawed the ground impatiently she patted his neck until he was quiet again it was so beautiful shed been to monte carlo to london and paris and bonn but after nearly five years of daytoday living and dawntodusk working she still thought this was the most beautiful sight in the world the rain splattered down promising to make the dirt roads that crisscrossed her land all but unmanageable if the temperatures dropped that night the rain would freeze and leave a slick and dangerous sheen of ice over the snow but it was beautiful she owed chuck for this and for so much more hed been her husband now she was his widow before hed burned himself out hed singed her badly but hed left her two of the most important things in her life her sons it was for them shed finally agreed to let the writer come shed dodged offers from publishers for more than four years that hadnt stopped an unauthorized biography of chuck rockwell or the stories that still appealed from time to time in the papers after months of soulsearching abby had finally come to the conclusion that if she worked with a writer a good writer she would have some control over the final product when it was done her sons would have something of their father dylan crosby was a very good writer abby knew that was as much a disadvantage as an advantage hed poke into areas she was determined to keep offlimits she wanted him to when he did shed answer in her way and shed finally dose that chapter of her life she would have to be clever with a shake of her head she ducked to her horse and sent him moving again the trouble was shed never been the clever one chantel had been that her older sisterolder by two and a half minuteshad always been able to plan and manipulate and make things happen then there was maddy her other sister younger by two minutes and ten seconds maddy was the outgoing one the one who could usually make her own way through sheer drive and will but she was abby the middle triplet the quiet one the responsible one the dependable one those titles still made her wince her problem now wasnt a label that had been pinned on her before she could walk her problem now was dylan crosby former investigative reporter turned biographer in his twenties hed unearthed a mafia connection that had eventually crumbled one of the largest mob families on the east coast before hed turned thirty hed unhinged the career of a senator with an unreported swiss bank account and aspirations to higher office now she had to handle him and she would after all he would be on her turf under her roof she would feed him information the secrets she wanted kept secret were locked in her own head and her own heart she alone had the key if shed learned nothing else as the middle daughter of a pair of roadroving entertainers shed learned how to act to get what she wanted all she had to do was give dylan crosby one hell of a show never tell the whole truth girl nobody wants to hear it thats what her father would have said and that abby told herself with a smile was what shed keep reminding herself of over the next few months a bit reluctant to leave the open road and the ram abby turned her horse and headed back it was almost time to begin dylan cursed the rain and reached out the window again to wipe at the windshield with an alreadydrenched rag the wiper on his side was working only in spurts the one on the other side had quit altogether icy rain soaked through his coat sleeve as he held the wheel with one hand and cleared his vision with the other hed been mad to buy a twentyfiveyearold car classic or not the vette looked like a dream and ran like a nightmare it probably hadnt been too smart to drive down from new york in february either but hed wanted the freedom of having his own carsuch as it was at least the snow hed run into in delaware had turned to rain as hed driven south but he cursed the rain again as it pelted through the open window and down his collar it could be worse he told himself he couldnt think of precisely how but it probably could after all he was finally going to sink his teeth into a project hed been trying to make gel for three years apparently abigail ohurley rockwell had decided shed squeezed the publisher for all she could get a pretty sharp lady he figured shed snagged one of the hottest and wealthiest race car drivers on the circuit and shed hardly been more than a kid before shed reached nineteen shed been wearing mink and diamonds and rolling dice in places like monte carlo it was never much strain to spend someone elses money his exwife had shown him that in a mercifully brief eighteenmonth union women were after all born with guile they were fashioned to masquerade as helpless vulnerable creatures until they had their hooks in you to shake free you had to bleed a little then if you were smart you took a hard look at the scars from time to time to remind yourself how life really worked dylan struggled with the map beside him held it in front while steering with his elbows then swore again yes that had been his turn hed just missed it with a quick glance up and down the stretch of rainfogged road he spun into a uturn the wipers might be pitiful but the vette knew how to move he couldnt imagine the chuck rockwell hed followed and admired choosing to settle in the backwoods of virginia maybe the little woman had talked him into buying it as some sort of hideaway shed certainly been hibernating there for the past few years just what kind of woman was she in order to write a thorough biography of the man he had to understand the woman shed stuck with rockwell like glue for nearly the first full year on the circuit then shed all but disappeared maybe the smell of gas and smoking tires had annoyed her she hadnt been in the stands for her husbands victories or his defeats most importantly she hadnt been there when hed run his last race the one that had killed him from the information dylan had shed finally shown up at the funeral three days later but had hardly spoken a word she hadnt shed a tear shed married a gold mine and turned a blind eye to his infidelities money was the only answer now as his widow she was in the position of never having to lift a finger not bad for a former singer whod never made it past hotel lounges and secondrate clubs he had to slow the vette to a crawl to make it down the slushy rutfilled lane marked by a battered mailbox with rockwell painted on the side obviously she didnt believe in spending much money on maintenance dylan wiped his window again and set his teeth against each jarring bump when he heard his muffler scrape he stopped cursing the rain and started cursing abigail the way he saw it she had a closetful of silk and fur but wouldnt shell out for minimal road repair when he saw the house he perked up a bit it wasnt the imposing oppressive plantation house hed been expecting it was charming and homey right down to the rocker on the front porch the shutters on the windows were painted colonial blue providing a nice contrast to the white frame a deck with a double railing skirted the second floor though he could see the house needed a new paint job it didnt look rundown just livedin there was smoke trailing up from the chimney and a bike with training wheels leaning on its kickstand under the overhang of the roof the sound of a dogs deepthroated barking completed the scene hed often thought of finding a place just like this for himself a place away from crowds and noise where he could concentrate on writing it reminded him of the home hed had as a child where security bad gone hand in hand with hard work when his muffler scraped the road again he was no longer charmed dylan pulled up behind a pickup truck and a compact station wagon and shut off his engine dropping his rag on the floor mat he rolled up his window and had started to open the door when a mass of wet fur leaped on it the dog was enormous maybe it had meant to give a friendly greeting but in its current bedraggled state the animal didnt look too pleasant as dylan gauged its size against that of a small hippo the dog scraped two muddy paws down his window and barked sigmund both dylan and the dog looked toward the house where a woman stood near the porch steps so this was abigail he mused hed seen enough pictures of her over the years to recognize her instantly the freshfaced ingenue in the pits at rockwells races the stunning socialite in london and chicago the cool composed widow by her husbands grave yet she wasnt precisely what hed expected her hair a honey blond fell across her forehead in wispy bangs and skimmed her shoulders she looked very slender and very comfortable in jeans and boots and a bulky sweater that bagged at her hips her face was pale and delicate through the rain he couldnt see the color of her eyes but he could see her mouth full and unpainted as she called to the dog again sigmund get down now the dog let out a last halfhearted bark and obeyed cautious dylan opened the door and stepped out mrs rockwell yes sony about the dog he doesnt bite very often theres good news dylan muttered and popped his trunk as he pulled out his bags abby stood where she was while her nerves tightened he was a stranger and she was letting him into her home into her life maybe she should stop it now right now before hed taken another step then he turned bags in hand and looked at her rain streamed from his hair it was dark darker now wet and plastered around his face not a kind face she thought immediately as she rubbed her palms on her thighs there was too much living in it too much knowledge for kindness a woman had to be crazy to let a man like that into her life then she saw that his clothes were drenched and his shoes already coated with mud looks like you could use some coffee yeah he gave the dog a last look as it sniffed around his ankles your lanes a mess i know she gave him a small apologetic smile as she noted that his car had fared no better than he its been a hard winter he didnt step forward with the rain pelting between them he stood watching her summing her up abby decided and she thrust her nervous hands in her pockets shed committed herself and she wouldnt get what she wanted if she allowed herself to be a coward now come inside she went to the door to wait for him her eyes looked dark a soft green and if he hadnt known better hed have said they were frightened the delicacy hed seen at a distance became more apparent at close range she had elegant cheekbones and a slightly pointed chin that gave her face a triangular piquant look her skin was pale her lashes dark dylan decided she was either a magician with cosmetics or wasnt wearing any she smelled of rain and woodsmoke pausing at the door dylan pried off his shoes i dont think you want me tramping around the place in those i appreciate it he stepped easily into her house in his stockinged feet while she stood with her hand on the knob feeling desperate and awkward why dont you just leave your things there for now and come into the kitchen its warm you can dry out fine he found the inside of the house as unexpected as hed found the exterior the floors were worn their shine a bit dull he saw on a table by the staircase a crude papiermƒch flower that appeared to have been made by a child as they walked abby bent down to pick two little plastic men in space regalia and continued without breaking rhythm you drove down from new york yeah not a very pleasant ride in this weather no he wasnt purposely being rude though he could be when it suited him at the moment the house interested him more than small talk there were no dishes in the sink and the floor was scrubbed clean nevertheless the kitchen was hardly tidy on every available space on the refrigerator door were pictures drawings memos on the breakfast bar was a halfcompleted jigsaw puzzle three and a half pairs of pintsize tennis shoes were jumbled at the back door but there was a fire in a brick fireplace and the scent of coffee if he wasnt going to bother to speak to her they wouldnt get far abby mused she turned for another look no his face wasnt kind but it was intriguing with its untidy nights growth of beard his brows were as dark as his hair and thick over eyes that were a pale green intense eyes she recognized that hadnt she been fatally attracted to intensity before chucks eyes had been brown but the message had been the same i get what i want because i dont give a damn what i have to do to win he hadnt abby was very much afraid shed just opened her life to the same kind of man but she was older now she reminded herself infinitely wiser and this time she wasnt in love ill take your coat she held out her hands and waited until he shrugged out of it for the first time in years she found herself noticing and reacting to a male body his was tall and rangy and a response trickled into her slowly abby felt it recognized it then put a stop to it turning she hung his coat on a peg by the door what do you take in your coffee nothing just black it had always been true for abby that to keep occupied was to keep calm she chose an oversize mug for him and a smaller one for herself how long have you been on the road i drove through the night through the night she glanced over her shoulder as he settled at the bar you must be exhausted but he didnt look it though he was unkempt he seemed to be completely alert i got my second wind he accepted the mug and noticed that her long narrow hands were ringless not even a gold band when he lifted his eyes they were cynical id guess you know how that is lifting a brow she sat across from him as a mother she knew what it was to lose a nights sleep and will herself through the next day i guess i do since he didnt seem interested in polite conversation shed get right down to business ive read your work mr crosby your book on millicent driscoll was tough but accurate accurates the key word she sipped coffee as she watched him i can respect that and i suppose there was enough pity for her from other sources did you know her personally not until after her suicide he warmed his hands on the mug as the fire crackled beside him i had to get to know her afterward in order to write the book she was a sensational actress a sensational woman but her life wasnt an easy one i knew her slightly through my sister chantel ohurley another sensational actress abby smiled and softened yes she is you met her didnt you when you were researching millicent briefly and thered been no love lost there all three of the ohurley triplets seemed to have made their mark one way or the other her eyes met his calm accepting one way or the other how does it feel having sisters causing ripples on both coasts im very proud of them the answer came immediately without any extra shades of meaning no plans to break back into show business yourself she would have laughed if she hadnt detected the cynicism in his voice no i have other priorities have you ever seen maddy on broadway couple of times he sipped the coffee was making up for those last few filthy miles of road you dont look like her you dont look like either one of them she was used to that the inevitable comparisons no my father always thought wed have been a sensation if wed been identical more coffee mr crosby no im fine the story goes that chuck rockwell walked into that little club where you and your family were playing on a whim and that he never looked twice at either of your sisters only you is that how the story goes abby pushed her coffee aside and rose yeah people generally lean toward the romantic but you dont she began to busy herself at the stove what are you doing im starting dinner i hope you like chili so she cooked or at least she was cooking tonight perhaps to build some sort of impression dylan leaned back in his stool and watched her brown meat im not writing a romance mrs rockwell if the publisher didnt make the ground rules clear to you ill do it now she concentrated on the task at hand why waste time i havent any to waste first rule is im writing this book thats what im paid for youre paid to cooperate abby added spices with a deft hand i appreciate you pointing that out are there other rules she was as cool as her reputation indicated cool and a good many had said unfeeling just this the book is about chuck rockwell youre a part of it whatever i find out about you however personal is mine yon gave up your privacy when you signed the agreement i gave up my privacy mr crosby when i married chuck she stirred the sauce then added a touch of cooking wine am i wrong or do you have reservations about writing this book not about the book about you she turned to him and the momentary puzzlement in her eyes vanished as she studied his face he wouldnt be the first to have come to the conclusion that shed married chuck for money i see thats frank enough well it isnt necessary for you to like me no it isnt that goes both ways the one thing i will be with you mrs rockwell is honest im going to write the most thorough and comprehensive biography of your husband i can to do that im bound to rub you the wrong wayplentybefore were done she set the lid on the pot then brought the coffee to the bar with her im not easily annoyed ive often been told im too complacent youll be annoyed before this is over after adding more coffee to her mug she set the pot on a hot pad it sounds as though youre looking forward to it im not much on smooth water this time she did laugh but it was a quick almost regretful sound she lifted her cup did you ever happen to meet chuck no youd have understood each other very well he was a man with one goal in mind to win hed run the race his way or not at all there was very little flexibility and you though the question was offhand she took it seriously one of my biggest problems growing up was that id tend to bend whenever i was asked ive learned she finished her coffee ill show you to your room you can unpack and get your bearings before dinner she led him down the hall and took one of his suitcases in hand before he could tell her not to bother he knew it was heavy but while he gathered the rest of his things he watched her carry it easily up the stairs stronger than she looked dylan mused it was just one more reason not to take heror anything about herat face value theres a bath at the end of the hall the hot waters fairly reliable after pushing open a door she set his case down next to the bed i brought a desk up here i do have a study of sorts downstairs but i thought this would be more convenient this is fine it was more than fine the room smelted faintly of lemon oil and spice fresh and inviting he liked antiques and recognized the chippendale headboard and the museumquality shaving stand there were sprigs of dried weeds mixed with silvermaple twigs in a brass pot on a chest of drawers the curtains were drawn back to give him a view of rolling snowcovered hills and a barn whose wood had mellowed to gray its a nice place thanks she looked out the window herself and remembered you should have seen it when we bought it there were probably five spots where the roof didnt leak and the plumbing was more wish than reality but i knew it was for me as soon as i saw it you picked it out he carried his typewriter to the desk it was his first order of business yes why she was still looking out the window so her back was toward him he thought he heard her sigh a person needs to sink down roots at least some people do he unearthed his tape recorder and set it next to his typewriter a long way from the fast lane i never raced she looked over her shoulder then turned seeing his tools already set out do you have everything you need for now one question before we get started mrs rockwell why now why after all this time did you agree to authorize a biography of your husband there were two reasons two very important very precious reasons but she didnt think hed understand lets just say i wasnt ready before chucks been gone for nearly five years now and after five years the money might be running out im sure the deal was lucrative when she didnt answer he glanced over there was no anger in her eyes he would have preferred it to the cool unreadable expression that was there dinner should be ready at six we keep early hours here mrs rockwell when i insult you im prepared to be kicked back she smiled for the first time it touched her eyes and gave her face a calm rather sweet vulnerability he felt a twinge of guilt and a tug of attraction both unexpected i dont fight well thats why i generally avoid it there was a crash outside but she didnt even jolt it was followed by a wailing yell worthy of an indian circling a wagon train the dog sent up a riot of barking just before something along the lines of an elephant stampede landed on the porch there are fresh towels in the bathroom thanks mind if i ask what that is what and for the first time he saw real humor in her eyes the vulnerability was gone here was a woman who knew who she was and where she was going it sounds like an invasion thats just what it is she crossed the room then paused when the front door slammed open then shut shaking the pictures on the walls mom were home the greeting echoed followed by another riot of crashing feet and the beginnings of a heated argument my children always feel as though they have to announce themselves god knows why if youll excuse me i have to try to save the living room carpet with that she left him alone with his thoughts chapter two by the time she got to the kitchen her sons were shedding their outdoor clothes shed followed the thin stream of water from the front door hi mom both boys grinned at her school was out and the world was beautiful hi yourself a few damp books sat on the bar a small puddle was forming in front of the refrigerator where the two boys stood the door was wide open and the cool air vied with the heat from the fire abby surveyed the damage and found it minimal chris that looks like your coat on the floor her youngest glanced around in apparent surprise tommy harding got in trouble on the bus again he gathered up his coat and hung it on one of the lower hooks by the rear door he has to sit up in the front for two whole weeks he spit at angela ben announced with relish as he got a sturdy grip on a jug of juice right in her hair lovely abby picked up chriss dripping gloves and handed them to him i dont suppose you had anything to do with it uhuh juice sloshed but ben made it to the counter i just said she was ugly shes only a little ugly chris always ready to root for the underdog busied himself with his boots toad face ben stated as he pouted juice in a glass chris and i raced from the bus i gave him a head start but i still won congratulations i almost won chris struggled with his second boot and i got awful hungry one cookie i mean awful hungry he had the face of a cherub round pate and pretty his blond hair curled a bit around his ears and his hazel eyes were luminous as he looked up at her abby relented with a sigh two he was going to be a heartbreaker im starving ben gulped down his juice then swiped the back of his hand across his mouth her little heathen his hair was already darkening from blond to a sandy brown and fell every which way around his face his eyes were dark and wicked two abby told him accepting the fact that they knew each others measure she was boss for now ben dipped his hand in a cookie jar shaped like a duck whose cars out front its neat the writer remember going to the closet abby took out a mop and began to scrub quickly at the water on the floor mr crosby the guy whos going to write the book about our dad thats right dont see why anybodyd want to read about somebody whos dead there it was again abby thought bens frank and careless dismissal of his father was chuck to blame for it or was she at fault for refusing to carry her child papoosestyle around the circuit blame didnt matter she decided only the result your father was very wellknown ben people still admire him like george washington chris asked stuffing the last of his cookie in his mouth not exactly you two should go up and change before dinner and dont disturb mr crosby she added hes in the spare room nearest the stairs he had a long drive and hes probably resting kay ben sent chris a significant look behind their mothers back well be real quiet i appreciate it abby waited until they were gone then leaned on the mop handle she was doing the right thing she told herself again she had to be dont make the stairs creak ben warned and started up in a pattern hed discovered a few months before hell know were coming were not supposed to bother him but chris meticulously followed his brothers path were not gonna were just going to look at him but mom said listen ben paused dramatically three steps from the top keeping his voice to a whisper suppose he isnt a writer really suppose hes a robber chriss eyes widened a robber yeah warming to the theme ben bent close to his brothers ear hes a robber and hes going to wait until were all sleeping tonight then hes going to clean us out is he going to take my trucks probably then ben played his ace i bet he has a gun too so weve gotta be real quiet and just watch him sold chris nodded the two boys hearts thumping crept up the last steps with his hands tucked in his back pockets dylan stood looking out the window the hills werent so different from the hills hed seen out of his bedroom window as a boy the rain pelted down the fog rolled there wasnt another house in sight unexpected but then he preferred the unexpected hed thought abigail ohurley rockwells home would have been a showplace of the ornate and the elegant hed been certain hed find a houseful of servants unless they were out on errands she didnt appear to have any at all and her house was simply comfortable hed known of course that she had children but hed expected nannies or boarding school the woman whose picture he had in his file dressed in white mink and glittering with diamonds wouldnt have the time or inclination to actually raise children if she wasnt that woman who the hell was she it was his job to research the life of chuck rockwell but dylan found himself more interested in the widow hardly looked like a widow he mused as he moved to drop one of his suitcases on the bed looked more like a graduate student on winter break but then she had been an actress of sorts perhaps she still was he flipped back the top of his suitcase a small sound hardly more than a murmur caught his attention as an investigative reporter dylan had found himself in enough back alleys and seedy bars to develop eyes in the back of his head casually he pulled out a stack of shirts and sweaters while he shifted his gaze to the mirror at the foot of the bed the bedroom door opened slowly just a crack then a tiny bit wider he tensed and waited though it appeared as though he simply continued to unpack he saw two eyes in the mirror one above the other moving to the dresser he beard the sound of nervous breathing when the door opened a bit wider he saw small fingers wrap around the edge he looks like a robber ben said in a piercing whisper hardly able to contain the excitement hes got shifty eyes do you think hes got a gun probably a whole arsenal wildly pleased ben followed dylans movements around the room hes going to the closet he whispered frantically be quiet the words were hardly out of his mouth when the door was yanked open the two boys tumbled into the room sprawled on the carpet chris looked up at the mans face which seemed miles above his his bottom up poked out but his eyes were dry you cant have my trucks he was ready to yell frantically for his mother at a moments notice okay amused dylan crouched down until they were almost eyetoeye maybe i could see them sometime chriss eyes darted back to his brother maybe are you a robber chris mortified ben struggled to untangle himself from his brother and stand hes just a kid am not im six six dylan struggled to look suitably impressed and you im eight bens conscience tugged at him well i will be pretty soon mom thinks youre a writer sometimes i think so too a goodlooking boy dylan decided and with such an eager gleam of curiosity in his eyes he was hard to resist im dylan he held out his hand and waited while ben pondered im ben he took dylans hand appreciating the mantoman offer this is chris nice to meet you dylan offered his hand to chris with a sheepishly pleased smile he took it we thought your car was neat it has its moments ben said it probably goes two hundred miles an hour it might unable to resist he ruffled the boys hair i dont chris grinned he liked the way the man smelled so different from his mom my mom said we werent supposed to disturb you did she dylan set the boy on his feet then rose himself ill let you know when you do accepting the words at face value chris climbed onto the bed and chattered while dylan unpacked ben held back saying little and watching everything doesnt trust easily dylan thought though he agreed with the sentiment he thought it was a pity to find it in such a small boy the little one was a crackerjack and one whod believe whatever tumbled out of your mouth it would pay to watch what you said chris watched as dylan pulled out a carton of cigarettes mom says those are a duty habit dylan tossed them into a dresser drawer moms are pretty smart do you like dirty habits i dylan decided to let that one ride why dont you hand me that camera willing to please chris drew the compact millimeter out of the case he held it for just a moment eyeing the knobs its pretty neat thanks you going to take our picture i just might as he set in on the dresser dylan glanced in the mirror and saw ben poking gingerly at his tape recorder interested caught ben snatched his hands back spies use these so ive heard got any around here ben sent him a quietly measuring look he wouldnt have expected from a boy twice his age maybe we thought mr petrie who helps with the horses was a spy for awhile chris looked in the suitcase to see if there was anything else interesting but he wasnt you have horses we got a bunch of them what kind chris shrugged mostly big ones youre such a dope ben said theyre morgans one day im going to ride thunder thats the stallion as he spoke the caution in his eyes vanished to be replaced by enthusiasm hes the best there is so this was the key to the boy dylan mused that someone could turn if he cared to i had a tennessee walker when i was a kid sixteen hands sixteen bens eyes widened before he remembered he shouldnt be too enthusiastic he probably wasnt as fast as thunder when dylan made no comment ben struggled then gave up whatd you call him sly he had a way of knowing which pocket you had the carrot in ben chris ben flushed with guilt as he spotted his mother in the doorway she had that look in her eye oblivious chris bounced happily on the bed hi mom i dont think dylans a robber after all im sure were all relieved to hear that benjamin didnt i tell you not to disturb mr crosby yes maam you had to use maam when she used benjamin they werent dylan took a pair of slacks and hung them in the closet we were getting acquainted thats kind of you she sent him an even look then ignored him maybe you boys have forgotten about your chores but mom she cut ben off with a look i dont think we have to discuss responsibilities again dylan stuck a shirt in his drawer and tried not to chuckle hed heard the same line in the same tone from his own mother countless times you have animals depending on you for their dinner abby reminded her sons and she rustled a paper this seems to have fallen on the floor im sure you were going to show it to me ben shuffled his feet as she held up his c in spelling i sort of studied mmm walking over she cupped his chin in her hand delinquent he smiled knowing the crisis had passed im going to study tonight you bet you are now scram you too she held out a hand for chris as ben scrambled from the room ben said he might steal my trucks abby lifted him up by the elbows to kiss him soundly youre very gullible is that okay for now change your clothes at six chris couldnt have defined charmbut he knew he had it im still awful hungry i guess we could eat a little early if you get your chores done since it seemed cookies were out he wiggled down and walked to the door he stopped and aimed a smile at dylan bye see you abby waited a moment then turned back im sorry im afraid theyre used to having the run of the house and dont think about other peoples privacy they didnt bother me she laughed and tossed her hair back from her shoulder that wont last i promise you if you dont mind well eat when theyve finished their chores and cleaned up anytime mr crosby the laughter was gone and her eyes were calm and sober again but it was her mouth he realized that drew his attention it was fun sensual serious im going to try to give you my cooperation with this project that doesnt include my children he drew his shaving kit out of the case which means i dont want them involved you arent to interview or question them about their father after setting the kit on his dresser he turned back to her soft she was a woman who looked soft as butter and she had a voice to match but he had a feeling shed grow talons if her children were threatened that was fair enough i hadnt really given that any thought id think both of them a little young to remember much youd be surprised she thought but nodded then we understand each other not yet not by a long shot mrs rockwell she didnt care for the look in his eyes it was too intrusive how much of herself would she have left when he finished his assignment it was a gamble and shed already decided to take it ill have one of the boys let you know when dinners ready after shed closed the door and started down the hall she found herself chilled so chilled that she rubbed her hands up and down her arms she wanted to call her family to hear her parents comforting voices or chanters caustic one she dragged a hand through her hair as she walked down the steps maybe she could call maddy and absorb some of her carelessly upbeat views on life in general she couldnt call trace big brother was roaming his way through europe or africa or god knew where she couldnt call any of them abby reminded herself as she stepped into the kitchen again she was on her own and had been for years by her own choice theyd come any and all of them would come if she so much as hinted at need so she couldnt call she wasnt simply the middle triplet now she was abby rockwell mother of two sons she had to see to them provide for them raise them and by god she was going to make certain they had some kind of legacy from their father she pulled vegetables out of the crisper and began to prepare a salad both her sons would mutter over when the stock was fed and hands and faces reluctantly washed abby turned off the flame under the pot of chili chris go up and tell mr crosby dinners ready ill do it bens offer was quick and out of character when abby sent him a questioning look he shrugged i want to get something upstairs anyway all right thanks but no fooling around everythings ready i dont have to eat mushrooms do i chris was already pulling himself onto his stool no you dont have to eat any mushrooms you gonna pick them out yes all of them if i eat one ill throw up understood she said and glanced up to see dylan and ben come in go ahead and sit im just setting things up moving automatically she began to dish salad into bowls i dont want any ben told her as he slid onto his stool your body does she added dressing here chris not one mushroom if there is im gonna yes i know she dished up a third bowl and set it in front of dylan now if youll she caught herself when she glanced over and saw him grinning at her oh im sorry she looked down at the salad shed fixed him just as tidily as she had fixed her sons i guess im just used to dishing it up its all right he picked up a bottle of dressing and shook it lazily i think we can handle it from here she sat down and began to eat as chris chattered between and during mouthfuls ben was picking at his salad and watching dylan out of the corner of his eye odd she thought he looked what wary resentful she couldnt be sure he wasnt the most open child but then it occurred to her all at once that dylan was sitting in what had been chucks seat true hed only sat there a handful of times and those times had been few and far between but it had been his did ben remember hed been barely three the last time his father had stayed at the house barely three she thought and yet so stiffly adult in too many ways she felt the elbow nudge her ribs and blinked herself back what ben pushed his salad bowl aside i said i ate most of it oh she started to reach for the ladle to spoon out chili i can get it myself she started to serve him then caught dylans eyes over bens head something in them made her pass ben the pot and sit back annoyed with herself the rain seems to be letting up she commented as she offered the chili to dylan seems to dylan helped himself i guess thingsll be a mess for the next few days mud up to your ankles abby set chriss chili next to him to cool if you like being outdoors i hope you brought something more substantial than your tennis shoes ill get by he tasted the chili ether it was delicious or he was starving whatever the reason he dug in the boys tell me you have some horses yes we breed morgans use your napkin chris breed dylan deftly avoided being splattered with sauce as chris jiggled his bowl i didnt know you were in business unfortunately a lot of people dont then she smiled and tugged at bens ear but they will do you know anything about horses he had a rocker chris piped up a walker ben rolled his eyes and would have wiped his mouth on his sleeve if he hadnt caught the warning look from his mother he said it was sixteen hands did he i was raised on a farm in jersey seems stupid to be a writer then ben commented as he scraped the bottom of his bowl must be boring like being in school all the time some people actually enjoy using their minds more mr crosby a little he took another scoop though he wasnt a talkative man preferring to listen he found himself compelled to justify his profession to the boy you know when i write i get to travel a lot and meet a lot of people thats pretty good ben made patterns on the bottom of his bowl with his fork im going to travel too when i grow up im going to be a space marauder interesting choice dylan murmured then i can fly from galaxy to galaxy and loot and pil pil pillage abby finished for him bens fond of crime ive already started saving up bail money its better than chris he wants to be a garbage man not anymore the fire was in chriss eyes as he talked through his last mouthful of chili dont talk with your mouth full love she scooted bens milk in front of him as a reminder we visited maddy in new york last year chris was fascinated with the garbage trucks dumb bens voice dripped with scorn as he looked at his brother real dumb ben isnt it your turn to wash up aw mom we made an agreement i cook you guys take turns with the dishes he sulked a moment but then a wicked gleam appeared in his eyes hes living here now with a jerk of his head ben indicated dylan he should have a turn too why was it abby wondered that ben was only logical when it was to his advantage ben mr crosby is a guest now the kid has a point dylan spoke casually but he was rewarded by a grin of approval from ben since im going to be around a while the least i can do is follow the rules mr crosby you dont have to humor the monsters around here ben will be glad to do the dishes no i wont he muttered you know when someone cooks you a good meal the least you can do is pitch in and clean up the mess as he pushed away from the counter dylan saw ben hang his head ill take the shift tonight bens head came up immediately no fooling seems fair to me great come on chris lets go do your homework abby finished she watched bens mouth open and close he knew better than to press his luck then you can watch television with a clatter of feet they were down the hall and racing up the stairs such unpretentious children she murmured i suppose i should apologize for their lack of manners again dont bother i was a kid once myself i suppose you were with her elbows on the counter abby dropped her chin onto her hands and looked at him its difficult to imagine certain people being small and vulnerable would you like anything else mr crosby your kids dont have any problem with my first name weve had a meal together now and were going to be together for a number of weeks why dont we try something a little less formal abigail abby she corrected automatically abby he liked the pretty oldfashioned sound of it it suits you better dylans an unusual name my father wanted something solid like john my mother was more romantic and more stubborn he was staring at her again in that cool unblinking way shed already determined meant questions were forming she wasnt ready to start answering them yet my parents always preferred the unusual she began as she slid off the stool to stack dishes thats my job abby continued to clear the bar im sure youve earned bens undying gratitude for getting him off the hook but you dont have to fed obligated she turned with a stack of bowls in her hands and all but ran into him a deals a deal he said very quietly and reached out to take the bowls from her their fingers brushed as lightly as fingers brush every day in ordinary situations abby jerked back and nearly sent the dishes crashing to the floor a little jumpy he watched her he had discovered that you learned more from faces than from words im not used to having anyone else in the kitchen a feeble excuse and one that didnt ring true even to herself id better give you a hand at least tonight until you team where things go theres a dishwasher she grabbed more dishes from the counter filling her hands and her mind with ordinary chores it seems ridiculous that the boys make such a fuss over the dishes when they dont have to do much more than load and unload we could spread out the pain a little more if i cooked once a week and you cleared up she was bent over the dishwasher and she had to straighten to stare at him you cook he nudged her aside surprised it was silly to be she knew but none of the men in her life had ever known one end of the stove from another she remembered her father quite clearly hardboiling eggs on a hot plate in a motel room but that was as far as it had gone i suppose when you live alone it helps he thought of his marriage she heard him laugh but he didnt sound amused even when you dont it helps the dishwasher rattled a bit as he added dishes this things a little shaky she frowned at the back of his head it works she wasnt about to admit that shed bought it secondhand and with a lot of sweat and skinned knuckles installed it herself youd know best with the last of the dishes in he closed it but it sounds to me like a couple of the bolts have shaken loose you might want to have it looked at there were a lot of things that needed to be looked at and they would be once the manuscript was submitted and the rest of the advance was in her bank account i imagine you want to work out some sort of schedule eager to start abby went to the coffeepot and poured two cups without asking youre here to get background im here to give it to you the best times for me are midmorning or early afternoon but ill try to be flexible i appreciate it he took the coffee then leaned on the stove dose to her as a kind of test for both of them he thought he could just smell the rain on her hair she stood very still for a moment still enough that he could see his own reflection in her eyes when he saw it he forgot to look for anything else incredibly he found he wanted to reach out to touch the hair that brushed her shoulders she stepped back the reflection vanished and so did the need breakfast is early concentrate on routine abby warned herself as long as she did there wouldnt be room for these sudden sharp desires to sneak up on her the kids have to catch the school bus at so if youre a late sleeper youre on your own ill manage if im not in the house im probably in the barn or one of the other outbuildings but i should be ready for you by ten and what in hell did a woman with hands like a harpist do in a barn for an hour and a half in the morning he decided to find out for himself rather than ask well figure on ten the time element might vary from day to day yes i understand that the tension was draining as they focused in on business abby relaxed against the counter and savored what would be her last cup of coffee for the night there were hours yet to fill between this and the cup of herbal tea shed pamper herself with at bedtime ill do the best i can the evenings of course are taken up with the children they go to bed at so if theres something important we can go over it after that but generally i do my paperwork at night so do i she had a lovely face soft warm open with just a touch of reserve around the mouth it was the kind of face that could make a man forget about feminine guile if he wasnt careful dylan was a careful man abby one question offtherecord this time whyd you give up show business this time she really laughed it was low and smooth a distinctly sensuous sound did you ever happen to catch our act the ohurley triplets i mean no i didnt think so if you had you wouldnt ask it was difficult to resist people who could laugh at themselves that bad oh worse much worse taking her cup to the sink she rinsed it out i have to go up and check on the boys when theyre this quiet for this long i get antsy help yourself to more coffee the tvs in the living room abby he wasnt satisfied with her with the house with the situation nothing was precisely what it seemed that much he was sure of still when she turned toward him her eyes were calm i intend to get to the bottom of you he murmured she felt a little jolt inside but quickly smoothed it over im not as complex as you seem to want to believe in any case youre here to write about chuck im going to do that too that was what she was counting on that was what she was afraid of with a nod she walked out to go to her children chapter three for the second time dylan heard his door creak open in bed abruptly awake it took him only a moment to remember he wasnt in some hotel room on assignment those days were over and the gun hed kept under his pillow for three years running wasnt there out of habit he kept his eyes closed and his breathing even still sleeping the quiet slightly disdainful whisper was bens chris jockeyed for position and a better view how come he gets to sleep late cause hes grownup stupid they get to do whatever they want moms up shes a grownup thats different shes a mom ben chris dylan judged the low call to be coming from the bottom of the stairs lets move it the busll be here in ten minutes come on ben narrowed his eyes for one last look we can spy on him later when the door closed dylan opened his eyes he couldnt claim to be an expert on kids but he was beginning to think that the rockwell boys were a different kettle of fish altogether so was their mother pushing himself up he glanced at his watch it seemed things ran on time around here and it was time he began twenty minutes later dylan walked downstairs the house was quiet and empty he decided before he came to the bottom landing the scent of coffee drew him to the kitchen it looked as though a hurricane had struck and moved on there were two cereal boxes on the breakfast bar both open with a trail of puffed wheat and little oat circles leading to the edge a halfopen bag of bread lay on the counter between the sink and stove next to it was a goodsized dollop of what dylan assumed to be grape jelly there was a jar of peanut butter with the top sitting crookedly and an assortment of knives spoons and bowls muddy paw prints ran just inside the back door then stopped abruptly didnt get far did you dylan thought as he searched out a cup for coffee with the first swallow of caffeine rushing through his system he walked to the window however confused things looked inside outside seemed peaceful enough the rain had frozen and covered what was left of the snow with a shiny brittle layer it glistened as the sun shone brightly by the end of the day he decided it would be a mess without the fog he could see past the barn to the rolling hills beyond if she had neighbors he thought they were few and far between what made a woman bury herself like this he wondered especially a woman who was used to lights and action there was something else that bothered him something that had been bothering him all along where were the men in her life he took another sip letting his gaze sweep over paddock and outbuildings surely a woman who looked like abby had them shed been a widow for four years a young wealthy widow though he was willing to concede that she took motherhood seriously that hardly answered the question two boys under ten didnt make up for male companionship for some reason she seemed to want him to take her little farm and her domesticity at face value his mouth twisted in a grimace and he downed the rest of the coffee he took nothing at face value particularly not women then he saw her she came out of a little shed and closed the door carefully behind her her hair caught the sunlight as she combed her fingers through it and just stood there her coat was bundled up to her chin and stopped just short of her hips where slim jeans ran down and tucked into scarred boots was she posing he thought as a rush of arousal pushed unwanted into his system did she know he was there watching as she stood with her face lifted to the sun and a quiet smile on her face but she never glanced toward the house she never turned swinging the bucket she carried she walked across the frozen ground to the barn abby had always liked the feel and scents of a barn especially in the morning when the animals were just stirring from sleep the lights was dim the air a bit musty she heard the purring of the barn cats as they woke for breakfast after setting the bucket beside the door she switched on the lights and began her morning routine hello baby opening the first stall she stepped inside to check the chestnut mare which was nearly ready to foal i know you feel fat and ugly she chuckled as the mare blew into her hand ive felt that way a couple times myself gently expertly she ran her hands along the mares belly the mares muscles quivered then relaxed as abby murmured to her in a week or two itll all be over then youll have such a pretty baby you know mr jorgensens interested in buying your foal with a sigh she rested her cheek against the mares neck why does that make me feel like a slave trader first sale she hadnt heard dylan come in she turned slowly one arm still slung around the mares neck hed shaved and though his face was smooth now and still attractive it seemed no kinder to her than before yeah up until now ive just been buying and setting up he stepped inside to get a closer look the mare was beautiful strong and fullbodied in the way of morgans with alert eyes and a glossy coat you pick this mare out eve i call her eve because shes the first of my breeders she was just weaned when i got her at auction mr petrie said to bid on her so i bid looks like your petrie knows his horseflesh id say this little ladys going to give you plenty of foals plan to breed her back thats the idea eve nuzzled into her shoulder it doesnt seem fair thats what shes built for it had been a long time since hed been around horses hed forgotten how good a barn could smell how soothing it could be to work around and with animals maybe people had consumed him for too long the mare shifted abby shifted with her and brushed against him the contact was anything but soothing how many do you have her mind usually so orderly was blank how many horses oh she was being ridiculous reacting as though shed never touched a man before eightthe stallion two mares already bred and two well breed in the spring three geldings for riding the last was a luxury shed never regretted not exactly the big leagues abby went on relaxing again four mares and a decent stallion properly managed sounds like a pretty good start to me thats what ive got she scratched the mare between the ears a start he watched her reach for a halter what are you doing they need to go out in the paddock while i clean the stalls you alone she went to the next stall to repeat the process on a second mare mr petrie comes by three times a week to help out but hes down with the flu like half the county come on girls taking the two lead ropes she led the horses out for a moment dylan just stood there with his hands in his pockets the woman looked to him as though shed keel over after one shovelful of manure what was she trying to prove the martyr act might work on certain men but hed always believed that if you asked for it you probably deserved it then he looked down the line of stalls he swore as he pulled a halter down whether she was doing all this for his benefit or not he couldnt just stand around and let her work alone outside abby closed the paddock gate behind the first two mares then turned to see dylan leading out another pair thanks she met him halfway and automatically reached for the rope when he just looked at her she stepped back feeling foolish look that wasnt a hint i dont want you to feel obligated i dont he walked past her and released the horses in the paddock mr crosby she corrected herself dylan i can handle things im sure you have other things youd rather do with your morning he closed the gate off the top of my head i can only think of about two dozen lets get the others she lifted her brow then fell into step beside him well since youre being so gracious about it im known for being gracious i dont doubt it the geldings go out the first three stalls on this side i leave the stallion in until the rest is dealt with hes apt to bite one of the geldings or mount any mare than isnt fast enough to get away sounds like a sweetheart hes as mean as they come but his lines just as pure as she slipped a halter around a roan the horse lowered his head then shoved her hard instinctively dylan made a grab to right her but she was shoving the horse back and laughing bully she said accusingly burying her face in his mane hed rather be taken for a ride than go into the paddock maybe later fella ive got my hands full today when the horses were settled abby pulled on a pair of work gloves sure she asked as she offered a second pair to dylan you take the left side he grabbed a pitchfork and went to work figuring hed have the four stalls cleaned out and spread with fresh hay before shed finished the first it had been a while since hed indulged in pure manual labor workouts kept his body in tune but didnt he discovered give the same kind of gratification his muscles coiled and tensed as the wheelbarrow filled he rolled it to the rear of the barn and added to the pile abby had switched on a portable radio and was singing along as she worked he ignored her or tried to shed never worked alongside a man before oh there was mr petrie she thought as she wiped a light film of sweat from her brow but he was different chuck had never so much as lifted a hoof pick in the barn and her father abby grinned as she spread fresh hay whenever francis xavier ohurley visited the farm he always found something vital to do when there was work one mustnt forget the man was an artist abby reminded herself trying not to think of just how much she missed him and the rest of her family the little farm in virginia didnt suit their lifestyles it hadnt suited chucks it suited her and it suited her children that was something shed never forget whatever compromises she had made whatever compromises she had yet to make she wouldnt bend there dylan sent his pitchfork into the soiled hay then glanced up when abby moved to the stall beside him why dont you finish over there i already did she started shoveling dylan glanced over his shoulder then turned completely around the three stalls were clean and fresh frowning he turned back hed barely started on his third you work fast he muttered its routine because shed never really understood the male ego she didnt give it a thought as she filled the wheelbarrow behind them i said id do this side yeah i appreciate the help abby tossed in a last forkful then walked over to grasp the handles of the wheelbarrow put that down its pretty full id just as soon make an extra trip as put the damn thing down he sliced his pitchfork down in the hay and walked toward her angermale anger though she hadnt been around it in a good many years she still recognized it cautiously abby lowered the cart and released the handles all right its down im not having you haul that thing while im around but youre not hauling twenty pounds of horse manure while im around he grasped the handles himself understand possibly calm patient abby picked up her pitchfork again and leaned on it i can haul it all i want when youre not around thats fine he began to roll it down the sloping concrete thats silly she said he muttered something she couldnt quite catch shaking her head she walked outside to begin leading the horses back after the one outburst they worked in silence as dylan finished up abby returned all the horses to their stalls and fed them then only the stallion remained ill take him out abby held a halter behind her back and opened only the top half of the stall door first hes moody and unpredictable dont care much for being closed up do you thunder she murmured cautiously opening the bottom half and stepping inside he danced back eyeing her but she continued to talk in the spring you can just graze and graze and have your way with those two pretty mares she slipped the halter around his neck taking a firm hold as he swung his head in annoyance highstrung dylan commented to say the least better stand back he likes to kick and he isnt particular who taking her at her word dylan moved aside thunder started to rear then subsided when abby scolded him scolded him in much the same way dylan thought as she continued out of the barn as hed heard her scold her sons he picked up his pitchfork and put his back into it when abby came back in he was nearly done you dont seem to be a stranger to this sort of work because hed shed his coat she could see the muscles rippling along his forearms he grunted an answer but she didnt hear she wondered what it would feel like to touch those arms when they were flexed with strength it had been so long so incredibly long since she caught herself and stepped away to stroke one of the mares which was busily gobbling grain did you raise horses cows dylan spread hay over the floor of the stall we had a dairy farm but there were always a couple of horses around i havent mucked out a stall since i was sixteen doesnt look like youve forgotten how no he hadnt forgotten how and it wouldnt be wise to forget what hed come for still at the moment he wanted to finish what hed started got a broom its bens job to sweep the barn she took the pitchfork from him and set it on its hook i usually leave thunder out in the paddock through the morning unless its filthy out so were done for now the least i can do after you saved me all this time is to fix you some fresh coffee all right then hed get his tape recorder and his notebook and start doing what hed come to do the kitchen was a mess she recalled did you have any trouble finding breakfast just coffee she bent over to pick up her bucket her back ached just a bit i guess i can give you some bacon and eggs i can guarantee the eggsre fresh he glanced into the bucket and saw a mound of light brown eggs you have chickens over there she indicated the shed hed seen her come out of earlier theyre the boys responsibility in the summer i havent the heart to make them trudge around before school so he slipped the ice was rapidly turning to slush next to him abby reached out then slid herself instinctively they grabbed for each other teetered then righted themselves her face was buried in his shoulder and she began to giggle you wouldnt laugh if youd landed on your back and broken your eggs his hand was deep in her hair it shouldnt be he knew but it was so soft and the neck beneath was so slender i always laugh when i escape catastrophe still smiling she looked up her face was flushed her eyes glowing without thinking without being able to think he tightened the arm around her waist the smile faded but the glow in her eyes deepened he was so close his body so hard and be was looking at her as though theyd known each other all their lives rather than one day she wished they had she wished desperately that they had and that he was someone she could talk to share with lean on just a little his fingers brushed the nape of her neck and she shivered though they were warm i should have warned you she began suddenly she found her heart was beating too fast to allow her to think much less speak warned me about what it was crazy it was wrong he had no business forgetting his purpose here in this sudden wild desire to taste her but crazy or not wrong or not he wanted to feel her mouth meet his and give he lowered his head watching her the sun shone on her face warm and bright but her eyes were shadowed and as wary as the mares had been when hed slipped the halter over her head the path abby inched her head back in a gesture of confusion that was easily mistaken for teasing her eyes never left his her lips parted it gets slippery so i found out the fingers at the nape of her neck pressed lightly drawing her closer still closer until their lips were only a whisper apart longings needs shed thought shed finished with sprang out fresh and terribly strong she wanted oh she wanted to give way to them and feel just feel but shed always been the sensible one only once had she forgotten that and she couldnt forget again dont his mouth brushed over hers and he felt the tremulous movement he knew women used as seduction i already have no she was weakening the hand that she brought to his chest simply lay there please dont her breath was unsteady her eyes halfclosed dylan had little respect for a woman who pretended reluctance so that a man was left with the responsibility and the blame need crawled through him but he released her his eyes were flat and cool as he nodded your choice she was chilled and churning there was something biting something hurting in his tone but she couldnt think about that now careful of the melting ice she picked her way back to the house after using the boot pull on the back porch she took the eggs to the sink and began washing up dylan came in behind her if youll give me a few minutes ill have something hot take your time he walked past her and out of the kitchen she washed each egg meticulously waiting for her mind to empty and her system to calm serenity was what she relied on what shed worked for she couldnt allow an accidental embrace with a man she barely knew to change that hadnt he released her without a seconds hesitation abby began to put the eggs in one of the empty cartons she kept under the sink he was safe she only sighed over that once shed never been terribly sexual in any case she reminded herself as she pulled a slab of bacon from the refrigerator hadnt chuck pointed that out with complete clarity she simply wasnt enough to fulfill a mans needs abby heated the castiron skillet and watched the bacon bubble and shrink she was a good wife dependable responsible sympathetic but she wasnt someone a man burned for in the middle of the night she didnt need to be she put on more water for coffee she was happy being what she was she intended to go on being what she was taking a deep breath she unclenched her hands dylan was coming back i didnt ask you how you wanted your eggs she began then turned to see him set his tape recorder on the counter nerves threatened and were conquered you want to work in here heres fine and id like the eggs over easy he found an uncluttered spot at the counter and sat listen abby i dont expect you to cook three meals a day for me the check you sent for expenses was more than adequate she broke an egg in the pan i thought youd have a staff a staff of what she broke the second egg then glanced over abruptly nerves gone she laughed a staff as in maid and cook and so on delighted she shook her hair back then gave the eggs her full attention where in the world did you get an idea like that automatically he turned on the tape recorder rockwell was wealthy you were his heir most women in your position would have a servant or two she remained facing the stove so that her face was curtained by her hair i dont really care to have people around im here most of the time itd be silly to have someone dusting around me didnt you have a staff before your husband died not here in chicago she scooped up his eggs that was before and right after ben was born we lived in a suite in his mothers house she had a full staff chuck traveled a great deal and we didnt really have a family yet so we hadnt decided where to settle his mother she didnt approve of you abby set the plate in front of him without a tremor where did you hear that i heard all sorts of bits and pieces its part of the job it couldnt have been easy living in janice rockwells home when she didnt approve of the marriage i dont think its fair to say she didnt approve abby went back for coffee choosing her words carefully she was devoted to chuck you probably knew she raised him alone when her husband died chuck was only seven then it isnt easy raising children without a partner youd know about that she sent him an even look yes i would in any case janice was very protective of chuck he was a dynamic attractive man the kind who attracted women on the circuit there are all manner of groupies hovering around you werent a fan i never followed racing we were always traveling around playing in clubs and so forth i didnt even know who chuck was when we first met hard to believe she poured coffee into two cups on the counter janice thought so too and resented you abby took a calming sip of coffee your job isnt to put words in my mouth is it she wasnt going to be easy to shake it seemed to him that she had her answers down pat too pat no go on janice didnt resent me personally she would have resented any woman who took chuck away from her its only natural in any case i think we got along well enough though he intended to dig a bit deeper there he let it pass for now why dont you tell me how you met rockwell that was easy she could talk about that without hedging we were playingmy family and iin a club in miami my parents did this little comedy routine and a couple of songs then my sisters and i ran through our bitshow tunes with a sprinkling of popular music god the costumes she broke off laughing then began to set the kitchen to rights as she talked anyway we did bring some business in i always thought chantel was responsible for that she was stunning and though she never had maddys range she could sell a song the race brought the drivers into town the mechanics backers groupies we always had a pretty good crowd he watched her move around the kitchen with a smile on her face as though she were amused by the memory every night pop had to ward men off who wanted to ah see chantel home then one night chuck walked in with brad billinger billingers retired now he quit racing after chuck was killed they were close very close i havent seen him in a couple of years now but he always sends the boys something on their birthdays and for christmas as soon as they sat down at a table there was a lot of noise and confusion right during the middle of a set you get used to that kind of thing in clubs and have to know how to handle it noise hecklers drunks i can imagine pop had delegated me to deal with that kind of problem when the three of us were on because chantel tended to lose her temper and maddy had a habit of walking right offstage until things calmed down again so i leaned into the mike and made some joke something about our next number being so dangerous that we needed absolute quiet they didnt pay a lot of attention but we kept on then we went into somewhere from west side story do you know it ive heard it dylan leaned back and lit a cigarette eighteen and handling drunks and hecklers she couldnt be as soft as she looked i looked over to where most of the noise was still coming from and chuck was looking right at me it was an odd feeling when you perform people watch but they rarely really look at you at the break chantel made a comment about superdriver staring at me that was the first inkling i had of what chuck did for a living chantel was always reading gossip columns now shes in them she loves every minute of it after searching through the kitchen drawers abby came up with the lid of a mason jar for dylan to use as an ashtray sorry i dont have anything else chris has already given me your views on smoking so it was love at first sight it was how did she explain shed been eighteen and naive in ways the man sitting in her kitchen would never understand you could call it that chuck stayed until the last set was over then came back and introduced himself maybe part of the attraction for him was that i really didnt know he was someone i should be impressed with he was very polite and asked me to dinner it was after midnight and he asked me to dinner she smiled again shed been so young and like chris so gullible of course pop wouldnt hear of it the next afternoon there were two dozen roses delivered to the motel where we were staying pink roses nothing that romantic had ever happened to me and that night he was back again he kept coming back until hed charmed my mother persuaded my father and infatuated me when he left miami for the next race i left with him and i had his ring on my finger she glanced down now it was bare lifes a funny thing isnt it she murmured you never know what trick its going to pull next how did your family feel about you marrying chuck she pulled herself back to the business at hand give him enough abby reminded herself just dont give him everything youd have to understand that my family rarely all think the same thing about anything my mother cried then altered her wedding dress to fit me even though we were married by a justice of the peace pop cried too after all he was marrying me off to a stranger and his act had just been shot to hell picking up an apple she polished it absently on her sleeve maddy said i was crazy but that everyone deserved to do something crazy now and then and chantel she hesitated chantel what it was time she felt for caution again chantels the oldest of the three of ustwo and a half minutes older than me but that still makes her big sister she didnt think chuck or anyone was good enough she had plans to have a great many love affairs and decided i was blowing my chance to have them too with a laugh she bit into the apple if you believe everything you read chantels had so many love affairs shes lucky to be alive trace didnt hear about the wedding until oh three or four months later he sent me a crystal bird from austria trace thats your brother older brother i dont have much information on him who does i doubt it matters in this case really trace never even met chuck dylan made a note anyway from there you hit the circuit some might call it an odd sort of honeymoon in some ways that entire first year had been a honeymoon in other ways thered been no honeymoon at all no solitary time for settling in and learning id traveled before she shrugged i was born traveling literally pop got my mother off a train in duluth and to a hospital twenty minutes before she gave birth ten days later we hit the road again until this place id never lived in one spot for more than six months at a time you follow one circuit or you follow another but the grand prixs more exciting in some ways but like performing theres a lot of sweat and preparation for a few minutes in the spotlight why did you marry him she looked back at him her eyes were calm enough but he thought her smile was just a little sad he was a knight on a white charger id always believed in fairy tales chapter four she wasnt being honest with him dylan didnt need a lie detector to know that abby veered away from the truth every time they talked when she veered she did so calmly looking him straight in the eye only the slightest change in her tone the briefest hesitation tipped him off to the lie dylan didnt mind lies in fact in his work he expected them reasons for them variedselfpreservation embarrassment a need to gloss over the image people wanted to paint themselves in the best light and it was up to him to find the shadows a lie or more precisely the reason for the lie often told him more than a flat truth his background as a reporter had taught him to base a story on fact corroborated fact then leave judgment to the reader his opinion might leak through but his feelings rarely did his main problem with abby was that hed yet to satisfy himself as to her motivation why lie when the truth would undoubtedly sell more books sensationalism was more marketable than domestic bliss she hadnt reached the point where she portrayed her marriage as idyllic but she certainly had managed to skim over problem areas and thered been plenty of them alone in his room with only the desk lamp to shed light dylan took out a stack of tapes a glance at this watch showed that it was just past midnight the rest of the house was long since in bed but then regular hours had never been a part of his life schedules and time frames boxed a man in dylan didnt like walls unless he built them himself he could work through the day if he chose or he could work through the night because hours didnt matter only the results the house was quiet around him with only a faint wind scraping at the windows he might have been alonebut he was aware maybe too aware that he wasnt there were three people in the house and he found them fascinating chris and ben dylan recalled sympathetically had gone to their rooms after a firm scolding and a few tears using their mothers best china to feed the dog hadnt been the smartest move they could have made she hadnt lifted a hand to them or even so much as shouted but her lecture and disapproval had had both boys chins dragging on the ground a nice trick though it amused him dylan pushed the whole business aside he had work to do and a woman to figure out hed already interviewed several people about chuck rockwell opinions and feelings about the man were varied but none of them were middleoftheroad the one firm fact dylan had picked up was that people had either adored rockwell or detested him dylan picked up the tape marked stanholz and turned it over in his hand grover p stanholz had been chucks original backer a wealthy chicago lawyer with a love of racing and personal ties to the rockwells for ten years hed played father mentor and banker to rockwell hed seen the young driver go from an eager rookie to one of the top competitors on the circuit just over a year before his death stanholz had pulled the financial rug out from under his famous protg thoughtful dylan slipped the tape into the recorder and ran it nearly to the end it only took him a moment to find the spot he was looking for rockwell was a winner a moneymaker and a friend dylans own voice came through the speaker low and distinct automatically he turned the volume down so that the sound reached no farther then the end of his desk why when he was favored to win the french grand prix did you pull out as his backer there was a long silence then a rustling sound dylan remembered that stanholz had drawn out a cigar and taken his time unwrapping it as i explained my interest in chuck wasnt simply financial i had been a close friend of his fathers was a friend of his mothers there was another silence as stanholz lit his cigar when chuck started out he was already a winner you could see it in his eyes the beauty was he had a tremendous love and respect for the sport he was special how he was going straight to the top whether i had backed him or hed had to scramble to find the money to race he was going to the top couldnt he have used the rockwell money to race stanholzs laugh came as a wheeze over the tape chucks money was tied up tight in trust janice adored that boy shed have never released the money so he could drive at mites an hour believe me she fried me for doing it but the boy was hard to resist it came on a sigh wistful regretful men like chuck dont come along every day racing takes a certain arrogance and a certain humility it takes common sense and a disregard for life and limb its a balance he was devoted to his profession and eager to make a name for himself ive always wondered if the trouble was that he won too much too soon chuck began to see himself as indestructible and unaccountable unaccountable there was another pause here a hesitation then a quiet sigh whatever he did however he did it was all right because of who he was he forgot if you can understand what i mean that he was human chuck rockwell was on a collision course with himself if he hadnt crashed in detroit hed have done so elsewhere i felt pulling out as his backer might give him something to think about what do you mean he was on a collision course with himself chuck was racing his own engine sooner or later he was going to burn out drugs i cant comment on that it was a lawyers voice dry and flat mr stanholz its been rumored that rockwell had been using drugs most specifically cocaine for some time before his fatal crash in detroit if you want that substantiated youll have to go elsewhere chuck didnt die an admirable man but hed had his moments i remember them unsatisfied dylan stopped the recorder it was a nondenial at best he had substantiated through others whod refused to go on record that chuck rockwell had developed a dangerous dependence on drugs but hed been clean during the last race the autopsy had determined that in any case that was only one area there were others the next tape was marked brewer lori brewer was the sister of the man who had been rockwells backer during his last year the divorced former model was by her own admission a woman who liked men who took risks rockwells wife hadnt been in the stands during his final race but his mistress had dylan put in the tape and pushed the play button the most exciting dynamic man ive ever known loris voice had the lowkey sensuality of the south chuck rockwell was a star fast and hot he knew his own worth i admire that in a man ms brewer for nearly a year youd been rockwells constant companion lover she corrected im not ashamed of it chuck was as devastating a lover as he was a driver he did nothing by half measures she gave a low warmsugar laugh neither do i did it bother you that he was married no i was there she wasnt look what kind of a marriage is it when people only see each other three or four times a year legal he remembered shed taken that goodnaturedly enough her only response a shrug chuck was planning to divorce her anyway the problem was that she had a stranglehold on his bank account the lawyers were negotiating a settlement dylan turned off the tape with a muttered oath not once during any of his conversations with abby had she mentioned divorce there was always the possibility that rockwell had lied to lori brewer but then dylan didnt believe the very sharp ms brewer would have been duped for long if divorce proceedings had been underway abby was doing her best to cover it dylan hadnt pushed the point yet nor had he brought up lori brewer he was aware that once he did she would probably look at him as the enemy whatever he got out of her after that point would have to be pried out so hed wait what he wanted from abby had to be won through patience he pushed aside tapes of other drivers mechanics other women and chose the one marked abby it didnt occur to him that out of all the tapes he had hers was the only one not marked with just a last name hed stopped thinking of her as mrs rockwell the tape was from this morning when hed cornered her in the living room shed been folding laundry and it had occurred to him that he hadnt seen anyone do that quiet timeconsuming little chore in more years than he could count thered been an old fifties record on the stereo and the doowops and the shalalas had poured out as shed sorted socks he remembered how shed looked her hair had been pulled back in a ponytail so that her cheekbones stood out with subtle elegance the collar of a flannel shirt had poked out of the neck of an oversize sweatshirt leaving the curve and line of her body a mystery shed worn thick socks and no shoes the fire had been crackling behind her flames curling greedily around fresh logs shed looked so content and at peace with herself that for a moment he hadnt wanted to disturb her but hed had a job to do just as he had one to do now dylan pushed the play button again did racing put a strain on your marriage you should remember chuck was a driver when i married him her voice on the tape sounded calm and solid after lori brewers honeylaced one racing was part of my marriage then you enjoyed watching him race there had been a lengthy pause as shed given herself time to find the right words in some ways i think chuck was at his best behind the wheel on the track he was exciting almost eerily competent confident she added looking beyond dylan into her own past so confident in himself in his abilities that it never occurred to me he would lose the race much less lose control but after the first eight or nine months you stopped traveling with your husband i was pregnant with ben shed smiled a little as shed pulled a small worn sweater out of the basket it became difficult for me to jump from city to city race to race chuck was and there it was dylan noted that slight variance in tone he was very understanding it wasnt too long after that that we bought this place a home base chuck and i agreed that ben then chris needed this kind of stability its hard to picture a man with chuck rockwells image settling down in a place like this but then he didnt settle did he she had very carefully folded a bright red sweatshirt chuck needed a home port like anyone else but he also needed to race we combined the two evasions dylan thought as he stopped the tape halftruths and outright lies what game was she playing and why he knew her well enough now to be certain she wasnt stupid she would have known of her husbands infidelities and most particularly of his relationship with lori brewer protecting him it hardly seemed feasible that she would protect a man whod cheated on her and one whod cheated blatantly in public without a semblance of discretion was she had she been the kind of woman content to stay in the background and keep the home fires burning or was she had she been a woman with her eye on the main chance and what kind of man had rockwell been had he been the egotistical driver the generous lover or the understanding husband and father dylan found it hard to believe any man could be all three abby was the only one who could give him the answers he needed dragging a hand through his hair he pushed away from the desk he wanted to get something down on paper once he did he might begin to put it all in some sort of perspective dylan looked at his typewriter and the tapes coffee he decided it was going to be a long night there was a low light burning in the hall automatically he glanced across the corridor to where abby slept her door was partially open and the room was dark he had an urge to cross over and push the door open a little wider so he could see her in the light from the hall what did he care for her privacy he poked and scraped at her privacy whenever he questioned her shed cashed a check that gave him permission to no he didnt give a damn for her privacy but his own selfpreservation was a different matter if he looked hed want to touch if he touched he might not be able to pull back so he turned from her room and started down the stairs alone the fire in the living room was burning low and well hed watched abby bank it one night and had been forced to admit that she did a better job of it than he would have he left it alone and walked down the hall to the kitchen she was sitting at the bar in the dark the only light came from the kitchen fire and the halfmoon outside she had her elbows on either side of a cup her chin propped by both hands he thought she looked unbearably lonely abby she jumped it might have been funny if he hadnt seen just how white her face was before she focused on him sorry i didnt mean to scare you i didnt hear you come down is anything wrong i wanted coffee but instead of going to the stove he went to her i thought you were in bed couldnt sleep she smiled a little and didnt as hed expected fuss with her hair or the lapels of her robe the waters probably still hot i just made tea he slid onto the stool beside her problem guilt his reporters instincts hummed at war with an unexpected desire to put his arm around her and offer comfort about what i keep seeing the tears welling up in chriss eyes when i sent him to bed without letting him watch his favorite show he didnt know whether to laugh at himself or her odds are hell recover the plate wasnt that important she lifted her tea then set it down without drinking i never use them theyre ugly uhhuh maybe they should take a place setting or two out to the barn for the horses she opened her mouth then laughed this time when she picked up her tea she drank it soothed a throat that was dry and a little achy i wouldnt go quite that far janice gave them to chuck to chuck and me she corrected a little too quickly theyre wedgwood and should be treated with due respect he said he hadnt missed her slip so whats the problem i hate to lose my temper did you you never raised your voice you dont have to yell to lose your temper she looked out the window again and wished fleetingly that it wasnt so cold if it were spring she could go out sit on the porch and watch the sky it was only a plate after all and it was only a television show with a sigh she settled against the back of the stool you think im being foolish i suppose youre being a mother i dont have much experience there its just so hard when youre the only one to make the rules and the decisions and the mistakes she combed a hand through her hair in an unconscious gesture that had it settling beautifully around her face sometimes late at night like this i worry that im too hard on them that i expect too much from them theyre just little boys now ive sent them off to bed chris sniffling and ben sulking and dylan interrupted her maybe youre too hard on their mother she stopped stared at him then looked at her tea again im responsible and that was that he could hear it in her tone he started to drop it to leave her to her own unhappiness but whatever he thought of her whatever he didnt think of her he knew she was devoted to her children look i dont know a lot about kids but id say those two are pretty normal and well adjusted maybe you should congratulate yourself instead of dragging out the sackcloth im not doing that sure you are youll have the ashes out any minute she waited for the annoyance to come but it didnt instead she felt the guilt fade thanks at ease now abby warmed her hands on her cup i guess it helps to have a little moral support from time to time no problem i hate to see a woman sulking in her tea she laughed but he couldnt be sure if it was at herself or at him i never sulk but im a real champ at guilt there were times when ben was going through his terrible twos when id call my mother just to hear her tell me he probably wasnt going to be a homicidal maniac id have thought youd talk to your husband about it that wouldnt have done any she cut herself off it was late and she was tired and much too vulnerable ill make you that coffee she began and started to stand i dont want you to wait on me he had his hand on her arm and though the touch was still light it was enough to keep her from moving away she felt incredibly impossibly an urge to just turn into his arms she wanted to be held in them to have him fold her to him and ask no questions but of course he would he would always ask and she couldnt always answer abby held her ground and kept her distance and i dont want you to interview me now youve never mentioned chuck in the area of fatherhood abby why is that maybe because youve never asked me so im asking now i told you im not in the mood for an interview its late im tired and you lie his grip tightened just enough to make her heartbeat unsteady i dont know what youre talking about he was sick of evasions sick of looking at her face and knowing the truth wouldnt be there every time i touch on certain areas you give me these tidy answers very pretty and well rehearsed i have to ask myself why why do you want to whitewash chuck rockwell he was hurting her not her armshe could barely feel his fingers on herhe was hurting her deep in places shed deluded herself into believing were safe he was my husband isnt that answer enough for you no he could hear the emotion trembling in her voice so hed push and hed push now the theory ive come up with is the better he looked the better you looked and if your marriage seemed to be going well janice rockwell was happy chuck was her only son and somebody was bound to inherit all that money for the second time he watched her face pale but this time he recognized rage not fear it ripped through her he could feel it just by the touch of his hand on her arm he wanted it he wanted to tear holes in her composure and get to the truth and to her let go of me her voice vibrated in the quiet kitchen behind them a log broke and tossed sparks against the screen neither of them noticed i want an answer first you seem to have them already if you want me to believe otherwise tell me i dont give a damn what you think and that abby realized was the biggest lie of all she cared and because she cared his accusation had crushed her shed been crushed before and understood that whining about it brought nothing but humiliation ill give you what you want to hear and be done with it i chose to exploit my marriage to cash in on my dead husbands fame and reputation since im all but certain janice rockwell will read the book i want to be sure shes satisfied with the results obviously i want her to see that my marriage to chuck was solid whatever dirt you manage to dig up wont come from me satisfied he let her arm go in the space of seconds shed confirmed everything hed thought of her and contradicted everything hed begun to feel yeah im satisfied fine if you have more questions ask them tomorrow when the tapes running he watched her walk away and wondered how long it would take him to separate the lies from the truth abby invariably woke quickly and after her first half cup of coffee was completely alert and ready to take charge today she found herself reluctant to leave her bed her muscles ached her temples throbbed blaming it on a restless night she went into her morning routine in low gear the boys were cheerful enough as they gobbled down their breakfast the altercation of the evening before was already forgotten in the way children had of putting things behind them after shed seen them off to school she indulged in another cup of coffee waiting for her system to catch up with her schedule still dragging she bundled herself in her coat and went outside the sun was bright the air already warming with the first promise of spring but she shivered and wished shed put on an extra sweater catching a cold she decided as she rubbed at the ache in the back of her neck well she just didnt have time for it moving on automatic pilot she gathered the eggs then walked to the barn the stalls needed cleaning the horses needed to be fed and groomed for the first time in as long as she could remember she resented the hours she spent working all she ever did was clean up after others take care of problems and deal with the jobs that had to be done when was she going to have time for herself time to curl up with a book and while away an afternoon a book nearly laughing at herself she gathered halters now wasnt the time to think of booksespecially not one book in particular shed forgotten she could be hurt it had been so long since shed been involved with anyone who could pressing her fingers against her eyes abby cut herself off she couldnt call her relationship with dylan an involvement business and business only the kind that was meant to benefit both of themthat was all there was it didnt matter couldnt matter to her that he thought she was an opportunist abby supposed that was the kindest word for what he thought of her if she followed her wounded feelings and tossed him out shed have accomplished nothing in any case shed signed the papers and was committed to keeping him around and when did her obligations end abby let the first two horses loose in the paddock then made the return trip to the barn shed been obligated to chuck then to her children now because of them she was again dutybound however obliquely to chuck so let dylan crosby think what he wanted of her as long as he wrote the book tired she rested her head against the geldings flank his flesh felt cool and friendly god she needed a friend how could she think straight when her head was pounding yet she had to the flare of temper last night might have cost her if dylan thought the worst of her wouldnt it color his writing damn what did he care about her reasons for authorizing the book whatever they were he was being paid to write it her motivations had nothing to do with the story of chucks life yet they had everything to do with it she made a second trip outside and returned for the rest of the horses after shed finished in the barn maybe her head would be clear then shed know the right way to handle dylan she remembered the morning when the sun had been bright and hard on her face and hed held her wanted her she could still remember the way his eyes had looked the way his mouth had felt when it had brushed against hers for a moment for one indulgent moment shed wished he could be someone she could depend on someone she could confide in that was foolish shed known before theyd met that he had a job to do so did she by the time shed finished with the first stall her skin was filmed with sweat the pitchfork seemed heavier than usual as she lifted it to start on the next seems to me you ought to hire yourself a couple of hands dylan stood just inside the door the sun at his back his face in shadow abby stopped long enough to squint at him does it ill take it under advisement he picked up a pitchfork but just leaned on it abby why dont you drop this masqueradeyou know the struggling little homemaker who works from dawn to dusk to keep her family going she leaned into her work im trying to impress you dont bother the books about chuck rockwell not you fine ill drop the act as soon as i get rid of this manure so she had claws his fingers tightened on the worn wood handle until he deliberately relaxed them he wanted to get to her but he had to keep control to do it listen as long as things dont jibe the book goes nowhere since we both want it to move lets stop playing games okay because she needed to rest a moment she stopped and leaned on her pitchfork what do you want dylan the truth or as close as you can get to it you were married to rockwell for four years that means there are parts of his life you know better than anyone those are the parts i want from you those are the parts you were paid to give me i said id talk to you when the tape was running and i will she turned back to the stall right now ive got work to do just drop it dylan grabbed her by the lapels and spun her around her pitchfork went clattering to the concrete call back whoever usually takes care of this business and lets get to work im tired of wasting time my staff shed have pulled away but she didnt think she had the strength sorry i gave them the month off if you want to work bring your little pad and tapes out here my horses need tending just who the hell are you he demanded giving her a quick shake he was no less surprised than she when her knees buckled keeping his grip firm he braced her against the stall whats the matter with you nothing she tried to brush his hands away but failed im not used to being knocked around you get jostled more on the subway he muttered she made him feel like a roughhanded clod and he hated it he let her go youd know more about that than i infuriated with herself she bent down to scoop up the pitchfork when her head spun she grabbed the side of the stall for support swearing dylan took her by the shoulders look if youre sick im not im never sick im just a little tired and pale he realized as he let himself really look at her he yanked off his glove and held a hand to her face youre burning up im just overheated her voice rose a bit with her panic at being touched even though being touched was exactly what she needed leave me alone until im finished in here cant stand a martyr he mumbled taking her by the arm it was rare very rare for abbys irish heritage to break through in sheer blind rage shed always left that to the rest of her family and calmly worked her way through difficulties this wasnt one of those times she yanked her arm away and shoved him hard against the side of the stall the strength shed dredged up surprised them both i dont care what you can stand i dont give a damn what you think those papers i signed dont give you the right to interfere in my life ill let you know when i have time for your questions and for your accusations whether you believe its a game or a facade i have work to do you can go to hell she was panting as she turned and grasped the handles of the wheelbarrow she jerked it up took two steps then dropped it again as her strength drained away youre doing great he was fed up with her and with himself but hed have to deal with that later now unless he was very much mistaken the lady needed a bed this time when he took her by the arm she could do no more than try to shake him off dont put your hands on me babe ive been doing my damnedest to keep them off you all week when she stumbled he swore then scooped her up in his arms this time were both going to have to put up with it i dont have to be carried then she started to shiver too weak to help herself she let her head fall on his shoulder i havent finished yeah you have the eggs ill get them laterafter i dump you in bed bed she roused herself again noticing dimly they were stepping onto the porch i cant go to bed the horses havent been dealt with and the vets coming at one to look over the mares mr jorgensens coming with him i have to sell that foal im sure jorgensens going to be thrilled to buy the foal after youve given him the flu flu i dont have the flu just a little cold flu dylan laid her on the bed then began to pry off her boots id say youll be hobbling around again in a couple of days dont be absurd she managed with a great deal of effort to prop herself up on her elbows i just need a couple of aspirin can you get undressed by yourself or do you want help im not getting undressed she said evenly though if she could have had one wish at the moment it would have been to sleep help then sitting down he began to unbutton her coat i dont need or want your help she clung to what dignity she had left and struggled to sit up look i might have a touch of the flu but i also have two children wholl walk in the door at in the meantime i have to groom the horses eve in particular i have a lot riding on the deal with jorgensen dylan studied her face her skin was pale her eyes glazed with fever the quickest way to bring her around was to agree with her okay thats at one do yourself a favor and rest for an hour when she started to object he shook his head abby youll really impress jorgensen by fainting at his feet she was wobbly there was no use denying it to be honest she didnt think she could have lifted a curry comb at the moment she was a practical woman and the practical thing to do was to test until she built up a little strength if it galled a bit to agree with him shed just have to swallow the gall ill rest an hour fine get into bed ill bring you a couple aspirin thanks she peeled off her coat as he rose then as it had a habit of doing her conscience poked at her really i appreciate it no problem when he left abby took a grip on the bedpost and pulled herself out of bed her body punished her by throbbing all over moving slowly she went to her dresser and pulled out a cotton gown she tugged off her sweater then her jeans exhausted from the effort she stood rocking on her feet and shivering just an hour she told herself and ill be fine later she couldnt even remember dragging on the gown and crawling into bed dylan found her there when he came back sprawled on her stomach she was sleeping so deeply that she never stirred when he tucked the blankets around her nor did she stir when he bent closer and brushed the hair away from her face she never stirred for the hour he sat in the chair beside the bed watching her and wondering chapter five sweaty aching and disoriented abby woke how long had she been asleep pressing the heels of her hands against her eyes she tried to gather her reserves of strength her skin felt clammy and she thought for a moment that the lining of her throat had been coated with something hot and bitter she was forced to admit that whatever had hit her had hit her with both fists because she was alone she moaned a little as she sat up then studying the clock beside her she moaned again shed slept nearly four hours mr jorgensen desperate abby swung out of bed the pounding in her head began immediately along with a throbbing that seemed to reach every inch of her body she realized she was damp with sweat abby snatched up her jeans then leaned against the bedpost waiting for the weakness to pass they might still be here she told herself they could have come late and right now be standing in the barn looking over the mare eve hadnt been groomed but jorgensen had already seen her at her best and the vetthe vet was bound to vouch for the fact that the mare was strong and healthy all she had to do was get dressed and go outside and apologize dylan strolled in carrying a tray going somewhere its after two though weak it was definitely an accusation you got that right he set the tray down on the dresser and studied her the nightgown scooped low at her neck and drooped carelessly over one shoulderone very slender very smooth shoulder the rest of her was just as slender from the long dancers legs to the high subtly rounded breasts a man was entitled dylan told himself to feel a little tightening a little heat a little longing when he looked at a halfnaked woman and a rumpled bed he just couldnt let it get personal interesting he murmured this is the first time ive seen you in something that isnt three inches thick im sure i look ravishing actually you look like hell why dont you get back in bed before you keel over mr jorgensen an interesting little man dylan finished walking to her dylan took the jeans out of her hand and tossed them on a chair he talked about his horses with more passion than he did his wife he eased her down on the bed as he spoke hes still here ive got to go out and talk to him hes gone with little fuss dylan arranged the pillows at her back gone yeah open up i managed to find this among the bottles of antiseptic spray and colored bandaids she waved the thermometer away as she tried to concentrate on her next move i can call him and reschedule did you explain why i wasnt available i cant believe i missed him the vet did the vet dylan stuck the thermometer in her mouth then captured both her hands before she could pull it out again shut up when she started to mumble around it he caught her chin in his other hand listen if you want to hear about jorgensen youll leave that thing in and keep your mouth shut got it she slumped back nearly ready to sulk he was speaking to her as she might to one of the boys seeing no alternative abby nodded good releasing her hands he went back for the tray abby immediately pulled the thermometer out did the vet give eve an exam i need to put that thing back in or ill leave you up here alone and wondering after setting the tray on her lap he stood waiting he felt a nice sense of satisfaction when she obeyed the vet said eve was in perfect shape that he didnt foresee any complications and you can expect her to deliver the foal within a week she reached for the thermometer he only had to lift a brow to stop her about the other mare gladys when she nodded he shook his head hell of a name for a horse anyway shes just as fit jorgensen said to tell you if all goes well hell call you to discuss terms after the foals born he also said dylan continued grabbing her wrist again as she reached up that he has a couple of names for you people who might be interested in the other foal i have a feeling he might be interested himself if his wife doesnt skin him you can call him when youre on your feet satisfied she closed her eyes and nodded it was happening at last it was really happening the money from the foals would go a long way toward paying off the rest of the loan shed been forced to take after chucks death to be nearly out of debt to know that in a year or two shed be essentially stable again foolishly she wanted to cry she wanted to burrow under the covers and weep until tears of relief washed everything else away keeping her eyes closed she waited until she could compose herself an odd woman dylan thought as he watched her why should she get so emotional over the sale of a couple of horses he was certain the price was right but it could hardly be more than a drop in the bucket compared to the estate she must have inherited from rockwell money must be important he decided though hed be damned if he could see where she spent it the furniture perhaps her bed was eighteenthcentury and not something youd pick up at a yard sale and the horses of course she hadnt bought that stallion for a song and a smite he glanced over at her closet hed wager that a good chunk of the rest was hanging in there when she opened her eyes again he plucked the thermometer out dylan i dont know what to say umhmm a hundred and three looks like you win the prize a hundred and three her gratitude disappeared thats ridiculous let me see it he held it out of reach are you always such a lousy patient im never sick you must have read that wrong he handed it over then watched as her brows drew together well that should make you feel a whole lot worse he took the thermometer again shook it then slipped it into its plastic case now can you feed yourself or do you want help i can manage she stared without appetite at the soup steaming on the tray i dont usually eat lunch today you do were pushing fluids try the juice first she took the glass he handed her then sighed no wonder he was treating her like one of the boys she thought she was acting like one thanks im sorry for complaining i dont mean to be cranky but there are so many things i have to do lying here isnt getting them done indispensable are you she looked at him again something moved in her eyesemotion hope questions he couldnt tell which i am needed she said it with such quiet desperation that he reached out to stroke her cheek before he thought about it then youd better take care of yourself yeah she lifted the spoon and tried to work up some enthusiasm for the soup i am a lousy patient sorry its all right so am i to please him she began to eat you dont look like youre ever sick if it makes you feel better i had the flu a couple of years ago she smiled a selfdeprecating humor in her eyes it does anyway im more used to doing the doctoring both boys were down with the chicken pox in september the house was like a ward dylan shed been working up to this for some time now idly stirring her soup she thought she had the courage im sorry about last night and this morning sorry for what she looked up he seemed so relaxed so untouched apparently harsh words and arguments didnt leave him churning with guilt but he hadnt lied and they both knew it she figured they both knew shed go on lying i said things i didnt mean i always do when im angry maybe youre more honest when youre angry than you think he was tense however it looked on the outside he was baffled by her moved by her listen abby i still intend to push you and push you hard but ive got some scruples i dont intend to start wrestling with you until you can hold your own she had to smile as long as im sick im safe something like that youre not eating im sorry she set down the spoon i just cant he picked up the tray to set it beside the bed anyone ever tell you that you apologize too much yes she smiled again sorry youre an interesting woman abby oh it felt so good just to snuggle back chilled she drew the blankets higher incredibly she was tired again so tired it would have taken no effort at all to simply ease back and drift off i always thought i was rather humdrum humdrum he glanced down at her elegant hands and remembered how competently they had worked he remembered the woman in mink diamonds glittering at her ears and thought of how she had folded laundry it didnt add up to humdrum it simply didnt add up at all ive got a picture of you in my file that was taken in monte carlo you were wrapped to the eyebrows in white mink the white mink she smiled drowsily as the energy drained from her degree by degree made me feel like a princess it was fabulous wasnt it was mmm just like a princess where is it the roof she said and slept the roof she had to be delirious if she was picturing fur coats on the roof she murmured a bit when he settled her more comfortably a very interesting woman abby he thought again as he stood back to look at her all he had to do was fill in all the blank spaces when dylan heard the first crash he was in the middle of transcribing his notes on rockwells first year of professional racing he swore though without heat as he turned off the typewriter leaving the halftyped sheet in the machine he went downstairs to greet the boys at the front door it wasnt my fault ben glared at his brother his arm around the dog it was too you chris reached into his vocabulary and brought out his top insult idiot youre the idiot just because problem dylan asked as he opened the door both boys had fire in their eyes and chris was covered with mud from head to foot as well his bottom lip trembled as he pointed a dirty selfrighteous finger at his brother he pushed me down i did not im telling mom hold it hold it dylan blocked the door and got a smear of fresh mud on his jeans ben dont you think youre a little too big to be pushing chris down i didnt his chin poked out hes always saying i did things when i didnt im telling mom big tears welled up in chriss eyes as he stood a major mess on the porch dylan had a strong and unexpected urge to hunker down and hug him look itll clean off he said contenting himself with flicking at the boys nose with a finger why dont you tell me what happened he pushed me down the first tears spilled over he was still too young to be ashamed of them just cause hes bigger i did not not far from tears himself ben stared at the ground i didnt mean to anyway we were just fooling around an accident yeah he sniffled embarrassing himself it never hurts to apologize for an accident he put a hand on bens shoulder especially when youre bigger im sorry he mumbled shooting a look at his brother moms going to be mad cause hes got mud all over im going to get in trouble and its friday uhhuh dylan considered chris was over his tears now and running his fingers curiously through the mud on his coat well maybe we wont have to tell her this time yeah hope sprang into bens eyes then was quickly displaced by mistrust shes gonna see anyhow no shes not come on seeing no other way dylan hoisted chris up well dump you in the washing machine he giggled and swung a friendly filthy arm around dylans neck you cant put people in there its too small wheres mom upstairs shes got the flu like mr petrie thats right ben stopped as they entered the kitchen moms never sick she is this time right now shes steeping so lets try to keep it down okay i want to see her myself dylan stopped in the act of pushing the door to the laundry room open he glanced back and saw ben just inside the kitchen his mouth set his eyes defiant though it disconcerted him dylan found himself admiring bens determination to defend his mother dont wake her up he swung through to the laundry room okay tiger strip ready to oblige chris struggled out of his coat my teacher had the flu last week so we had a substitute she had red hair and couldnt remember our names is mom going to be sick tomorrow she wont be as sick tomorrow dylan found the soap and began figuring out the mechanics of the washing machine she can use my crayons chris plopped down on the floor and began yanking at his boots and we can read her stories she reads me storks when im sick im sure shell appreciate it if she feels real bad i can let her have mary whos mary marys my dog the one aunt maddy gave me when i was little i still steep with her but dont tell ben he teases me dylan smiled and sent water gushing into the machine it was nice to be trusted i wont say anything if shes better tomorrow do you think we can go to the movies she said shed take us to the movies on saturday i dont know turning back dylan saw that the boy had taken him at his word hed stripped down to the skin his sturdy little body was covered with goose bumps and dirt i dont think we have to go that far after taking a folded towel off the dryer dylan bent down and wrapped the boy in it youre going to need a bath i hate baths chris tilted his head and gave dylan a solemn look i really hate them trouble is you were right dylan dumped the rest of the clothes in the machine and closed the lid you wont fit in the washing machine laughing chris raised his arms in an open uncomplicated gesture that left dylan speechless helpless to do anything but respond dylan lifted him up good god he thought as he nuzzled him ive managed to keep things in perspective for over thirty years and now im falling for a sixyearold kid with mud on his face about that bath hate them come on youre bound to have a boat or something to fool around with in there resigned chris let himself be carried toward the inevitable i like trucks better so take a truck can i take three as long as theres room for you he set chris down again by the bathroom door now youve got to be quiet right right chris returned in a whisper are you going to help me wash my hair i can almost do it myself ah he thought about the work waiting on his desk sure get yourself started babysitting dylan thought as he hesitated in the hall hadnt been part of the deal still he knew abby wasnt enjoying it any more than he was he glanced at bens room the door was closed his first thought was to leave the boy to himself and deal with the less complicated task of washing chriss hair swearing at himself dylan walked over and knocked you can come in dylan opened the door to see the boy sitting on his bed an army of miniature men spread out in front of him did you see your mother yeah i didnt wake her up he sent two of the men crashing together i guess shes pretty sick she just needs to rest for a couple of days dylan sat on the edge of the bed and picked up one of the men shell probably want some company later once i came home from school and she was on the couch because she said she had this headache but i knew shed been crying at a loss dylan lined up men in tandem with bens moms need to cry sometimes everybody does really not guys yeah sometimes ben digested that but he wasnt ready to believe it was mom crying again this time shes just sick i guess shell feel better if we dont give her any trouble i dont mean to cause trouble bens voice was very young and very small im sure you dont dylan thought of himself of how hed pushed and tugged and pressured his job but it didnt go very far toward the guilt i didnt really mean to push chris down in the mud he mumbled i didnt think you did but dylan had meant to push abby up against a wall mom wouldve punished me i see dylan found himself admiring bens candor but now hed have to do something and what the hell did be know about handling kids he dragged a hand through his hair and tried to be logical i guess well have to think of something want me to go push you down in the mud ben glanced up warily after meeting dylans eyes he laughed then mom would be mad at you right why dont you do chriss chores tonight okay that was no big deal he liked spending time with the horses and chris usually got in the way it both pleased and surprised dylan that he could read the boys mind that includes the dishesits chriss turn but its a tough old world kid dylan tugged his earlobe and went to see to his other charge abby awoke to the sounds of an argument an argument in whispers was still an argument opening her eyes she focused on her sons who were standing at the foot of the bed we should wake her up now ben insisted we should wait until dylan conies up now what if she still has a temperature well take it and find out do you know how chris demanded ready to be impressed you use that little skinny thing we just put it in her mouth then wait while shes asleep no dummy we have to wake her up im awake abby pushed herself up against the pillows while both boys eyed her hi not at all sure how to deal with a sick mother ben fooled with the bedspread hi yourself are you still sick her throat was so dry that she was surprised she could talk at all every muscle in her body rebelled as she pushed herself up a bit higher maybe a little do you want my crayons not one to stand on ceremony chris crawled onto the bed to get a closer look maybe later she told him running a hand through his hair did you just get home from school heck no weve been home forever right ben we had dinner ben confirmed and did the chores dinner after shed cleared her mind of sleep she saw that the light was dim with evening a glance at the clock had her moaning shed lost another three hours what did you have tacos dylan makes them real good do you have a temperature interested chris put his hand on her head you feel hot do you have to take medicine like ben and me did i can read you a story after you cant read ben said in disgust i can too miss schaeffer said i read real good kid stuff not moms kind of stories fighting again dylan walked in with another tray its nice to see everythings normal scoot over chris your mom has to eat we all made it chris told her as she shifted aside dylan made the eggs and ben heated the soup i made the toast looks great she wished she could toss it tray and all out the window when dylan arranged the pillows behind her she glanced up and saw the grin apparently writers read minds since he did hed also be aware that she had no choice but to eat dylan said you need your strength ben put in did he and dylan said we had to be quiet so you could rest we were real quiet chris waited for his mother to sample the toast hed smeared overgenerously with butter you were very quiet abby told him washing down the soggy toast with juice dylan said hed play a game with us later if we didnt mess up chris sent him a sunny smile we didnt did we you did just fine unwilling to let chris get all the attention ben moved closer dylan said youd probably be too sick to go to the movies tomorrow it seems dylan says a lot she murmured then reached out to touch bens cheek well have to see how was school it was pretty good a bird got into the classroom during math and mrs lieter chased it around it kept crashing into the windows pretty exciting yeah but then she opened one of the windows and got a broom tricia fell on the playground and got a big bump on her head chris leaned over to fuss with the thin gold chain his mother wore which had fascinated him since childhood she cried for a long time i fell down and didnt cry at all well not very much he corrected meticulously dylan was going to put me in the washing machine abby stopped running a hand over chriss hair i beg your pardon well there was all this mud and stuff and dylan interrupted before chriss storytelling got his brother in deep water a little accident its still pretty slippery outside as abby looked on ben tilted his head and sent dylan a quick sidelong look a mixture of guilt and gratitude i see at least she thought she did she was also wise enough not to pursue it this is a great dinner you guys but i dont think i can eat any more right now dylan took the remaining juice off the tray and set it on the nightstand why dont you two take the tray down ill be along in a minute as soon as theyd gone dylan picked up the thermometer dylan i really appreciate all this i dont know what to say good he stuck the thermometer in her mouth then you can be quiet unwilling to start another battle shed lose abby sat back and waited until he drew the thermometer out again its down right up twotenths he corrected entirely too cheerfully for her taste and handed her the aspirin the boys were counting on that movie tomorrow theyll survive after replacing the thermometer he started to leave her abby grabbed his hand impulsively dylan im not trying to be a bad patient but i swear ill go crazy if i spend another minute alone in this bed he cocked his head is that an invitation what oh no she snatched her hand back i didnt mean that i only meant i get the picture bending over he wrapped the spread around her and lifted her into his arms what are you doing getting you out of bed ill take you down plop you in front of the tv odds are youll be dead to the world inside of an hour ive already slept all day this time she could allow herself to enjoy to appreciate the sensation of being held in strong arms of being carried as though she were fragile for tonight just for tonight she could pretend there was someone to stand by her to stand with her fairy tales abby warned herself and stopped before she could lay her head on his shoulder i appreciate you watching the children like this i dont want to impose though i can call a neighbor forget it he said it lightly not wanting to admit hed enjoyed the afternoon i can handle them i worked my way through college as a bouncer that kind of experience certainly helps she murmured dylan did chris get hurt when ben pushed him down i dont know what youre talking about you certainly do did chris look hurt to you no but then you wouldnt want me to be a stool pigeon would you she sent him a mild look as he settled her down on the living room couch men always stick together dont they without answering he switched on the set hed needed to set her down quickly to break contact shed seemed so sweet so small so frail in his arms a man made his biggest mistakes when he was sucked in by fragility if you need anything well be in the kitchen men stuff you know dylan look if you thank me again im going to belt you instead he bent down took her face in his hands and kissed her hard dont thank me and dont apologize i wouldnt dream of it before she could think before she could reason abby reached out and brought his mouth back to hers again it wasnt sweet it wasnt magic it was solid and strong she tasted for the first time in too many years the flavor of man she wanted for the first time in too many years and wasnt it wonderful just to want againnot to think not to reason just to let go and want the touch the taste brought back no memories of her marriage of the only other man shed known it was fresh and new as beginnings should be her skin was hot he felt the yielding he knew came as much from weakness as from passion yet he thought or rather wanted to think that there was something more something unique in the way her mouth fit his so he wanted more from the kiss alone desire sprinted out until he wanted everythingto feel her skin feverishly hot under the thin nightgown to feel her body melt against his there was no artifice in her kiss no expertise the gesture seemed to be as pure and as generous as chris lifting his arms to him he drew away reluctant and more than a little puzzled he was finding that the more he knew her the less he knew she lay back her eyes halfclosed knowing he was studying her and helpless to slip on any mask whatever he wanted to see was there she had no way of knowing that his own doubts were blinding him thats something else were going to deal with when youre on your feet abby yes i know youd better rest he put his hands in his pockets because it would be too easy to touch her again and forget i will she closed her eyes because it would be too easy to reach out again and forget there were children in the next room her children her responsibility her life when she opened her eyes again he was gone chapter six she didnt remember going back upstairs but in the morning she woke in her own bed and she woke late there was something warm and fuzzy against her cheek her initial alarm turned to puzzlement then to love as she cuddled the ragged stuffed dog chris prized he must have brought it to her as shed slept shifting she saw the big pink sheet of contact paper taped sloppily to the bedpost that read get well mom she recognized bens slanted uneven printing and tears blurred her vision maybe they were monsters but they were her monsters and they came through when it counted did she she rubbed mary absently against her cheek it was nearly ten in the morning and she hadnt even fixed her children breakfast disgusted abby pulled herself out of bed pretending her legs didnt wobble she yanked her robe out of the closet and headed for the shower there were things to be done and she couldnt accomplish them in bed after shed cleared the tub of a convoy of trucks she just stood under the spray it beat against aching muscles and feverish skin she braced her hands against the tile and lifted her face so that the water sluiced over her gradually the chill passed and her mind cleared dylan was it wrong that when her mind cleared he was the first thing to form in it perhaps it wasnt wrong but it certainly wasnt safe shed started more there than shed bargained for alone she could admit that she hadnt the vaguest idea what to do next the attraction she felt for him hadnt been in the plans the wisest move would be to ignore it but could she would he once before shed felt this kind of quick excitement and once before shed acted without giving herself a chance to reason it wasnt a mistake she could afford to make twice she couldnt say how long it had taken her to get over the hurt chuck had caused but she knew she couldnt deal with that sort of pain again no she didnt think she would survive to rebuild a second time so the choice was clear no involvement was worth the risk of losing no man was worth the price now she had children to think of a home and the life shed made for them overlaying the doubts she had about herself were doubts about the project that had brought dylan to her it was going to be more difficult to evade to lie to hide if she let herself feel something for him so she couldnt abby wearily turned off the shower she couldnt risk feeling or giving or even taking when it came to dylan shed stick by her plan because the plan was survival he was only the biographer of her childrens father dry she walked back into the hall a quick peek showed her the boys were already up shed go down fix coffee make them breakfast and get them away from their cartoons long enough to feed the stock she found them where shed expected huddled in front of the tv with the latest actionadventure cartoon whizzing by on the screen what she hadnt expected was to find dylan huddled with them you call this a cartoon chris was snuggled beside him on the sofa and ben lay sprawled at his feet as though the three of them spent every saturday morning together its a great cartoon ben told him asteroid john tracks down the bad guys but he never gets them all especially dr disaster dylan thought he knew who ben was rooting for listen bugs bunnys a cartoon it has style and wit not just laser beams wile e coyote trying to catch the roadrunner bugs outmaneuvering elmer fudd thats a cartoon ben just snorted and gave asteroid john his attention chris tugged on dylans shirt i like bugs bunny amused by the boys earnest face dylan swung an arm over his shoulders chris looks like bugs bunny ben stated he grinned waiting for retaliation before chris could scramble down dylan shifted the boy onto his lap nope he said after a careful study of chriss face ears are too short but ben reaching down he tugged on an unguarded ear these might just make it giggling ben put both hands over his ears and rolled over im dr disaster and im going to blow up the planet kratox yeah you and who else he scooped the boy up and held him in a loose headlock you space marauders are all the same eva no ticklish he dug a finger into the boys ribs and sent him squealing it only took a moment for the three of them to roll off the sofa delighted chris climbed onto dylans shoulders it was then he saw his mother standing in the doorway hi mom good morning she watched her sons who were flushed from the tussle then looked at dylan he hadnt shaved and might have been any man on a lazy saturday morning were not supposed to roughhouse on the furniture ben whispered in dylans ear right dylan untangled himself then gave abby a long measuring look you should be in bed im fine thanks why did he become only more arousing when he was a little rough around the edges would she always be attracted to men who had so little tenderness in than im just going to fix some coffee its on the stove oh she hesitated hating to drag the kids away ben chris as soon as that shows over i need you to come eat and help me feed the stock we already did it ben told her relieved that there would be no lecture on showing the proper respect for the furniture you fed the stock already this morning and we had breakfast pancakes chris told her dylan makes them real good oh she stuck her hands in her pockets feeling foolish and worse useless then ill heat up the coffee let me know how the planet makes out dylan said then rose and followed abby into the kitchen problem he asked her no just dozens of them she thought as she turned the flame on under the pot how was she supposed to keep promises to herself when she saw him playing with her children how was she supposed to keep her mind busy when all the chores were done before she could even begin no tenderness in him no kindnessshe needed to go on believing that if she wanted to stay whole she stiffened when he took her by the shoulders but he ignored it and turned her to face him with his eyes on hers he put a hand to her forehead you still have a fever i feel much better you feel like hell he said taking her by the arm he led her to a stool sit dylan im used to running my own life fine you should be able to get back to it by monday and what am i supposed to do until then the words came out in a heated rush as she gave in to her weakness and dropped down onto the stool im tired of lying in bed and eating soup im tired of having a thermometer stuck in my mouth and aspirin poured down my throat one of the first signs of getting well is crankiness he set a glass of juice in front of her drink youre good at giving orders youre lousy at taking them she scowled at him then picked up the juice and drained it there satisfied not certain whether he should be amused or annoyed dylan skirted the counter whats eating you ive just told you i her voice trailed off as he took her face in his hand you havent told me half of it but you will unable to resist he stroked his thumb along her cheekbone dont she lifted a hand to his wrist but couldnt make herself push him aside people are my specialty he murmured so far im having a hard time getting through to what makes you tick do you like challenges abby no she said it almost desperately no i dont i do he combed his other hand through her hair which was still damp from the shower i find them intriguing and in some cases very arousing hed thought about her during the night thought about her and what be wanted the more he thought the more he believed the two might be the same thing he touched his mouth to hers just enough to awaken her you arouse me abby what the hell are we going to do about that stop she fought to keep a tight hold on her emotions but her grip kept slipping the children if they havent seen their mother kissing a man before they should have the hand in her hair grew firmer this time his mouth didnt merely touch hers it absorbed it his lips were softer than they should have been warmer more patient none of it was expected was this how a man kissed a woman he desired a woman he cared for was this what shed been missing in her me what shed been craving without understanding if it was she wouldnt be able to fight it for long gentleness shattered her defenses in a way demands never could slowly reluctantly she opened to him if her head was spinning it was the fever she needed the excuse he couldnt explain the sense of innocence he felt from her but it excited him he couldnt explain his own sudden need but it churned through him he wanted her alone he wanted to see that look of panic and passion in her eyes when he touched her he wanted to fed that slow gradual melting of her body against hishalf reluctant half eager he wanted to hear that quickening of breath that meant shed forgotten everything but him whatever game she was playing whatever lies she told didnt matter when her mouth yielded to his hed have his answers hed have hers at the moment he didnt care which came first i want to take you to bed he murmured it against her mouth then against her skin as his lips skimmed over her face soon abby very soon dylan i are you taking moms temperature abby jerked back and stared speechless at chris he looked at her and at dylan with the open friendly curiosity that was an innate part of him mom kisses my forehead sometimes when i have a fever can i have a drink yes abby fumbled for words while chris found a glass dylan was just telling your mother she should get back in bed dylan finished for her and you and ben need your coats we have to run into town into town when she looked at him she saw only cool amusement she knew she should have expected that were out of a few things he said easily enough and he needed to get out away from her until he had himself back in order can i have some gum sugarless chris added remembering his mother probably leaving half a glass of juice on the counter chris went running for his brother you dont have to take them abby began i like the company amusement helped fade the tension oh youll have plenty of that have you ever taken two boys to the store i told you he wasnt smiling now i like challenges yes you did struggling to be calm abby rose theyll try to talk you into buying twice as much as you need im a rock dont say i didnt warn you then ben and chris came barreling in again ready for the next adventure abby compromised with herself she did indeed have work to do and barely enough energy to stand in order to accomplish some of the first and give in to the second she took her paperwork to bed with her the least she could do was pay the bills and bring her account and checkbooks uptodate because the house was quiet she turned on the radio beside the bed before she began though shed long ago accepted it as an unending cycle it continued to give abby a sense of satisfaction to pay bills and diminish the amount of her debts the house came first and always would it was security for her family and undeniably for herself fourteen years and two months to go she mused as she sealed the envelope fourteen years she thought again her boys would be men she wanted the home where theyd grown up to matter to be full of good memories love laughter and a balancing sense of responsibility that wasnt something she could give them merely by writing a check that was something else she wanted them to grow to understand what you had wasnt nearly as important as what you were there were those she knew who never found the serenity to understand that she wrote her monthly check to grover stanholz with a mixture of gratitude and resentmentgratitude to the man for the loan resentment that the loan itself had been necessary resentment didnt help she reminded herself fulfilling the obligation would her answer there was the foals if their price was right shed have come a long way toward being free of at least one of her obligations settling back abby wrote the note she always attached to the check dear grover i hope this finds you well and happy the children are great and looking forward as i am to the end of winter the weathers finally beginning to clear up though there are a few patches of snow and ice here and there i want to thank you again for the invitation to join you in florida i know the boys would have enjoyed a few days but it just wasnt possible to leave the farm or take them out of school two of our mares are nearly ready to foal spring promises to be exciting if you consider a trip north please come id like you to see what you helped me accomplish as always abby it never seemed enough abby folded the letter and sighed there was so little she could say she could have mentioned dylan they had discussed their joint contribution to the book and she knew that dylan had already interviewed him somehow she thought it would help both of them to avoid the subject until it was all finished stanholz had loved chuck like a father and had grieved like one it seemed she could do no more than send him pictures of the children a couple times a year and a tidy note attached to a check once a month shaking off the mood she continued to sort through bills some she could pay some she knew she had to put off just a little while longer when she was finished she had a grand total of in her checking account so shed dip into the emergency fund she told herself that was what emergency funds were for the boys were going to need new shoes within the month and twentyseven dollars wasnt going to do it it only proved shed made the right decision in agreeing to the book with that money to fall back on she could keep everything afloat when the foals were born she had to stop abby closed the books firmly and tidied the papers she wasnt going to fall into the trap of thinking about money every waking moment there would be enough that was all she needed to know laying back she frowned at the ceiling want to or not she didnt think she had the strength to tackle the kitchen floor or any of the other heavy household chores on her list for the day but she wasnt going to vegetate either when was the last time shed had a saturday free thinking of it made her laugh at herself and how many times had she wished for one so she could do nothing at all well shed gotten her wish and she hated it turning her head she spotted the thermometer she refused to touch it but beside it was the phone abby hesitated then reached for it shed just paid most of the bills hadnt she what better time for a little extravagance abby dialed the phone then waited impatiently until the third ring hi just hearing the syllable made her smile maddy abby the rest of the words tumbled out quickly as though maddy wanted to hurry them aside so she could say something else terrific i was just thinking about you must be another triplet flash whats going on ive got the flu and im feeling sorry for myself now you dont have to ill feel sorry for you are you getting plenty of rest and liquids i bet youve never taken one of those megavitamins i sent yes i did shed taken a total of five before theyd ended up in the back of a cupboard anyway im feeling a bit better today maddy stepped over a boot and sat on a pile of magazines how are the monsters wonderful they hate school very often hate each other never pick up anything and make me laugh at least six times a day youre lucky i know tell me about new york maddy i want to get away for a while we had some snow last week it was beautiful maddy rarely noticed how quickly it turned to gray sludge on my day off i walked through central park it was just like fairyland even the muggers were charmed there was no use telling maddy it might not be wise to walk through fairyland alone hows the play going looks like it could run forever did you know mom and pop made a swing through here last month they had a couple of gigs in the catskills and i talked them into a detour through manhattan pop had this terrific argument with the choreographer i bet he did how are they the older we get the younger they get i dont know how it works the pause was so slight that no one but her sister would have detected it abby did you go ahead with the book yes she concentrated on keeping her tone easy as a matter of fact the writers already here everything okay everythings fine i wished youd waited until one of us could have been there with you thats silly but i do miss youyou and chantel and mom and pop and trace i got a telegram from trace where is he morocco he wanted me to know hed shown my picture to some sheikh and got an offer of twelve camels for me pretty exciting did he take it i wouldnt be surprised abby im thinking about leaving the show leaving but you just said it could run forever yeah thats why its getting too easy ive been with it for a year now poking at the table beside her maddy found an earring shed been certain had been lost forever without giving it a thought she clipped it on i think it might be time to move on to something else if i do would you mind company for a few days oh maddy id love it well keep the light burning kid ive got to go saturday matinee give my love to the boys i will bye abby sat back and pictured her sister grabbing her bag searching for her keys then dashing out of her apartment already ten minutes late for makeup that was maddys style she had a critically acclaimed broadway musical under her belt and was thinking of leaving it to see what was around the corner that too was maddys style and hers was to do the laundry with a little sigh abby got out of bed an hour later she was satisfied she had some portion of her life under control dressed in baggy sweats she carried the first load of clean folded laundry toward the stairs the front door burst open and two boys and a dog bounded in sigmund she made a quick evasive maneuver before the dog could knock her and the fresh linen to the floor mom mom i got a new truck thrilled with himself chris brandished a shiny new pickup as he shouted over a mouthful of gum hey very fancy she set her basket down to examine it from hood to taillights as she knew was expected of her i got a plane ben was bouncing up and down to get her attention a jet lets see abby took it and duly gave it the onceover looks pretty fast wheres dylan walked through the door a bag of groceries under each arm more bags in the car fellas okay they tore out again the dog at their heels a rock huh abby smiled at him as he walked past her arent you supposed to be in bed i was now im not she followed him into the kitchen dylan it was very nice of you to buy things for the boys but you shouldnt let them pressure you easy for you to say he muttered he wasnt quite ready to admit the pleasure it had given him to buy a couple of plastic toys i did pretty well all in all i think ben wanted an atomic bomb it was on his christmas list she poked in the first bag and pulled out a box of little vanilla cakes with cream filling twinkies i happen to like twinkies mmm and chocolate icecream bars and chocolate icecream bars he agreed snatching them out of her hand got any teeth left keep it up and ill show you and guess what else chris staggered into the room under the weight of a grocery bag abby saved the bag set it on the counter then scooped him up what else we have a surprise he hooked his feet behind her waist and laughed youre not supposed to tell ben walked in trying not to show the strain as he carried the last bag i see well it seems to me that anyone who worked so hard must be ready for lunch we ate already ben set his bag down and eyed the box of twinkies hamburgers and french fries chris added sounds like quite a day it was neat i want to put the stickers on my plane now come on chris at the imperial order chris was scrambling down and racing after his brother dont walk much do they dylan commented as he stashed the groceries away i guess you found that out in the store she started to empty bags but she was more interested in dylan im a little surprised she began you dont look ready for a bottle of aspirin and a nap should i be i dont know actually you look as if you enjoyed yourself i did he closed a cupboard door and turned surprised yes chuck had never enjoyed them hed been frustrated baffled and annoyed by them and hed never enjoyed them most menbachelorsdont consider an afternoon shopping with kids a barrel of laughs you generalize she moved her shoulders dismissively i suppose ive never asked if you have children of your own no my exwife was a model she wasnt ready to take time out for children im sorry he turned giving her a mild halfamused look for what the question left her stumbling divorceits usually a difficult experience in this case marriage was the difficult experience it only lasted a year and a half such a short time she thought yet he did seem like a man who would admit a mistake quickly and deal with it but still divorce is never pleasant and marriage rarely is she opened her mouth to disagree but discovered she had very little ammunition but divorce is like admitting youre a failure isnt it she wasnt talking about him he took a gallon of milk and put it in the refrigerator wondering if she knew how transparent she was the marriage was a failure i wasnt she shrugged off the feeling in the way hed seen his own mother do she neatly folded the empty bags i suppose its easier when children arent involved i wouldnt know about that id say when a marriage is bad its bad it doesnt do anyone any good to pretend otherwise she glanced up to see him staring at her too close to the bone abby thought keeping her hands busy well we seem to have things under control here not yet but nearly he crossed over and put his hand to her brow fevers down i told you i was feeling better good because i want you to have all your strength back before we start again i like to play fair whenever possible and when its not then its not do you believe in rules abby of course theres no of course people make rules then they use them or they ignore them smart people dont box themselves in with them ive got to get something else out of the car dissatisfied with him and with the situation abby went back and picked up the laundry she heard the boys shuffling around in bens room and went into her own how much did dylan suspect about her marriage she hadnt intended to make it sound as though it had been made in heaven or had she shed wanted to give the illusion of normalcy of contentment the agreement with herself had been made there would be no mention of the tears and broken promises of the lies and disillusionment she would never have been able to hide the infidelities already gleefully recorded in the scandal sheets but shed thought she could play them down and never never had it occurred to her that he might discover that divorce papers had been filed weeks before chucks last race he probably didnt know she told herself as she walked to the window and looked out over her land he would have no reason to question her lawyer and if he did wasnt that privileged information four years earlier shed agonized over how to tell her children she was divorcing their father instead shed had to tell them their father was dead chris hadnt understood hed barely known who his father was and hadnt comprehended death at all but ben had theyd wept together and that first night theyd lain together in the bed where shed spent so many other nights alone now she was trying to give them what she felt they needed to understand their father and themselves and she had to protect them the problem was she was no longer so sure she could do both mom ben pushed open her door without knocking youve got to come down the surprise is ready she looked at him as he stood in the doorway eager flushed with excitement and miserably untidy ben she walked over and caught him up in a fierce hug i love you pleased embarrassed he laughed a little and since there was no one to see he hugged her back as hard as he could i love you mom then because she knew him she nuzzled into his neck until he squealed whats the surprise she demanded im not telling i can make you talk i can make you beg to tell me everything you know mom chris yelled impatiently from the bottom of the stairs come down we cant start till youre here dylan says dylan says she thought with a sigh taking advantage of her momentary distraction ben squirmed away and danced to the stairs hurry he ordered then bolted downstairs amused abby started after him okay where is everybody she found them in the living room huddled over a vcr whats this dylan rented it chris nearly delirious with pleasure climbed onto the couch and bounced you play tapes of movies on it i know she glanced at dylan as he handily attached the necessary plugs he said since we couldnt go to the movies we could have them at home we got warriors in space she caught chris on an upswing warriors in space i was outvoted dylan told her they had some very interesting movies in the back room i bet they did i did pick up this as well he tossed her a second tape lawless she murmured chanters big break she was really wonderful in this movie ive always been partial to it i still remember sitting in the theater and watching her come on the screen it was an incredible feeling just holding the tape brought her sister closer and reminded her that she was never really alone its funny i just talked to maddy a couple of hours ago and now can we watch chantel too ben was nearly beside himself with the idea of such extravagance i like to see when she shoots the guy in the hat she hesitated struggling with a feeling of obligation she didnt know what to do with both boys looked at her with eager impatience dylan simply lifted a brow and waited she gave in as much for herself she realized as for anyone else seems to me we should have popcorn he grinned understanding very well the process that had gone on inside her head you up to making it oh i think i can manage twenty minutes later they were spread out on the sofa watching the first in a series of flashy laser battles ben as usual was rooting ferociously for the bad guys chriss little fingers tensed on abbys arm and she leaned down and whispered something that made him laugh it was so normal that was what kept running through her head as the movie rolled noisily on watching movies and eating homemade popcorn on a chilly saturday afternoonit seemed so easy almost nonsensically easy but shed really never wanted much else relaxed abby draped her arm on the back of the sofa her hand brushed dylans she started to draw away then glanced over at him he watched her over the heads of her sons the questions that always seemed to be in his eyes were still there but she was growing accustomed to them and to him he had done this for her for her children maybe just maybe hed done it for himself as well maybe that was all that really mattered with a smile she linked her fingers with his he wasnt used to such simplicity from a woman shed just smiled and taken his hand there had been no flirtation in the gesture no subtle promises if hed been willing to take the gesture at face value hed have said it was a simple thankyou he thought this must be what it was like to have a family notsoquiet weekends with sticky faces and mundane chores and a living room littered with toys warm smiles from a woman who seemed happy to have you there dozens of questions that leaped out of young minds and demanded answers and contentment the kind that didnt require hot lights and fast music hed always wanted a family once hed told himself he wanted shannon moreshannon with the slim amazing body and the dark sultry looks shed touched off things inside himexploded was more accurate dylan admitted he found it much easier to remember now than it once had been theyd met made love and married all in a whirling sexual haze it had seemed right theyd both lived on the edge and enjoyed it somehow it had been incredibly wrong shed wanted more more money more excitement more glamour hed wanted he was damned if he knew what hed wanted but if he could believe the woman sitting two children away from him was real it might be her chapter seven a backlog of work had helped abby avoid dylan throughout the morning his typewriter had been clicking when shed woken the boys for school it had clattered steadily almost routinely rather than in the quick onagain offagain spurts of creation shed expected perhaps it was routine for him digging into and recording the lives of other people the sound had reminded her forcibly that the weekend had only been a reprieve it was monday she was recovered and the questions were about to begin again she wished she could recapture the confidence of a week ago and believe she could answer only the ones she chose to and answer them in her own way still her own routine soothed herthe breakfast clatter the scent of coffee the typically frantic search for a lost glove before she sent her sons racing off to catch the bus she watched them go down the lane as she did every morning it struck her unexpectedly and sharply as it did now and then that they were hers hers those two apprentice men in wool caps heading off to face the day at a fast trot had come from her it was fascinating wonderful and just a little frightening when they disappeared she continued to watch a little longer whatever happened whatever strange twist me tossed at her no one could take away the wonder of her children the day no longer seemed so hard to face as she headed toward the barn a few minutes later she heard the sound of a car changing direction she walked around the side and saw mr petrie hopping out of the cab of his truck she could have kissed his grizzled face maam he grinned at her then spit out a plug of tobacco mr petrie im so glad to see you she shifted the bucket of eggs as she studied him are you sure youre well enough to work right as rain he did look fit his small stubby body appeared well fed beneath several days growth of beard his color was good ruddy windburned and reliable he was hardly taller than she and built somewhat like a thumbsturdy and unexpectedly agile the boots he wore were black and worn and tied up over his ankles if your wife let you out of the house i guess youre ready to pitch some hay old nag he said affectionately she kept a mustard plaster on me for a week his small slightly myopic eyes narrowed you look a might peaked no im fine i was just about to get started in the barn how are the ladies wonderful they began to walk together over the slowly drying ground the vet was here on friday and gave them both a checkup it looks like eve and gladys are going to be mothers before the weeks out petrie spit again as they crossed to the barn jorgensen came by yes hes very interested dont let that old horse thief buffalo you top dollar petrie swung the door open with a hand that was missing the first knuckle of the ring finger no ones going to buffalo me she assured him hed known her five years and worked for her for nearly two and he believed her she might look like something out of one of the magazines his wife kept on the coffee table but she was tough a woman alone had to be tell you what now you take the horses out and groom them ill clean out the stalls but no now youve been swinging a pitchfork on your own all last week looks like you need some sun to me sides i gotta work off some of this food my wife pushed on me when i was too weak to stop her there now sweetheart he stroked eves head when she leaned it over the stall his ugly callused hands were as gentle as a lute players old petries back he pulled out a carrot and let her take it from his hand abby appreciated his easy touch with the horses just as she had always relied on his judgment shes missed you sure she has he moved down to the next stall and gave the second mare equal attention i tell you something miz rockwell if i had the means id have myself a mare like this she knew the position he was in knew the limitations of living off social security and little else the regret that she couldnt pay him more came quickly as it always did i wouldnt have either of them if you hadnt helped me oh youdve got by all rightbut maybe youdve paid too much with a cackle he went down to the next horse you were a novice back then miz rockwell but i think youve lost your green from him it was an incredible compliment with more pleasure than shed been able to drum up in days abby began to lead the horses out she groomed them in the sunshine dylan watched her from his window she was singing he couldnt hear her but he could tell by the way she moved he watched as she meticulously cleaned out hooves brushed manes and curried there was a lightness about her that he hadnt seen before but then she thought she was alone her gloves were on a post and she ran her bare hands over the flank of one of the geldings leaserving hands he thought yet somehow they looked just as right brushing hard over the geldings coat how would they look brushing over his skin how would it feel to have those hands running with abandon over his body arousing exciting exploring would she have that dreamy look in her eyes he thought she had it now but he was too far away to be certain and if he was smart hed stay away her face wouldnt be pale now the earlymorning air would bring the color up as the strong sunlight and exercise warmed her muscles her face wouldnt be pale when he made love with her excitement would flush it passion would make her agile he could imagine what it would be like to have her skin slide over his he could almost taste the flavor of her flesh in those dark secret places made only more mysterious by the layers of thick winter clothing he wanted to peel them off her while she stood watching him wanting him waiting for him just thinking of it made his pulse thud hed wanted other women sometimes his wants had been eased sometimes they hadnt passion came and passion went it erupted and it vanished he understood that well just because he churned for her now just because he stood at the window and watched her with needs bouncing crazily inside him that didnt mean hed want her tomorrow desire couldnt rule your lifenot desire for money not for power and certainly not for a woman but he continued to watch her while his typewriter hummed impatiently behind him he watched as she led the horses two and three at a time into the barn he waited until she came out again not even calculating the time that passed then abruptly and obviously on impulse she swung herself onto the big gelding shed called judd with a halter and nothing else she sent the horse racing out of the paddock and up the rough narrow track that led in to the hills he wanted to throw the window open and yell at her not to be an idiot he wanted to watch her ride he could see her knees pressed tight to the geldings side and her hand holding the halter rope but more as the sun fell like glory over her face he saw the look of absolute delight she let the gelding run up and down the trackten minutes fifteen dylan was too mesmerized to notice her hair rose and fell in the wind they created but she never bothered to push it from her face and when she swung to the ground he knew she was laughing she nuzzled the horse stroking again stroking soothing murmuring dylan wondered what soft pretty words she spoke a man was losing his grip when he became jealous of a horse he knew it but continued to stand by the window straining for control or perhaps for the inevitable she disappeared inside the barn again and he told himself to turn away to get back to his work but he waited she returned with the stallion holding the rope close under his chin as he danced impatiently badtemperedly abby tied him securely to the rail and began to groom him the animal was beautiful his head thrown high and an arrogant look in his eyes that dylan could see even from the window and he was skittish when abby took his hind leg to clean his hoof he jerked it twice nearly pulling out of her grip before he settled down and let her do her business when she set it down again dylan caught his breath as the horse took a hard nasty kick at her abby avoided it and calmly picked up the next leg he could almost hear her gently scolding as she might have if one of the boys had had a fit of temper damn it who ate you he pressed a hand to the glass as if demanding she look up hear him and answer who the hell are you if she was genuine why the lies if she had the kind of morals the kind of values she seemed to have how could she lie yet she was lying dylan reminded himself and she would continue to lie until he tripped her up today he promised himself as he watched her brush out the smooth dark skin of the stallion today abby turning he went back to his typewriter and told himself to forget her it was after eleven when he heard her come back into the house he had rockwells early professional years his earlier family background drafted out hed written of rockwells meeting with abby from her perspective using quotes from her and bits of her family history people would be interested in the sister of one of hollywoods rising stars and in the sister of a successful broadway actress he hadnt overlooked the triplet angle or the theater background three sisters three actresses but he was about to rewrite abbys script she heard him come down but continued to wash the eggs good morning she didnt look back at him and continued to keep her hands busy coffees on thanks when he walked to the stove she glanced over he hadnt shaved it always made her stomach quiverperhaps at the thought of having that rough slightly uncivilized face scrape against hers mr petries back i think he could have used another day or two but he missed the horses you finished out there for now im going to be checking on the mates off and on fine he took his coffee to the bar lit a cigarette then turned on his tape recorder when did you and rockwell decide to divorce an egg hit the floor with a splat abby stared down at it in dull surprise without a word she began to clean it up do you want me to repeat the question no her voice was muffled then came stronger no but i would be interested to know where you got the idea lori brewer i see abby cleaned up the last of the mess then turned to wash her hands she was sleeping with your husband im aware of that abby dried her hands meticulously they were steady she hung on to that she wasnt the first im also aware of that she went to the stove and poured coffee you got ice for blood lady when she turned to look at him calmly it goaded him all the more your husband slept with any woman who could crawl between the sheets he made a career out of cheating on you lori brewer was only the last in a long line did he think she was hurting her she wondered did he think she should feel a stab of pain a wave of betrayal shed felt it all before but that was long since over she felt nothing now but a sort of vague curiosity about the anger she saw in dylans eyes if we both know that why talk about it was he going to dump you for her she took a sip of coffee it steadied the nerves she would give him the truth as long as it was possible to give him the truth chuck never asked me for a divorce she drank again and the liquid slipped hot and potent into her system though he may very well have told lori brewer that he did that was the truth his gut told him that this time she spoke with pure honesty it only made it more of a morass shes not a stupid woman she had it in her head that she and rockwell would be married before the year was out i cant realty comment on what she thought what can you comment on his anger surged and because he trusted it be moved with it perhaps with anger he could finally break through her shield tell me thishow did it feel knowing your husband wasnt faithful to you shed known the question would come up shed prepared herself for it but now somehow the answer didnt come as easily chuck and i understood each other how flat that sounded how foolishly sophisticated i well i knew he was under a great deal of pressure and being on the road like that month after month is a license to relieve the pressure anyway you chose she wasnt as calm as she wanted to be but she was still in control im not talking about a license or even an excuse dylan but it is a reason you consider being separated from you being on the road and pressured by a need to win is a reason for the women the booze the drugs drugs her face went a dead white if the shock in her eyes wasnt real dylan decided she should be the sister in hollywood i dont know what youre talking about im talking about cocaine freebasing his voice was clipped and hard a reporters voice he tried not to hate himself for it no there was a sudden sheen of desperation in her voice he watched her knuckles blanch as she gripped the counter no i dont believe that abby i have it from four different sources his tone had softened she was hurting inside she might have lied to him before but the pain was real you didnt know you cant write that you cant the children she put her hands over her eyes oh god what i have done he had her arm she hadnt heard him get up sit down when she started to shake her head he pulled her over to a stool sit down abby you cant write that she repeated and her voice was a roller coaster of ups and downs you cant be sure its true if you try to put that in the book ill withdraw my authorization ill sue what youd better do right now is calm down calm down she clutched her hands together until her fingers ached only determination kept her facing him and her eyes were drenched with despair youve just told me that chuck was she swallowed and got a grip on herself turn that off she said quietly then waited until the recorder stopped were off the record now do you understand me her eyes were dry again and her voice steady he had a sudden flash of her carrying his suitcase up the stairs stronger than she looked all right abby off the record if chuckif he used drugs i never knew do you think you would have she closed her eyes a sense of failure reached up and grabbed her by the throat no im sorry he touched her hand swearing at himself when she drew back i am sorry his mother knew i have it that she tried to get him into rehab a sudden hysterical thought drummed through her the last race the crash he was clean he thought he heard the relief sweep through her though she didnt make a sound he just took the turn too fast she nodded and straightened her shoulders if abby had teamed anything over the past eight years it was to take one step at a time deal with it then go on dylan im not asking for favors but id like you to remember there are two innocent people involved the children deserve some legacy from their father if you try to print anything about this ill find a way to stop you even if i have to go to janice how much will you try to cover up abby she gave him a clear direct look youd do better to ask me how much id do to protect my children he felt a twinge and fought to grind it down once a balls rolling it rolls youd have been smarter to stop the book in the beginning isnt the sex enough for you she lashed out desperate to find solid ground again how could she take the first step when each time she did she was kneedeep in quicksand do you have to put this ugly business in too cant you leave the boys something do you want me to write a fairy tale he grabbed her wrists before she could push away from the counter he should have resented her for making him fed responsible yet he couldnt she looked lost and helpless abby its too late to stop the book now the publishers would sue you not the other way around talk to me tell me the truth trust me to tell it trust you she stared at him wishing she could see inside him find some soft giving spot i trusted myself and ive made a mess of it faced with the inevitable she stopped resisting his hold on her hands ive got no choice do i no she waited a moment until she was certain she was strong enough turn your recorder back on she withdrew from him not by inches but by miles as soon as the machine was running abby began speaking again but she never looked at him chuck never used drugs in my presence we were married for four years and i never saw him with drugs of any kind as far as im concerned he never used them at all chuck was an athlete and he was very disciplined about his body for most of your marriage you only lived together for short periods thats true we each had certain responsibilities that kept things that way it would seem to me that you had certain responsibilities that should have kept you together she would ignore that she wouldnt wallow in guilt or in selfpity ever again if the time had come to compromise herself so be it shed take the lesser demon to go back to your earlier question chuck was often lonely he was attractive and women were a part of the circuit you accepted that i accepted that chuck was not capable of being faithful i realized that a marriage is the responsibility of two people in certain areas i wasnt able to give him what he needed what are you talking about pride was brushed aside abby had found it was rarely useful in any case i was only eighteen when we were married despite the fact that we were entertainers and on the road continually i was very sheltered i was a virgin when i married chuck and he often said i remained one i failed him in bed and so he looked elsewhere maybe that was wrong but it was also natural stop humiliating yourself this way she heard the barely restrained fury and turned to look at him you wanted answers im giving them to you chuck slept with other women because his wife didnt satisfy him the hell with this he spun her on the stool until she faced him youre a fool if you believe that dylan i know what went on in my own bedroom you dont i know what goes on inside you you asked me if i had ice for blood im answering you no youre not he pulled her off the stool to stand beside him now you will he had her close his mouth came down on hers hot furious before she could even think about protesting excitement bubbled up inside her to war with a strong desire for selfpreservation she tried to resist there was something wild and frightening about the way he could take her over make her hurt with need the hands in her hair werent gentle but held her to him in a kind of angry possession slowly inevitably she let herself go hed burned for her through the night through the morning but he hadnt expected it to be like this there were waves of fire and smoke blinding him her body was tight as a bowstring against his holding back against the passion he could feel building her fingers didnt push at his shoulders but dug into them he could almost hear her heart thudding in her throatfear excitement desire he didnt care as long as it was for him then with incredible ease she relaxed her lips softened her body yielded and she was his her heartbeat didnt slow somehow it increased even as her arms wound slowly around him she sighed he felt the soft trickle of air whisper against his mouth he combed his hands through her hair gently soothingly because she seemed to need it the flame had gone out of him but the heat was still there simmering sizzling he could have burned alive with tenderness come upstairs abby he murmured it against her ear then against her mouth come upstairs with me she wanted to the fact that she did jolted her shed already accepted that she was attracted to him but it was a different matter to slip into bed with a man dylan i i want you his mouth loitered along her chin where he bit gently you know that i think i do please her voice was trembling her muscles felt like putty she couldnt allow herself to tumble over the edge a second time without keeping her eyes open please dylan i just cant im not ready you want me he skimmed his hands up molding her hips tracing her ribs teasing her breasts i can feel it every time you take a breath yes she was through denying but i need more than that she took his hand and brought it to her cheek i need some time dylan brought his hand up under her chin and held it there her cheeks were flushed as hed once imagined they would be her eyes were dark and unsure if it hadnt been for them watching him almost trusting him hed have ignored her protests and taken her how badly did he mess up your head i wonder no she shook her head this has nothing to do with what happened between chuck and me you dont believe that and neither do i hes your yardstick sooner or later youre going to find out you cant measure me by it i dont think of chuck when im kissing you i dont think at all his fingers tightened on her skin abby if you want time youd better watch yourself she felt the energy that had poured into her so quickly drain out again i dont know how to play the games dylan thats the reason i messed up so badly once before im not interested in games and im not interested in hearing you shoulder blame lets make a deal she moistened her lips and wished she could be sure of herself again what sort you tell me the truth the truth he repeated laying his hands on her shoulders ill write it objectively then well let the blame fall wherever it belongs he made it sound so simple but then he had nothing to lose i dont know if i can do that dylan i have the children to think of sometimes the truth hurts sometimes it cleanses he countered abby ill find out everything i need to know one way or the other it was a threat he understood that and he saw by the look that came and went in her eyes mat she did as well you should think about that dont you think it would be better if it came from you i dont want to hurt those kids trapped she studied him carefully critically no i dont think you do but you and i might not agree on whats best for them he rubbed a hand over his face then paced around the kitchen it wasnt like him to make compromises he didnt care for it yet he was compelled to find one the book he was beginning to think the book didnt mean much of anything he wanted the truth from her about her and he wanted it for himself he thought perhaps he wanted it for her okay you give me the real story the true story without all the little evasions ill write it and then before i submit anything for publication ill give it to you to read if theres a problem well work it out both of us have to be satisfied with the manuscript before it flies she hesitated do you mean that he turned back she wasnt ready to trust him the woman had been lied to before he thought and lied to in a big way youve got it on record he gestured to the recorder which was still running she took the step though her legs were a little wobbly all right when he came forward and offered his hand abby held her breath and accepted it another bargain she thought hoping she could keep it better than the one shed made with herself he hurt you dylan said it quietly so quietly she answered without hesitation yes it made him angry no it made him furious he couldnt explain it but he knew that fury wouldnt help him get to the truth and for years maybe too many years that had been his driving ambition why dont you sit down again she nodded then sat with her hands neatly folded and her face placid abby you and rockwell were having serious marital problems thats right it seemed so easy to say it now just as hed said cleansing was it the other women that was part of it chuck needed more than i could give him in so many areas i guess i needed more than he could give me he wasnt a bad man the words were quick and earnest i want you to understand that maybe he wasnt a good husband but he wasnt a bad man dylan planned to use his own judgment there why did you stop traveling with him i was pregnant with ben she let out a little breath i cant honestly say whether that was a convenient excuse or a legitimate reason but i was pretty far along and traveling had become difficult we were living with his mother in chicago at first at first he managed to fly back fairly often i think he was happy maybe a little awed at the idea of being a father in any case he was attentive when he was home and be encouraged me to stay in chicago and take care of myself he tried really tried to ease the uncomfortable relationship i had with his mother there were long separations she looked back remembering those weeks months in the luxurious house in chicago long idle mornings quiet afternoons it seemed like a dream one in soft focus but with surprisingly sharp edges i was content and rather pleased with myself i decorated the nursery and took up knitting badly she laughed at herself as she remembered her fumbling attempts i figured i had just about everything under control then one day i found one of those gossip papers on my bed ive always wondered if janice left it there abby shook that away it hardly mattered there was a picture of chuck and this really beautiful woman and a short nasty article she looked out the window and watched the trees bend a little i sat there big and clumsy and nearly eight months pregnant i was crashed and betrayed and absolutely certain the world was over chuck came home at the end of the week and i tossed the paper at him demanding an explanation he gave you one he was angry that id believe a story like that he called it trash and threw it in the fire he didnt defend himself so i was abruptly in the position of apologizing do you understand he thought he could picture her fragile and alone his anger only burned brighter yeah i understand i was one month away from having a baby and scared to death i decided to believe him but of course i knew because id seen it in his face that he was lying i accepted the lie do you understand why did she keep asking that why was it so important she pressed her fingers against her eyes a moment and swore not to ask again i think by accepting it i only hurt him you believe if youd had a showdown then it would have stopped her eyes were solemn ill never be sure and there were other women there were others remember that chuck and i werent living together under normal circumstances and that our physical relationship had deteriorated he was a man who needed victories but as soon as hed achieved them he needed more if you could try to understand that even as a child he was under tremendous pressure to succeed to be the bestto be number one weary of it all she let out a little sigh because of that he required constant reassurance that he was the greatest after a while i dont think i gave him that in any case id thoughthopedthat after ben was born wed settle down but i knew or should have known when i married chuck that he was far from ready to settle there was an ugly little scandal with one of the groupies she wrote me letters threatened to kill herself if chuck didnt marry her thats when we bought this place chuck was upset because things had gotten out of hand it was an attempt to make it up to me to ben maybe to himself but then there was another race you didnt go with him no for a while i concentrated on making a home i felt he needed one the fact was i needed one she watched the smoke from dylans cigarette curl slowly toward the ceiling during that time after ben was born and before i became pregnant with chris i began to realize that our marriage wasnt working that chuck and i were only pretending it had ever worked he came home hed won in italy he wanted to sell the farm we had a terrible fight about it while we were fighting ben toddled in chuck just went wild he yelled at ben who was crying she dragged a hand through her hair as the misery of that memory came back to her ben was barely a year old i lost my temper and told chuck to get out he got in his car and went tearing up the road i calmed ben down and finally got him to sleep it was late and i went to bed i didnt expect chuck to came back i didnt care but he came back her voice had dropped almost to a whisper as he watched her dylan realized she wasnt talking to him any longer she was exorcizing her own ghosts hed been drinking he never drank very much because he couldnt handle it well but this time hed been drinking heavily he came upstairs and we argued again i was trying to get him to go sleep in one of the guest rooms so he wouldnt disturb ben he was too furious and too drunk to listen to reason he said id never been any kind of wife and less of a lover he said i only cared about ben and the farm god it was true it hadnt always been but he was right and i wouldnt admit it he said it was about time i learned what it was a man wanted from his wife what it was a man expected and was entitled to so he shoved me back on the bed and he raped me she said flatly as dylan stared at her then he cried like a baby he left before dawn a few weeks later i found out i was pregnant her hand trembled as she ran it through her hair thats honest dylan thats the truth she focused on him again should i tell chris that he was conceived the night his father forced himself on me is that the truth i owe my son she didnt wait for him to answer but stood slowly and walked out of the room chapter eight he couldnt work dylan stared almost resentfully at his typewriter but he couldnt bring himself to put words on paper the words were there jammed tight in his head the emotion was there still churning through him he could remember point by point precisely what had happened throughout the afternoon and evening when abby had walked out of the kitchen hed just sat there staring at the tape which had continued to run shocked how could he say he was shocked hed taken off his rosecolored glasses years before he knew how ugly life could be how violent how petty hed chipped his way into lives before and found the sores the scars and the secrets they didnt shock him and they had stopped affecting him a long time ago but hed sat in the kitchen a long time where the scent of coffee had still lingered and hed hurt hed hurt because he could remember how pale her face had been how calm her voice had sounded when shed told him then hed left her alone knowing privacy was what shed wanted hed driven into town distance hed told himself would help a journalist needed distance just as he needed intimacy it was the combination of the two that brought truth and power to a story and wasnt it always the story that came first the air had warmed though the wind was starting to kick up to welcome march snow was just a memory on the stillsoggy ground spring was beginning to push its way through and when spring faded the book should be finished he no longer knew precisely how when hed come back the boys had been home from school theyd been playing in the yard racing with the dog and each other dylan had sat in the car for a few moments watching them until chris had rushed over to invite him to play catch even now hours later dylan could remember just how bright chriss face had been how open and innocent his eyes had looked the little hand had gripped his with absolute trust as hed begun to ramble on about his day in school someone named sean parker had thrown up at recess big news ben had said something childishly obscene about sean parkers dilemma and chris had giggled until hed been ready to burst theyd raced around the back and had barreled into the kitchen standing behind them dylan had seen abby at the stove when shed turned their eyes had held for one long moment then shed fallen into the predinner routine with the easy efficiency hed come to expect from her hed waited for the tension but it hadnt come not then not during dinner not later when shed played a board game with the children and hed been drafted to join them normal was the order of the day and if it was forced even he couldnt tell shed seen the children off to bed then had retreated to her room shed been there ever since in his own room he found it impossible to get settled what was he going to do he had the makings of a tough honest story in the palm of his hand romance betrayal sex violence and it wasnt fiction it was real it was his job to write it and to write it honestly thoroughly he remembered how trustingly that small hand had fit into his swearing dylan pushed away from his desk he couldnt do it it wasnt possible to put down in black and white what abby had told him that afternoon no matter how he wrote no matter how carefully he phrased it it would be ugly hollow unforgivable and the child was so beautifully untouched and open it shouldnt matter all the instincts that had driven him through his years of reporting all the skill that had made his biographies hardedged and genuine pushed him to the truth but he could remember the way a small boy had grinned and lifted his arms for a hug he remembered ben sitting alone and sulky on a bed surrounded by tiny men and he remembered how abby had linked her fingers with his and made him feel whole theyd gotten to him dylan dragged a hand through his hair there was no use pretending otherwise inside him was a tugofwar that theyd created and he was still fighting hed forgotten the cardinal rule the one hed teamed in his first week as a pool reporter dont get involved well he was involved and he had no idea how to draw back the hell with drawing back without giving himself a chance to think it through dylan walked out of his room crossed the hall and knocked on abbys door yes come in she was sitting at a small writing desk finishing a letter she glanced up then set it aside as if shed been expecting him we need to talk all right close the door he closed it but he didnt speak at once there was no barrier between them now no recorder that made everything profession and ethical what was said now would be between the two of them or more accurately he realized for the two of them he wasnt certain how it had come down to this like a man walking down a dimly lit road he walked over and sat on the bed the room was quiet soft feminineas she was if there had been violence here it had long since been eradicated shed locked it away he realized because she wouldnt let her life or the lives of her children be destroyed by it by putting the knowledge in his hands shed made him responsible something within her had reached in and discovered the compassion that made him accept the responsibility abby you know i cant write what you told me this afternoon a wave of relief rolled over her shed hoped shed dared to trust but she hadnt been sure thank you dont be grateful in some ways he felt he could deal with her resentment more successfully im going to write plenty that you wont like im beginning to think it doesnt matter as much as i once believed it did she looked beyond him to the tiny pattern of flowers that was repeated over and over again in the wallpaper life was like that patterns that repeated shed tried to change them without looking at the overall picture you know i thought the children needed an image to look up to to be able to say this is my father the more i think about it really think about it its more important that they be proud of themselves why did you tell me she looked at himat the man who had finally changed the pattern how could she explain shed found kindness in him where none had been expected hed worked beside her though he hadnt been required to hed been warm and generous with her children he had cared for her when shed been ill shed found the kindness beneath the tough exterior and she had fallen in love with it with a half sigh abby picked up her pen unconsciously shifting it from hand to hand i cant tell you all the reasons once i started talking it just came all of it maybe i needed to say it out loud now after all these years ive never been able to before there was a paperweight by her hand pale pink flowers encased in glass fragile to look at difficult to shatter you didnt tell your family dylan asked no maybe i should have you go through all these stagesshame selfreproach fury i needed to work them through why in gods name did you stay with him he thought of the money again of the woman in mink and diamonds he no longer wanted to believe that was the reason she looked down at her hands the wedding ring had been gone for a long time and the bitterness had faded even before that afterafter it happened chuck was devastated he was miserably sorry i thought we might salvage something out of that awful night for a while we nearly did then chris was born chuck couldnt look at him without remembering hed look at the baby and hed resent him because of the way hed come into the world because chris reminded him of his own weakness maybe his own mortality and you how did you feel when you looked at chris the smite came slowly he was so beautiful hes still beautiful youre a remarkable woman abby she looked at him surprised no i dont think so im a good mother but theres nothing remarkable about that i wasnt a good wife chuck needed someone whod pick up and go on a moments notice he needed someone whod race with him i was too slow what did you need now she looked at him her expression blank no one but her family bad ever asked her that and the pat answers wouldnt come im not sure what i needed but im happy now with what i have its enough the children this place he rose and crossed to her i thought you were going to tell me the truth dylan he wasnt supposed to be so close she couldnt think when he stood so close i dont know what you expect me to say dont you taking her hand he drew her to her feet he felt her fingers tremble and tightened his grip i dont want you to be afraid of me im not i dont want you to be afraid of whats between us i cant help it dylan dont do this she put her free hand on his arm i really couldnt stand making a mess of it i thinki hope were at the point of being friends were past that point he brought her hand to his lips and watched the surprise come into her eyes has anyone ever made love with you panic sprinted up her spine ii have two children thats not an answer curious he turned her hand over and pressed his lips to the palm her fingers curled and tensed was there anyone besides chuck no i his look sharpened and his fingers tightened no one the shame came quickly the price of failure no im really not a physical person in how many ways had rockwell managed to humiliate her dylan wondered rage came swiftly and he banked it noninvolvement he was far beyond that now he wanted to prove to her it could be different maybe for the first time he wanted to believe it himself why dont you let me find out for myself dylan the words clogged in her throat as he brushed his lips over her temple dont you want me abby seduction hed never consciously seduced a woman before women had always come to him knowing experienced expectant none of them had ever trembled he had a moment of panic himself did he have it in him to be careful enough gentle enough thorough enough yes she tilted her head to look at him but i dont know what i can give you let me worry about it with more confidence than he felt he took her face in his hands for now just take he kissed her slowly dreamily her hands lifted to his wrists and held on it was that that hesitant vulnerable movement that touched him in a way hed never expected to be touched the lamplight fell across her face as he tilted his head and nibbled lightly at her lips she felt the pulse in his wrists speed up and tightened her hold he wanted her really wanted her and god she was terrified shed disappoint both of them he urged her closer she stiffened easy he murmured finding patience he hadnt been aware of possessing relax abby he stroked soothingly until he felt her muscles give her hands went around his waist hesitant tentative he felt the sweetness of the gesture shoot through him hed never looked for sweetness before never expected it now finding it he didnt want to lose it slowly easily carefully he made love to her with his mouth alone tasting seducing then relaxing he drew her ever so gradually to him he felt her hands clutch then loosen at his back when her mouth warmed and softened against his he took her deeper he felt her breath shudder heard the low quiet moan that came from wonder for the first time in years he felt the wonder himself he slipped his hands under her sweater when she jumped he stroked and whispered promises he hoped he could keep her skin was smooth her back long and slender need whipped through him quickly painfully he fought back inch by inch he brought the sweater up until he could slip it off it dropped at their feet the panic returned she was vulnerable now her breath was coming quickly somehow clouding her brain didnt she have to think how could she protect herself how could she give him what he expected if she couldnt think but his hands felt so wonderful gliding over her skin strong patient touching her when she needed so badly to be touched perhaps when they became demanding she would freeze up but for now she could only feel the heat building then he led her toward the bed fear snapped back into place dylan lie down with me abby just lie down with me she held on to him as they lowered to the bed she saw everything with perfect clarity the pattern of roses repeated over and over on the walls the dark spiral of the bedpost the white square of ceiling and his face nerves tangled and twisted until she was afraid she couldnt move she struggled with them trying to remind herself she wasnt a young inexperienced girl but a woman the light i want to see you he kissed her again eyes open and on hers i want you to see me im going to make love to you abby thats nothing that has to be done in the dark dontdont expect too much he cupped the back of her neck and lifted her face toward his dont expect too little then he silenced her the kiss sent her spinning it was hard and pungent her body already tingling with panicked excitement went hot with passion the moan ripped out of her and into him she felt as shed once imagined the scrape of his face against her cheek dozens of pulses began to beat in a rhythm that drummed over and over in her head she was driving him crazy couldnt she feel it the way her body tensed and shuddered and relaxed the way her hands reached and hesitated and caressed he hadnt known hed wanted her this badly not this badly now that she was here warm and solid beneath him he knew he had to think of her first and his own needs second so he showed her restlessly ruthlessly he stroked his hands over her feeling her arch hearing her tangled breaths he inhaled the passion rising to her skin that musky heady womanly scent a man could drown in the light slanted over her face so that he could see surprise pleasure and desire mix and mingle impatient he pulled off his shirt so he could feel his skin against hers he was smooth his torso was hard as iron but the skin over it was soft she could glide her fingers over it and feel his muscles tense strong shed always needed strength but shed found it only in herself patience once shed nearly wept for patience but then shed stopped looking now shed found it passion shed wanted it craved it then dismissed it as something shed have to live without here it was wrapped around her burgeoning inside her he moaned her name and she was dizzy from the sound of it his lips were on her breast the muscles in her stomach contracted as he encircled the tip with his mouth unconsciously she pressed a hand to the back of his bead and arched under him with teeth and tongue and lips he brought her an exquisite torture mindlessly she let herself go with it he opened the snap of her jeans but she didnt even notice she felt the slow movement of his hands the soft scrape of denim down her legs she wanted to call out to him but his name evaporated with a moan as his tongue skimmed over her thigh she was beautiful her body was slim and subtly muscled the legs long the hips narrow he wondered as he looked at her how shed ever carried children somehow he could only imagine her as untouched then he began to see just how high he could take her and how fast the first peak rocked her with uncontrollable speed helpless dazed abby gave a muffled cry it seemed as though her body filled then burned then emptied struggling to right herself she reached for him only to have him send her miles higher she was gasping for breath pulsing with sensations shed never experienced before were there names for them she wondered frantically had anyone ever found the right words to describe those feelings her skin was so sensitized that even the brush of his fingertip sent her spiraling hed wanted to see her like this floundering in her own pleasure when he slipped into her her eyes flew open he saw the astonished pleasure in them before she reached out to bring him closer her hips moved like lightning tearing down the control hed laboriously built her fingers dug into his back the short rounded nails scraping his skin she wasnt aware and soon neither was he it had never been like that before no one had ever made her feel so complete so important so alive doors had been opened windows raised and the air that blew in was wonderful she wanted to tell him but was afraid hed think she was foolish instead she contented herself with placing a hand over his heart it was beating more steadily than hers but it was beating very fast it had never been like that before no one had ever made him feel so real so strong so open shed turned on a light inside his head and it shone dear and bright he wanted to tell her but was afraid shed think he was feeding her a line instead he contented himself with drawing her against him not very physical huh what you told me you werent very physical i guess you didnt want to brag she turned her face into his shoulder her scent was there she realized it was an odd and wonderful sensation to find her own scent clinging to his skin i never have been very good at the at the technical parts technical parts he didnt know whether to laugh or shout at her what does that mean well the embarrassed she let her words trail off sex she said firmly reminding herself she was a grown woman we didnt have sex he said simply rolling on top of her we made love its just a matter of semantics like hell it is no dont close up on me he grasped her shoulders bard before she could im not chuck look at me really look she calmed herself and did what he asked i am i know what do you want abby an evaluation no color flooded cheeks already flushed with passion no of course not i just wonder how it was for me if you did the right things at the right times he sat up pulling her with him and kept his hands firmly on her shoulders even when she fumbled for the sheet did it ever occur to you that chuck rockwell wasnt the devastating macho lover the gossip sheets touted him to be did you ever consider that what happened or didnt happen between the two of you in this bed was his fault it hadnt of course it hadnt all those other women she began then fell silent let me tell you something its easy to wrestle under the sheets with a different woman every night he felt a little twinge remembering all those times you dont have to think you dont have to feel you dont have to worry about making the other person see stars all you do is satisfy yourself its very different when youve got a partner someone youve made promises to someone youre supposed to want to make happy it takes care and time and waiting until its right she stared at him lips parted eyes wide with an oath be lifted a hand and ran it through her hair listen right now i dont much want to hear about chuck rockwell i dont want you to think about him or anyone else just concentrate on me i am a little uncertain she touched a hand to his cheek youre the best thing thats happened to me in a long time she saw his expression change felt his hand tighten in her hair and went on quickly youve made me face a lot of things i thought i should keep under lock and key im grateful im getting tired of telling you not to thank me but his hand gentled in her hair and slipped down to the curve of her shoulder this is absolutely the last time lifting her arms she twined them around him and held tight she felt safe there as shed known she would once before when the sun had shone down on them dont laugh he skimmed his lips over her collarbone i dont fed much like laughing i feel as though ive just mastered a very complex and important skill he chuckled earning himself a whack on the back like the backstroke i said not to laugh sorry then he tumbled her over until she lay beneath him you dont master anything unless you practice a lot i guess youre right this playfulness was something shed never tasted before abby clung to it her lips met his already warm open and accepting dylan hmm i did see stars he smiled she felt it when he drew back to look at her she saw it me too he started to lower his head again but then he heard the sobbing what the chris abby was out of bed in an instant she whipped a robe out of her closet pulled it out and was out of the room before hed picked up his jeans oh baby abby hurried into chriss room where he was bundled under the covers sobbing his heart out whats the matter they were green and ugly he burrowed into the safety of his mothers breasts smelling her familiar smell they looked like snakes and went ssss and they were chasing me i fell down in a hole what a nasty dream she held and rocked and soothed him its all over now okay im right here he sniffled but relaxed they were going to cut me up in little pieces bad dream dylan hesitated in the doorway not certain whether it was his place to come in ugly green snakes abby told him as she rocked chris in her lap wow pretty scary huh tiger chris sniffled again nodded and rubbed his eyes whether it was his place or not dylan couldnt resist he came in and hunkered down in front of the boy next time you should dream yourself a mongoose snakes dont have a chance against a mongoose mongoose chris tried out the word giggling over it did you make it up nope well find a picture of one tomorrow they have them in india trace went to india chris remembered we got a postcard then he yawned and settled back against abby dont go yet no i wont ill stay until youre asleep again dylan too dylan rubbed his knuckles over the boys cheek sure they sat there abby snuggling the boy and singing something that sounded to dylan like an irish lullaby dylan felt an amazing satisfaction not like the one hed found with abby in the old bed but one just as strong it was a firm sense of belonging as if he had finally reached a place hed been moving toward all his life it was foolish and he told himself it would pass but it stayed the hall light slanted into the room and fell on a jumble of trucks next to an old halfdeflated ball she settled the boy smoothly tucking mary under the sheets with him abby kissed his cheek then straightened but dylan stayed for a moment idly brushing at the curls over chriss forehead pretty irresistible isnt he she murmured yeah he brought his hand back and stuck it in his pocket hes going to be hard to live with when he figures it out hes a lot like traceall charm according to pop trace figured out how to exploit it before he could crawl in a natural gesture she took dylans hand and drew him out of the room i just want to look in on ben she pushed the door open and saw the morass that was her sons room clothes books toys were one tangled heap that stretched from wall to wall abby sighed and promised herself shed make him see to it over the weekend at the moment though her firstborn was sprawled in bed half in and half out of the covers going in she rolled him over pulled a tennis shoe from under the pillow tossed aside a squadron of small plastic men and covered him up he sleeps like a rock she commented so i see she took a last look around the room hes also a slob yeah no argument there with a quiet laugh she bent over and kissed her son i love you you little jerk she made her way expertly over the heaps in the semidarkness when she came to the doorway again dylan ran his hands down her arms i like your kids abby touched she smiled then kissed his cheek youre a nice man dylan there arent a lot of people whod agree with you she understood that maybe they havent seen you the way i have that much was true but he couldnt tell her why he didnt know come back to bed she nodded and slipped an arm around his waist chapter nine so much could happen in twentyfour hours abby faced the morning with a kind of dazed wonder shed discovered passion shed found affection and maybe just maybe she was taking the first step toward finally severing her ties and obligations to the past she had dylan to thank for that but she didnt think hed tolerate hearing the phrase again she couldnt express her gratitude without annoying him she couldnt tell him that she loved him without risking losing what had just begun so she would say nothing and hope that simply being with him was enough abby sent the boys off to school zipped through her morning chores and left a note for dylan on the breakfast bar then hopped in her car she had the energy of ten shed planned to spend the morning mopping waxing and scrubbing mrs cuttermans houseand earning a good portion of the grocery money she thought it was a lucky thing she was over the flu and could get back to the parttime job that helped keep the ledgers balanced until she could sell the foals tomorrow was also her day to do the twicemonthly cleaning at the smiths mentally she went over her schedule and calculated that she had just enough time to fit everything in including a shopping expedition for new shoes at the end of the week abby told herself to concentrate on that and not to think too deeply about what had happened the night before what it had meant to dylan and what it had meant to her were two different things she had to be wise enough to understand that but hed given her something shed never had from a man before respect affection passion she was still relishing it switching the radio on she turned onto the main road when dylan came downstairs he went straight for the coffee he didnt usually wake up groggy even after a sleepless night but working through the night and lying awake in bed seemed to have different effects he wasnt sure yet why hed been so restless abby had slept beside him as peacefully as her children had slept in the other rooms his body had been relaxed even serene he could tell himself that was pure physical relief but his mind had been tense and active what had happened between them hadnt been ordinary part of him wished it had been while anothera part he hadnt explored in yearsrejoiced that it hadnt he wasnt a man who enjoyed contrasts within himself over and above those contradictions there was the mystery of the woman who had slept beside him hed begun to dissect the opinion hed had of her before theyd met and compare it to the feelings he had about her now nothing lined up what did the woman in mink laughing at the spin of the wheel have to do with the woman whod trembled in his arms were they both realor were they both an act his blood still curdled when he thought of what shed told him for the first time in his life the urge to protect was stronger than any other he knew better than to let his feelings color the facts and he tried to be objective if she had been physically and emotionally abused why had she stayed chuck rockwell had publicly thumbed his nose at his wedding vows so a divorce would have been simple but shed stayed he couldnt resolve the contradiction any more than he could resolve what was happening inside him he wanted her just as much as he had beforeno even more there was a sweetness about her lovemaking that hed never tasted before and he craved it again but there was more he could close his eyes and hear the way she laughed at herself easily and without guile he could see the way she worked steadily and without bitterness there was the way she handled her children with a firm hand and tremendous love a special woman he knew only a fool believed there was anything as fanciful as a special woman maybe he was becoming a fool he glanced out the window and wondered if she was in the barn feeding the stock he could wait for her to come in again have his recorder ready and theyd get down to work dylan pictured her hefting a bag of grain or hefting another bale of hay with a shake of his head he turned and reached for his coat then he saw the note dylan im at mrs cuttermans through the morning the number is in the book if theres a problem i need to swing into town and pick up a few things before i come home see you around one abby he felt ridiculously depressed she wasnt there wouldnt be there for hours he wanted to see her to look at her in the morning see her face after their night together he wanted to talk to her calmly logically until what he knew and what he felt drew closer together he wanted to make love with her in the daylight in the big empty house he wanted to be with her shrugging off the feeling dylan poured a second cup of coffee and took it upstairs there was work to be done when abby pulled up in front of the house the sky had darkened again she muttered halfheartedly at the clouds as she carried the bread and milk to the house rain she thought disgusted because the radio had promised clear skies neither of the boys had their boots with them well they needed new shoes anyway she reminded herself and pushed open the door on her way to the kitchen she picked up two tracks two plastic men and a sock after shedding her coat she switched on the portable radio and began to deal with the ground beef shed taken out to defrost that morning hi she jumped a little a frying pan in one hand dylan was only two feet away lord youre quiet i didnt hear you come in you always play the radio too loud oh automatically she lowered the volume she felt awkward but shed expected to i had to pick up some milk the way the boys go through it im tempted to bay a cow she busied herself at the stove and felt a little easier youve been working yeah he felt awkward he hadnt expected it soft and straight her hair was tied back with a bandanna he wanted to loosen it to fed it flow through his hands the way it had during the night did you have a good time what a good time the meat began to sizzle with your friend myoh mrs cutterman shes very nice abby thought briefly of the acres of furniture shed polished dismissing the thought she began to rummage for tomato paste its going to rain she said i dont think the boys are going to make it home before it does you had a call oh betty something from the pta bake sale with a sigh abby opened the can of tomato paste the whirl of the electric can opener sounded like an earthquake how long she wondered could she hide behind routine cupcakes three dozen she said she knew she could count on you good old reliable abby she said it without sarcasm but with a selfmocking tone when does she need them next wednesday okay the silence went on as she diluted the paste and added spices spaghetti was bens favorite she thought he packed it away like a lumberjack at the moment she didnt know if she would ever eat again i guess youd like to ask me more questions a few ill be finished here in a minute if we can do it white im seeing to the laundry then her voice trailed off when he touched her shoulder no longer knowing what to expect she turned slowly he was looking at her again looking deep looking hard she wished she understood what he was searching for then he kissed her softly gently and her heart melted like butter oh dylan the breath she hadnt been aware of holding escaped unevenly as she put her arms around him i was afraid you had regrets about what god it felt good to hold her hed told himself it made no difference but it did it made all the difference about last night no i have no regrets she smelted of soapjust as fresh as that im dazed really only half believing him she drew back yeah really he smiled incredibly relieved and kissed her again i missed you oh thats nice she ran her hands up his back as she drew him closer thats very nice want to play hooky with a laugh she tossed back her head hooky thats right you look like someone who never played enough hooky i was never in one school long enough to work up to it besides its going to rain what kind of fun is it to play hooky in the rain come upstairs ill show you she laughed again but her eyes widened when she saw he was serious dylan the kidsll be home in a couple of hours you can pack a whole day into a couple of hours on impulse he scooped her up it felt good be realized to hear that quick breathless laugh to see those wide wondering eyes her heart pounded as he carried her from the room it was thrilling illicit abby buried her face against his throat and murmured no ones going to have any clean socks and only you and i will know why they made love quickly desperately with a wild kind of abandon shed never experienced before clothes were tossed helterskelter around the room the curtains were thrown wide so that the soft gloomy light crept into the room he took her places shed never been places she knew shed be afraid to go with anyone else like a child treated to her first roller coaster she lost her breath on the ride then fretted to go again he felt free so incredibly free as they rolled over on the old bed her body was furnacehot and open to him open to anything he could teach her she was pliant she was strong and she was his amazingly agile she arched back lost in mindless pleasure unable to get enough he rose with her their bodies met torso to torso hip to hip as they knelt on the bed tight as bowstrings then limp they tumbled together it began to rain slow and steady against the windows their loving slowed and steadied as passion turned to yearning quiet sighs gentle movements took the place of frenzy there was no need to rush the bed was wide and soft the rain quiet and soothing they drew from each other all the sweet simple things lovers bring to one another and no one else he tasted her skin warm with pleasure damp with excitement hed never known a flavor more intoxicating her fingers trailed over his back finding the muscles that contracted and gave shed never known strength in itself could be so arousing they went deep into each other where the rain could no longer be heard she found what shed needed to findthe kindness the compassion there were so many layers to herserenity wisdom passion he wondered if he would ever discover them all he could look at her one way and see the headstrong woman whod thrown caution to the winds and left family and familiar things to grab at something as elusive as love he could look at her another way and see the vulnerability and the control he felt compelled to know her to fit the pieces together abby was becoming his obsession but when they were like this desire peaking senses swimming it only mattered that she was there with him the hands that had once been hesitant moved over him as though theyd always known him the mouth that had once been unsure fused to his as though there were no other tastes in the world she would ever need her long umber body came to his without inhibitions her arms and legs wrapped around him like warm silk passion poured through them swirled around them until there was nothing else abby was walking downstairs delighted with herself when the front door burst open wipe your feet she said automatically then laughed and hurried down the rest of the stairs to hug her two dripping children its raining chris informed her really my papers got wet ben took off his soaking hat and let it fall on the floor they wouldnt if you used your book bag theyre for girls he picked up his hat because his mother was looking at it then handed her a wet wrinkled paper an a abby put a hand to her heart as if the shock were too much for her why benjamin someone put your name on their paper he chuckled a bit embarrassed no they didnt its mine this spelling testunit with none absolutely none marked wrong belongs to benjamin francis rockwell my benjamin francis rockwell he wrinkled his nose as he always did when reminded of his middle name yeah she put a hand on his shoulder you know what this means she asked solemnly what hot chocolate all around a grin split his face can i have marshmallows absolutely hot chocolate dylan asked as he came down the steps abby hooked an arm around bens shoulder were celebrating the one hundred percent graded unit twenty deathdefying words spelled correctly she held up the paper where the little gold star glittered damply pretty impressive dylan scrubbed a hand over chriss head then held it out to ben congratulations its no big deal he murmured but looked secretly pleased with the handshake can i have three marshmallows the boy knows how to take advantage of a situation abby stated lets go hang up your coats she said automatically when they stepped into the kitchen for the next twenty minutes the air was filled with stories of the adventures young boys go through in a day then bloated with chocolate ben and chris tugged on their boots and coats and went out to tend the stock i bet i havent had any of this for twenty years dylan mused as he studied his empty cup bring back memories my mother used to make it when abby leaned on the counter opposite him and smiled he found himself continuing shes a great cook i still think she bakes the best custard pies in new jersey do you get to see them often your parents couple of times a year he shrugged feeling the familiar tug of guilt and resignation there never seems to be enough time i know abby glanced over her shoulder at the window there would come a time when her boys would go when shed have to let them go that was the price of being a parent i dont see mine very often either theyre never in one place long enough still playing the clubs theyll always be playing the clubs affection came into her voice deep and natural put two people into a room and theyre ready to entertain its in the blood if you believe my fathers theory hes desperately proud of chantel and maddy for carrying on the tradition in grand style he stays annoyed with trace because he didnt what does your brother do travels she moved her shoulders none of us really have any idea just what it is that trace does she took another cookie off the plate and offered dylan one pop claims trace doesnt know either what about you any problems because you dont sing for your supper oh no she grinned i gave them ben and chrisbetter than a command performance your parents must be proud of you my father would have preferred it if id stayed on the farm and milked cows he drew out a cigarette but my mother tells me hes read every word ive written isnt if funny how mom chris came barreling through the door dripping wet and tracking mud abby caught him halfway into the room checking for injuries what is it whats wrong its eve shes sick shes lying down and all sweaty abby already had her coat off the hook not bothering to change into her boots she dashed out the door in her sneakers when she got to the barn ben was sitting next to the mare struggling not to cry as he stroked her is she going to die abby crouched beside him and put a hand on the mound of the mares stomach no no of course not she circled her arm around ben and squeezed hard shes just going to have a baby remember we talked about it she looks awful sick when babies come it hurts some but shes going to be fine with her heart in her throat abby prayed she wasnt making promises she couldnt keep shes having contractions she murmured soothing the mare her bodys helping the baby come out all ben could see was the mares shudders sweat rolled dampening her coat and overwhelming the scent of fresh hay why does it have to hurt because life hurts a little ben but its worth it one of the barn cats mewed in sympathy as eve moaned now ben i want you to go in and call the vet tell him who you are first okay he sniffed kay then tell him that eves in labor in labor having a babys work she told him and kissed his cheek go ahead then come back this is something youll want to see he dashed off recovered enough to be pleased with the responsibility as the mare suffered her pangs abby shifted eves head onto her lap anything we can do she looked up to see dylan standing at the entrance to the stall chriss hand firmly caught in his her son was wideeyed and fascinated she smiled ive helped the vet with deliveries before and i found that you end up doing little more than cheering her on eve has the starring role here eve moaned with the next contraction and abby leaned over and crooned to her oh i know it hurts baby the mares sweat transferred to her own skin abby wished she could take some of the pain as easily chris swallowed with a little click hed never seen anything like it one of the cats had had kittens once he remembered but hed come out to the barn to find them snuggled clean and naked against their mother did it hurt when i was born you were a slowpoke the mares eyes half shut and she breathed heavily with her hand on eves stomach abby felt the power of the contraction for a while i thought youd decided not to come out after all the doctor had music on they were playing let it be when you were born would eve like the music i bet she would anxious to help chris dashed over and turned on the radio a familiar ballad filled the air the vet said hed come as soon as he could but not to worry cause eves real strong ben dashed back in and took his place beside his brother of course she is but as the minutes dragged on and the contractions built abby worried she knew she could handle a simple foaling with or without the vet when a woman lived on her own raised children on her own she had no choice but to develop selfconfidence but if there were complications she shook her head and cleared her mind whatever happened she was going to give eve the best she could the horse meant more much more than a means to an end to her eve was flesh and blood something shed cared for day after day for over a year when pain went through the mate it rippled through her then dylan crouched beside her shes doing fine he assured her look i never delivered any horses but i helped with my share of cows she leaned her head on his shoulder briefly in a gesture that caught bens attention thanks but when it began abby rushed to help the foal into the world before dylan could her own sweat mixed with the mares and her voice was raised in encouragement the blood that came with new life streaked her hands the hope that came with new life shone in her eyes she looked dylan realized as he watched her magnificent he glanced at the boys and saw them watching the foals birth with their mouths hanging open incredible isnt it ben looked at him and made a face its pretty gross then he saw spindly legs emerge a small head and a compact body its a horse its a real horse both he and chris scrambled for a closer look but hes big intrigued chris measured the foal howd he fit in there she abby corrected weeping shamelessly isnt she beautiful shes kind of sloppy ben commented then eve immediately went about her business and cleaned up her baby good job dylan stroked a hand down abbys hair then kissed her real good job chris reached out a tentative hand to touch the foal can we play with her not yet but you can touch isnt she soft then chris jerked back as the foal shook and shivered and tried out her legs for the first time she stood up amazed he stared at his mother she stood right up cathy jacksons little sister didnt stand up for months and months it pleased him enormously to find his horse superior what can we name her we cant name her love if mr jorgensens going to buy her then hell want to name her we cant keep her chris she looked at him and at ben you know we cant we talked about this you didnt sell ben and me horses grow up faster dylan put in one day youll have a house of your own the foals going to be ready for her own place in a few months we can visit her ben set his chin and waited for someone to shoot him down im sure we can abby smiled at him her baby was so grownup already mr jorgensens a very nice man can we watch when gladys has her baby ben reached out for the first time to touch the foals ears if youre not in school she heard the sound of an engine and looked down at her hands for the first time she noticed they were streaked with blood that must be the vet id better wash the excitement didnt die down until long after bedtime because she understood abby let her boys go out and say goodnight to the foal after they should both have been in bed themselves tired but pleasantly so she settled down in front of the living room fire quite a day dylan murmured as he sat beside her and then some im so glad the boys were there its something theyll never forget its something ill never forget she felt a stirring inside her one she hadnt experienced for a long long time she knew what it was like to have me grow inside her what it was like to bring it into a notsoperfect world would she ever carry another child she sighed reminding herself she had two beautiful healthy sons tired a little your minds wandering she curled her legs under her and watched the flames dance i think you see too much in there too easily funny i would have said i havent seen nearly enough she blocked off wishes and longings and faced reality tomorrow youre going to have more questions and youre going to expect me to answer them thats what im here for abby but he wasnt sure that was the complete truth not now i know she accepted it as truth she had to ive made myself a few promises dylan im going to try to keep them he touched her hair wishing there were other ways to get what he needed to get from her there arent any questions right now she closed her eyes a moment maybe there was a little room for longings after all for tonight just for tonight id like to pretend there isnt any book that there arent any questions he knew he could have pressed he understood that at that moment she was open enough to tell him everything if be pushed the right buttons the answers would simply pour out he had an obligation to do it he slipped an arm around her shoulder and watched the fire with her we had a big stone fireplace at home my mother used to say you could roast an ox in it she relaxed against him as if it were the most natural thing in the world were you happy yeah i never much cared for milking cows before the sun came up but i was happy we had a creek and a big oak tree id sit under it listen to the water and read books i could go anywhere she smiled picturing him as a child and you decided to be a writer i decided to singlehandedly spread the truth i guess thats why reporting came first i went into that with the first amendment playing in my head he laughed at himself something he didnt yet realized hed learned from her i found out youve got to crawl through a lot of dirt to make it work the truth she closed her eyes and wished the word didnt have such a sharp edge its very important to you without it the rest is just dressing just excuses shed made plenty of those abby thought why biographies then because its fascinating to explore one persons life one person at a time and find out how many other lives were affected what marks were left what mistakes were made sometimes mistakes are private thats why ive never done a bio that wasnt authorized and if one day someone wrote yours he seemed to find that amusing she heard his chuckle as his cheek brushed over her hair he couldnt know how deadly serious she was maybe id do it myselfwarts and all have you ever done anything you were really ashamed of he didnt have to think for long a man didnt live beyond thirty without shame ive had my share of wrong turns and youd write about them no matter what anyone thought of you after it was done you cant bargain with the truth abby he remembered what she had told him about chriss conception and continued sometimes when its important enough you can pretend you didnt hear it she watched the fire and thought about that she thought about it a long time because he wanted to get an early start dylan was downstairs before the boys had finished breakfast the main topic as expected was the foal the boys were arguing though without heat about whether gladys would mess things up and deliver while they were in school veterans now they were prepared to step in as midwives to prove their valor each one had a polaroid snapshot of the new addition to take to class theyre having hamburgers for lunch today ben remembered looking expectantly at his mother abby put the jar of peanut butter back in the cupboard get my purse me too chris asked dribbling milk down his chin okay she opened her bag when ben brought it in and dumped out the contents along with her wallet she pulled a pair of rubber gloves in a plastic bag out of the pile and dropped them on the counter here you go dont lose it we wont chris scrambled for his coat white he stuffed the money in the pocket of his jeans mom i know where babies come from umhmm she was pouring her second cup of coffee but how do they get there oh she spilled the coffee on the counter and caught dylans grin as she turned to look at chris his round young face was lifted to hers but hes only six she thought wondering just what she was supposed to tell him she knelt down in front of him and asked herself how to tell a sixyearold about making babies in the two minutes he had left before he had to catch the bus for school love puts them there she told him and kissed both his cheeks a very special kind of love oh satisfied he gave her one of his quick energetic hugs and dashed for the door come on ben then seeing that his brother was still pulling on his coat chris grinned ill beat you he flew off with the challenge and left ben struggling to zip up and run at the same time bye ben abby murmured then with a shake of her head she went back to mop up the coffee dylan sat at the counter and watched her tidy up the spill with a secret smile of amusement on her face i like your style lady oh laughing she tugged at the hem of an overlaundered sweatshirt it is rather today isnt it i was talking about your answer to a very important and very ticklish question from a sixyearold boy some people wouldve given him a biology lesson and others would have brushed him off you gave him exactly the answer he needed still he toyed with the last of his coffee i wish id had that polaroid when the question popped out of his mouth your face was worth the price of a ticket im sure it was she walked over to pull on her boots i like the way you look in the morning she stopped still bent over and looked at him frazzled fresh the smile on her face faded soft his voice lowered id like to be able to lie in bed with you during the morning watch you wake up fall back to sleep and know when you wake up again i could make love with you her pulse thudded and she wondered he didnt hear it id like that too but the children i didnt say i didnt understand but the idea warms me up a little it warmed her more than a little she thought as she finally managed to get into her boots as it is there isnt a lot of time around here for lazing around in bed in the morning i always figure ill know the kids are growing up when they sleep past seven not quite steady she walked over to clear the counter ill do that he said and caught her hand its all right abby he flicked a finger over her wrist havent you ever heard of womens liberation she lifted a brow in her way shed been liberated since shed taken her first breath her parents had seen to that sure thats why the boys take turns doing the dishes put away their own clotheson a good dayand know how to use the vacuum their wives will thank me in the meantime someone has to man the oars there are usually two oars she tilted her head smiled then nodded fine you clean up the kitchen ill feed the stock itll save some time okay well get started when you come back in he started to object then made himself stop she had her own life he watched her fill her purse again do you always carry rubber gloves in there what oh with a laugh she dropped them in i do when im going to the smiths shes a fanatic about ammonia come again ammonia abby zipped up her purse and wondered if there was enough spaghetti in the fridge for leftovers the straight stuff the woman has a fetish about having all the floors cleaned with ammonia his brow creased as he tried to follow her you clean them twice a month her mind on dozens of other matters abby went for her coat what is it like volunteer work she have a quick appreciative roll of laughter as she turned back not on your life i make six dollars an hour look dont run the dishwasher i think you work as a maid housekeeper she grinned and pulled a bandanna off a peg to tie her hair back with i suppose thats really a glorified term but i always see a maid in a little black skirt and she let the words die when he rose out of his seat and walked to her something in his eyes had her throat clogging up shed never dealt well with anger why in the bell are you getting down on your hands and knees and scrubbing someone elses floor her chin came up its honest work why because the only other thing im good at is singing in threepart harmony there isnt a lot of call for that and the pays lousy ignoring her evasions he went straight to the point why does chuck rockwells widow have to wash floors for six dollars an hour she went very pale it was in his voice the doubt the derision i dont have time or the inclination to discuss my financial business with you dylan she yanked the door open but he slammed it again i asked you a question and ive given you the only answer i intend to the fire came into her eyes briefly but powerfully i dont have to tolerate this from you from anyone dylan i dont have to stand here while you look at me as though im less of a person because i mop other peoples floors and dust their furniture for pay if i did it for charity id be a hero but i do it for money i want to know why you do it at all i do exactly what i have to do nobody knows it better with that she yanked the door open again and strode out he could have followed her and he started to then just as determined as she dylan shut the door it was time to get back to business he told himself and back to the truth chapter ten moving with a dull grinding fury dylan drafted out twenty pages chuck rockwell had become more than a name less than an image to him now over the course of time dylan had come to know him as a man a badly flawed one insecure selfabsorbed intemperate the skill and the training couldnt be overlooked nor could the daring that some would have called heroics hed been born not just with a silver spoon in his mouth but with the whole place setting at his disposal yet he hadnt chosen to simply sit back and enjoy his wealth hed refused a meaningless title in the family conglomerate he had instead chosen to make his own mark in his own way there was something to be said for that chuck rockwell had become a success and had earned respect even adulation his associates had considered him one of their best even if they hadnt liked him personally the press had gloried in him on the track and off his fans had made him a celebrity within a year of his first professional race hed attained all that plus a devoted wife and two sons then hed set outsystematically it seemed to dylanto destroy it all hed lost his backer and first supporter hed alienated most of his associates and had torn irreparable holes in his marriage yet abby had once described him as a knight on a white charger and shed stuck by him for four years why chuck had abused their marriage abused her and left her to raise his children while he ran the next race and pursued the next woman but shed made a home for him why until she told him until he cornered her again and pulled the answers out of her what he wrote would just be words until she told him until she trusted him with the truth what he felt for her couldnt be acknowledged how long could he deny it dylan crushed his cigarette out with quick and deliberate violence how long could he live in the same house with her watch her want her deny hed lost his head over her lost his head with selfmocking laugh he ran his hands over his face it was easier to plead insanity than to admit hed lost his heart what hed done was fall in love but hed always thought that falling in love meant youd stumbled slipped that you hadnt looked for the rocks in the road or noticed the edge of the cliff and hed been right he felt as if hed slipped stumbled and caught himself on one of those rocks then taken a nosedive off the cliff in all likelihood it was going to screw up his book his objectivity and his life he wished to god she would come home that was another problem he admitted hed been on the farm less than three weeks and he already thought of it as home hed been with abby less than three weeks and he already thought of her as his and the boys dylan pushed away from his desk and strode around the room all right so he was crazy about them he wasnt made of stone was he it didnt have to make any difference hed worked too hard to get his life exactly the way he wanted it the only person he was responsible to was himself the only person he had to satisfy was himself the only person who had to approve of him was dylan crosby maybe he wasnt rolling in money but he certainly made enough if he wanted to take off tomorrow for three weeks in the south seas there was no one hed have to clear it with first selfish dylan turned that over in his mind with a shrug what if he were he was entitled hed milked cows until the tune hed gone to college hed studied hard worked hard and had established himself professionally and personally his years as an investigative reporter had been fiendish in their way but hed gotten through them his marriage hadnt exactly been made in heaven but hed done the best he could with it while it had lasted now he was free with no ties no strings he set his own schedules made his own demands just because he liked the farm and was fond of a couple of kids didnt mean he was going to turn his world upside down hed been through one marriage and so had abby theyd be smart not to step back into the ring when was she coming home the minute he heard the engine he was at the window but it wasnt abbys sturdy station wagon that pulled up it was a huge gunmetalgray limo ah fresh air country air frank ohurley bounced out of the limo as though it were act one scene one clears the mind cleanses the soul everybody should breathe it in he did then screwed up his face god save us what is that smell horse manured be my guess maddy stepped out beside him then looked around with quick avid curiosity fiftysecond street or dogpatch it made no difference to her mom did i leave my purse in there right here molly slim and pretty accepted the drivers hand before stepping out she stood on sturdy legs and shaded her eyes against the sun sunlight made wrinkles she wasnt particularly vain but her face was part of her act ah with a look that was half pleased half baffled she stared at the house such a place i can never quite imagine our abby here whered we go wrong frank asked her and got a quick swipe on the shoulder from his youngest daughter cut it out pop abby loves this place dylan came to the door just in time to see chantel ohurley step from the limo onto the sparsely graveled drive it struck him first that abby had the same milliondollar legs as chantel he watched as her skirt flared beautifully around her and she took the drivers hand then flashed a smile designed to turn a man to putty thank you donald her voice was like smoke and seemed to encircle her listeners sensuously if youd just put our bags on the porch that will be all for today very good miss ohurley you do that so well maddy murmured as the driver popped the hood darling i was born to do it then as she laughed and linked her arm through her sisters she spotted dylan well well it might have been a purr but kittens didnt purr when they showed their teeth what have we here must be the writer maddy gave him a brief and thorough summingup be nice maddy remember my image chantel slid her oversize sunglasses down her nose and continued to stare nice had nothing to do with it as the two women paused dylan did some summingup of his own one sister was dressed in baggy slacks and an oversize jacket whose contrasting shades of green and blue should have hurt the eyes instead the pattern was as bright and cheerful as her short mop of strawberryblond hair beside her was the image of cool understated glamour from the long silveryblond mane to the toes of her alligator pumps standing next to them were a small pretty woman of about fifty and a wiry little man making theatrical gestures toward the barn maddy was the first to step forward hello were abbys family she walked up the steps with the quick swinging gait of a born optimist her sister followed with the slow alluring moves of a born siren dylan crosby chantel extended the tips of her fingers weve met miss ohurley if hed ever seen a woman whod have liked to ram a knife into himand one who would have known precisely the right spot to aim forit was this one dylan turned to maddy youre the writer she sent her sister an amused knowing glance abby told us youd be here these are our parents frank and molly ohurley frank stuck his hand out and shook with fast friendly exuberance molly and frank his wife said with a smile dylan could see where abby had inherited her looks always worried about billing frank pecked his wifes cheek before turning back to dylan wheres my girl abby had to run some errands dylan was a man who believed in first impressions and he was immediately drawn to the small spry man with the big grin and the welltimbred voice errands frank slipped an arm around his wife and gave her a squeeze just like our abby and totally unlike the rest of us hello molly didnt offer her hand but smiled at dylan you must be the writer abby told us shed decided to authorize the book thats right she didnt have to say any more to convey her disapproval yet dylan felt it was directed at the project rather than himself it wasnt everyone who could make such a fine distinction felt so easily i dont know exactly when shell be back but no problem frank gave him a companionable pat on the arm then strode past him into the house the move was so smooth so natural that it took dylan a minute to realize frank had ignored the pile of luggage maddy hauled up two bags and sent dylan a wink pretty sharp isnt he come on chantel just like old times chantel cast a long considering look at the pile paused then chose one small leather tote takes after her father molly commented as she leaned over to grasp the handle of a suitcase ill take care of it dylan began but molly laughed and hefted the bag herself ive been lugging trunks since i could stand dont worry about me youll have your hands full with the rest because i can promise you they wont be back for them put on some coffee frank she called out then walked up the staircase without a backward glance with a shrug dylan stacked and lifted the remaining bags and followed it looked as if it might be an interesting afternoon abby decided there was little purpose in nursing her temper perhaps it was justified perhaps in its way it was satisfying but it just didnt accomplish anything dylan didnt trust her if she was honest she had to admit he had no real reason to while she could rationalize that she hadnt lied to him neither had she been completely honest dylan crosby was a man who required the unvarnished truth hed hurt her his doubts and derision had hurt her she had wanted to believe theyd reached some point of understanding shed hoped theyd come far enough in their relationship for him to accept her for who and what she was she had wanted too much the trouble was abby longed for more she wanted his trust though she hadnt been able to give her own she wanted his support though she was afraid to offer hers she wanted his love most of all yet she wouldnt admit her own feelings for him temper had given her a smug sense of selfsatisfaction but only temporarily it had also left her unsettled and unhappy maybe the time had come for her to put her feelings on the line and give dylan what seemed most important to him complete honesty if she opened up and he still walked away from her she could have no regrets when abby pulled up in the drive she had decided to tell dylan everythingthe mistakes the regrets the compromises without faith love was just another word she would put her life in his hands and believe in him the minute she opened the front door her nerve started to weaken she had to talk to him and talk to him quickly before she pulled back then she saw him coming from the direction of the kitchen abby stood where she was and waited for her resolve to harden dylan she shifted her bag from hand to hand we need to talk yeah hed made his own decisions that morning it might have to wait a little while it cant i abby caught a movement out of the corner of her eye and turned toward the stairs maddy stood there barefoot her hands deep in the pockets of baggy slacks she grinned as though she knew every secret in the world and was ready to tell them maddy before the name was fully formed abby rushed toward the staircase and threw herself into her sisters arms first came laughter then they both began to talk at once somehow in the torrent of words they both managed to ask and answer a half a dozen questions you two always stepped on each others lines from the top of the staircase chantel looked down dylan noted that she looked just as cool just as elegant as she had when shed stepped from the limo then with a whoop she was clattering down the stairs at a dangerous speed to launch herself at her sisters both of you abby had an arm around each sister holding them dose one smelled free easy fresh the other dark and tempting how did you manage it i backed out of the play maddy said with a laugh she hadnt realized until it was done how badly shed needed to move on my understudy is building a shrine to me we shot the final scenes of the movie last week chantel gave a lazy shrug i left my leading man desolate then she stepped back taking abbys face in her hand she turned it one way then the other her eyes narrowed incredible she muttered not a bit of makeup thats why i hate you abby hugged them both again oh god im so glad to see you there was a hint only a hint of desperation in her voice it was enough over abbys head chantel aimed a long hard look at dylan her eyes were blue a very dark very intense blue she knew how to use them sensitive to changes in mood maddy felt the tension the best way to deal with it in her opinion was to slide over it i hate to use old lines she said easily but you aint seen nothin yet come into the kitchen how about some coffee dylan her look was so friendly that he wondered if he imagined the message beneath her eyes werent the vivid blue of chantels or the deep green of abbys they were a warm shade of brandy uniquely her own but the challenge was there acknowledging it he walked in to the kitchen with them mom pop stunned abby stared at her parents who were sitting cozily at the breakfast bar its about time you got home girl frank swiveled in his chair and grinned at her his arms opened in the wide inviting gesture that had always warmed her lets have a kiss what are you doing here she had an arm around each parent drawing in the old familiar scentspeppermint and chanel her father couldnt get through a day without peppermints and her mother would go without shoes before she denied herself her perfume there isnt a theater within twenty miles vacation her father have her another smacking kiss it was either here or paris molly gave a quick nonetoosubtle snort then picked up her coffee where are the boys in school theyll be home a bit after three all day stuck with books frank shook his head its a tragedy just keep that to yourself abby warned theyll be too glad to agree with you whats this frank reached up and brushed a tear from her lashes abbys entitled to get emotional maddy went to the stove to pour more coffee shes wondering how shes going to feed four extra people for three days abby is there a trick to this stove i cant get the burner going push the knob in before you turn it can you really stay she looked at her mother first because she knew who really called the shots were between engagements molly told her dryly then patted her arm if you can put up with us well stay until the end of the week of course i can put up with you she hugged molly again hardly able to believe her family was in one place at one time i only wish trace were here frank made a hissing sound that boy no sense of responsibility no ambition cant think how i could raise a son to be so feckless its a mystery chanters dry voice was lost on him hes got talent frank slammed his fist on the counter taught him everything i knew he hasnt walked through a stage door in ten years did i mention that chris was in his school christmas play abby knew how to soothe and distract he played a sheep frank positively preened a mans got to start somewhere nice touch abby maddy murmured years of practice she saw dylan standing slightly off to the side observing and absorbingsomething he did well she wished she could tell if the smile on his face was one of amusement or disdain coffee she asked he only nodded dylan my boy frank perked up as he remembered his audience come sit down here let me tell you about the time we played radio city chantel didnt bother to disguise a moan and frank glared at her have some respect frank dylan may not be interested in show business frank looked at his wife as if shed grown horns theres not a person alive who isnt interested in show business he added two heaping spoonfuls of sugar to his coffee hesitated briefly then added a third besides the mans a writer that means he likes a story storys right chantel gave her father a loud kiss on the cheek tall story frank raised his chin sit down dylan ignore the family i could teach them a time step but i never could teach them manners frank told his story interrupted by asides from all three of his daughters and the occasional chuckle from his wife dylan would never be sure whether it was fact or fiction but he was certain that frank ohurley believed every word abby relaxed dylan could all but feel the tension that had held her stiff when shed first come in drain out of her she seemed to meld with the odd mix of people who were her family though she was totally unlike any of them she fit in like a piece of a jumbled jigsaw puzzle he enjoyed them they were loud talking over and against each other laughing at one another each one had a habit of grabbing the spotlight and clinging a moment before passing it on their stories were exaggerated and dramatic yet some of them though ridiculous had the ring of truth instinctively he found himself making mental notes the ohurleys singly and as a group might make a hell of a book not his style dylan reminded himself it wasnt his style at all of course but he continued to observe when the boys came home it was chaos to a casual observer it might have seemed as though the ohurleys were competing for the attention of a new audience dylan saw something deeper their innate love of confusion and each other ben and chris were part of abby and therefore part of themselves there were hugs exclamations quizzes and presents some children might have been overwhelmed by all the sudden attention dylan watched as ben and chris simply lapped it up as if it were their due from what hed gathered dylan was certain the boys didnt see their grandparents or their aunts often but he sensed none of the awkward shyness that might have been expected at one point chris climbed up onto dylans lap as though it were his natural place and began bombarding his grandfather with stories of his day at school without thinking dylan hooked an arm around the boys waist to secure him they sat that way for nearly an hour with the fire crackling in the hearth the scent of coffee lingering and the echo of voices bouncing off the kitchen walls the minute abby started dinner preparations frank was up taking both of his grandsons by the hand he demanded that they take him upstairs and show him some of their more fascinating toys maddy watched them go with a shake of her head as quick on his feet as ever the nice thing about your father is that he doesnt consider cooking womens work any more than he considers changing a tire mens work molly leaned back in her stool with a smile he considers them both work and avoids them at all costs what can i do dear nothing this is going to be pretty simple tonight im afraid meat loaf chantel walked over and slipped onto a stool in such a way that her skirt flared and settled around her legs i guess you want me to peel potatoes or something abby glanced down at her sisters beautifully manicured hands there was a sunburst of diamonds and sapphires on one finger and a slim gold watch with an amber face on her wrist abby smiled hefted a bag of potatoes out of the pantry and dropped it on the counter a dozen ought to do it with a sigh chantel took the paring knife i suppose i should learn to keep my mouth shut youve always been so literalminded though it would have amused him to watch one of hollywoods reigning princesses skin potatoes dylan rose ill feed the stock but the boys abby began special circumstances dylan grabbed his jacket off the hook ill give you a hand maddy was up and bouncing toward the door id rather play with the horses than peel potatoes when the first blast of cool air hit her face she tossed her head back i hope you know your way around the barn i dont i can manage sigmund bounded around the side of the house and leaped toward her tongue lolling maddy evaded him with the ease of a woman used to dodging foot traffic on crowded sidewalks she bent down and rubbed his fur vigorously with both hands until he settled down i dont know what to make of you dylan still leaning over the dog she turned her head to look up at him id almost decided not to like you until i saw you with the boys generally i think kids are the best judge of people and they like you when he said nothing she straightened and looked directly at him the main reason i came down to see abby was because of you dylan decided the stock could wait and drew out a cigarette i dont think i follow you when i talked to abby a week or so ago she sounded unnerved it takes a lot to unnerve abby maddy dipped her hands into her pockets but her candid friendly gaze remained on his shes been through a lot i wasnt always around chantel wasnt always around it wasnt possible to give her support when it turned out she needed it most thats why were here now he let out a long stream of smoke it seems to me that abby can take care of herself absolutely she dragged a hand through her hair but the wind tossed it back again look at this place she loves it and whether shes told you or not shes done it all on her own all i dont know what shes told you or might tell you about chuck rockwell but everything here is abbys you didnt like him for an actress im often transparent no i didnt like him and there are really very few people i can say that about but my feelings are my own and abbys are hers i wont see her slapped down again though she smiled a little but her smile took nothing away from her firm tone thing is id expected to stand between you and abby with my fists raised i dont think thats going to be necessary you dont know me i think abby does she said simply if she cares for you theres a reason i guess thats enough she linked her arm through his as though shed been doing so for years lets feed the horses dinner was a babble of conversation the food might have been simple but it was consumed enthusiastically down to the last crumb when it came time to deal with the dishes frank made his escape with his banjo because he was entertaining the children abby said nothing and went about the task herself it was reward enough to hear her fathers voice over the sound of clattering china and silverware let me do that mom youre on vacation do you know the last time i washed dishes molly stacked plates in the quick expert style that demonstrated her onagain offagain career as a waitress god i dont i used to think it was relaxing maddy wrinkled her nose and grabbed a few glasses i wish youd come to my apartment and relax come on chantel grab that platter i peeled the potatoes she looked critically at her hands unless you have surgical gloves im not putting these in dishwater vain maddy grumbled as she stacked more dishes always vain its only vanity if you havent a right to it chantel smiled and slid off the stool i think ill give pop a hand dylan began to stack plates in the dishwasher i imagine youve done enough housework for one day he said to abby why dont you go sit with your father one look was enough to remind her of the harsh words hed spoken that morning wanting to avoid a scene in front of her family abby backed off it looks as though you have things under control there was the sound of threepart harmony from the living room frankll be in heaven molly commented hes got his girls singing with him again go ahead maddy were nearly done here maddy needed no urging to slip out of the kitchen and into the spotlight within seconds the voices were joined by another frank picked up the beat with the banjo and went into the next number molly began to hum as she wiped off a counter guess im sentimental she said but it does my soul good to hear them youve quite a family mrs ohurley oh lord dont call me that call me that and you remind me im too damn old to be running around the country and smearing on greasepaint molly just plain molly dylan closed the door of the dishwasher and looked at her really looked she was lovely with soft small features and a full youthful mouth the lines made no difference that he could see no difference at an i wouldnt say just plain molly she laughed a full robust sound that contrasted with her height and build oh youre a smart one you are and youve a way with words i read your last book the one about that actress on the train she laid the dishcloth over the spigot and there was an and in there though he wasnt certain it would be complimentary youre a hard man the kind who sees things that would probably be better left alone but youre fair when she turned and looked at him again really looked he saw that her eyes were like abbys deep and vulnerable be fair with my girl dylan thats all i want shes strong sometimes it scares me just how strong when shes hurt she doesnt ask for help but binds her wounds herself i dont want her to have to bind anymore i didnt come here to hurt her but you may unintentionally hurt her in the end she sighed a little her children were grown theyd started taking steps without her help years before can you sing she asked him abruptly off balance he looked at her a moment then laughed no then its time you learned she took him by the arm and led him out to join the others it was after midnight before the house settled down abby thought maddy and chantel might still be talking and laughing in the room they were sharing her parents would be asleep as comfortable in the strange bed as they had been in hundreds of other strange beds she was restless too restless to sleep too restless to join her sisters instead she slipped a coat over her robe and went out to the barn the foal that had pleased maddy so much was asleep curled contentedly in the hay with her mother guarding him gladys was awake perhaps too close to her own time to rest abby stroked her hoping to soothe both herself and the mare you need some sleep her fingers tightened in the mares mane then slowly relaxed before she turned to dylan i didnt hear you come in i thought everyone was in bed you should be you look tired he came closer almost afraid to get close enough to touch her i saw you leave i was standing at the window just checking on gladys abby rested her cheek against the mares the mornings argument seemed so far away it seemed like years since shed lain beside him and felt excitement build with my family here its going to be a little difficult for us to work together for the next couple of days ive got enough to work on my own for a while abby he wanted her wanted to gather her close and pretend things were every bit as simple as sitting around the living room and singing he wanted to offer her the kind of unconditional support her family did yet there seemed to be a wall between them id like to talk to you about this morning shed known he would for a moment she continued to stroke gladys all right would you like to go inside no he caught her as she turned caught her before he could give himself the chance to remember he should keep a certain distance i want you alone damn it abby i want some answers youre driving me crazy i wish i could give you the ones you want she took a deep breath and put her hands on his arms both to comfort and to emphasize her point dylan i decided as i was driving back here today to tell you everything to be completely open with you i may not give you the answers you want but im going to trust you with the truth that was all he wanted from her or so he told himself he watched her in the dim slanting light why she could have evaded him and perhaps she should have but honesty had to begin somewhere because im in love with you he didnt step back but his hands slid slowly away from her until he was no longer touching her abby felt a little tingle of pain i told you it might not be the answer you wanted wait a minute wait a minute he repeated as she turned away even through his own shock hed seen the flicker of hurt in her eyes you cant expect to say something like that and not leave me a little stunned when she turned toward him he didnt reach out to her because she terrified him i dont know what to say to you you dont have to say anything her words were calm and low and there was a touch of amusement in her eyes now im responsible for my own feelings dylan thats something i learned a long time ago i answered your question honestly because i decided that avoiding this and the rest of your questions will only put me into a hole i may never get out of about this morning the hell with this morning he caught her face in his hands and stared at her as though he were seeing her for the first time i dont know what to do about you i sure as hell dont know what to do for you it would have been so easy just to step forward into his arms to ask to be held she knew he wouldnt refuse abby shook her head and kept her arms at her sides thats a problem i cant help you with she was closer now but he didnt even realize that hed closed the distance between them i dont want to get tangled up in a relationship i had one marriage hit the skids i have a career that requires me to be selfish to begin with im not asking you for a relationship dylan im not asking you for anything at all thats the trouble damn it if you asked i could tell you to forget it or so he hoped if you asked i could give you two dozen reasons why it would never work she looked at him her eyes warm and calm he swore at her then at himself before he drew her into his arms i want you there doesnt seem to be anything i can do about it theres nothing you have to do shut up he muttered then he closed his mouth over hers it was as if the day had never happened the heat the passion the glow were just as strong as theyd been before she softened against him as if she knew he needed her to be soft her lips were avid and hungry on his meeting every demand in the dim light of the barn he could see her eyes flutter closed then open to watch him as their mouths met again and again the scent of animals and hay and leather was strong but as she entwined her arms around him he could only smell the fresh light hint of soap on her skin i dont want to talk he skimmed his lips over her cheek before he drew her back i dont really want to think no she linked her fingers with his not tonight ill give you all the answers dylan i promise he nodded but wondered if she already had chapter eleven things got a little crazy when gladys went into labor abby was walking through her morning routine her father strolling along beside her the ground was hard again and just beginning to show signs of new life her fathers shoes hit the path in their own cheerful rhythm she never tired of listening to him spin his stories of life on the road even though shed been there herself for more than half her life abby was able to suspend reality and believe it was all glamour and excitement and opening nights i tell you abby its a great life city after city town after town what a way to see the world he never mentioned the backalley entrances the smokeand liquorfilled rooms or the disinterested crowds there were no such things in frank ohurleys world abby was grateful for it vegas what a place the neon flashing the slot machines clinking people waltzing around in evening clothes at am ah id give a lot to play vegas again you will pop maybe not on the strip maybe not with his name several feet high on a marquee but hed play vegas again just as hed play in dozens of other towns a man like frank ohurley couldnt stop performing any more than he could stop breathing and survive in the blood hed often said to her and in the blood it was and it was because the ohurley blood was thick that he was up before eight oclock and walking in a farmyard with his daughter when be usually considered noon a barely civilized hour knowing that only made abby love him more this place he stopped but was careful not to breathe too deeply it suits you i guess must take after your grandma never would leave that farm in ireland he had a moments pang for early memories that were more dreams than memories you happy abby she thought about the question because she sensed the answer was important the farm brought her contentment and personal satisfaction the children abby smiled as she remembered their complaints at being sent off to school when the excitement was at home the children gave her roots and pride and the kind of love she could never describe and dylan he brought her passion and fire and serenity all at once he made life complete even though she knew it was only temporary it seemed to be enough im happier now that ive been in a long long time that was true enough i like what ive done here its important to me it was beyond frank how anyone could be happy staying rooted to one spot but hed always wanted his children to have what they wanted most it didnt matter what it was as long as they had it this writer he felt his way along here it was untested ground well abby a body would have to be blind not to see the way you look at him im in love with him strange how easily the words came out now without a pang of regret without a twinge of fear i see he let out the whistling sound through his teeth should i talk with him for a moment she went blank then the laughter came oh no pop no you dont have to talk to him she stopped and kissed her fathers smoothly shaven cheek i love you and so you should he pinched her chin now i can admit that your mother and i are concerned about you living alone out here and trying to run things all on your own he grinned and tugged on her hair fact is your mother claims theres not a reason in the world to worry about you but i worry just the same you dont have to the boys and i have a good life the life we want thats easy to say but a father considers worrying over his daughters a serious matter chantel well she gave me enough anxiety as a teenager so i figure were past that stage now and maddy can talk her way in and out of anything under the sun like her pop he grinned like her pop but youve been a different matter never a minutes trouble with you as a child and then he let his words trail off it wasnt fair or right to tell her now about the hours hed spend agonizing over what had happened in her life the heartbreaks the struggles though he was a caring man he hadnt grieved for his soninlaw he had only prayed for his daughters peace of mind but now that i know youre going to be settling down with a man a good solid man if i dont miss my mark i can rest easy the earlymorning breeze whispered through her hair it was warm almost balmy what a difference a few weeks could make im not settling down with dylan pop its not like that but you just said i know what i said she kicked a small stone out of her path and wished other obstacles could be dealt with as easily he wont stay pop this isnt the life for him and i cant go because this is the life for me ive never heard such a barrel of nonsense she opened the barn door and though it hadnt been his intention to actually go in he was compelled to follow hed led his family over the country crisscrossing overlapping circling shouldnt he be able to lead his abby where she already wanted to go people in love make certain adjustments not sacrifices abby knew her father didnt believe in sacrifices compromises and such abby you didnt have that with the other he wouldnt say chucks name his throat simply closed over it thats because it takes two people to compromise if ones doing all the adjusting its like a rubber band its either going to fly away or break she studied him he wasnt a handsome man but he was an engaging one with his small agile build and animated face often he played the clown because bringing laughter was what he felt hed been fashioned for but he was no fool youre very wise pop abby kissed him again and remembered all the times hed been right there when shed stumbled dylans nothing like chuck and im beginning to realize that im nothing like the woman who married that excitingly irresponsible man just how does this man feel about you i dont know she hit the lights i guess i really dont want to because it would make the situation harder one way or the other now dont worry she put both hands on his spindly shoulders i told you i was happy here just as i am im not looking for a man to take care of me pop i did that once before and a poor job he did of it too she had to laugh and kiss him again when frank ohurley lost his temper it was quite a scene he wasnt made to take care of me pop and i just couldnt take care of him you know very well thats not what marriage is about its a team like you and mom those two young boys need a man around i know that that was where the guilt ultimately came from i cant give them everything he cut himself off because he heard it in her voice the faint regret the obvious guilt he took her hands and squeezed youve done a damn fine job with them anyone says different they have to take on frank ohurley she laughed remembering a few brawls he might be small but her father enjoyed a tussle why dont you help me feed the horses instead he drew back a little naturally cautious well i dont know about that abby girl im a man of the city come on now youll want to see the foal she started to walk to the first stall when instinct had her looking into gladyss with quick moves abby was swinging open the stall door and going to the laboring horse whats the matter whats the matter her father was practically skipping behind her is it sick contagious abby had to laugh even as she checked the mare having babies isnt a communicable disease pop go into the kitchen look in my book and call the vet he let loose a string of irish and american curses you need water hot water just call the vet pop and dont worry im an old hand at this he scurried off and didnt come back abby hadnt expected him to he did send dylan though to abbys surprise chantel poked her head in the stall behind him should we get ready to pass out cigars soon enough did pop call the vet i did dylan took his place beside her frank ran into the kitchen demanding boiling water i think your mothers calming him down hows gladys doing pretty good she glanced up at her sister chantel was as cool and polished as ever in buffcolored slacks and a silk blouse youre up early chantel just shrugged not bothering to mention that when your life revolved around am calls you got in the habit of rising early i couldnt miss all the excitement then because her heart went out to the mare female to female she crouched down anything i can do its nearly done abby announced and so she and dylan delivered their second foal working together in a kind of unstated partnership that had chanters eyes narrowing perhaps shed misjudged him she thought but she wasnt accustomed to misjudging a man not any longer whats going on rumpled from a nights sleep and dressed in overalls that swamped her maddy staggered in im supposed to bring a message to the front it seems the vets on call his service is tracking him down but it might be a while she yawned hugely pops got water boiling on every burner if the vet doesnt show up soon hes threatening to call the paramedics you cant even get a cup of coffee in there were getting ready to knit four little pink bootees chantel told her she brushed off the knees of her slacks as she rose would you look at that maddy focused her sleepbleared eyes on the foal hey wait dont anybody move ive got to go get my camera the guys in dance class wont believe it she was off and running well now that the excitements over i think ill just toddle inside and see if i can get pop to give up some of his boiling water im dying for coffee chantel sauntered off trailing a tantalizing scent behind her your familys something dylan murmured yeah abby wiped sweat from her face with her shirtsleeve i know when maddy suggested riding abby rearranged her schedule and saddled judd dylan was working and her parents werent interested so it would be the three of them as it so often had been in the past she watched maddy adjust a stirrup with breezy confidence before she turned to chantel need some help oh i think i can manage chantel fastened the cinch on the little mare i didnt think you rode at all cautious abby rechecked the saddle but matilda here is gentle chantel adjusted the collar of her blouse well just poke along once outside maddy swung into the saddle with athletic ease chantel hesitated fumbled and finally managed to mount the mare abby decided to keep judd to a walk beside her sister we can go up this road it runs along the east side of the property where well be planting hay in a couple of weeks planting hay chantels mare stood soberly while she looked lazily around how rural of you maddy chuckled okay miss hollywood lets ride chantel shifted down in the saddle better miss new york lets race as abbys mouth dropped open chantel pressed her heels to the mares sides and lunged forward maddy started to shout a warning then realized it wasnt necessary chantel was laughing and riding beautifully always full of surprises maddy said to abby abby skimmed her own heels over judd what are we waiting for for more than half a mile she rode free easily matching maddys pace it brought memories of childhood chantel had always been the leader then as well even with the grueling schedules of trains and buses and onenight stands theyd managed to fight and play like most children even prior to birth theyd had each other nothing had changed that they pulled up breathless and laughing where chantel waited at the top of the crest whered you learn to ride like that maddy demanded chantel simply fluffed her hair darling just because you gulp vitamins and jog ten miles a day doesnt mean youre the only ohurley with any athletic ability when maddy snorted she grinned the hollywood actress was gone and chantel was just a woman enjoying a joke ive just come off a western wyoming circa she arched her back and rolled her eyes i swear i spent more time in the saddle than any cattle rustler lost a half inch off my hips abby controlled judd as he danced sideways its not all flashy premieres and lunches at ma maison is it no then she tossed her hair back and shrugged but you do what you do best it youre smart isnt that what youre doing abby glanced around the land shed fought so hard to keep raising children and planting hay yes i suppose its what i do best i cant say i envy you but i do admire you they began to walk the horses chantel in the middle abby to the left and maddy to the right in the same position theyd used before more audiences than they could have counted maddy adjusted the stride of her horse to match her sisters do you remember that time in that little place just outside memphis the place where all the customers drank straight bourbon and looked as though they could chew raw meat abby shook her hair back and looked at the sky god its hard to believe we lived through that one lived through it chantel repeated buffing her nails on her suede jacket darling we were a smash yeah there were about six bottles smashed that night as i recall remembering made maddy chuckle on opening night i pretend im about to play in mitzies place outside memphis i tell myself whatever happens cant be as bad what are you going to do when you get back abby asked her are you really leaving suzannas park it looks like itll have a long run on broadway over a year of dancing the same routines saying the same words maddy clicked to her horse as he took an interest in the shrubbery on the side of the road i wanted something new and as it turned out theres a play in the works now if they find an angel we could be in rehearsals in a couple months im a stripper a what chantel and abby said in unison a stripper you know bump grind take it off the characters wonderful a lady of free spirit and morals who meets the guy of her dreams and pretends shes a librarian and no i wont actually bare my full talent on stage we want to bring in the family crowd as well what about you chantel taking a break abby asked who could stand it im going to start shooting a miniseries in about ten days did you read strangers god yes it was wonderful i thought maddys words trailed off and her eyes widened youre going to play hailey oh chantel what a wonderful part abby did you read it no i dont get a lot of time to read anymore it was said simply without malice its all about this maddy chantel cut her off as they rode beside a big spreading elm lets not give her the whole story line you can watch it in the comfort of your own home in a few months abby it no longer surprised her that she could indeed snuggle on the living room sofa and watch her sister on television somehow i never thought youd do tv again abby commented neither did i but the script was too good anyway it might be interesting to go back she rarely admitted she liked challenges the image of glamour and ease had been too hardwon i havent worked the small screen since my sensuousshampoo and brighterthanwhitetoothpaste ads they were far enough away from the house now and abby seemed relaxed chantel and maddy exchanged a glance agreement needed no words what about you abby chantel tugged on the reins and skirted around easily to put abby in the middle whats the story with you and crosby the story she said simply is what dylan came here to write i have to tell it at least parts of it does feeling the way you do about him make it easier abby absorbed maddys question she didnt have to tell either of her sisters that she was in love they could feel it almost as strongly as she did in some ways id planned to well i guess id planned to restructure the facts that doesnt work with dylan because he knows just by looking at me whether or not im being upfront with him so i have to tell him the truth chantel felt her temper start to rise have you told him what a bitch janice rockwell is how she treated you and the boys after chuck died thats not really relevant is it well i for one would like to read it in black and white maddy muttered what she did was criminal what she did was perfectly within the law abby corrected just because it wasnt right doesnt mean it wasnt legal anyway i think im better off the way things turned out made me shape up i think he should know it all chantel insisted all the details all the angles race drivers wealthy mother leaves widow and children impoverished oh chantel it wasnt as bad as that we were hardly begging for pennies it was as bad as that she corrected abby if youre going to trust him with some you should trust him with everything shes right maddy was silent a moment the sun was warm and bright the scent of new grass pungent but she could sense the turmoil within her sister i thought the whole idea was a mistake but now that its being done it should be done properly look i know there were plenty of things you didnt tell us you didnt have to dont you think youd feel better feel freer if you finally got it all out im not thinking of me ive learned to deal with it im thinking of the boys do you think they dont know chantel said quietly no she looked down at her hands voicing what shed been avoiding for the longest time they know not the details but theyve sensed the mood what they dont know now theyll find out sooner or later i just want dylan to write it with enough compassion so when theyre old enough they can accept it all does he have any chantel asked her any what compassion yes abby smiled then relaxing again a surprisingly large amount that was something chantel intended to test for herself how does he feel about you he cares in unspoken agreement they turned the horses back i think he cares more than he ever bargained for not only about me but the kids it wont make any difference when hes finished hell leave then you have to make him stay abby smiled at maddy you got all the optimism chantel got all the guile thank you very much only halfamused chantel picked up the pace maddy can just believe strongly enough and things happen you make them happen i just shuffle around the cards ive been dealt until i have the best hand i can manage i cant make dylan stay because if he asked i couldnt go im not eighteen and impulsive anymore i have two children chantel held her head high and let the wind take her hair it was a sensation of absolute freedom she couldnt often allow herself i dont see why you should make him stay in the first place some women put too much emphasis on having a man complete their lives they should be fulfilled in the first placethen a man might be a nice addition spoken like a true heartbreaker maddy put in i dont break hearts chantel smiled slowly i only bruise them a little ill gag any minute maddy said to her horse in any case just because you and i arent ready to settle down doesnt mean that abby isnt entitled to dirty dishes in the sink and someone to take out the garbage an interesting description of a meaningful relationship abby murmured as the only one of the three of us whos ever been married i fed qualified to say that theres a bit more to it than that hold on abby concerned chantel slowed her horse whos talking marriage im not saying you shouldnt have a good time with him enjoy him certainly but you cant seriously be thinking about locking yourself in again another interesting description maddy commented making abby laugh if i thought we had a shot at it and if i could find a foothold for compromise id ask him myself then go for it the sun shot a halo around maddys bright rumpled hair if you love him if hes right for you why anticipate problems chantel gave a quick amused laugh the bulk of this womans experience with men has been limited to socializing with dancers who stand in front of mirrors all day and admire themselves dylans not a dancer maddy pointed out unbruised and the actors you spend time with cant figure out who they really are after a day on the set jaded abby shook her bead and struggled not to laugh i think all of us better stay single amen to that chantel breathed who has time for romance anyway maddy commented between dance classes rehearsals and matinees im too tired for candlelight and roses who needs men darling that depends on whether youre talking about a permanent addition or an occasional escort youre starting to believe your own press abby said as the house came into view why shouldnt i chantel lifted a brow everyone else does with a laugh and a kick of her heels she plunged ahead damned if shes going to beat me again maddy was off like a shot abby took a moment to smile after them before she signaled to judd knowing his long powerful stride would bring her in ahead of her sisters chapter twelve the moonlight was soothing thin white and quiet as it fell over the bed the house though silent almost seemed to ring with the echo of voices and laughter musicthe music her family created wherever they went her mother playing the banjo while her father danced her father playing while all of them sang tomorrow they would be gone but abby thought it would be a long time before those echoes faded completely content but far from sleepy she cradled her head on dylans shoulder and just listened it was silly she supposed to feel as though she was stealing this time with him with her family in the house being with him was like walking on eggshells he must have felt something of it as well now he came to her late at night after the others were asleep and left early at first light they hadnt discussed it hed seemed to have understood that she would feel awkward she was a grown woman a widow the mother of two but she felt entirely too much like a daughter when her parents were under the same roof they might laugh about it later but for now the echoing silence was too lovely he was listening to his own echoes the phone calls hed made while abby had been occupied with her family had added more pieces to the puzzle he didnt like all of them when her family was gone the questions would start again but he already had a number of answers it was more important to him now that she tell him things he was already aware of that she trusted him with secrets he already knew when she did if she did maybe they could put yesterdays behind them and deal with tomorrows are you asleep no he brushed his lips over her hair tonight was the last night for pretenses and he wanted badly to give her whatever she needed i was thinking of your parents ive never met anyone like them im not sure there is anyone like them it pleased her abby let her eyes half close as memories fluttered through her head the only thing that scared me was that your father was really insisting he could teach me to tapdance the thing is pop could teach anyone to dance im living proof she yawned and settled more comfortably against him theyll take the limo to the bus station and travel to chicago for a threeday gig she smiled a little picturing them going over their routine in a cramped motel room chantel wanted to put them on a plane first class they wouldnt hear of it mom said shed managed to get where she was going for fifty years without leaving the ground and saw no reason to start now your mothers a sensible woman i know sort of a contradiction in terms isnt it i think if she ever found herself in suburbia with a lawn and a chainlink fence shed go crazy she found the perfect partner when she hooked up with pop how long have they been together hmmm about thirtyfive years now he was silent for a moment kind of lifts your confidence in the institution i think one of the reasons i married so quickly was that mom and pop made it seem so easy for them it really is im going to miss them he heard the wistfulness in her voice and drew her closer never a dull moment i thought you were going to lose a couple of lamps when frank decided to teach the boys how to juggle abby turned her face into his shoulder as she laughed there wont be an apple worth eating until ben gets it out of his system better than having him throw them at chris every time she lifted her head and though she was still smiling her eyes were serious as she looked down at him im glad you were here to meet them someday you might be traveling through some small halfforgotten town and see their names on a marquee youll remember me in a habit be knew would be hard to break he combed his fingers through her hair do you think ill need a marquee it wouldnt hurt lowering her mouth she let it linger on his warm and sweet id tike to think youd remember this she brushed her hand through his hair then skimmed her lips over his temple and that ive a good memory abby he took her wrists the pulses in them were just beginning to quicken a very good memory still holding her he rolled over pinning her body with his there it was instantly that splinter of excitement that calming feeling of rightness with his lips he found hers he didnt release her hands not yet somehow he knew if she touched him then hed explode go mad take frantically what he wanted to savor they had all night they had years if he believed hard enough they had forever so he held himself a prisoner as much as he held her letting his lips soothe arouse and entice he sucked at her tongue drawing it deep into his mouth teasing it with his own feeling her breath shudder against his mouth he groaned at the sensation at each move her body sank into the mattress strong enough to take pliant enough to give still holding her wrists he skimmed down the long line of her throat there was pulse hammering a flavor tempting he could have spent hours exploring each tiny spot where her blood pulsed close to the surface he felt at home her body offered him both peace and rest passion and excitement he had only to take what he needed most she loved him it was a wild terrifying thought yet when he released her wrists her arms wrapped around his so naturally hands soothing and tormenting all at once she asked for nothing and by doing so asked for more than hed thought he could ever give again he was so gentle abby wondered if shed ever get used to the quiet tenderness beneath the fire his hands molded caressed at times his fingers dug unheedingly into her flesh but there was always such underlying care such overlying sweetness whenever she heard his breath grow uneven she was amazed she reveled in feeling his muscles quiver and tense beneath her exploring hands it was for her from her with her never before not even in her dreams had there been a man with such a compelling need for her yet she wondered if he knew even as they took each other deep and fast feeling the blood heat the surface of their skin she wondered if he knew what that beyond wanting her beyond desiring her he needed her in his life unless he did their relationship would end when he had his answers and shed already promised to give them to him dylan the sudden stark realization ran through her that he was slipping through her fingers just when shed learned to grab hold she had no tricks no wiles knew no secret ways to keep a man and bind him to her she could only give him what was in her heart and hope it was enough for both of them he heard his name come softly from her he felt the sigh run deep inside her because he felt she needed it he brought his lips back to hers and let her take what she wanted slowly he slipped inside her cushioning her gasp with his mouth i want to watch you climb abby the flickers of passion of pleasure of wonder on her face aroused him more than hed ever imagined possible hed thought he wasnt the sort of man to give but with her he was driven to for years hed taken sometimes carelessly often selfishly it was never like that with abby it left him shaken it left him wondering between packing lastminute details and saturdaymorning cartoons everyone in the house was occupied chantel bided her time when dylan went to help the boys tend the stock she waited a few moments then slipped out to join them it was warm for march by east coast standards but she shivered inside her jacket and decided shed be glad to get back to southern california before she went she had something to do most of the horses were in the paddock chantel wandered over to lean on the fence hed come out sooner or later she could wait dylan let out the two geldings and saw her hed known for days that she had something to say to him it appeared the time was now he released the horses and carefully closed the gate behind them in silence he moved over and joined her at the fence she took the cigarette he offered she rarely smoked it all had to do with mood she inhaled deeply then let out a long stream of smoke watching the horses as she spoke i havent decided if i like you its not really important abbys feelings are dylan decided she couldnt know how closely her words echoed maddys it was just part of the bond together they watched as eves foal began to nurse the mare steadied herself against the pull and tug then stood patiently i can tell you i didnt like you when you interviewed me about millicent driscoll for your last book some of it had to do with that period of my life and the rest was your attitude i found you abrasive and unsympathetic so i wasnt as open with you as i might have been if i had been maybe youd have found a little more room for compassion in your story but abbys my sister for the first time she turned to look at him even in the strong unrelenting sunlight her face was stunning the classic oval shape the sweep of cheekbone the flawless skin a man could look at that face and forget there was anything else to the woman but it was her eyes that held his interest he imagined theyd ruthlessly flayed a great many men i think you care about abby but im not sure if youre too tough to let that matter i want to tell you about chuck rockwell in a way i dont think abby can she drew in more smoke appreciating its rough taste this is offtherecord dylan if abby consents to this you can use anything i say if she doesnt youre out of luck agreed agreed tell me when chuck came into the club that first night he was utterly infatuated with abby maybe for a little white he was even in love with her i dont know the kind of women hed been running with before but i can imagine abby was even with the tacky costume and greasepaint untouched gullibles a hard word unless you understand the person and abby was and still is gullible she smiled not the clever iceedged smile she used so often but a simple easy curving of the lips that was as beautiful as it was revealing she believed in love devotion till death us do part she went into marriage with stars in her eyes he could imagine abby then open innocent trusting and rockwell he loved her i think as far as he was capable and for as long as he was capable some people say weakness doesnt make a person bad something flickered in her eyes but was quickly masked i disagree with that chuck was weak emotionally i could make excuses for him knowing that he was raised by an impossibly domineering mother and a workaholic father personally i dont care much for excuses she glanced over waiting for him to comment go on dylan had already researched rockwells upbringing they had trouble almost from the start shed cover it up but its difficult to hide anything from another triplet she went with him to paris london wore beautiful clothes and was offered the sort of lifestyle a lot of women dream of not abby chantel shook her head and her fingers began to drum lightly on the fence rail im not saying she didnt enjoy it at first but abby had always looked for roots the ohurleys have a difficult time sinking them thats why she wanted this place chantel dropped her cigarette on the ground and left it to smolder chuck bought it after a particularly messy affair with a girl too young to know any better then almost as soon as he did he grew bored with it he made it clear to abby that if she wanted to keep the place and maintain it she had to do it herself she told you that no chuck did she sent him an odd selfmocking look he breezed into la and decided it might be interesting to put the moves on his wifes sister charming give me another cigarette while he lit if for her chantel composed herself as it happened he wasnt my type and though my morals are often in doubt i do have standards he did manage to get drunk and tell me all the problems he was having with the little woman at home she was boring chantel blew out a vicious stream of smoke she was too ordinary too middleclass shed dug into this farm and was holding on and he had better things to do with his money if she wanted the damn roof fixed she could deal with it herself if she wanted the plumbing brought up to twentiethcentury standards shed just have to figure out how to manage it on her own he wasnt interested he went on about how she had this wild idea to raise horses he laughed at her chantels jaw stiffened when she realized she was speaking too quickly she deliberately slowed i didnt throw him out because i wanted to hear it all while shed been going through this id been busy carving out my own career too busy you see to pay much attention even though i knew instinctively that things werent right with abby and how much attention had he really paid over the past weeks that thought stung him hed expected her trust and honestyhad demanded itbut all hed given her were questions hed seen her listened to her watched her and hed known in his gut that all the preconceptions hed come with were wrong yet why had she stayed with rockwell and why did he hate himself for still needing to know he drew back why do you think he told you all this he asked his voice unemotional her look was hard it was amazing how quickly her expression could change from cool to frigid without her moving a muscle obviously he thought id be just as amused as he she smiled again and drew more calmly on her cigarette anyway i got rid of him then i called maddy and we came here abby was living in a place that was nearly ready to fall down around her ears chuck wasnt giving her a dime so she was working parttime at places she could take ben along she was glad to see us but she wasnt ready to listen to any advice that led to divorce why dylan touched her for the first time just a hand on her arm but she could feel the intensity of his response why did she stay with him so that was the crux of it chantel realized he cared and that made it difficult to hold her grudge against him i think youll need to get that answer from her but i can tell you this abby has a large capacity for hope and she kept believing that chuck would come around meantime there was the immediate problem of making the house livable we went to richmond and sold her jewelry chuck had been very generous in the first six or eight months of their marriage and it brought in enough to get her going i bought her mink what she didnt mention was that she hadnt been able to afford it at the time she joked later that she saw a picture of me wearing her roof she sold the mink to fix the roof he murmured there were a lot of repairs it amazed me then how stubborn she was about this place but when i see her here now its obvious how right it is for her and the kids after that things settled down a bit she was pregnant with chris i have my own theory on that but its best left alone he looked at her and saw that she understood more than abby would ever have guessed its being left alone maybe i do like you she relaxed a little and tossed the cigarette aside after chris was born things went from bad to worse chuck was blatant about his affairs i dont consider it a point in his credit but i believe he wanted to push abby into a divorce for her own good when she did when she finally did i think he realized just how much he was losing are you saying that abby had filed for divorce thats right she could have raked him over the coalsi certainly would havebut she didnt charge him with adultery and she didnt ask for alimony all she wanted was the farm and some reasonable support for the kids he was involved with lori brewer at the time and they went on quite a binge somewhere along the tine it must have hit him hed compensated for the loss of the thrill of racing with other things hed had a wife whod stuck by him and two wonderful children hed traded for a lifestyle that only led to more misery i know how he felt because he called me a few days before that last race god knows why i was hardly sympathetic he said hed called abby and had asked her to reconsider and shed refused he wanted me to go to bat for him i told him to grow up a couple days later he crashed and she was left feeling guilty because shed planned to divorce him you catch on she tapped a beautifully manicured nail against the rail theres never been any use telling her not to feel that way or not to let herself be punished dylan was having problems enough with his own sense of guilt but he focused on chantels last words what do you mean punished did you ever consider how difficult it is to maintain a place like this to raise two childrenim not speaking of emotionally or physically now but financially rockwell had plenty of money rockwell didjanice rockwell did and she still does abby didnt get a penny she shook her head before he could interrupt her every time she thought of it she tasted venom she saw to it that abby didnt get a penny of chucks trust fund not for herself not for the farm not for the children while chantel tasted venom something like acid rose in dylans throat everything hed said to abby from the first day in the rain dreary kitchen to the morning hed watched her drop rubber gloves in her purse came back to him and he realized as his stomach twisted that hed have to live with that how has she managed to hold on to the farm she took out a loan there was a bitter taste in his mouth that had nothing to do with tobacco he hadnt believed in her hadnt trusted his own feelings enough shed been too proud to tell him the things chantel was saying now the hell with her pride he thought suddenly viciously didnt he have a right to know didnt he have a right to checking his thoughts he stared over the paddock and to the hills beyond no it was his pride that was bruised he realized both the mans and the reporters shed known what hed thought of her and shed accepted itand him why are you telling me this because someone has to convince abby that it wasnt her fault that she couldnt have prevented anything that happened i think youre the one to do it i think youre the man if youve got the spine for it to make her happy her chin was up her eyes dark as she tossed the challenge at him dylan found himself smiling youre a hell of a woman i missed that the first time around she smiled back yeah i missed a few things about you too maddy stuck her head out of the back door chantel the limos here im coming she took a step back then gave him one last piercing look one more thing dylan if you hurt abby youre going to have to deal with me fair enough he offered his hand as though she were amused by both of them chantel accepted it i guess ill wish you luck i appreciate it the goodbyes were long tearful and noisy maddy came to dylan and gave him a surprisingly hard and affectionate hug lucky for you i think youre good for her she whispered in his ear then she backed off with a smile welcome to the family dylan each member made the rounds twice before climbing into the limo chris and ben had to be coaxed out once they discovered all the knobs and automatic buttons inside the car after theyd raised and lowered the windows half a dozen times blasting the stereo and the sleek compact tv abby pulled them out so that the rest of her family could climb in serene as an ocean liner the limo cruised up the rutfilled lane im going to drive a limo chris decided on the spot i can wear a neat hat like the one mr donald had and ride in the front seat id rather ride in the back with the tv laughing abby ruffled bens hair theres a lot of ohurley in this boy i dont know about you but i want something long and cold before i tackle the mess in the kitchen can we go play with the foals ben was already off the porch as he asked not too rough abby called after them with a sigh she turned into the house i miss them already quite a family to say the least do you want a soda no restless he wandered around the kitchen chantels words were still eating at him that and everything else hed learned over the last couple of days the fact that hed misjudged abby so completely and so unfairly left him unsure of himself abby this place the farm its very important to you aside from the boys its the most important she filled a glass with ice youre not a pushover he said it so strongly that she turned back to stare at him i dont like to think so why did you let rockwell push you around he demanded why did you let his mother push you out of everything you were entitled to wait a minute shed expected a day even a few hours before she had to plunge into it all again janice had virtually nothing to do with the rest of it certainly nothing to do with chucks biography the hell with the biography he took her by the arms it wasnt until that moment that he realized the book meant nothing had meant nothing for some time abby meant everything he could only see what shed been through what she had done what had been done to her if she wouldnt hate he would hate for her she made certain you didnt get a penny of rockwells trust fund with that money the farm would have been free and clear you were entitled your children were entitled why did you tolerate that i dont know where you got your information she struggled to keep her voice calm there had been bitterness long ago and shed swallowed it she had no desire to taste it again janice had control of the trust chuck would have inherited at thirtyfive but he didnt live that long the money was hers do you really think that would have stood up in court i wasnt interested in going to court chuck left us some money what was left after hed blown most of it away abby nodded keeping her voice even this was an old argument one shed had with herself years before enough so i can be sure that the kids can go to college in the meantime you had to take out a loan just to keep a roof over their beads it humiliated her he couldnt know how it had humiliated her to ask for money how it embarrassed her that dylan was now aware of it dylan that isnt your concern im making it my concern youre my concern do you know how it made me feel to know that youre scrubbing some womans floors she let out an impatient huff of air what difference does it make whose floors i scrub it makes a big difference to me because i dont want youi cant stand thinking of you he swore and tried again you could have been honest with me maybe not at first but later after wed come to mean something to each other to mean what she wanted to ask at least shed been honest about her feelings she took the coffeepot from the stove and calmly moved to the sink to fill it with soapy water i was as honest as i could be if it had only been me i might have told you everything but i had to think of the boys i wouldnt do anything to hurt them i couldnt dylan why should any of this be important she wasnt calm she thought damn it she wasnt calm at all she could feel anger building up and throbbing in her head its only money cant you just let it go its not just about money and no i cant let it go you havent let it go either or youd have been able to tell me about it the frustration bit him the guilt the anger and suddenly he flashed back to the picture of her wrapped like a princess in white fur you sold that damn white mink to fix the roof baffled she shook her head what difference does that make i hardly need a mink to feed the stock you knew what i thought of you dylans anger with himself only made him more unreasonable with her you let me go on thinking that even when i was busy falling in love with you you never really trusted me with all of it doubletalk and evasions abby you never told me you were going to divorce him you never told me you had to struggle just to keep food on the table do you know how it makes me feel to find out all of these things in bits and pieces do you know how it makes me feel her voice rose to match his do you know how it feels to rake it all up to remember what a miserable failure i was thats ridiculous you have to know how foolish that statement is i know how foolish i was abby his tone roughened but his hands grew gentle on her arms he failed you he failed his children and he failed himself he gave her a quick shake desperate to make her see what shed done and how much he respected her for it you were the one who made things work youre the one who built a home and a life stop yelling at my mom rigid and pale ben stood just inside the kitchen doorway already upset abby could do little more than stare at him ben let go of my mom his bottom lip quivered but the look he sent dylan was devastatingly mantoman let go of her and go away we dont want you here disgusted with himself dylan released abby and turned to the boy i wouldnt hurt your mother ben you were i saw you ben abby stepped between them quickly you dont understand we were angry with each other people sometimes yell at each other when theyre angry his jaw was set in a way that reminded abby almost painfully of her father in full temper i dont want him to yell at you im not going to let him hurt you honey i was yelling back she said it softly dropping her hand to stroke his head and he wasnt hurting me his eyes shone with a mixture of humiliation and anger maybe you like him better than me no baby im not a baby his pale face filled with color as he pushed away ill show you abby was still crouched on the floor as the back door slammed behind him oh god slowly abby rose to her feet i didnt handle that very well it was my fault dylan dragged both hands through his hair hed wanted to give to offer whatever he could to all of them instead hed managed to hurt abby and alienate ben in one instant let me go talk to him i dont know maybe i shouldoh my god ben ben stop she was through the back door before dylan could call out he was behind her in an instant then past her ben was mounted on top of thunder and the highstrung stallion was bucking nastily abbys heart lodged in her throat as the boy clung to the horses back and she couldnt even call his name again for a moment she thought hed be able to control the horse and slip off safely but then the stallion reared so violently that for an instant horse and boy were one form raised high against the blue sky behind them then ben was tossed off as carelessly as a fly she beard his cry mingle with the shrill whinnies of the animal slowly as if suspended in time she watched devastated as hooves danced around bens body miraculously missing him she tasted her own fear which rose like rust in her mouth as she raced over the last few feet of ground ben oh ben she wasnt weeping but along with dylan began to check his limp body for signs of life hes okay but hes unconscious i think his arms broken his own hands were shaking if hed only been quicker just a few seconds abby can you pull the car around ben lay quietly his face pale as milk she wanted to cover his body with hers and weep yes glancing up she saw chris standing beside her shaking like a leaf come on chris she took his hand in hers weve got to take ben to the hospital is he okay is he going to be okay hes going to be fine she murmured as she hurried for the car can you drive dylan asked her when she came back i dont know the way with a nod she helped him settle her firstborn on his lap in the front seat teeth set she went slowly down the lane terrified of jolting him with bumps the moment she got onto the highway she pressed the accelerator and stopped thinking when ben stirred she felt tears well up and forced them back the first whimpering sounds he made became fullfledged sobbing as he regained consciousness fully she began to talk to him nonsense anything that came into her head from the back seat chris leaned up and tentatively stroked bens leg not knowing what else to do dylan held the boy tight in his arms and brushed gently at his hair almost there ben he murmured just hang on it hurts yeah i know when the boy turned his face into his shirt dylan held on for the first time in his life he fully understood what it meant to feel someone elses pain abby left the car by the curb outside the emergency room and leaped out to help dylan with ben it seemed to take hours her teeth began to chatter as she gave the admissions clerk insurance information and bens medical history she took deep gulping breaths and tried to compose herself when they wheeled ben away for x rays her little boy had tried in his angry way to prove he was a man now he was hurt and she could only wait beside her dylan stood holding chris in his arms sit down abby its bound to take some time hes just a little boy she couldnt fall apart now ben was going to need her but the tears poured out and ran silently down her cheeks he was so angry hed never have gotten on the stallion if he hadnt been angry abby boys are always breaking bones but his own stomach was knotted and rolling whats going to happen to ben when he saw his mothers tears chriss breath began to hitch hes going to be all right abby pushed both hands over her cheeks to dry them the doctors are taking care of him i think hes going to have a cast dylan ran his hands down chriss short sturdy arm when its dry you can sign your name on it chris sniffed and thought about it i can only print thatll be fine lets sit down abby forced herself not to pace when chris climbed into her lap she had to stop herself from clinging too tightly with each minute that passed the empty feeling inside her increased until she knew she was hollow she was up and dizzy with fear when the doctor came out a nice clean break he said to her recognizing her anxiety he gave her shoulder a quick squeeze hes going to be a sensation at school with that cast hes is there anything else everything from concussion to internal injuries had passed through her mind hes a strong sturdy boy his hand still resting lightly on her shoulder the doctor felt the relief run through her hes a little queasy and hes got some bruises thatll be colorful id like him to rest here for a couple of hours keep an eye on him but i dont think youve got anything to worry about well give you a prescription and a list of dos and donts ive already told him he has to stay off wild horses for a while thank you she pushed her hands against her eyes for a moment a broken bone bones healed she thought with relief can i see him now right this way he looked so small on the white table she fought back a fresh bout of tears as she went over to hold him oh ben you scared me to death i broke my arm he was getting used to the idea as he showed off his cast very impressive she was already forgiven abby could see it in his eyes feel it in the way his fingers curled into hers i guess it hurts huh it feels a little better chris walked over to inspect the clean white plaster dylan said i could put my name on it i guess so ben looked up for the first time at dylan maybe you all could did thunder run away dont worry about thunder abby told him he knows where the grain barrel is he stared down at his own fingers wriggling them tentatively im sorry no she cupped a hand under his chin im sorry you were standing up for me thanks he breathed in her familiar scent when she kissed him he didnt feel so brave now just tired s okay they want you to stay a little while im going to get your medicine why dont you and chris do that abby dylan moved closer to the table id like to talk to ben awhile because she saw embarrassment rather than anger in bens face she nodded an right we wont be long can i have a drink ben asked ill ask the doctor bending over abby kissed both of his cheeks im crazy about you you jerk he grinned a little and stared down at his cast when she glanced over her shoulder from the doorway he was looking at dylan i guess you were pretty mad at me dylan began i guess yelling at someone you care abouts pretty stupid adults can be stupid sometimes ben thought so too but he was cautious maybe how could he approach the boy with the truth he spouted off about honesty demanded it expected it maybe it was time he gave it still cautious dylan rested a hip against the table ive got a problem ben i was hoping you could help me out with it the boy shrugged and began to toy with the edge of the sheet but he listened it was almost dusk when they were home again settling ben down and stacking up piles of books and toys for his pleasure the day had worn him out and he was asleep before hed finished his supper even while abby was tucking him in dylan carried a dozing chris up to his room fell asleep in his pizza he told abby with a half grin ill be right there i can do it why dont you do down and fix us both a drink there were a few bottles of wine left over gifts from chantel abby poured two glasses then dove into the pizza realizing she hadnt eaten since early that morning she was halfway through a piece when the tears started again she closed the cardboard box carefully put her head on the counter and wept it all out dylan found her that way and didnt hesitate he gathered her into his arms held her close and let her cry against him silly now she managed hes all right i just keep seeing him in the air hanging there for that one horrible second i know but he is all right he drew her away from him and began wiping away the tears in fact besides one broken bone hes great abby touched his cheek then kissed it you were great i dont know what id have done without you youd have done fine he drew out a cigarette because he was more than a little shaken himself thats one of the most intimidating things about you intimidating she hadnt been sure she would ever laugh again but it was easy me it isnt easy for a man to get involved with a woman whos totally capable of handling anything that comes along running a house raising children building a farm it isnt easy for a man to believe that there are women who can not only do those things but enjoy them im not following you dylan i dont guess you would he crushed out the cigarette discovering he really didnt want it its all natural for you isnt it its incredible she picked up his glass and handed it to him if i didnt know better id think youd already been dipping in the wine im just beginning to think clearly i am too she picked up her glass and sipped the wine was unfamiliar and wonderfully cool i know you were angry with me this morning abby no wait a minute the last thing you said to me before ben came in turned on all sorts of lights id like to get it out nowall of itand end it he could have told her that it didnt matter anymore not to him but he could see it mattered to her okay youve asked me why i stayed with chuck very simply id stayed because id made a promise eventually when i knew i had to break it and end my marriage i needed to take all the blame somehow it was easier for me to go on believing that id made a mistake id failed in some way her voice was strained abby took another sip of wine then continued but i hadnt made a mistake dylan and i have two beautiful children to prove it you said chuck failed himself and you were right he was capable of so much more but he made the wrong choices its time i admit that i made the right ones ive got to thank you for that ill take your gratitude but its not what im after as it had in the hospital waiting room her stomach worked itself into knots ill never forget what you did what youve done just by being here i have a hard time hearing you put all that in the past dont you want to know what ben and i talked about white you were gone she looked down at her wine i thought youd tell me if you wanted me to know then she smiled up at him besides i could always get it out of ben if you didnt thats one of the things i love about you she looked at him with eyes that were clouded and no longer calm dylan this morning when you were shouting you said that id fallen in love with you you have a problem with that she was holding her glass with both hands now but she didnt look away i wish i knew let me explain it to you the way i explained it to ben he set his glass down then took hers and set it on the counter i told him i was in love with his mother and that i was new at being in love and didnt know quite how to handle it i told him i knew id make some mistakes and that i hoped hed give me a hand he combed a hand through her hair let it rest on her cheek then removed it i told him i knew a little about running a farm but i didnt have much experience at being a husband and none at being a father though i wanted to give it a shot her eyes had grown wide so wide and vulnerable that he wanted to pull her against him and promise to protect her from everything but thered be no rash promises with abby shed had rash promises before and had them broken he thought second chances should be based on faith are you going to give me a chance she couldnt swallow she wasnt even sure how she could still manage to breathe what did ben say smiling he reached out and touched her cheek he thought it sounded like a pretty good idea so do i she flung herself into his arms oh dylan so do i perhaps it was gratitude he felt perhaps it was relief mixed with it was a sense of coming home at last just dont start thinking about buying cows no no cows i promise when she laughed he pressed his mouth to hers there was everythinglove trust hope there were second chances in life and theyd found theirs abby he could spend hours just holding her mmmhmm do you think we could talk your father into dancing at our wedding her eyes laughed at him id hate to see you try to stop him the end
