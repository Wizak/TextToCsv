 miss mehetabels son by thomas bailey aldrich boston and new york houghton mifflin company copyright and i the old tavern at bayleys four corners you will not find greenton or bayleys fourcorners as it is more usually designated on any map of new england that i know of it is not a town it is not even a village it is merely an absurd hotel the almost indescribable place called greenton is at the intersection of four roads in the heart of new hampshire twenty miles from the nearest settlement of note and ten miles from any railway station a good location for a hotel you will say precisely but there has always been a hotel there and for the last dozen years it has been pretty well patronized by one boarder not to trifle with an intelligent public i will state at once that in the early part of this century greenton was a point at which the mailcoach on the great northern route stopped to change horses and allow the passengers to dine people in the county wishing to take the early mail portsmouthward put up overnight at the old tavern famous for its irreproachable larder and soft featherbeds the tavern at that time was kept by jonathan bayley who rivalled his wallet in growing corpulent and in due time passed away at his death the establishment which included a farm fell into the hands of a soninlaw now though bayley left his soninlaw a hotel which sounds handsome he left him no guests for at about the period of the old mans death the old stagecoach died also apoplexy carried off one and steam the other thus by a sudden swerve in the tide of progress the tavern at the corners found itself high and dry like a wreck on a sandbank shortly after this event or maybe contemporaneously there was some attempt to build a town at greenton but it apparently failed if eleven cellars choked up with dйbris and overgrown with burdocks are any indication of failure the farm however was a good farm as things go in new hampshire and tobias sewell the soninlaw could afford to snap his fingers at the travelling public if they came near enough which they never did the hotel remains today pretty much the same as when jonathan bayley handed in his accounts in except that sewell hasfrom time to time sold the furniture of some of the upper chambers to bridal couples in the neighborhood the bar is still open and the parlor door says parlour in tall black letters now and then a passing drover looks in at that lonely barroom where a highshouldered bottle of santa cruz rum ogles with a peculiarly knowing air a shrivelled lemon on a shelf now and then a farmer rides across country to talk crops and stock and take a friendly glass with tobias and now and then a circus caravan with speckled ponies or a menagerie with a soggy elephant halts under the swinging sign on which there is a dim mailcoach with four phantomish horses driven by a portly gentleman whose head has been washed off by the rain other customers there are none except that one regular boarder whom have mentioned if misery makes a man acquainted with strange bedfellows it is equally certain that the profession of surveyor and civil engineer often takes one into undreamedof localities i had never heard of greenton until my duties sent me there and kept me there two weeks in the dreariest season of the year i do not think i would of my own volition have selected greenton for a fortnights sojourn at any time but now the business is over i shall never regret the circumstances that made me the guest of tobias sewell and brought me into intimate relations with miss mehetabels son it was a black october night in the year of grace that discovered me standing in front of the old tavern at the corners though the ten miles ride from khad been depressing especially the last five miles on account of the cold autumnal rain that had set in i felt a pang of regret on hearing the rickety open wagon turn round in the road and roll off in the darkness there were no lights visible anywhere and only for the big shapeless mass of something in front of me which the driver had said was the hotel i should have fancied that i had been set down by the roadside i was wet to the skin and in no amiable humor and not being able to find bellpull or knocker or even a door i belabored the side of the house with my heavy walkingstick in a minute or two i saw a light flickering somewhere aloft then i heard the sound of a window opening followed by an exclamation of disgust as a blast of wind extinguished the candle which had given me an instantaneous picture en silhouette of a man leaning out of a casement i say what do you want down there inquired an unprepossessing voice i want to come in i want a supper and a bed and numberless things this is nt no time of night to go rousing honest folks out of their sleep who are you anyway the question superficially considered was a very simple one and i of all people in the world ought to have been able to answer it offhand but it staggered me strangely enough there came drifting across my memory the lettering on the back of a metaphysical work which i had seen years before on a shelf in the astor library owing to an unpremeditatedly funny collocation of title and author the lettering read as follows who am i jones evidently it had puzzled jones to know who he was or he would nt have written a book about it and come to so lame and impotent a conclusion it certainly puzzled me at that instant to define my identity thirty years ago i reflected i was nothing fifty years hence i shall be nothing again humanly speaking in the mean time who am i sureenough it had never before occurred to me what an indefinite article i was i wish it had not occurred to me then standing there in the rain and darkness i wrestled vainly with the problem and was constrained to fall back upon a yankee expedient isnt this a hotel i asked finally well it is a sort of hotel said the voice doubtfully my hesitation and prevarication had apparently not inspired my interlocutor with confidence in me then let me in i have just driven over from kin this infernal rain i am wet through and through but what do you want here at the corners whats your business people dont come here leastways in the middle of the night it is nt in the middle of the night i returned incensed i come on business connected with the new road i m the superintendent of the works oh and if you dont open the door at once ill raise the whole neighborhood and then go to the other hotel when i said that i supposed greenton was a village with a population of at least three or four thousand and was wondering vaguely at the absence of lights and other signs of human habitation surely i thought all the people cannot be abed and asleep at half past ten oclock perhaps i am in the business section of the town among the shops you jest wait said the voice above this request was not devoid of a certain accent of menace and i braced myself for a sortie on the part of the besieged if he had any such hostile intent presently a door opened at the very place where i least expected a door at the farther end of the building in fact and a man in his shirtsleeves shielding a candle with his left hand appeared on the threshold i passed quickly into the house with mr tobias sewell for this was mr sewell at my heels and found myself in a long lowstudded barroom there were two chairs drawn up before the hearth on which a huge hemlock backlog was still smouldering and on the unpainted deal counter contiguous stood two cloudy glasses with bits of lemonpeel in the bottom hinting at recent libations against the discolored wall over the bar hung a yellowed handbill in a warped frame announcing that the next annual n h agricultural fair would take place on the th of september there was no other furniture or decoration in this dismal apartment except the cobwebs which festooned the ceiling hanging down here and there like stalactites mr sewell set the candlestick on the mantelshelf and threw some pineknots on the fire which immediately broke into a blaze and showed him to be a lank narrowchested man past sixty with sparse steelgray hair and small deepset eyes perfectly round like a fishs and of no particular color his chief personal characteristics seemed to be too much feet and not enough teeth his sharply cut but rather simple face as he turned it towards me wore a look of interrogation i replied to his mute inquiry by taking out my pocketbook and handing him my businesscard which he held up to the candle and perused with great deliberation you re a civil engineer are you he said displaying his gums which gave his countenance an expression of almost infantile innocence he made no further audible remark but mumbled between his thin lips something which an imaginative person might have construed into if you re at civil engineer i ll be blessed if i would nt like to see an uncivil one mr sewells growl however was worse than his bite owing to his lack of teeth probably for he very goodnaturedly set himself to work preparing supper for me after a slice of cold ham and a warm punch to which my chilled condition gave a grateful flavor i went to bed in a distant chamber in a most amiable mood feeling satisfied that jones was a donkey to bother himself about his identity when i awoke the sun was several hours high my bed faced a window and by raising myself on one elbow i could look out on what i expected would be the main street to my astonishment i beheld a lonely country road winding up a sterile hill and disappearing over the ridge in a cornfield at the right of the road was a small private graveyard enclosed by a crumbling stonewall with a red gate the only thing suggestive of life was this little corner lot occupied by death i got out of bed and went to the other window there i had an uninterrupted view of twelve miles of open landscape with mount agamenticus in the purple distance not a house or a spire in sight well i exclaimed greenton does nt appear to be a very closely packed metropolis that rival hotel with which i had threatened mr sewell overnight was not a deadly weapon looking at it by daylight by jove i reflected maybe i m in the wrong place but there tacked against a panel of the bedroom door was a faded timetable dated greenton august i smiled all the time i was dressing and went smiling down stairs where i found mr sewell assisted by one of the fair sex in the first bloom of her eightieth year serving breakfast for me on a small table in the barroom i overslept myself this morning i remarked apologetically and i see that i am putting you to some trouble in future if you will have me called i will take my meals at the usual table de hфte at the what said mr sewell i mean with the other boarders mr sewell paused in the act of lifting a chop from the fire and resting the point of his fork against the woodwork of the mantelpiece grinned from ear to ear bless you there is nt any other boarders there has nt been anybody put up here sence let me see sence fatherinlaw died and that was in the fall of to be sure there s silas hes a regular boarder but i dont count him mr sewell then explained how the tavern had lost its custom when the old stage line was broken up by the railroad the introduction of steam was in mr sewells estimation a fatal error jest killed local business carried it off i m darned if i know where the whole country has been sort o retrograding ever sence steam was invented you spoke of having one boarder i said silas yes he come here the summer tilda died she that was tilda bayley and he s here yet going on thirteen year he could nt live any longer with the old man between you and i old clem jaffrey silass father was a hard nut yes said mr sewell crooking his elbow in inimitable pantomime altogether too often found dead in the road hugging a threegallon demijohn habeas corpus in the barn added mr sewell intending i presume to intimate that a postmortem examination had been deemed necessary silas he resumed in that respectful tone which one should always adopt when speaking of capital is a man of considerable property lives on his interest and keeps a hoss and shay he s a great scholar too silas takes all the periodicals and the police gazette regular mr sewell was turning over a third chop when the door opened and a stoutish middleaged little gentleman clad in deep black stepped into the room silas jaffrey said mr sewell with a comprehensive sweep of his arm picking up me and the newcomer on one fork so to speak be acquainted mr jaffrey advanced briskly and gave me his hand with unlookedfor cordiality he was a dapper little man with a head as round and nearly as bald as an orange and not unlike an orange in complexion either he had twinkling gray eyes and a pronounced roman nose the numerous freckles upon which were deepened by his funereal dresscoat and trousers he reminded me of alfred de mussets blackbird which with its yellow beak and sombre plumage looked like an undertaker eating an omelet silas will take care of you said mr sewell taking down his hat from a peg behind the door i ve got the cattle to look after tell him if you want anything while i ate my breakfast mr jaffrey hopped up and down the narrow barroom and chirped away as blithely as a bird on a cherrybough occasionally ruffling with his fingers a slight fringe of auburn hair which stood up pertly round his head and seemed to possess a luminous quality of its own dont i find it a little slow up here at the corners not at all my dear sir i am in the thick of life up here so many interesting things going on all over the world inventions discoveries spirits railroad disasters mysterious homicides poets murderers musicians statesmen distinguished travellers prodigies of all kinds turning up everywhere very few events or persons escape me i take six daily city papers thirteen weekly journals all the monthly magazines and two quarterlies i could not get along with less i could nt if you asked me i never feel lonely how can i being on intimate terms as it were with thousands and thousands of people theres that young woman out west what an entertaining creature she is now in missouri now in indiana and now in minnesota always on the go and all the time shedding needles from various parts of her body as if she really enjoyed it then there s that versatile patriarch who walks hundreds of miles and saws thousands of feet of wood before breakfast and shows no signs of giving out then theres that remarkable one may say that historical colored woman who knew benjamin franklin and fought at the battle of bunk no it is the old negro man who fought at bunker hill a mere infant of course at that period really now it is quite curious to observe how that venerable female slave formerly an african princess is repeatedly dying in her hundred and eleventh year and coming to life again punctually every six months in the smalltype paragraphs are you aware sir that within the last twelve years no fewer than two hundred and eightyseven of general washingtons colored coachmen have died for the soul of me i could not tell whether this quaint little gentleman was chaffing me or not i laid down my knife and fork and stared at him then there are the mathematicians he cried vivaciously without waiting for a reply i take great interest in them hear this and mr jaffrey drew a newspaper from a pocket in the tail of his coat and read as follows it has been estimated that if all the candles manufactured by this eminent firm stearine co were placed end to end they would reach and times around the globe of course continued mr jaffrey folding up the journal reflectively abstruse calculations of this kind are not perhaps of vital importance but they indicate the intellectual activity of the age seriously now he said halting in front of the table what with books and papers and drives about the country i do not find the days too long though i seldom see any one except when i go over to kfor my mail existence may be very full to a man who stands a little aside from the tumult and watches it with philosophic eye possibly he may see more of the battle than those who are in the midst of the action once i was struggling with the crowd as eager and undaunted as the best perhaps i should have been struggling still indeed i know my life would have been very different now if i had married mehetabel if i had married mehetabel his vivacity was gone a sudden cloud had come over his bright face his figure seemed to have collapsed the light seemed to have faded out of his hair with a shuffling step the very antithesis of his brisk elastic tread he turned to the door and passed into the road well i said to myself if greenton had forty thousand inhabitants it could nt turn out a more astonishing old party than that ii the case of silas jaffrey a man with a passion for bricаbrac is always stumbling over antique bronzes intaglios mosaics and daggers of the time of benvenuto cellini the bibliophile finds creamy vellum folios and rare alduses and elzevirs waiting for him at unsuspected bookstalls the numismatist has but to stretch forth his palm to have priceless coins drop into it my own weakness is odd people and i am constantly encountering them it was plain that i had unearthed a couple of very queer specimens at bayleys fourcorners i saw that a fortnight afforded me too brief an opportunity to develop the richness of both and i resolved to devote my spare time to mr jaffrey alone instinctively recognizing in him an unfamiliar species my professional work in the vicinity of greenton left my evenings and occasionally an afternoon unoccupied these intervals i purposed to employ in studying and classifying my fellowboarder it was necessary as a preliminary step to learn something of his previous history and to this end i addressed myself to mr sewell that same night i do not want to seem inquisitive i said to the landlord as he was fastening up the bar which by the way was the salle а manger and general sittingroom i do not want to seem inquisitive but your friend mr jaffrey dropped a remark this morning at breakfast which which was not altogether clear to me about mehetabel asked mr sewell uneasily yes well i wish he would nt he was friendly enough in the course of conversation to hint to me that he had not married the young woman and seemed to regret it no he did nt marry mehetabel may i inquire why he did nt marry mehetabel never asked her might have married the girl forty times old elkinss daughter over at k she d have had him quick enough seven years off and on he kept company with mehetabel and then she died and he never asked her he shillyshallied perhaps he did nt think of it when she was dead and gone then silas was struck all of a heap and thats all about it obviously mr sewell did not intend to tell me anything more and obviously there was more to tell the topic was plainly disagreeable to him for some reason or other and that unknown reason of course piqued my curiosity as i was absent from dinner and supper that day i did not meet mr jaffrey again until the following morning at breakfast he had recovered his birdlike manner and was full of a mysterious assassination that had just taken place in new york all the thrilling details of which were at his fingers ends it was at once comical and sad to see this harmless old gentleman with his naпve benevolent countenance and his thin hair flaming up in a semicircle like the footlights at a theatre revelling in the intricacies of the unmentionable deed you come up to my room tonight he cried with horrid glee and i ll give you my theory of the murder i ll make it as clear as day to you that it was the detective himself who fired the three pistolshots it was not so much the desire to have this point elucidated as to make a closer study of mr jaffrey that led me to accept his invitation mr jaffreys bedroom was in an l of the building and was in no way noticeable except for the numerous files of newspapers neatly arranged against the blank spaces of the walls and a huge pile of old magazines which stood in one corner reaching nearly up to the ceiling and threatening to topple over each instant like the leaning tower at pisa there were green paper shades at the windows some faded chintz valances about the bed and two or three easychairs covered with chintz on a blackwalnut shelf between the windows lay a choice collection of meerschaum and brierwood pipes filling one of the chocolatecolored bowls for me and another for himself mr jaffrey began prattling but not about the murder which appeared to have flown out of his mind in fact i do not remember that the topic was even touched upon either then or afterwards cosey nest this said mr jaffrey glancing complacently over the apartment what is more cheerful now in the fall of the year than an open woodfire do you hear those little chirps and twitters coming out of that piece of applewood those are the ghosts of the robins and bluebirds that sang upon the bough when it was in blossom last spring in summer whole flocks of them come fluttering about the fruittrees under the window so i have singing birds all the year round i take it very easy here i can tell you summer and winter not much society tobias is not perhaps what one would term a great intellectual force but he means well he s a realist believes in coming down to what he calls the hard pan but his heart is in the right place and he s very kind to me the wisest thing i ever did in my life was to sell out my grain business over at k thirteen years ago and settle down at the corners when a man has made a competency what does he want more besides at that time an event occurred which destroyed any ambition i may have had mehetabel died the lady you were engaged to no not precisely engaged i think it was quite understood between us though nothing had been said on the subject typhoid added mr jaffrey in a low voice for several minutes he smoked in silence a vague troubled look playing over his countenance presently this passed away and he fixed his gray eyes speculatively upon my face if i had married mehetabel said mr jaffrey slowly and then he hesitated i blew a ring of smoke into the air and resting my pipe on my knee dropped into an attitude of attention if i had married mehetabel you know we should have had ahem a family very likely i assented vastly amused at this unexpected turn a boy exclaimed mr jaffrey explosively by all means certainly a son great trouble about naming the boy mehetabels family want him named elkanah elkins after her grandfather i want him named andrew jackson we compromise by christening him elkanah elkins andrew jackson jaffrey rather a long name for such a short little fellow said mr jaffrey musingly andy is nt a bad nickname i suggested not at all we call him andy in the family somewhat fractious at first colic and things i suppose it is right or it would nt be so but the usefulness of measles mumps croup whoopingcough scarlatina and fits is not clear to the parental eye i wish andy would be a model infant and dodge the whole lot this supposititious child born within the last few minutes was plainly assuming the proportions of a reality to mr jaffrey i began to feel a little uncomfortable i am as i have said a civil engineer and it is not strictly in my line to assist at the births of infants imaginary or otherwise i pulled away vigorously at the pipe and said nothing what large blue eyes he has resumed mr jaffrey after a pause just like hettys and the fair hair too like hers how oddly certain distinctive features are handed down in families sometimes a mouth sometimes a turn of the eyebrow wicked little boys over at khave now and then derisively advised me to follow my nose it would be an interesting thing to do i should find my nose flying about the world turning up unexpectedly here and there dodging this branch of the family and reappearing in that now jumping over one greatgrandchild to fasten itself upon another and never losing its individuality look at andy there s elkanah elkinss chin to the life andys chin is probably older than the pyramids poor little thing he cried with sudden indescribable tenderness to lose his mother so early and mr jaffreys head sunk upon his breast and his shoulders slanted forward as if he were actually bending over the cradle of the child the whole gesture and attitude was so natural that it startled me the pipe slipped from my fingers and fell to the floor hush whispered mr jaffrey with a deprecating motion of his hand andys asleep he rose softly from the chair and walking across the room on tiptoe drew down the shade at the window through which the moonlight was streaming then he returned to his seat and remained gazing with halfclosed eyes into the dropping embers i refilled my pipe and smoked in profound silence wondering what would come next but nothing came next mr jaffrey had fallen into so brown a study that a quarter of an hour afterwards when i wished him goodnight and withdrew i do not think he noticed my departure i am not what is called a man of imagination it is my habit to exclude most things not capable of mathematical demonstration but i am not without a certain psychological insight and i think i understood mr jaffreys case i could easily understand how a man with an unhealthy sensitive nature overwhelmed by sudden calamity might take refuge in some forlorn place like this old tavern and dream his life away to such a man brooding forever on what might have been and dwelling wholly in the realm of his fancies the actual world might indeed become as a dream and nothing seem real but his illusions i dare say that thirteen years of bayleys fourcorners would have its effect upon me though instead of conjuring up goldenhaired children of the madonna i should probably see gnomes and kobolds and goblins engaged in hoisting false signals and misplacing switches for midnight express trains no doubt i said to myself that night as i lay in bed thinking over the matter this once possible but now impossible child is a great comfort to the old gentleman a greater comfort perhaps than a real son would be maybe andy will vanish with the shades and mists of night hes such an unsubstantial infant but if he does nt and mr jaffrey finds pleasure in talking to me about his son i shall humor the old fellow it would nt be a christian act to knock over his harmless fancy i was very impatient to see if mr jaffreys illusion would stand the test of daylight it did elkanah elkins andrew jackson jaffrey was so to speak alive and kicking the next morning on taking his seat at the breakfasttable mr jaffrey whispered to me that andy had had a comfortable night silas said mr sewell sharply what are you whispering about mr sewell was in an illhumor perhaps he was jealous because i had passed the evening in mr jaffreys room but surely mr sewell could not expect his boarders to go to bed at eight oclock every night as he did from time to time during the meal mr sewell regarded me unkindly out of the corner of his eye and in helping me to the parsnips he poniarded them with quite a suggestive air all this however did not prevent me from repairing to the door of mr jaffreys snuggery when night came well mr jaffrey how s andy this evening got a tooth cried mr jaffrey vivaciously no yes he has just through gave the nurse a silver dollar standing reward for first tooth it was on the tip of my tongue to express surprise that an infant a day old should cut a tooth when i suddenly recollected that richard iii was born with teeth feeling myself to be on unfamiliar ground i suppressed my criticism it was well i did so for in the next breath i was advised that half a year had elapsed since the previous evening andy s had a hard six months of it said mr jaffrey with the wellknown narrative air of fathers we ve brought him up by hand his grandfather by the way was brought up by the bottle and brought down by it too i added mentally recalling mr sewells account of the old gentlemans tragic end mr jaffrey then went on to give me a history of andys first six months omitting no detail however insignificant or irrelevant this history i would in turn inflict upon the reader if i were only certain that he is one of those dreadful parents who under the aegis of friendship bore you at a streets corner with that remarkable thing which freddy said the other day and insist on singing to you at an evening parly the iliad of tommys woes but to inflict this enfantillage upon the unmarried reader would be an act of wanton cruelty so i pass over that part of andys biography and for the same reason make no record of the next four or five interviews i had with mr jaffrey it will be sufficient to state that andy glided from extreme infancy to early youth with astonishing celerity at the rate of one year per night if i remember correctly and must i confess it before the week came to an end this invisible hobgoblin of a boy was only little less of a reality to me than to mr jaffrey at first i had lent myself to the old dreamers whim with a keen perception of the humor of the thing but by and by i found that i was talking and thinking of miss mehetabels son as though he were a veritable personage mr jafifrey spoke of the child with such an air of conviction as if andy were playing among his toys in the next room or making mudpies down in the yard in these conversations it should be observed the child was never supposed to be present except on that single occasion when mr jafifrey leaned over the cradle after one of our sйances i would lie awake until the small hours thinking of the boy and then fall asleep only to have indigestible dreams about him through the day and sometimes in the midst of complicated calculations i would catch myself wondering what andy was up to now there was no shaking him off he became an inseparable nightmare to me and i felt that if i remained much longer at bayleys fourcorners i should turn into just such another baldheaded mildeyed visionary as silas jaffrey then the tavern was a grewsome old shell any way full of unaccountable noises after dark rustlings of garments along unfrequented passages and stealthy footfalls in unoccupied chambers overhead i never knew of an old house without these mysterious noises next to my bedroom was a musty dismantled apartment in one corner of which leaning against the wainscot was a crippled mangle with its iron crank tilted in the air like the elbow of the late mr clem jaffrey sometimes in the dead vast and middle of the night i used to hear sounds as if some one were turning that rusty crank on the sly this occurred only on particularly cold nights and i conceived the uncomfortable idea that it was the thin family ghosts from the neglected graveyard in the cornfield keeping themselves warm by running each other through the mangle there was a haunted air about the whole place that made it easy for me to believe in the existence of a phantasm like miss mehetabels son who after all was less unearthly than mr jaffrey himself and seemed more properly an inhabitant of this globe than the toothless ogre who kept the inn not to mention the silent witch of endor that cooked our meals for us over the barroom fire in spite of the scowls and winks bestowed upon me by mr sewell who let slip no opportunity to testify his disapprobation of the intimacy mr jaffrey and i spent all our evenings together those long autumnal evenings through the length of which he talked about the boy laying out his path in life and hedging the path with roses he should be sent to the high school at portsmouth and then to college he should be educated like a gentleman andy when the old man dies remarked mr jaffrey one night rubbing his hands gleefully as if it were a great joke andy will find that the old man has left him a pretty plum what do you think of having andy enter west point when he s old enough said mr jaffrey on another occasion he need nt necessarily go into the army when he graduates he can become a civil engineer this was a stroke of flattery so delicate and indirect that i could accept it without immodesty there had lately sprung up on the corner of mr jaffreys bureau a small tin house gothic in architecture and pink in color with a slit in the roof and the word bank painted on one faзade several times in the course of an evening mr jaffrey would rise from his chair without interrupting the conversation and gravely drop a nickel into the scuttle of the bank it was pleasant to observe the solemnity of his countenance as he approached the edifice and the air of triumph with which he resumed his seat by the fireplace one night i missed the tin bank it had disappeared deposits and all like a real bank evidently there had been a defalcation on rather a large scale i strongly suspected that mr sewell was at the bottom of it but my suspicion was not shared by mr jaffrey who remarking my glance at the bureau became suddenly depressed i m afraid he said that i have failed to instil into andrew those principles of integrity which which and the old gentleman quite broke down andy was now eight or nine years old and for some time past if the truth must be told had given mr jaffrey no inconsiderable trouble what with his impishness and his illnesses the boy led the pair of us a lively dance i shall not soon forget the anxiety of mr jaffrey the night andy had the scarletfever an anxiety which so infected me that i actually returned to the tavern the following afternoon earlier than usual dreading to hear that the little spectre was dead and greatly relieved on meeting mr jaffrey at the doorstep with his face wreathed in smiles when i spoke to him of andy i was made aware that i was inquiring into a case of scarletfever that had occurred the year before it was at this time towards the end of my second week at greenton that i noticed what was probably not a new trait mr jaffreys curious sensitiveness to atmospherical changes he was as sensitive as a barometer the approach of a storm sent his mercury down instantly when the weather was fair he was hopeful and sunny and andys prospects were brilliant when the weather was overcast and threatening he grew restless and despondent and was afraid that the boy was not going to turn out well on the saturday previous to my departure which had been fixed for monday it rained heavily all the afternoon and that night mr jaffrey was in an unusually excitable and unhappy frame of mind his mercury was very low indeed that boy is going to the dogs just as fast as he can go said mr jaffrey with a woful face i cant do anything with him hell come out all right mr jaffrey boys will be boys i would not give a snap for a lad without animal spirits but animal spirits said mr jaffrey sententiously should nt saw off the legs of the piano in tobiass best parlor i dont know what tobias will say when he finds it out what has andy sawed off the legs of the old spinet i returned laughing worse than that played upon it then no sir he has lied to me i cant believe that of andy lied to me sir repeated mr jaffrey severely he pledged me his word of honor that he would give over his climbing the way that boy climbs sends a chill down my spine this morning notwithstanding his solemn promise he shinned up the lightningrod attached to the extension and sat astride the ridgepole i saw him and he denied it when a boy you have caressed and indulged and lavished pocketmoney on lies to you and will climb then theres nothing more to be said hes a lost child you take too dark a view of it mr jaffrey training and education are bound to tell in the end and he has been well brought up but i did nt bring him up on a lightningrod did i if he is ever going to know how to behave he ought to know now tomorrow he will be eleven years old the reflection came to me that if andy had not been brought up by the rod he had certainly been brought up by the lightning he was eleven years old in two weeks i essayed with that perspicacious wisdom which seems to be the peculiar property of bachelors and elderly maiden ladies to tranquillize mr jaffreys mind and to give him some practical hints on the management of youth spank him i suggested at last i will said the old gentleman and you d better do it at once i added as it flashed upon me that in six months andy would be a hundred and fortythree years old an age at which parental discipline would have to be relaxed the next morning sunday the rain came down as if determined to drive the quicksilver entirely out of my poor friend mr jaffrey sat bolt upright at the breakfasttable looking as woebegone as a bust of dante and retired to his chamber the moment the meal was finished as the day advanced the wind veered round to the northeast and settled itself down to work it was not pleasant to think and i tried not to think what mr jaffreys condition would be if the weather did not mend its manners by noon but so far from clearing off at noon the storm increased in violence and as night set in the wind whistled in a spiteful falsetto key and the rain lashed the old tavern as if it were a balky horse that refused to move on the windows rattled in the wormeaten frames and the doors of remote rooms where nobody ever went slammed to in the maddest way now and then the tornado sweeping down the side of mount agamenticus bowled across the open country and struck the ancient hostelry pointblank mr jaffrey did not appear at supper i knew that he was expecting me to come to his room as usual and i turned over in my mind a dozen plans to evade seeing him that night the landlord sat at the opposite side of the chimneyplace with his eye upon me i fancy he was aware of the effect of this storm on his other boarder for at intervals as the wind hurled itself against the exposed gable threatening to burst in the windows mr sewell tipped me an atrocious wink and displayed his gums in a way he had not done since the morning after my arrival at greenton i wondered if he suspected anything about andy there had been odd times during the past week when i felt convinced that the existence of miss mehetabels son was no secret to mr sewell in deference to the gale the landlord sat up half an hour later than was his custom at halfpast eight he went to bed remarking that he thought the old pile would stand till morning he had been absent only a few minutes when i heard a rustling at the door i looked up and beheld mr jaffrey standing on the threshold with his dress in disorder his scant hair flying and the wildest expression on his face hes gone cried mr jaffrey who sewell yes he just went to bed no not tobias the boy what run away no he is dead he has fallen from a stepladder in the red chamber and broken his neck mr jaffrey threw up his hands with a gesture of despair and disappeared i followed him through the hall saw him go into his own apartment and heard the bolt of the door drawn to then i returned to the barroom and sat for an hour or two in the ruddy glow of the fire brooding over the strange experience of the last fortnight on my way to bed i paused at mr jaffreys door and in a lull of the storm the measured respiration within told me that the old gentleman was sleeping peacefully slumber was coy with me that night i lay listening to the soughing of the wind and thinking of mr jaffreys illusion it had amused me at first with its grotesqueness but now the poor little phantom was dead i was conscious that there had been something pathetic in it all along shortly after midnight the wind sunk down coming and going fainter and fainter floating around the eaves of the tavern with an undulating murmurous sound as if it were turning itself into soft wings to bear away the spirit of a little child perhaps nothing that happened during my stay at bayleys fourcorners took me so completely by surprise as mr jaffreys radiant countenance the next morning the morning itself was not fresher or sunnier his round face literally shone with geniality and happiness his eyes twinkled like diamonds and the magnetic light of his hair was turned on full he came into my room while i was packing my valise he chirped and prattled and carolled and was sorry i was going away but never a word about andy however the boy had probably been dead several years then the open wagon that was to carry me to the station stood at the door mr sewell was placing my case of instruments under the seat and mr jaffrey had gone up to his room to get me a certain newspaper containing an account of a remarkable shipwreck on the auckland islands i took the opportunity to thank mr sewell for his courtesies to me and to express my regret at leaving him and mr jaffrey i have become very much attached to mr jaffrey i said he is a most interesting person but that hypothetical boy of his that son of miss mehetabels yes i know interrupted mr sewell testily fell off a stepladder and broke his dratted neck eleven year old was nt he always does jest at that point next week silas will begin the whole thing over again if he can get anybody to listen to him i see our amiable friend is a little queer on that subject mr sewell glanced cautiously over his shoulder and tapping himself significantly on the forehead said in a low voice room to let unfurnished
