the killer inside me by jim thompson copyright id finished my pie and was having a second cup of coffee when i saw him the midnight freight had come in a few minutes before and he was peering in one end of the restaurant window the end nearest the depot shading his eyes with his hand and blinking against the light he saw me watching him and his face faded back into the shadows but i knew he was still there i knew he was waiting the bums always size me up for an easy mark i lit a cigar and slid off my stool the waitress a new girl from dallas watched as i buttoned my coat why you dont even carry a gun she said as though she was giving me a piece of news no i smiled no gun no blackjack nothing like that why should i but youre a cop a deputy sheriff i mean what if some crook should try to shoot you we dont have many crooks here in central city maam i said anyway people are people even when theyre a little misguided you dont hurt them they wont hurt you theyll listen to reason she shook her head wideeyed with awe and i strolled up to the front the proprietor shoved back my money and laid a couple of cigars on top of it he thanked me again for taking his son in hand hes a different boy now lou he said kind of running his words together like foreigners do stays in nights gets along fine in school and always he talks about you what a good man is deputy lou ford i didnt do anything i said just talked to him showed him a little interest anyone else could have done as much only you he said because you are good you make others so he was all ready to sign off with that but i wasnt i leaned an elbow on the counter crossed one foot behind the other and took a long slow drag on my cigar i liked the guy as much as i like most people anyway but he was too good to let go polite intelligent guys like that are my meat well i tell you i drawled i tell you the way i look at it a man doesnt get any more out of life than what he puts into it umm he said fidgeting i guess youre right lou i was thinking the other day max and all of a sudden i had the doggonedest thought it came to me out of a clear sky the boy is father to the man just like that the boy is father to the man the smile on his face was getting strained i could hear his shoes creak as he squirmed if theres anything worse than a bore its a corny bore but how can you brush off a nice friendly fellow whod give you his shirt if you asked for it i reckon i should have been a college professor or something like that i said even when im asleep im working out problems take that heat wave we had a few weeks ago a lot of people think its the heat that makes it so hot but its not like that max its not the heat but the humidity ill bet you didnt know that did you he cleared his throat and muttered something about being wanted in the kitchen i pretended like i didnt hear him another thing about the weather i said everyone talks about it but no one does anything but maybe its better that way every cloud has its silver lining at least thats the way i figure it i mean if we didnt have the rain we wouldnt have the rainbows now would we lou well i said i guess id better shove off ive got quite a bit of getting around to do and i dont want to rush haste makes waste in my opinion i like to look before i leap that was dragging em in by the feet but i couldnt hold em back striking at people that way is almost as good as the other the real way the way id fought to forget and had almost forgot until i met her i was thinking about her as i stepped out into the cool west texas night and saw the bum waiting for me central city was founded in but it never became a city in size until about tentwelve years ago it was a shipping point for a lot of cattle and a little cotton and chester conway who was born here made it headquarters for the conway construction company but it still wasnt much more than a wide place in a texas road then the oil boom came and almost overnight the population jumped to well the town had been laid out in a little valley amongst a lot of hills there just wasnt any room for the newcomers so they spread out every whichway with their homes and businesses and now they were scattered across a third of the county its not an unusual situation in the oilboom country youll see a lot of cities like ours if youre ever out this way they dont have any regular city police force just a constable or two the sheriffs office handles the policing for both city and county we do a pretty good job of it to our own way of thinking at least but now and then things get a little out of hand and we put on a cleanup it was during a cleanup three months ago that i ran into her name of joyce lakeland old bob maples the sheriff told me lives fourfive miles out on derrick road just past the old branch farm house got her a nice little cottage up there behind a stand of blackjack trees i think i know the place i said hustlin lady bob weel i reckon so but shes bein mighty decent about it she aint running it into the ground and she aint takin on no roustabouts or sheepherders if some of these preachers around town wasnt rompin on me i wouldnt bother her atall i wondered if he was getting some of it and decided that he wasnt he wasnt maybe any mental genius but bob maples was straight so how shall i handle this joyce lakeland i said tell her to lay off a while or to move on weel he scratched his head scowling i dunno lou just well just go out and size her up and make your own decision i know youll be gentle as gentle and pleasant as you can be an i know you can be firm if you have to so go on out an see how she looks to you ill back you up in whatever you want to do it was about ten oclock in the morning when i got there i pulled the car up into the yard curving it around so i could swing out easy the county license plates didnt show but it wasnt deliberate it was just the way it had to be i eased up on the porch knocked on the door and stood back taking off my stetson i was feeling a little uncomfortable i hardly knew what i was going to say to her because maybe were kind of oldfashioned but our standards of conduct arent the same say as they are in the east or middlewest out here you say yes maam and no maam to anything with skirts on anything white that is out here if you catch a man with his pants down you apologize even if you have to arrest him afterwards out here youre a man a man and a gentleman or you arent anything and god help you if youre not the door opened an inch or two then it opened all the way and she stood looking at me yes she said coldly she was wearing sleeping shorts and a wool pullover her brown hair was as tousled as a lambs tail and her unpainted face was drawn with sleep but none of that mattered it wouldnt have mattered if shed crawled out of a hogwallow wearing a gunny sack she had that much she yawned openly and said yes again but i still couldnt speak i guess i was staring openmouthed like a country boy this was three months ago remember and i hadnt had the sickness in almost fifteen years not since i was fourteen she wasnt much over five feet and a hundred pounds and she looked a little scrawny around the neck and ankles but that was all right it was perfectly all right the good lord had known just where to put that flesh where it would really do some good oh my goodness she laughed suddenly come on in i dont make a practice of it this early in the morning but she held the screen open and gestured i went in and she closed it and locked the door again im sorry maam i said but its all right but ill have to have some coffee first you go on back i went down the little hall to the bedroom listening uneasily as i heard her drawing water for the coffee id acted like a chump it was going to be hard to be firm with her after a start like this and something told me i should be i didnt know why i still dont but i knew it right from the beginning here was a little lady who got what she wanted and to hell with the price tag well hell though it was just a feeling shed acted all right and she had a nice quiet little place here i decided id let her ride for the time being anyhow why not and then i happened to glance into the dresser mirror and i knew why not i knew i couldnt the top dresser drawer was open a little and the mirror was tilted slightly and hustling ladies are one thing and hustling ladies with guns are something else i took it out of the drawer a automatic just as she came in with the coffee tray her eyes flashed and she slammed the tray down on a table what she snapped are you doing with that i opened my coat and showed her my badge sheriffs office maam what are you doing with it she didnt say anything she just took her purse off the dresser opened it and pulled out a permit it had been issued in fort worth but it was all legal enough those things are uswally honored from one town to another satisfied copper she said i reckon its all right miss i said and my names ford not copper i gave her a big smile but i didnt get any back my hunch about her had been dead right a minute before shed been all set to lay and it probably wouldnt have made any difference if i hadnt had a dime now she was set for something else and whether i was a cop or christ didnt make any difference either i wondered how shed lived so long jesus she jeered the nicest looking guy i ever saw and you turn out to be a lousy snooping copper how much i dont jazz cops i felt my face turning red lady i said thats not very polite i just came out for a little talk you dumb bastard she yelled i asked you what you wanted since you put it that way i said ill tell you i want you out of central city by sundown if i catch you here after that ill run you in for prostitution i slammed on my hat and started for the door she got in front of me blocking the way you lousy sonofabitch you dont you call me that i said dont do it maam i did call you that and ill do it again youre a sonofabitch bastard pimp i tried to push past her i had to get out of there i knew what was going to happen if i didnt get out and i knew i couldnt let it happen i might kill her it might bring the sickness back and even if i didnt and it didnt id be washed up shed talk shed yell her head off and people would start thinking thinking and wondering about that time fifteen years ago she slapped me so hard that my ears rang first on one side then the other she swung and kept swinging my hat flew off i stooped to pick it up and she slammed her knee under my chin i stumbled backward on my heels and sat down on the floor i heard a mean laugh then another laugh sort of apologetic she said gosh sheriff i didnt mean to i you made me so mad i i sure i grinned my vision was clearing and i found my voice again sure maam i know how it was used to get that way myself give me a hand will you youyou wont hurt me me aw now maam no she said and she sounded almost disappointed i know you wont anyone can see youre too easygoing and she came over to me slowly and gave me her hands i pulled myself up i held her wrists with one hand and swung it almost stunned her i didnt want her completely stunned i wanted her so she would understand what was happening to her no baby my lips drew back from my teeth im not going to hurt you i wouldnt think of hurting you im just going to beat the ass plumb off of you i said it and i meant it and i damned near did i jerked the jersey up over her face and tied the end in a knot i threw her down on the bed yanked off her sleeping shorts and tied her feet together with them i took off my belt and raised it over my head i dont know how long it was before i stopped before i came to my senses all i know is that my arm ached like hell and her rear end was one big bruise and i was scared crazy as scared as a man can get and go on living i freed her feet and hands and pulled the jersey off her head i soaked a towel in cold water and bathed her with it i poured coffee between her lips and all the time i was talking begging her to forgive me telling her how sorry i was i got down on my knees by the bed and begged and apologized at last her eyelids fluttered and opened ddont she whispered i wont i said honest to god maam i wont ever dont talk she brushed her lips against mine dont say youre sorry she kissed me again she began fumbling at my tie my shirt starting to undress me after id almost skinned her alive i went back the next day and the day after that i kept going back and it was like a wind had been turned on a dying fire i began needling people in that deadpan way needling em as a substitute for something else i began thinking about settling scores with chester conway of the conway construction company i wont say that i hadnt thought of it before maybe id stayed on in central city all these years just in the hopes of getting even but except for her i dont think id ever have done anything shed made the old fire burn again she even showed me how to square with conway she didnt know she was doing it but she gave me the answer it was one day one night rather about six weeks after wed met lou she said i dont want to go on like this lets pull out of this crummy town together just you and i why youre crazy i said i said it before i could stop myself you think id id go on lou let me hear you say it tell me she began to drawl what a fine ol family youall fords is tell me weall fords maam we wouldnt think of livin with one of you mizzable ol whores maam us fords just aint built that way maam that was part of it a big part but it wasnt the main thing i knew she was making me worse i knew that if i didnt stop soon id never be able to id wind up in a cage or the electric chair say it lou say it and ill say something dont threaten me baby i said i dont like threats im not threatening you im telling you you think youre too good for me ill ill go on its your turn to do the saying i wouldnt want to lou honey but im not going to give you up never never never if youre too good for me now then ill make it so you wont be i kissed her a long hard kiss because baby didnt know it but baby was dead and in a way i couldnt have loved her more well now baby i said youve got your bowels in an uproar and all over nothing i was thinking about the money problem ive got some money i can get some more a lot of it yeah i can lou i know i can hes crazy about me and hes dumb as hell ill bet if his old man thought i was going to marry him he who i said who are you talking about joyce elmer conway you know who he is dont you old chester yeah i said yeah i know the conways right well how do you figure on hookin em we talked it over lying there on her bed together and off in the night somewhere a voice seemed to whisper to forget it forget it lou its not too late if you stop now and i did try god knows i tried but right after that right after the voice her hand gripped one of mine and kneaded it into her breasts and she moaned and shivered and so i didnt forget well i said after a time i guess we can work it out the way i see it is if at first you dont succeed try try again mmm darling in other words i said where theres a will theres a way she squirmed a little and then she snickered oh lou you corny so and so you slay me the street was dark i was standing a few doors above the cafe and the bum was standing and looking at me he was a young fellow about my age and he was wearing what must have been a pretty good suit of clothes at one time well how about it bud he was saying how about it huh ive been on a hell of a binge and by god if i dont get some food pretty soon something to warm you up eh i said yeah anything at all you can help me with ill i took the cigar out of my mouth with one hand and made like i was reaching into my pocket with the other then i grabbed his wrist and ground the cigar butt into his palm jesus bud he cursed and jerked away from me what the hell you tryin to do i laughed and let him see my badge beat it i said sure bud sure he said and he began backing away he didnt sound particularly scared or angry more interested than anything but you better watch that stuff bud you sure better watch it he turned and walked off toward the railroad tracks i watched him feeling sort of sick and shaky and then i got in my car and headed for the labor temple the central city labor temple was on a side street a couple of blocks off of the courthouse square it wasnt much of a building an old twostory brick with the downstairs rented out to a pool hail and the union offices and meeting hall on the second floor i climbed the stairs and went down the dark corridor to the end where a door opened into several of the best and largest offices in the place the sign on the glass read central city texas building trades council joseph rothman pres and rothman opened the door before i could turn the knob lets go back here in the rear he said shaking hands sorry to ask you to come around so late but with you being a public official and all i thought it might be best yeah i nodded wishing i could have ducked seeing him entirely the law is pretty much on one side of the fence out here and i already knew what he wanted to talk about he was a man of about forty short and stocky with sharp black eyes and a head that seemed too big for his body he had a cigar in his mouth but he laid it down after he sat down at his desk and began rolling a cigarette he lit it and blew smoke over the match his eyes shying away from mine lou the labor leader said and hesitated ive got something to tell you in the strictest confidence you understand but id like you to tell me something first its probably a pretty touchy subject with you but well how did you feel about mike dean lou feel im not sure i know what you mean joe i said he was your foster brother right your father adopted him yes dad was a doctor you know and a very good one i understand excuse me lou go on so thats the way it was going to be spar and counterspar each of us feeling the other out each of us telling things he knows damn well the other fellow has heard a thousand times rothman had something important to tell me and it looked as though he was going to do it the hard and careful way well i didnt mind id play along with him he and the deans were old friends when they got wiped out in that big flu epidemic he adopted mike my mother was dead had been dead since i was a baby dad figured mike and me would be company for each other and the housekeeper could take care of two of us as easily as one uhhuh and how did that strike you lou i mean youre the only son and heir and your dad brings in another son didnt that rub you a little the wrong way i laughed hell joe i was four years old at the time and mike was six youre not much concerned with money at that age and anyway dad never had any he was too softhearted to dun his patients you liked mike then he sounded like he wasnt quite convinced like isnt the word for it i said he was the finest swellest guy that ever lived i couldnt have loved a real brother more even after he did what he did and just what i drawled would that be rothman raised his eyebrows i liked mike myself lou but facts are facts the whole town knows that if hed been a little older hed have gone to the chair instead of reform school no one knows anything there was never any proof the girl identified him a girl less than three years old shed have identified anyone they showed her and mike admitted it and they dug up some other cases mike was scared he didnt know what he was saying rothman shook his head let it go lou im not really interested in that as such only in your feelings about mike werent you pretty embarrassed when he came back to central city wouldnt it have been better if hed stayed away no i said dad and i knew mike hadnt done it i mean i hesitated knowing mike we were sure he couldnt be guilty because i was mike had taken the blame for me i wanted mike to come back so did dad he wanted him here to watch over me my god joe dad pulled strings for months to get mike his job as city building inspector it wasnt easy to do the way people felt about mike as popular and influential as dad was that all checks rothman nodded thats my understanding of things but i have to be sure you werent sort of relieved when mike got killed the shock killed dad he never recovered from it as for me well all i can say is that i wish it had been me instead of mike rothman grinned okay lou now its my turn mike was killed six years ago he was walking a girder on the eighth floor of the new texas apartments a conway construction job when he apparently stepped on a loose rivet he threw himself backward so hed fall inside the building onto the decking but the floors hadnt been decked in properly there were just a few planks scattered here and there mike fell all the way through to the basement i nodded so i said what about it joe what about it rothmans eyes flashed you ask me what about it when as president of the building unions you know that the ironworkers are under your jurisdiction joe its their obligation and yours to see that each floor is decked in as a building goes up now youre talking like a lawyer rothman slapped his desk the ironworkers are weak out here conway wouldnt put in the decking and we couldnt make him you could have struck the job oh well rothman shrugged i guess i made a mistake lou i understood you to say that you you heard me right i said and lets not kid each other conway cut corners to make money you let him to make money im not saying youre at fault but i dont reckon he was either it was just one of those things well rothman hesitated thats a kind of funny attitude for you to take lou it seems to me youre pretty impersonal about it but since thats the way you feel perhaps id better perhaps id better i said let me do the talking and then you wont have to feel funny about it there was a riveter up there with mike at the time he took his dive working after hours working by himself but it takes two men to rivet one to run the gun and one on the bucking iron youre going to tell me that he didnt have any rightful business there but i think youre wrong he didnt have to be riveting he could have been gathering up tools or something like that but you dont know the whole story lou this man i know the guy was an iron tramp working on a permit he blew into town without a dime three days after mikes death he left in a new chevy which he paid cash on the line for that looks bad but it doesnt really need to mean anything he might have won the dough in a crap game or but you still dont know it all lou conway lets see if i dont i said conways company was the architect on that job as well as the contractor and he hadnt allowed enough space for the boilers to get em in he was going to have to make certain alterations which he knew damned well mike would never allow it was either that or lose several hundred thousand dollars go on lou so he took the loss he hated it like hell but he went ahead and did it rothman laughed shortly he did huh i pushed iron on that job myself and and well i gave him a puzzled look he did didnt he no matter what happened to mike your locals couldnt close their eyes to a dangerous situation like that youre responsible you can be sued you could be tried for criminal collusion you lou rothman cleared his throat youre a hundred per cent right lou naturally we wouldnt stick our necks out for any amount of money sure i smiled stupidly you just havent thought this deal through joe youve been getting along pretty good with conway and now hes taken a notion to go nonunion and naturally youre kind of upset about it i reckon if you thought thered really been a murder you wouldnt have waited six years to speak up yeah i mean certainly not certainly i wouldnt he began rolling another cigarette uh how did you find out all these things lou if you dont mind telling me well you know how it is mike was a member of the family and i get around a lot any talk thats going around id naturally hear it mmmm i didnt realize thered been so much gossip in fact i didnt know thered been any and you never felt inclined to take any action why should i i said it was just gossip conways a big business man just about the biggest contractor in west texas he wouldnt get mixed up in a murder any moren you people would keep quiet about one rothman gave me another sharp look and then he looked down at his desk lou he said softly do you know how many days a year an ironworker works do you know what his life expectancy is did you ever see an old ironworker did you ever stop to figure that theres all kinds of ways of dying but only one way of being dead well no i reckon not i said i guess i dont know what youre driving at joe let it go its not really relevant i suppose the boys dont have it too easy i said but heres the way i look at it joe theres no law says they have to stick to one line of work if they dont like it they can do something else yeah he nodded thats right isnt it its funny how it takes an outsider to see through these problems if they dont like it let em do something else thats good thats very good aw i said it wasnt anything much i disagree its very enlightening you really surprise me lou ive been seeing you around town for years and frankly you hardly struck me as a deep thinker do you have any solution for our larger problems the negro situation for example well thats pretty simple i said id just ship em all to africa uhhuh i see i see he said and he stood up and held out his hand im sorry i troubled you for nothing lou but ive certainly enjoyed our talk i hope we can get together again sometime that would be nice i said meanwhile of course i havent seen you understand oh sure i said we talked for a minute or two more and then we walked to the outside door together he glanced at it sharply then looked at me say he said didnt i close that damned thing i thought you did i said well no harm done i guess he said could i make a suggestion to you lou in your own interests why sure you can joe anything at all save that bullshit for the birds he nodded grinning at me and for a minute you could have heard a pin drop but he wasnt going to say anything he wasnt ever going to let on so finally i began to grin too i dont know the why of it lou i dont know a thing understand not a thing but watch yourself its a good act but its easy to overdo you kind of asked for it joe i said and now you know why and im not very bright or i wouldnt be a labor skate yeah i said i see what you mean we shook hands again and he winked and bobbed his head and i went down the dark hall and down the stairs after dad died id thought about selling our house id had several good offers for it in fact since it was right on the edge of the downtown business district but somehow i couldnt let it go the taxes were pretty high and there was ten times as much room as i needed but i couldnt bring myself to sell something told me to hold on to wait i drove down the alley to our garage i drove in and shut off the lights the garage had been a barn it still was for that matter and i sat there in the doorway sniffing the musty odors of old oats and hay and straw dreaming back through the years mike and i had kept our ponies in those two front stalls and back here in the box stall wed had an outlaws cave wed hung swings and acting bars from these rafters and wed made a swimming pool out of the horse trough and up overhead in the loft where the rats now scampered and scurried mike had found me with the little gi a rat screamed suddenly on a high note i got out of the car and hurried out of the big sliding door of the barn and into the backyard i wondered if that was why i stayed here to punish myself i went in the back door of the house and went through the house to the front turning on all the lights the downstairs lights i mean then i came back into the kitchen and made coffee and carried the pot up into dads old office i sat in his big old leather chair sipping coffee and smoking and gradually the tension began to leave me it had always made me feel better to come here back from the time i was kneehigh to a grasshopper it was like coming out of the darkness into sunlight out of a storm into calm like being lost and found again i got up and walked along the bookcases and endless files of psychiatric literature the bulky volumes of morbid psychology krafftebing jung freud bleuler adolf meyer kretschmer kraepelin all the answers were here out in the open where you could look at them and no one was terrified or horrified i came out of the place i was hiding in that i always had to hide in and began to breathe i took down a bound volume of one of the german periodicals and read a while i put it back and took down one in french i skimmed through an article in spanish and another in italian i couldnt speak any of those languages worth a doggone but i could understand em all id just picked em up with dads help just like id picked up some higher mathematics and physical chemistry and half a dozen other subjects dad had wanted me to be a doctor but he was afraid to have me go away to school so hed done what he could for me at home it used to irritate him knowing what i had in my head to hear me talking and acting like any other rube around town but in time when he realized how bad i had the sickness he even encouraged me to do it thats what i was going to be i was going to have to live and get along with rubes i wasnt ever going to have anything but some safe small job and id have to act accordingly if dad could have swung anything else that paid a living i wouldnt even have been as much as a deputy sheriff i fiddled around dads desk working out a couple of problems in calculus just for the hell of it turning away from the desk i looked at myself in the mirrored door of the laboratory i was still wearing my stetson shoved a little to the back of my head i had on a kind of pinkish shirt and a black bow tie and the pants of my blue serge suit were hitched up so as to catch on the tops of my justin boots lean and wiry a mouth that looked all set to drawl a typical westerncountry peace officer that was me maybe friendlier looking than the average maybe a little cleaner cut but on the whole typical thats what i was and i couldnt change even if it was safe i doubted if i could change id pretended so long that i no longer had to lou i jumped and whirled amy i gasped what in the you shouldnt be here where upstairs waiting for you now dont get excited lou i slipped out after the folks went to sleep and you know them but someone might no one did i slipped down the alley arent you glad i wasnt although i suppose i should have been she didnt have the shape that joyce did but it was a big improvement over anything else around central city except when she stuck her chin out and narrowed her eyes like she was daring you to cross her she was a mighty pretty girl well sure i said sure im glad lets go back up huh i followed her up the stairs and into my bedroom she kicked off her shoes tossed her coat on a chair with her other clothes and flopped down backwards on the bed my she said after a moment and her chin began to edge outward such enthusiasm oh i said giving my head a shake im sorry amy i had something on my mind ssomething on your mind her voice quavered i strip myself for him i shed my decency and my clothes for him and hhe stands there with something on his rnmind aw now honey its just that i wasnt expecting you and no and why should you the way you avoid me and make excuses for not seeing me if i had any pride left id id she buried her head in the pillow and began to sob giving me an a view of what was probably the second prettiest rear end in west texas i was pretty sure she was faking id picked up a lot of pointers on women from joyce but i didnt dare give her the smacking she deserved instead i threw off my own clothes and crawled into bed with her pulling her around facing me now cut it out honey i said you know ive just been busy as a chigger at a picnic i dont know it i dont know anything of the kind you dont want to be with me thats what why thats plumb crazy honey why wouldnt i want to bbecause oh lou darling ive been so miserable well now thats a right foolish way to act amy i said she went on whimpering about how miserable shed been and i went on holding her listening you got to do plenty of listening around amy and wondering how it had all started to tell the truth i guess it hadnt started anywhere wed just drifted together like straws in a puddle our families had grown up together and wed grown up together right here in this same block wed walked back and forth to school together and when we went to parties we were paired off together we hadnt needed to do anything it was all done for us i suppose half the town including her own folks knew we were knocking off a little but no one said anything or thought anything about it after all we were going to get married even if we were kind of taking our time lou she nudged me you arent listening to me why sure i am honey well answer me then not now i said ive got something else on my mind now but oh darling i figured shed been gabbing and nagging about nothing as usual and shed forget about whatever i was supposed to answer but it didnt work out that way as soon as it was over and id reached her cigarettes for her taking one for myself she gave me another one of her looks and another well lou i hardly know what to say i said which was exactly the case you want to marry me dont you mar but sure i said i think weve waited long enough lou i can go on teaching school well get by a lot better than most couples but but thats all wed do amy wed never get anywhere what do you mean well i dont want to go on being a deputy sheriff all of my life i want to well be somebody like what for example oh i dont know theres no use in talking about it a doctor perhaps i think that would be awfully nice is that what you had in mind lou i know its crazy amy but she laughed she rolled her head on the pillow laughing oh lou i never heard of such a thing youre twentynine years old and yyou dont even speak good english and and oh ha ha ha she laughed until she was gasping and my cigarette burned down between my fingers and i never knew it until i smelled the scorching flesh im ssorry darling i didnt mean to hurt your feelings but were you teasing me were you joking with your little amy you know me i said lou the laughing boy she began to quiet down at the tone of my voice she turned away from me and lay on her back picking at the quilt with her fingers i got up and found a cigar and sat down on the bed again you dont want to marry me do you lou i dont think we should marry now no you dont want to marry me at all i didnt say that she was silent for several minutes but her face talked for her i saw her eyes narrow and a mean little smile twist her lips and i knew what she was thinking i knew almost to a word what she was going to say im afraid youll have to marry me lou youll have to do you understand no i said i wont have to youre not pregnant amy youve never gone with anyone else and youre not pregnant by me im lying i suppose seems as though i said i couldnt get you pregnant if i wanted to im sterile you sterile isnt the same thing as impotent ive had a vasectomy then why have we always been so why do you use i shrugged it saved a lot of explanations anyway youre not pregnant to get back to the subject i just dont understand she said frowning she wasnt at all bothered by my catching her in a lie your father did it why lou oh i was kind of run down and nervous and he thought why you were not you were never that way well i said he thought i was he thought he did a terrible thing like that made you so we can never have children just because he thought something why its terrible it makes me sick when was it lou whats the difference i said i dont really remember a long time ago i wished id kept my mouth shut about her not being pregnant now i couldnt back up on my story shed know i was lying and shed be more suspicious than ever i grinned at her and walked my fingers up the curving plane of her belly i squeezed one of her breasts and then i moved my hand up until it was resting against her throat whats the matter i said what have you got that pretty little face all puckered up for she didnt say anything she didnt smile back she just lay there staring adding me up point by point and she began to look more puzzled in one way and less in another the answer was trying to crash through and it couldnt make it quite i was standing in the way it couldnt get around the image she had of gentle friendly easygoing lou ford i think she said slowly id better go home now maybe youd better i agreed itll be dawn before long will i see you tomorrow today i mean well saturdays a pretty busy day for me i said i reckon we might go to church together sunday or maybe have dinner together but but youre busy sunday night i really am honey i promised to do a favor for a fellow and i dont see how i can get out of it i see it never occurs to you to think about me when youre making all your plans does it oh no i dont matter i wont be tied up too long sunday i said maybe until eleven oclock or so why dont you come over and wait for me like you did tonight id be tickled to death to have you her eyes flickered but she didnt break out with a lecture like she must have wanted to she motioned for me to move so she could get up and then she got up and began dressing im awfully sorry honey i said are you she pulled her dress over her head patted it down around her hips and buttoned the collar standing first on one foot then the other she put on her pumps i got up and held her coat for her smoothing it around her shoulders as i helped her into it she turned inside my arms and faced me all right lou she said briskly well say no more tonight but sunday well have a good long talk youre going to tell me why youve acted as you have these last few months and no lying or evasions understand maam miss stanton i said yes maam all right she nodded thats settled now youd better put some clothes on or go back to bed before you catch cold that day saturday was a busy one there were a lot of payday drunks in town it being the middle of the month and drunks out here mean fights all of us deputies and the two constables and sheriff maples had our hands full keeping things under control i dont have much trouble with drunks dad taught me they were touchy as all hell and twice as jumpy and if you didnt ruffle em or alarm em they were the easiest people in the world to get along with you should never bawl a drunk out he said because the guy had already bawled himself out to the breaking point and you should never pull a gun or swing on a drunk because he was apt to feel that his life was in danger and act accordingly so i just moved around friendly and gentle taking the guys home wherever i could instead of to jail and none of them got hurt and neither did i but it all took time from the time i went on at noon until eleven oclock i didnt so much as stop for a cup of coffee then around midnight when i was already way over shift i got one of the special jobs sheriff maples was always calling me in on a mexican pipeliner had got all hayed up on marijuana and stabbed another mexican to death the boys had roughed him up pretty badly bringing him in and now what with the hay and all he was a regular wild man theyd managed to get him off into one of the quiet cells but the way he was cutting up he was going to take it apart or die in the attempt cant handle the crazy mex the way we ought to sheriff bob grumbled not in a murder case i miss my guess weve already given some shyster defense lawyer enough to go yellin thirddegree ill see what i can do i said i went down to the cell and i stayed there three hours and i was busy every minute of it i hardly had time to slam the door before the mex dived at me i caught his arms and held him back letting him struggle and rave and then i turned him loose and he dived again i held him back again turned him loose again it went on and on i never slugged him or kicked him i never let him struggle hard enough to hurt himself i just wore him down little by little and when he quieted enough to hear me i began talking to him practically everyone in this area talks some mex but i do it better than most i talked on and on feeling him relax and all the time i was wondering about myself this mex now was about as defenseless as a man could be he was hopped up and crazy with the booting around hed had a little bit more would never have been noticed id taken a lot bigger chance with what id done to that bum the bum could have caused trouble this mex alone in a cell with me couldnt yet i didnt so much as twist a finger id never hurt a prisoner someone that i could harm safely i didnt have the slightest desire to maybe i had too much pride in my reputation for not using force or maybe i figured subconsciously that the prisoners and i were on the same side but however it was id never hurt em i didnt want to and pretty soon i wouldnt want to hurt anyone id get rid of her and it would all be over for all time after three hours like i say the mex was willing to behave so i got him his clothes back and a blanket for his bunk and let him smoke a cigarette while i tucked him in sheriff maples peeped in as i was leaving and shook his head wonderingly dont see how you do it lou he swore dagnab it if i see where you get the patience youve just got to keep smiling i said thats the answer yeah do tell he drawled thats right i said the man with the grin is the man who will win he gave me a funny look and i laughed and slapped him on the back just kidding bob i said what the hell you cant break a habit overnight and what was the harm in a little kidding the sheriff wished me a good sunday and i drove on home i fixed myself a big platter of ham and eggs and french fries and carried it into dads office i ate at his desk more at peace with myself than id been in a long time id made up my mind about one thing come hell or high water i wasnt going to marry amy stanton id been holding off on her account i didnt feel i had the right to marry her now though i just wasnt going to do it if i had to marry someone it wouldnt be a bossy little gal with a tongue like barbedwire and a mind about as narrow i carried my dishes into the kitchen washed them up and took a long hot bath then i turned in and slept like a log until ten in the morning while i was having breakfast i heard gravel crunch in the driveway and looking out i saw chester conways cadillac he came right in the house without knocking people had got in the habit of that when dad was practicing and back into the kitchen keep your seat boy keep your seat he said though i hadnt made any move to get up go right on with your breakfast thanks i said he sat down craning his neck so that he could look at the food on my plate is that coffee fresh i think ill have some hop up and get me a cup will you yes sir i drawled right away mr conway sir that didnt faze him of course that was the kind of talk he felt he was entitled to he took a noisy swill of coffee then another the third time he gulped the cup was emptied he said he wouldnt take any more without my offering him any and lighted a cigar he dropped the match on the floor puffed and dusted ashes into his cup west texans as a whole are a pretty highhanded lot but they dont walk on a man if he stands up theyre quick to respect the other fellows rights chester conway was an exception conway had been the big man in town before the oil boom hed always been able to deal with others on his own terms hed gone without opposition for so many years that by this time he hardly knew it when he saw it i believe i could have cussed him out in church and he wouldnt have turned a hair hed just have figured his ears were playing tricks on him it had never been hard for me to believe hed arranged mikes murder the fact that he did it would automatically make it all right well he said dusting ashes all over the table got everything fixed for tonight have you no chance of any slipups youll wind this thing right on up so itll stay wound im not doing anything i said ive done all im going to dont think wed better leave it that way lou member i told you i didnt like the idea well i still dont that damned crazy elmer sees her again no telling whatll happen you take the money yourself boy ive got it all ready ten thousand in small bills and no i said pay her off then bust her around a little and run her across the county line mr conway i said thats the way to do it he chuckled his big pale jowls jouncing pay her bust her and chase her you say something i went through it again real slowly dealing it out a word at a time miss lakeland insisted on seeing elmer one more time before she left she insisted on his bringing the dough and she didnt want any witnesses along those were her terms and if conway wanted her to leave quietly hed have to meet em we could have her pinched of course but she was bound to talk if we did and it wouldnt be pretty talk conway nodded irritably understand all that cant have a lot of dirty publicity but i dont see ill tell you what you dont see mr conway i said you dont see that youve got a hell of a lot of gall huh his mouth dropped open whaat im sorry i said stop and think a minute how would it look if it got around that an officer of the law had made a blackmail payoff that is if she was willing to accept it from me how do you think i feel being mixed up in a dirty affair of this kind now elmer got into this trouble and he came to me only smart thing he ever did and i came to you and you asked me to see what could be done about getting her out of town quietly i did it thats all im going to do i dont see how you can ask me to do anything more well uh he cleared his throat maybe not boy reckon youre right but you will see that she leaves after she gets the money ill see to that i said if shes not gone within an hour ill move her along myself he got up fidgeting around nervously so i walked him to the door to get rid of him i couldnt take him much longer it would have been bad enough if i hadnt known what hed done to mike i kept my hands in my pockets pretending like i didnt see him when he started to shake hands he opened the screen then hesitated a moment better not go off anywhere he said im sending elmer over as soon as i can locate him want you to give him a good talkingto see that hes got everything down straight make him know whats what understand yes sir i said its mighty nice of you to let me talk to him thats all right no trouble at all he said and the screen slammed behind him a couple hours later elmer showed up he was big and flabbylooking like his old man and he tried to be as overbearing but he didnt quite have the guts for it some of our central city boys had flattened him a few times and it had done him a world of good his blotched face was glistening with sweat his breath would have tested a hundred and eighty proof getting started pretty early in the day arent you i said so what not a thing i said ive tried to do you a favor if you ball it up its your headache he grunted and crossed his legs i dunno lou he frowned dunno about all this what if the old man never cools off whatll me and joyce do when the ten thousand runs out well elmer i said i guess theres some misunderstanding i understood that you were sure your father would come around in time if that isnt the case maybe id better tell miss lakeland and no lou dont do that hell hell get over it he always gets over the things i do but why dont you do this i said dont let your ten thousand run out buy you some kind of business you and joyce can run it together when its going good get in touch with your dad hell see that youve made a darned smart move and you wont have any trouble squaring things elmer brightened a little doggoned little working wasnt elmers idea of a good solution to any problem dont let me talk you into it i said i think miss lakeland has been mighty badly misjudged she convinced me and im not easy to convince ive stuck my neck out a mile to give you and her a fresh start together but if you dont want to go whyd you do it lou whyd you do all this for me and her maybe money i said smiling i dont make very much maybe i figured youd do something for me in a money way his face turned a few shades redder well i could give you a little something out of the ten thousand i guess oh i wouldnt take any of that youre damned right i wouldnt i figured a man like you must have a little dough of his own what do you do for your cigarettes and gas and whiskey does your dad buy em for you like hell he sat up and jerked out a roll of bills i got plenty of money he started to peel off a few bills they were all twenties it looked like and then he caught my eye i gave him a grin it told him plain as day that i expected him to act like a cheapskate aw hell he said and he wadded the roll together and tossed the whole thing to me see you tonight he said hoisting himself up at ten oclock i nodded there were twentyfive twenties in the roll five hundred dollars now that i had it it was welcome i could always use a little extra money but i hadnt planned on touching elmer id only done it to shut him up about my motives in helping him i didnt feel much like cooking so i ate dinner in town coming home again i listened to the radio a while read the sunday papers and went to sleep yes maybe i was taking things pretty calmly but id gone through the deal so often in my mind that id gotten used to it joyce and elmer were going to die joyce had asked for it the conways had asked for it i wasnt any more coldblooded than the dame whod have me in hell to get her own way i wasnt any more coldblooded than the guy whod had mike knocked from an eightstory building elmer hadnt done it of course probably he didnt even know anything about it but i had to get to the old man through him it was the only way i could and it was the way it should be id be doing to him what hed done to dad it was eight oclock when i waked up eight of the dark moonless night id been waiting for i gulped a cup of coffee eased the car down the alley and headed for derrick road here in the oil country you see quite a few places like the old branch house they were ranch houses or homesteads at one time but wells were drilled around em right up to their doorsteps sometimes and everything nearby became a mess of oil and sulphur water and red sunbaked drilling mud the greaseblack grass dies the creeks and springs disappear and then the oil is gone and the houses stand black and abandoned lost and lonely looking behind the pest growths of sunflowers and sage and johnson grass the branch place stood back from derrick road a few hundred feet at the end of a lane so overgrown with weeds that i almost missed it i turned into the lane killed the motor after a few yards and got out at first i couldnt see a thing it was that dark but gradually my eyes became used to it i could see all i needed to see i opened the trunk compartment and located a tire tool taking a rusty spike from my pocket i drove it into the right rear tire there was a poof and a whishss the springs squeaked and whined as the car settled rapidly i got a jack under the axle and raised it a foot or so i rocked the car and slid it off the jack i left it that way and headed up the lane it took maybe five minutes to reach the house and pull a plank from the porch i leaned it against the gate post where i could find it in a hurry and headed across the fields to joyces house lou she stood back from the door startled i couldnt imagine who wheres your car is something wrong nothing but a flat tire i grinned i had to leave the car down the road a piece i sauntered into the living room and she came around in front of me gripping her arms around my back and pressing her face against my shirt her negligee fell open accidentally on purpose i imagine she moved her body against mine lou honey yeah i said its only about nine and stupid wont be here for another hour and i wont see you for two weeks and well you know i knew i knew how that would look in an autopsy well i dont know baby i said im kind of pooped out and youre all prettied up oh i am not she squeezed me im always prettied up to hear you tell it hurry so i can have my bath bath that made it okay you twisted my arm baby i said and i swept her up and carried her into the bedroom and no it didnt bother me a bit because right in the middle of it right in the middle of the sweet talk and sighing she suddenly went still and pushed my head back and looked me in the eye you will join me in two weeks lou just as soon as you sell your house and wind up your affairs thats the understanding i said dont keep me waiting i want to be sweet to you but if you wont let me ill be the other way ill come back here and raise hell ill follow you around town and tell everyone how you robbed you of your bloom and cast you aside i said crazy she giggled but just the same lou i know i wont keep you waiting baby i lay on the bed while she had her bath she came back in from it wiping herself with a big towel and got some panties and a brassiere out of a suitcase she stepped into the panties humming and brought the brassiere over to me i helped her put it on giving her a pinch or two and she giggled and wiggled im going to miss you baby i thought youve got to go but im sure going to miss you lou you suppose elmer will make any trouble i already told you i said what can he do he cant squawk to his dad ill tell him i changed my mind and well have to keep faith with the old man and thatll be that she frowned it seems so oh so complicated i mean it looks like we could have got the money without dragging elmer into it well i glanced at the clock ninethirtythree i didnt need to stall any longer i sat up beside her swinging my feet to the floor casually drawing on my gloves well ill tell you baby i said it is kind of complicated but it has to be that way youve probably heard the gossip about mike dean my foster brother well mike didnt do that he took the blame for me so if you should do your talking around town it would be a lot worse than you realized people would start thinking and before it was all over but lou im not going to say anything youre going to join me and better let me finish i said i told you how mike fell from that building only he didnt fall he was murdered old man conway arranged it and lou she didnt get it at all i wont let you do anything to elmer you mustnt honey theyll catch you and youll go to jail and oh honey dont even think about it they wont catch me i said they wont even suspect me theyll think he was halfstiff like he usually is and you got to fighting and both got killed she still didnt get it she laughed frowning a little at the same time but lou that doesnt make sense how could i be dead when easy i said and i gave her a slap and still she didnt get it she put a hand to her face and rubbed it slowly yyoud better not do that now lou ive got to travel and youre not going anywhere baby i said and i hit her again and at last she got it she jumped up and i jumped with her i whirled her around and gave her a quick onetwo and she shot backwards across the room and bounced and slumped against the wall she staggered to her feet weaving mumbling and halffell toward me i let her have it again i backed her against the wall slugging and it was like pounding a pumpkin hard then everything giving away at once she slumped down her knees bent under her her head hanging limp and then slowly an inch at a time she pushed herself up again she couldnt see i dont know how she could i dont know how she could stand or go on breathing but she brought her head up wobbling and she raised her arms raised them and spread them and held them out and then she staggered toward me just as a car pulled into the yard guhguhguhby kiss guhguhguh i brought an uppercut up from the floor there was a sharp craack and her whole body shot upward and came down in a heap and that time it stayed down i wiped my gloves on her body it was her blood and it belonged there i took the gun from the dresser turned off the light and closed the door elmer was coming up the steps crossing the porch i got to the front door and opened it hiya lou ol boy ol boy ol boy he said right on time huh thass elmer conway always right on time halfstiff i said thats elmer conway have you got the money he patted the thick brown folder under his arm whats it look like wheres joyce back in the bedroom why dont you go on back ill bet she wont say no if you try to slip it to her aw he blinked foolishlyaw you shouldnt talk like that lou you know were gonna get married suit yourself i shrugged id bet money though that shes all stretched out waiting for you i wanted to laugh out loud i wanted to yell i wanted to leap on him and tear him to pieces well maybe he turned suddenly and lumbered down the hall i leaned against the wall waiting as he entered the bedroom and turned on the light i heard him say hiya joyce ol kid ol ol ol kkk i heard a heavy thump and a gurgling strangled sound then he said he screamed joyce joyce lou i sauntered back he was down on his knees and there wasblood on his hands and a big streak across his chin where hed wiped it he looked up at me his mouth hanging open i laughed i had to laugh or do something worse and his eyes squeezed shut and he bawled i yelled with laughter bending over and slapping my legs i doubled up laughing and farting and laughing some more until there wasnt a laugh in me or anyone id used up all the laughter in the world he got to his feet smearing his face with his big flabby hands staring at me stupidly wwho did it lou it was suicide i said a plain case of suicide bbut that ddont make its the only thing that does make sense it was the way it was you hear me suicide you hear me suicide suicide suicide i didnt kill her dont you say i killed her she killed herself i shot him then right in his gaping stupid mouth i emptied the gun into him stooping i curved joyces hand around the gun butt then dropped the gun at her side i went out the door and across the fields again and i didnt look back i found the plank and carried it down to my car if the car had been seen that plank was my alibi id had to go up and find one to put under the jack i ran the jack up on the plank and put on the spare tire i threw the tools into the car started the motor and backed toward derrick road ordinarily id no more back into a highway at night without my lights than i would without my pants but this wasnt ordinarily i just didnt think of it if chester conways cadillac had been traveling faster i wouldnt be writing this he swarmed out of his car cursing saw who i was and cursed harder than ever goddamit lou you know bettern that you trying to get killed for christs sake huh what the hell are you doing here anyhow i had to pull in there with a flat tire i said sorry if i well come on lets get going cant stand here gabbing at night going i said its still early the hell it is its a quarter past eleven and that damned elmer aint home yet promised to come right back and he aint done it probably up there working himself into another scrape maybe wed better give him a little more time i said i had to wait a while i couldnt go back in that house now why dont you go on home mr conway and ill im going now he turned away from the car and you follow me the door of the cadillac slammed he backed up and pulled around me yelling again for me to come on i yelled back that i would and he drove off fast i got a cigar lit i started the motor and killed it i started it and killed it again finally it stayed running it just wouldnt die so i drove off i drove up the lane at joyces house and parked at the end of it there wasnt room in the yard with elmers and the old mans cars there i shut off the motor and got out i climbed the steps and crossed the porch the door was open and he was in the living room talking on the telephone and his face was like a knife had come down it slicing away all the flabbiness he didnt seem very excited he didnt seem very sad he was just businesslike and somehow that made it worse sure its too bad he said dont tell me that again i know all about how bad it is hes dead and thats that and what im interested in is her well do it then get on out here we aint going to let her die get me not this way im going to see that she burns it was almost three oclock in the morning when i got through talking answering questions mostly to sheriff maples and the county attorney howard hendricks and i guess you know i wasnt feeling so good i was kind of sick to my stomach and i felt well pretty damned sore angry things shouldnt have turned out this way it was just plumb unreasonable it wasnt right id done everything i could to get rid of a couple of undesirable citizens in a neat nokickbacks way and here one of em was still alive and purple hell was popping about the other one leaving the courthouse i drove to the greeks place and got a cup of coffee that i didnt want his boy had taken a parttime job in a filling station and the old man wasnt sure whether it was a good thing or not i promised to drop by and look in on the lad i didnt want to go home and answer a lot more questions from amy i hoped that if i stalled long enough shed give up and leave johnnie pappas the greeks boy was working at slim murphys place he was around at the side of the station when i drove in doing something to the motor of his hot rod i got out of my car and he came toward me slowly sort of watchfully wiping his hands on a chunk of waste just heard about your new job johnnie i said congratulations yeah he was tall goodlooking not at all like his father dad send you out here he told me youd gone to work here i said anything wrong with that well youre up pretty late well i laughed so are you now how about filling er up with gas and checking the oil he got busy and by the time he was through hed pretty much lost his suspicions im sorry if i acted funny lou dads been kind of nagging me he just cant understand that a guy my age needs a little real dough of his own and i thought he was having you check up on me you know me better than that johnnie sure i do he smiled warmly ive got plenty of nagging from people but no one but you ever really tried to help me youre the only real friend ive ever had in this lousy town why do you do it lou whats the percentage in bothering with a guy that everyone else is down on oh i dont know i said and i didnt i didnt even know how i could stand here talking to him with the terrible load i had on my mind maybe its because i was a kid myself not so many years ago fathers are funny the best ones get in your hair most yeah well what hours do you work johnnie just midnight to seven saturdays and sundays just enough to keep me in pocket money dad thinks ill be too tired to go to school on mondays but i wont lou ill make it fine sure you will i said theres just one thing johnnie slim murphy hasnt got a very good reputation weve never proved that he was mixed up in any of these carstripping jobs but i know he kicked the gravel of the driveway uncomfortably i wont get into any trouble lou good enough i said thats a promise and i know you dont break your promises i paid him with a twenty dollar bill got my change and headed toward home wondering about myself shaking my head as i drove i hadnt put on an act i was concerned and worried about the kid me worried about his troubles the house was all dark when i got home but it would be whether amy was there or not so i didnt get my hopes too high i figured that my standing her up would probably make her all the more determined to stay that she was a cinch to crop up at the one time i didnt want any part of her thats the way i figured it and thats the way it was she was up in my bedroom in bed and shed filled two ashtrays with the cigarettes shed smoked and mad ive never seen one little old girl so mad in my life i sat down on the edge of the bed and pulled off my boots and for about the next twenty minutes i didnt say a word i didnt get a chance finally she began to slow up a little and i tried to apologize im sure sorry honey but i couldnt help it ive had a lot of trouble tonight ill bet you want to hear about it or not if you dont just say so oh go on ive heard so many of your lies and excuses i may as well hear a few more i told her what had happened that is what was supposed to have happened and she could hardly hold herself in until id finished the last word was hardly out of my mouth before shed cut loose on me again how could you be so stupid lou how could you do it getting yourself mixed up with some wretched prostitute and that awful elmer conway now therell be a big scandal and youll probably lose your job and why i mumbled i didnt do anything i want to know why you did it well it was kind of a favor see chester conway wanted me to see what i could do about getting elmer out of this scrape so why did he have to come to you why do you always have to be doing favors for other people you never do any for me i didnt say anything for a minute but i thought thats what you think honey im doing you a favor by not beating your head off answer me lou ford all right i said i shouldnt have done it you shouldnt have allowed that woman to stay in this county in the first place no i nodded i shouldnt have well im not perfect i snapped i make plenty of mistakes how many times do you want me to say it well all ive got to say is all she had to say would take her the rest of her life to finish and i wasnt even halfway in the mood for it i reached out and grabbed her by the crotch lou you stop that why i said yyou stop it she shivered you sstop or oh lou i lay down beside her with my clothes on i had to do it because there was just one way of shutting amy up so i laid down and she swarmed up against me and there wasnt a thing wrong with amy when she was like that you couldnt have asked much more from a woman but there was plenty wrong with me joyce lakeland was wrong with me lou amy slowed down a little whats the matter dear all this trouble i said i guess its thrown me for a loop you poor darling just forget everything but me and ill pet you and whisper to you mmm ill she kissed me and whispered what she would do and she did it and hell she might as well have done it to a fence post baby joyce had taken care of me but good amy pulled her hand away and began brushing it against her hip then she snatched up a handful of sheet and wiped scrubbed her hip with it you sonofabitch she said you dirty filthy bastard whaat i said it was like getting a punch in the guts amy didnt go in for cussing at least id never heard her do much youre dirty i can tell i can smell it on you smell her you cant wash it off itll never come off you jesus christ i grabbed her by the shoulders what are you saying amy you screwed her youve been doing it all along youve been putting her dirty insides inside of me smearing me with her and im going to make you pay for it if its the last thing i ever ddo ill she jerked away from me sobbing and jumped out of bed as i got up she backed around a chair putting it between me and her kkeep away from me dont you dare touch me why sure honey i said whatever you say she didnt see the meaning yet of what shed said all she could think of was herself the insult to herself but i knew that given enough time and not much at that shed put all the parts of the picture together she wouldnt have any real proof of course all she had to go on was guesswork intuition and that operation id had something thank god which seemed to have slipped her mind for the moment anyway shed talk and the fact that there wasnt any proof for what she said wouldnt help me much you dont need proof know what i mean not from what ive seen of the law in operation all you need is a tip that a guy is guilty from then on unless hes a big shot its just a matter of making him admit it amy i said amy honey look at me i ddont want to look at you look at me this is lou honey lou ford remember the guy youve known all your fife i ask you now would i do what you said i did she hesitated biting her lips you did do it her voice was just a shade uncertain i know you did you dont know anything i said just because im tired and upset you jump to a crazy conclusion why why would i fool around with some chippy when i had you what could a dame like that give me that would make me run the risk of losing a girl like you huh now that doesnt make sense does it honey well that had got to her it had hit her right in the pride where she was tenderest but it wasnt quite enough to jar her loose from her hunch she picked up her panties and began putting them on still standing behind the chair theres no use arguing about it lou she said wearily i suppose i can thank my lucky stars that i havent caught some terrible disease but dammit i moved around the chair suddenly and got her in my arms dammit stop talking that way about the girl im going to marry i dont mind for myself but you cant say it about her get me you cant say that the girl im going to marry would sleep with a guy who plays around with whores let me go lou let she stopped struggling abruptly what did you you heard me i said bbut just two days ago so what i said no man likes to be yanked into marriage he wants to do his own proposing which is just what im doing right now hell weve already put it off too long in my opinion this crazy business tonight proves it if we were married we wouldnt have all these quarrels and misunderstandings like weve been having since that woman came to town you mean all right i said ive done all i could if youre willing to believe that about me i wouldnt want wait lou she hung on to me after all you cant blame me if and she let it go at that she had to give up for her own sake im sorry lou of course i was wrong you certainly were when shall we do it lou get married i mean the sooner the better i lied i didnt have the slightest intention of marrying her but i needed time to do some planning and i had to keep her quiet lets get together in a few days when were both more ourselves and talk about it huhuh she shook her head now that youve weve come to the decision lets go through with it lets talk about it right now but its getting daylight honey i said if youre still here even a little while from now people will see you when you leave i dont care if they do darling i dont care a teensyweensie little bit she snuggled against me burrowing her head against my chest and without seeing her face i knew she was grinning she had me on the run and she was getting a hell of a kick out of it well im pretty tired i said i think i ought to sleep a little while before ill make you some coffee darling thatll wake you up but honey the phone rang she let go of me not very hurriedly and i stepped over to the writing desk and picked up the extension lou it was sheriff bob maples yeah bob i saidwhats on your mind he told me and i said okay and hung up the phone again amy looked at me and changed her mind about popping off your job lou youve got some work to do yeah i nodded sheriff bobs driving by to pick me up in a few moments you poor dear and you so tired ill get dressed and get right out i helped her dress and walked to the back door with her she gave me a couple of big kisses and i promised to call her as soon as i got a chance she left then a couple of minutes before sheriff maples drove up the county attorney howard hendricks was with him sitting in the back seat of the car i gave him a coldeyed look and a nod as i got in the front and he gave me back the look without a nod id never had much use for him he was one of those professional patriots always talking about what a great hero hed been in the war sheriff bob put the car in gear clearing his throat uncomfortably sure hated to bother you lou he said hope i didnt interrupt anything ndthing that cant wait i said she id already kept her waiting fivesix hours you had a date for last night asked hendricks thats right i didnt turn around in the seat for what time for a little after ten the time i figured id have the conway business finished the county attorney grunted he sounded more than a mite disappointed who was the girl none of your wait a minute lou bob eased his foot off the gas and turned onto derrick road howard youre getting way out of line youre kind of a newcomer out this way been here eight years now aint you but you still ought to know bettern to ask a man a question like that what the hell said hendricks its my job its an important question if ford had himself a date last night it well he hesitated it shows that he planned on being there instead of well uh some place else you see what i mean ford i saw all right but i wasnt going to tell him so i was just old dumb lou from kalamazoo i wouldnt be thinking about an alibi because i hadnt done anything to need an alibi for no i drawled i reckon i dont know what you mean to come right down to cases and no offense meant i figured youd done all the jawing you had to do when i talked to you an hour or so ago well youre dead wrong brother he glared at me redfaced in the rearview mirror ive got quite a few more questions and im still waiting for the answer to the last one i asked who was the drop it howard bob jerked his head curtly dont ask lou that again or im personally going to lose my temper i know the girl i know her folks shes one of the nicest little ladies in town and i aint got the slightest doubt lou had a date with her hendricks scowled gave out with an irritated laugh i dont get it shes not too nice to sl well skip it but shes too nice to have her name mentioned in the strictest confidence im damned if i can understand a deal like that the more im around you people the less i can understand you i turned around smiling looking friendly and serious for a while anyway it wasnt a good idea to have anyone sore at me and a guy thats got something on his conscience cant afford to get riled i guess were a pretty stiffnecked lot out here howard i said i suppose it comes from the fact that this country was never very thickly settled and a man had to be doggoned careful of the way he acted or hed be marked for life i mean there wasnt any crowd for him to sink into he was always out where people could see him so so if a man or woman does something nothing bad you understand but the kind of thing men and women have always been doing you dont let on that you know anything about it you dont because sooner or later youre going to need the same kind of favor yourself you see how it is its the only way we can go on being human and still hold our heads up he nodded indifferently very interesting well here we are bob sheriff maples pulled off the pavement and parked on the shoulder of the road we got out and hendricks nodded toward the weedgrown trail which led up to the old branch house he jerked his head at it and then turned and looked at me do you see that track through there ford do you know what caused that why i reckon so i said a flat tire you admit that you concede that a track of that kind would have to be there if you had a flat tire i pushed back my stetson and scratched my head i looked at bob frowning a little i dont guess i see what you boys are driving at i said whats this all about bob of course i did see i saw that id made one hell of a bonehead play id guessed it as soon as i saw the track through the weeds and i had an answer ready but i couldnt come out with it too fast it had to be done easylike this is howards show said the sheriff maybe youd better answer him lou okay i shrugged ive already said it once a flat tire makes that kind of track do you know said hendricks slowly when that track was made i aint got the slightest idea i said all i know is that my car didnt make it youre a damned li huh hendricks mouth dropped open foolishly bbut i didnt have a flat when i turned off the highway now wait a minute you maybe you better wait a minute sheriff bob interrupted i dont recollect lou tellin us his tire went flat here on derrick road dont recall his sayin anything of the kind if i did say it i said i sure as heck didnt mean to i knew i had a puncture sure i felt the car sway a little but i turned off in the lane before the tire could really go down bob nodded and glanced at hendricks the county attorney suddenly got busy lighting a cigarette i dont know which was redder his face or the sun pushing up over the hills i scratched my head again well i said ireckon its none of my business but i sure hope you fellows didnt chew up a good tire makin that track hendricks mouth was working bobs old eyes sparkled off in the distance somewhere maybe threefour miles away there was a suckwhush as a mudhog drilling pump began to growl suddenly the sheriff whuffed and coughed and let out a wild whoop of laughter haw haw haw he boomed doggone it howard if this aint the funniest haw haw haw and then hendricks started laughing too restrained uncomfortable at first then plain unashamed laughter i stood looking on grinning puzzledly like a guy who wanted to join in but didnt know the score i was glad now that id made that bonehead mistake when a mans rope slides off you once hes mighty cautious about making a second throw hendricks slapped me on the back im a damned fool lou i should have known better say i said letting it dawn on me at last you dont mean you thought i of course we didnt think so said bob warmly nothing of the kind it was just something that had to be looked into hendricks explained we had to have an answer for it now you didnt talk much to conway last night did you no i said it didnt seem to me like a very good time to do much talking well i talked to him bob i did rather he talked to us and hes really raring and tearing this woman whats her name lakeland is as good as dead the doctors say shell never regain consciousness so conway isnt going to be able to lay the blame for this mess on her naturally then hell want to stick someone else with it hell be snatching at straws thats why we have to head him off on anything that looks uh even mildly peculiar but shucks i said anyone could see what happened elmerd been drinking and he tried to push her around and sure but conway dont want to admit that and he wont admit it if theres any way out we all rode in the front seat going back to town i was in the middle squeezed in between the sheriff and hendricks and all of a sudden a crazy notion came over me maybe i hadnt fooled em maybe they were putting on an act just like i was maybe that was why theyd put me in the middle so i couldnt jump out of the car it was a crazy idea of course and it was gone in a moment but i started a little before i could catch myself feelin twitchy said bob just hunger pains i grinned i havent eaten since yesterday afternoon wouldnt mind a bite myself bob nodded how about you howard might be a good idea mind stopping by the courthouse first huhuh said bob we go by there and were apt not to get away you can call from the restaurant call my office too while youre at it word of what had happened was already all over town and there was a lot of whispering and gawking as we pulled up in front of the restaurant i mean there was a lot of whispering and gawking from the newcomers the oil workers and so on the old timers just nodded and went on about their business hendricks stopped to use the telephone and bob and i sat down in a booth we ordered ham and eggs all around and pretty soon hendricks came back that conway he snapped sliding in across from us now he wants to fly that woman into fort worth says she cant get the right kind of medical attention here yeah bob looked down at the menu casually what time is he takin her im not at all sure that he is im the man that has the sayso on handling this case why she hasnt even been booked yet let alone arraigned we havent had a chance cant see that it makes much difference said bob as long as shes going to die thats not the point the point is yeah sure drawled bob you like to take a little trip into fort worth lou maybe ill go along myself why i guess i could i said i reckon well do that then okay howard thatll take care of the technicalities for you the waitress set food in front of us and bob picked up his knife and fork i felt his boot kick mine under the table hendricks knew how things stood but he was too much of a phoney to admit it he had to go on playing the big hero the county attorney that didnt take orders from anyone now see here bob maybe im new here as you see it maybe ive got a lot to learn but by god i know the law and so do i the sheriff nodded the one that aint on the books conway wasnt asking you if he could take her to fort worth he was telling you did he mention what time well hendricks swallowed heavily ten this morning he thought he wanted to hes chartering one of the airlines twinmotor jobs and theyve got to fit it up with oxygen and a uhhuh well that ought to be all right lou and mell have time to scrub up a little and pack a bag ill drop you off at your place lou as soon as we finish here fine i said hendricks didnt say anything after a minute or two bob glanced at him and raised his eyebrows something wrong with your eggs son better eat em before they get cold hendricks heaved a sigh and began to eat bob and i were at the airport quite a bit ahead of time so we went ahead and got on the plane and made ourselves comfortable some workmen were pounding around in the baggage compartment fixing things up according to the doctors instructions but tired as we were it would have taken more than that to keep us awake bob began to nod first then i closed my eyes figuring to just rest them a little and i guess i must have gone right to sleep i didnt even know when we took off one minute i was closing my eyes the next it seemed like bob was shaking me and pointing out the window there she is lou theres cow town i looked out and down i felt kind of disappointed id never been out of the county before and now that i was sure joyce wasnt going to live i could have enjoyed seeing the sights as it was i hadnt seen anything id wasted all my time sleeping wheres mr conway i asked back in the baggage compartment i just went back for a look myself she shes still unconscious uhhuh and she aint ever going to be any other way if you ask me he shook his head solemnly conway dont know when hes well off if that noaccount elmer wasnt already dead hed be swingin from a tree about now yeah i said its pretty bad all right dont know what would possess a man to do a thing like that dogged if i do dont see how he could be drunk enough or mean enough to do it i guess its my fault i said i shouldnt have ever let her stay in town weel i told you to use your own judgment and she was a mighty cute little trick from all i hear id probably have let her stay myself if id been in your place im sure sorry bob i said i sure wish id come to you instead of trying to handle this blackmail deal myself yeah he nodded slowly but i reckon weve been over that ground enough its done now and theres nothing we can do about it talking and fretting about mighthavebeens wont get us anywhere no i said i guess theres no use crying over spilled milk the plane began to circle and lose altitude and we fastened our seat belts a couple of minutes later we were skimming along the landing field and a police car and ambulance were keeping pace with us the plane stopped and the pilot came out of his compartment and unlocked the door bob and i got out and watched while the doctor supervised the unloading of the stretcher the upper part of it was closed in kind of a little tent and all i could see was the outline of her body under the sheet then i couldnt even see that they were hustling her off toward the ambulance and a heavy hand came down on my shoulder lou said chester conway you come with me in the police car well i said glancing at bob i kind of figured on you come with me he repeated sheriff you ride in the ambulance well see you at the hospital bob pushed back his stetson and gave him a hard sharp look then his face sort of sagged and he turned and walked away his scuffed boots dragging against the pavement id been pretty worried about how to act around conway now seeing the way hed pushed old bob maples around i was just plain sore i jerked away from his hand and got into the police car i kept my head turned as conway climbed in and slammed the door the ambulance started up and headed off the field we followed it conway leaned forward and closed the glass partition between our seat and the drivers didnt like that did you he grunted well there may be a lot of things you dont like before this is over ive got the reputation of my dead boy at stake understand my own reputation im looking out for that and nothing but that and i aint standing on etiquette im not letting someones tender feelings get in my way i dont suppose you would i said itd be pretty hard to start in at your time of life i wished immediately that i hadnt said it i was giving myself away you see but he didnt seem to have heard me like always he wasnt hearing anything he didnt want to hear theyre operating on that woman as soon as she gets to the hospital he went on if she pulls through the operation shell be able to talk by tonight i want you there at that time just as soon as she comes out of the anesthetic well i said bob maples is all right but hes too old to be on his toes hes liable to foul up the works right when you need him most thats why im letting him go on now when it dont matter whether anyones around or not i dont know as i understand you i said you mean ive got rooms reserved at a hotel ill drop you off there and you stay there until i call you get some rest understand get rested up good sos youll be on your toes and raring to go when the time comes all right i shrugged but i slept all the way up on the plane sleep some more then you may have to be up all night the hotel was on west seventh street a few blocks from the hospital and conway had engaged a whole suite of rooms the assistant manager of the place went up with me and the bellboy and a couple of minutes after they left a waiter brought in a tray of whiskey and ice and right behind him came another waiter with a flock of sandwiches and coffee i poured myself a nice drink and took it over by the window i sat down in a big easy chair and propped my boots up on the radiator i leaned back grinning conway was a big shot all right he could push you around and make you like it he could have places like this with people jumping sideways to wait on him he could have everything but what he wanted his son and a good name his son had beaten a whore to death and shed killed him and hed never be able to live it down not if he lived to be a hundred and i damned well hoped he would i ate part of a clubhouse sandwich but it didnt seem to set so well so i fixed another big drink and took it over to the window i felt kind of restless and uneasy i wished i could get out and wander around the town fort worth is the beginning of west texas and i wouldnt have felt conspicuous dressed as i was like i would have in dallas or houston i could have had a fine time seen something new for a change and instead i had to stay here by myself doing nothing seeing nothing thinking the same old thoughts it was like there was a plot against me almost id done something wrong way back when i was a kid and id never been able to get away from it id had my nose rubbed in it day after day until like an overtrained dog id started crapping out of pure fright and now here i was i poured another drink here i was now but it wouldnt be like this much longer joyce was bound to die if she wasnt dead already id got rid of her and id got rid of it the sickness when i did it and just as soon as things quieted down id quit my job and sell the house and dads practice and pull out amy stanton well i shook my head she wasnt going to stop me she wasnt going to keep me chained there in central city i didnt know just how id break away from her but i knew darned well that i would some way somehow more or less to kill time i took a long hot bath and afterwards i tried the sandwiches and coffee again i paced around the room eating and drinking coffee moving from window to window i wished we werent up so high sos i could see a little something i tried taking a nap and that was no good i got a shine cloth out of the bathroom and began rubbing at my boots id got one brushed up real good and was starting on the toe of the second when bob maples came in he said hello casually and fixed himself a drink he sat down looking into the glass twirling the ice around and around i was sure sorry about what happened there at the airport bob i said i reckon you know i wanted to stick with you yeah he said shortly i let conway know i didnt like it i said and he said yeah again forget it just drop it will you well surei nodded whatever you say bob i watched him out of the corner of my eye as i went ahead rubbing the boot he acted mad and worried almost disgusted you might say but i was pretty sure it wasnt over anything id done in fact i couldnt see that conway had done enough to upset him like this is your rheumatism bothering you again i said why dont you face around on the straight chair where i can get at your shoulder muscles and ill he raised his head and looked up at me and his eyes were clear but somehow there seemed to be tears behind them slowly slowly like he was talking to himself he began to speak i know what you are dont i lou know you backwards and forwards known you since you was kneehigh to a grasshopper and i never knowed a bad thing about you know just what youre goin to say and do no matter what youre up against like there at the airport seeing conway order me around a lot of men in your place would have got a big bang out of that but i knew you wouldnt i knew youd feel a lot more hurt about it than i did thats the way you are and you wouldnt know how to be any other way bob i said you got something on your mind bob itll keep he said i reckon itll have to keep for a while i just wanted you to know that i i yes bob itll keep he repeated like i said itll have to keep and he clinked the ice in his glass staring down at it that howard hendricks he went on now howard ought tove known bettern to put you through that foolishness this morning course hes got his job to do same as i got mine and a man cant let friendship stand in the way of duty but oh hell bob i said i didnt think anything of that well i did i got to thinking about it this afternoon after we left the airport i thought about how youd have acted if youd have been in my place and me in yours oh i reckon youd have been pleasant and friendly because thats the way youre built but you wouldnt have left any doubt as to where you stood youd have said look now bob maples is a friend of mine and i know hes straight as a string so if theres something we want to know lets just up and ask him lets dont play no little twobit sheepherders tricks on him like he was on one side of the fence and we was on the other thats what youd have done but me well i dont know lou maybe im behind the times maybe im getting too old for this job it looked to me like he might have something there he was getting old and unsure of himself and conway had probably given him a hell of a riding that i didnt know about you had some trouble at the hospital bob i said yeah he hesitated i had some trouble he got up and poured more whiskey into his glass then he moved over to the window and stood rocking on his heels his back turned to me shes dead lou she never came out of the ether well i said we all knew she didnt stand a chance everyone but conway and he was just too stubborn to see reason he didnt say anything i walked over to the window by him and put my arm around his shoulders look bob i said i dont know what conway said to you but dont let it get you down where the hell does he get off at anyway he wasnt even going to have us come along on this trip we had to deal ourselves in then when we got back here he wants us to jump whenever he hollers frog and he raises hell when things dont go to suit him he shrugged a little or maybe he just took a deep breath i let my arm slide from his shoulders hesitated a moment thinking he was about to say something then went into the bathroom and closed the door when a mans feeling low sometimes the best thing to do is leave him alone i sat down on the edge of the tub and lighted a cigar i sat thinking standing outside of myself thinking about myself and bob maples hed always been pretty decent to me and i liked him but no more i suppose than i liked a lot of other people when it came right down to cases he was just one of hundreds of people i knew and was friendly with and yet here i was fretting about his problems instead of my own of course that might be partly because id known my problems were pretty much settled id known that joyce couldnt live that she wasnt going to talk she might have regained consciousness for a while but she sure as hell wouldnt have talked not after what had happened to her face but knowing that i was safe couldnt entirely explain my concern for him because id been damned badly rattled after the murder i hadnt been able to reason clearly to accept the fact that i had to be safe yet id tried to help the greeks boy johnnie pappas the door slammed open and i looked up bob grinned at me broadly his face flushed whiskey slopping to the floor from his glass hey he said you runnin out on me lou come on in here an keep me company sure bob i said sure i will and i went back into the living room with him he flopped down into a chair and he drained his drink at a gulp lets do something lou lets go out and paint old cow town red just men you huh what about conway thell with him hes got some business here stayin over for a few days well check our bags somewheres sos we wont have to run into him again and then well have a party he made a grab for the bottle and got it on the second try i took it away from him and filled his glass myself that sounds fine bob i said id sure like to do that but shouldnt we be getting back to central city i mean with conway feeling the way he does it might not look good for us i said thell with him said it an thats what i meant well sure but done enough for conway done too much done moren any white man should now cmon and slide into them boots an lets go i said sure sure i would id do just that but i had a bad callus and id have to trim it first so maybe as long as hed have to wait hed better lie down and take a little nap he did it after a little grumbling and protesting i called the railroad station and reserved a bedroom on the eight oclock train to central city it would cost us a few dollars personally since the county would only pay for firstclass pullman fare but i figured we were going to need privacy i was right i woke him up at sixthirty to give him plenty of time to get ready and he seemed worse off than before his nap i couldnt get him to take a bath he wouldnt drink any coffee or eat instead he started hitting the whiskey again and when we left the hotel he took a full bottle with him by the time i got him on the train i was as frazzled as a cows hide under a branding iron i wondered what in the name of god conway had said to him i wondered and hell i should have known because hed as good as told me it was as plain as the nose on my face and id just been too close to it to see it maybe though it was a good thing i didnt know for there was nothing to be done about it nothing i could do and id have been sweating blood well that was about the size of my trip to the big town my first trip outside the county straight to the hotel from the plane straight to the train from the hotel then the long ride home at night when there was nothing to see closed in with a crying drunk once around midnight a little while before he went to sleep his mind must have wandered for all of a sudden his fist wobbled out and poked me in the chest hey i said watch yourself bob wash watch yself he mumbled stop man with grin smile worthwhile sstop all a stuff spilt milk n so on wha you do that for anyway aw i said i was only kidding bob ttell you somethin he said ttell you somethin i bet you never thought of yeah its its always lightest jjust before the dark tired as i was i laughed you got it wrongs bob i said you mean huhuh he said you got it wrong we got into central city around six in the morning and bob took a taxi straight home he was sick really sick not just hungover he was too old a man to pack away the load hed had i stopped by the office but everything was pretty quiet according to the night deputy so i went on home too i had a lot more hours in than id been paid for no one could have faulted me if id taken a week off which naturally i didnt intend to do i changed into some fresh clothes and made some scrambled eggs and coffee as i sat down to eat the phone rang i supposed it was the office or maybe amy checking up on me shed have to call early or wait until four when her school day was over i went to the phone trying to think of some dodge to get out of seeing her and when i heard joe rothmans voice it kind of threw me know who it is lou he said remember our late talk sure i said about the uhbuilding situation id ask you to drop around tonight but i have to take a little jaunt to san angelo would you mind if i stopped by your house a few minutes well i said i guess you could is it something important a small thing but important lou a matter of a few words of reassurance well maybe i could im sure you could but i think id better see you he said and he clicked up the receiver i hung up my phone and went back to my breakfast it was still early the chances were that no one would see him anyway he wasnt a criminal opinion in some quarters to the contrary he came about five minutes later i offered him some breakfast not putting much warmth into the invitation since i didnt want him hanging around and he said no thanks but sat down at the table with me well lou he said starting to roll a cigarette i imagine you know what i want to hear i think so i nodded consider it said the very discreet newspaper stories are correct in their hints he tried to dish it out and got it thrown back at nim thats the way it looks i cant think of any other explanation i couldnt help wondering he said moistening the paper of his cigarette i couldnt help wondering how a woman with her face caved in and her neck broken could score six bullseyes on a man even one as large as the late unlamented elmer conway he looked up slowly until his eyes met mine i shrugged probably she didnt fire all the shots at one time she was shooting him while he was punching her hell shed hardly stand there and take it until he got through and then start shooting it doesnt seem that she would does it he nodded yet from the smattering of information i can gather she must have done exactly that she was still alive after he died and almost any one well two of the bullets she put into him was enough to lay him low ergo she must have acquired the broken neck et cetera before she did her shooting i shook my head i had to get my eyes away from his you said you wanted reassurance i said you you the genuine article lou no substitutes accepted and im still waiting to get it i dont know where you get off at questioning me i said the sheriff and the county attorney are satisfied thats all i care about thats the way you see it eh thats the way i see it well ill tell you how i see it i get off questioning you because im involved in the matter not directly perhaps but but not indirectly either exactly i knew you had it in for the conways in fact i did everything i could to set you against the old man morally perhaps even legally i share the responsibility for any untoward action you might take at any rate well say i and the unions i head could be placed in a very unfavorable light you said it i said its your own statement but dont ride that horse too hard lou i dont hold still for murder incidentally whats the score as of to date one or two shes dead she died yesterday afternoon i wont buy it lou if it was murder your doing i cant say offhand what i will do but i wont let you ride i couldnt youd wind up getting me into something even worse oh hell i said what are we the girls dead and elmers dead so regardless of how funny things look and this deal should have put the courthouse crowd into hysterics they cant prove anything if they knew what i know about your having a motive for killing her why would i want to do that well he began to slow down a little leave her out of it say that she was just an instrument for getting back at conway a piece of stage setting you know that doesnt make sense i said about the other this socalled motive id had it for six years id known about mikes accident that long why would i wait six years and then all of a sudden decide to pull this beat some poor whore to a pulp just to get at chester conways son now tell me if that sounds logical just tell me joe rothman frowned thoughtfully his fingers drumming upon the table no he said slowly it doesnt sound logical thats the trouble the man who walked away from that job if he walked away you know he didnt joe so you say so i say i said so everyone says youd say so yourself if you didnt know how i felt about the conways put that out of your mind once and what do you have why just a double murder two people getting in a brawl and killing each other under kind of puzzling circumstances he smiled wryly id call that the understatement of the century lou i cant tell you what happened i said because i wasnt there but i know there are flukes in murder the same as there are in anything else a man crawls a mile with his brains blown out a woman calls the police after shes shot through the heart a man is hanged and poisoned and chopped up and shot and he goes right on living dont ask me why those things are i dont know but i do know they happen and so do you rothman looked at me steadily then his head jerked a little nodding i guess so lou he said i guess youre clean at least ive been sitting here watching you putting together everything i know about you and i couldnt make it tally with the picture ive got of that guy screwy as things are that would be even screwier you dont fit the part to coin a phrase what do i say to that i said not a thing lou i should be thanking you for lifting a considerable load from my mind however if you dont mind my going into your debt a little further yes whats the lowdown just for my own information ill concede that you didnt have a killing hate for conway but you did hate him what are you trying to pull off id been expecting that question since the night id talked to him i had the answer all ready the money was supposed to be a payoff to get her out of town conway was paying her to go away and leave elmer alone actually elmer was going to leave with her right rothman got up and put on his hat well i cant find it in my heart to chide you for the stunt despite its unfortunate outcome i almost wish id thought of it aw i said it wasnt nothing much just a matter of a will finding a way ooof he said what are conways feelings by the way well i dont think he feels real good i said probably something he ate he nodded dont you imagine but watch that stuff lou watch it save it for those birds he left i got the newspapers out of the yard yesterday afternoons and this mornings poured more coffee and sat back down at the table as usual the papers had given me all the breaks instead of making me look like a boob or a busybody which they could have done easily enough they had me down as a kind of combination j edgar hooverlombroso the shrewd sheriffs sleuth whose unselfish intervention in the affair came to naught due only to the unpredictable quirks of alltoohuman behavior i laughed choking on the coffee i was starting to swallow in spite of all id been through i was beginning to feel nice and relaxed joyce was dead not even rothman suspected me and when you passed clean with that guy you didnt have anything to worry about it was sort of an acid test you might say i debated calling up the newspapers and complimenting them on their accuracy i often did that spread a little sunshine you know and they ate it up i could say something i laughed i could say something about truth being stranger than fiction and maybe add something like well murder will out or the best laid plans of mice and men i stopped laughing i was supposed to be over that stuff rothman had warned me about it and itd got bob maples goat but well why shouldnt i if i wanted to if it helped to take the tension out of me it was in character it fitted in with that dull goodnatured guy who couldnt do anything bad if he tried rothman himself had remarked that no matter how screwy things looked seeing me as a murderer was even screwier and my talk was a big part of me part of the guy that had thrown em all off the trail if i suddenly stopped talking that way what would people think why i just about had to keep on whether i wanted to or not the choice was out of my hands but of course id take it kind of easy not overdo it i reasoned it all out and wound up still feeling good but i decided not to call the newspapers after all the stories had been more than fair to me but it hadnt cost em anything they had to fill space some way and i didnt care too much about a number of the details what they said about joyce for example she wasnt a shabby sister of sin she hadnt for christs sake loved not wisely but too well she was just a cute little ol gal whod latched onto the wrong guy or the right guy in the wrong place she hadnt wanted anything else nothing else and shed got it nothing amy stanton called a little after eight oclock and i asked her to come over that night the best way to stall i figured was not to stall not to put any opposition to her if i didnt hang back shed stop pushing me and after all she couldnt get married on an hours notice thered be all sorts of things to attend to and discuss god how theyd have to be discussed even the size of the douche bag to take along on our honeymoon and long before she was through id be in shape to pull out of central city after id finished talking to her i went into dads laboratory lighted the bunsen burner and put an intravenous needle and an ordinary hypodermic on to boil then i looked along the shelves until i found a carton each of male hormone acth bcomplex and sterile water dads stock of drugs was getting old of course but the pharmaceutical houses still kept sending us samples the samples were what i used i mixed up an intravenous of the acth bcomplex and water and put it into my right arm i shot the hormone into my hip and i was set for the night amy wouldnt be disappointed again she wouldnt have anything to wonder about whether my trouble had been psychosomatic or real the result of tension or too much joyce i wouldnt have it tonight little amy would be tamed down for a week i went up to my bedroom and went to sleep i woke up at noon when the refinery whistles began to blow then dozed off again and slept until after two sometimes most of the time i should say i can sleep eighteen hours and still not feel rested well im not tired exactly but i hate to get up i just want to stay where i am and not talk to anyone or see anyone today though it was different just the opposite i could hardly wait to get cleaned up and be out and doing something i showered and shaved standing under the cold water a long time because that medicine was really working i got into a clean tan shirt and put on a new black bow tie and took a freshly pressed blue suit out of the closet i fixed and ate a bite of lunch and called sheriff maples house his wife answered the phone she said that bob was feeling kind of poorly and that the doctor thought hed better stay in bed for a day or two he was asleep right then and she kind of hated to wake him up but if there was anything important i just wondered how he was i said thought i might drop by for a few minutes well thats mighty nice of you lou ill tell him you called when he wakes up maybe you can come by tomorrow if hes not up and around by then fine i said i tried to read a while but i couldnt concentrate i wondered what to do with myself now that i did have a day off i couldnt shoot pool or bowl it didnt look good for a cop to hang around pool halls and bowling alleys it didnt look good for em to go into bars it didnt look good for them to be seen in a show in the daytime i could drive around take a ride by myself that was about all gradually the good feeling began to leave me i got the car out and headed for the courthouse hank butterby the office deputy was reading the paper his boots up on the desk his jaws moving on a cud of tobacco he asked me if it was hot enough for me and whyn hell i didnt stay home when i had a chance i said well you know how it is hank nice goin he said nodding at the paper right pretty little piece they got about you i was just fixin to clip it out and save it for you the stupid sonofabitch was always doing that not just stories about me but everything hed clip out cartoons and weather reports and crappy poems and health columns every goddam thing under the sun he couldnt read a paper without a pair of scissors ill tell you what i said ill autograph it for you and you keep it maybe itll be valuable some day well he slanted his eyes at me and looked quickly away again i wouldnt want to put you to no trouble lou no trouble at all i said here let me have it i scrawled my name along the margin and handed it back to him just dont let this get around i said if i have to do the same thing for the other fellows itll run the value down he stared at the paper glassyeyed like maybe it was going to bite him uh there it went hed forgot and swallowed his spit you really think heres what you do i said getting my elbows down on the desk and whispering go out to one of the refineries and get em to steam you out a steel drum then you know anyone thatll lend you a welding torch yeah he was whispering too i think i can borry one well cut the drum in two cut it around twice rather sos youll have kind of a lid then put that autographed clipping inside the only one in existence hank and weld it back together again sixty or seventy years from now you can take it to some museum and theyll pay you a fortune for it cripes he said you keepin a drum like that lou want me to pick you up one oh i guess not i said i probably wont live that long i hesitated in the corridor in front of howard hendricks office and he glanced up from his desk and waved to me hello there lou come on in and sit a minute i went in nodding to his secretary and pulled a chair up to the desk just talked to bobs wife a little while ago i said hes not feeling so good so i hear he struck a match for my cigar well it doesnt matter much i mean theres nothing more to be done on this conway case all we can do is sit tight just be available in the event that conway starts tossing his weight around i imagine hell become resigned to the situation before too long it was too bad about the girl dying i said oh i dont know lou he shrugged i cant see that shed have been able to tell us anything we dont already know frankly and just between the two of us im rather relieved conway wouldnt have been satisfied unless she went to the chair with all the blame pinned on her id have hated to be a party to it yeah i said that wouldnt have been so good though of course i would have lou if shed lived i mean id have prosecuted her to the hilt he was leaning backwards to be friendly since our brush the day before i was his old pal and he was letting me know his innermost feelings i wonder howard yes lou well i guess id better not say it i said maybe you dont feel like i do about things oh im sure i do ive always felt we had a great deal in common what is it you wanted to tell me his eyes strayed a second from mine and his mouth quirked a little i knew his secretary had winked at him well its like this i said now ive always felt we were one big happy family here us people that work for the county uhhuh one big happy family eh his eyes strayed again go on lou were kind of brothers under the skin yyes were all in the same boat and weve got to put our shoulders to the wheel and pull together his throat seemed to swell all of a sudden and he yanked a handkerchief from his pocket then he whirled around in his chair his back to me coughing and strangling and sputtering i heard his secretary get up and hurry out her high heels went taptapping down the corridor moving faster and faster toward the womans john until she was almost running i hoped she pissed in her drawers i hoped that chunk of shrapnel under his ribs had punctured a lung that chunk of shrapnel had cost the taxpayers a hell of a pile of dough hed got elected to office talking about that shrapnel not cleaning up the county and seeing that everyone got a fair shake just shrapnel he finally straightened up and turned around and i told him hed better take care of that cold ill tell you what i always do i said i take the water from a boiled onion and squeeze a big lemon into it well maybe a middlingsize lemon and a small one if lou he said sharply yeah i said i appreciate your sentiments your interest but ill have to ask you to come to the point what did you wish to tell me anyway oh it wasnt any please lou well heres what i was wondering about i said and i told him the same thing that rothman had wondered about i put it into my words drawling it out slow and awkward that would give him something to worry over something besides flattire tracks and the beauty of it was he couldnt do much but worry jesus he said slowly its right there isnt it right out in the open when you look at it right its one of those things that are so plain and simple you dont see em no matter how you turn it around he just about had to kill her after he was dead after he couldnt do it or vice versa i said he wiped his forehead excited but kind of sicklooking trying to trap old simple lou with the tire tracks was one thing that was about his speed but this had him thrown for a loop you know what this means lou well it doesnt necessarily mean that i said and i gave him an out i rehashed the business about fluke deaths that id given to rothman thats probably the way it was just one of those damned funny things that no one can explain yeah he said of course thats bound to be it you uh you havent mentioned this to anyone lou i shook my head just popped into my mind a little while ago course if conways still riled up when he gets back i i dont believe i would lou i really dont think thatd be wise at all you mean i should tell bob first oh i intended to do that i wouldnt go over bobs head no lou he said that isnt what i mean bob isnt well hes already taken an awful pounding from conway i dont think we should trouble him with anything else something which as you point out is doubtless of no consequence well i said if it doesnt amount to anything i dont see why lets just keep it to ourselves lou for the time being at least just sit tight and see what happens after all what else can we do what have we got to go on nothing much i said probably nothing at all exactly i couldnt have stated it better i tell you what we might do i said it wouldnt be too hard to round up all the men that visited her probably aint more than thirty or forty of em her being a kind of highpriced gal bob and us our crowd we could round em up and you could i wish you could have seen him sweat rounding up thirty or forty welltodo citizens wouldnt be any skin off our ass the sheriffs office hed be the one to study the evidence and ask for indictments by the time he was through hed be through he couldnt be elected dogcatcher if shrapnel was running out of his eyeballs well though i didnt really want him to do it any more than he wanted to the case was closed right on elmer conways neck and it was a darned good idea to leave it that way so that being the case and seeing it was about supper time i allowed him to convince me i said i didnt have much sense about such things and i was sure grateful for his setting me straight and thats the way it ended almost i gave him my recipe for curing coughs before i left i sauntered down to my car whistling thinking of what a fine afternoon it had been after all and what a hell of a kick thered be in talking about it ten minutes later i was out on derrick road making a uturn back toward town i dont know why well i do know she was the only person i could have talked to whod have understood what i was talking about but i knew she wasnt there i knew shed never be there again there or anywhere she was gone and i knew it so i dont know why i drove back toward town back toward the rambling old twostory house and the barn where the rats squealed and once i said im sorry baby i said it out loud youll never know how sorry i am then i said you understand dont you in a few months more i couldnt have stopped id have lost all control and a butterfly struck lightly against the windscreen and fluttered away again i went back to my whistling it had sure been a fine afternoon i was about out of groceries so i stopped at a grocery and picked up a few including a steak for my dinner i went home and fixed myself a whopping big meal and ate every bite of it that bcomplex was really doing its job so was the other stuff i began to actually look forward to seeing amy i began to want her bad i washed and wiped the dishes i mopped the kitchen floor dragging the job out as long as i could i wrung the mop out and hung it up on the back porch and came back and looked at the clock the hands seemed to have been standing still it would be at least a couple of hours yet before shed dare to come over there wasnt any more work i could do so i filled a big cup with coffee and took it up into dads office i set it on his desk lighted a cigar and started browsing along the rows of books dad always said that he had enough trouble sorting the fiction out of socalled facts without reading fiction he always said that science was already too muddled without trying to make it jibe with religion he said those things but he also said that science in itself could be a religion that a broad mind was always in danger of becoming narrow so there was quite a bit of fiction on the shelves and as much biblical literature probably as a lot of ministers had id read some of the fiction the other id left alone i went to church and sunday school living as i had to live but that was the end of it because kids are kids and if that sounds pretty obvious all i can say is that a lot of supposedly deep thinkers have never discovered the fact a kid hears you cussing all the time and hes going to cuss too he wont understand if you tell him its wrong hes loyal and if you do it it must be all right as i say then id never looked into any of the religious literature around the house but i did tonight id already read almost everything else and i think it was in my mind that since i was going to sell this place id better be checking things over for value so i reached down a big leatherbound concordance to the bible and blew the dust off of it and i carried it over to the desk and opened it up it kind of slid open by itself when i laid it down and there was a picture in it a little twobyfour snapshot and i picked it up i turned it around one way then another i turned it sideways and upside down what i thought was upside down and i kind of grinned like a man will when hes interested and puzzled it was a womans face not pretty exactly but the kind that gets to you without your knowing why but where the hell it was what she was doing i couldnt make out offhand it looked like she was peering through the crotch of a tree a white maple say with two limbs tapering up from the bole she had her hands clasped around the limbs and but i knew that couldnt be right because the bole was divided at the base and there were stumps of chopped off limbs almost tangent to the others i rubbed the picture against my shirt and looked at it again that face was familiar it was coming back to me from some faraway place like something coming out of hiding but it was old the picture i mean and there were kind of crisscross blurs of age i supposed scarring whatever she was looking through i took a magnifying glass and looked at it i turned it upside down as it was supposed to be turned then i kind of dropped the glass and shoved it away from me and i sat staring into space at nothing and everything she was looking through a crotch all right but it was her own she was on her knees peering between them and those crisscross blurs on her thighs werent the result of age they were scars the woman was helene who had been dads housekeeper so long ago dad i was only like that for a few minutes sitting there and staring but a world of things most of my kid life came back to me in that time she came back to me the housekeeper and she had been so much of that life want to fight helene want to learn how to box and oh im tired you just hit me and but youll like it darling all the big boys do it i lived back through it all and then i came to the end of it that last terrible day with me crouched at the foot of the stairs sick with fear and shame terrified aching with the first and only whipping in my life listening to the low angry voices the angry and contemptuous voices in the library i am not arguing with you helene youre leaving here tonight consider yourself lucky that i dont prosecute you oh yess id like to see you try it why helene how in the world could you do such a thing jealous you a mere child and yes thats right a mere child why not remember that listen to me daniel i dont say it please im at fault if i hadnt has it hurt you any have you harmed anyone havent you in fact i should ask gradually lost all interest in it but a child my child my only son if anything should happen uhhuh thats what bothers you isnt it not him but you how it would reflect on you get out a woman with no more sensibilities than im white trash thats the term isnt it riffraff i aint got that ol quality all right and when i see some hypocritical sonofabitch like you im damned glad of it get out or ill kill you tsktsk but think of the disgrace doctor now im going to tell you something get something that you above all people should know this didnt need to mean a thing absolutely nothing but now it will youve handled it in the worst possible way you i please helene youll never kill anyone not you youre too damned smug and selfsatisfied and sure of yourself you like to hurt people but no all right im wrong youre the great good dr ford and im white trash so that makes me wrong i hope that was all id forgotten about it and now i forgot it again there are things that have to be forgotten if you want to go on living and somehow i did want to i wanted to more than ever if the good lord made a mistake in us people it was in making us want to live when weve got the least excuse for it i put the concordance back on the shelf i took the picture into the laboratory and burned it and washed the ashes down the sink but it was a long time burning it seemed like and i couldnt help noticing something how much she looked like joyce how there was even a strong resemblance between her and amy stanton the phone rang i wiped my hands against my pants and answered it looking at myself in the laboratory door mirror at the guy in the black bow tie and the pinktan shirt his trouser legs hooked over his boot tops lou ford speakin i said howard lou howard hendricks look i want you to come right down down to the courthouse yeah well i dont know about that i said i kind of shell have to wait lou this is important it had to be the way he was sputtering remember what we were talking about this afternoon about the you know the possibility of an outside party being the murderer well you we were dead right our hunch was right huh i said but it couldnt i mean weve got him lou weve got the sonofabitch weve got the bastard cold and you mean hes admitted it hell howard theres always some crank confessing to hes not admitting anything he wont even talk thats why we need you we cant uh work on him you know but you can make him talk you can soften him up if anyone can i think you know him incidentally wwhoyeah the greeks kid johnnie pappas you know him hes been in plenty of trouble before now get down here lou ive already called chester conway and hes flying out from fort worth in the morning i gave you full credit told him how wed worked on this idea together and wed been sure all along that elmer wasnt guilty and and hes pleased as punch lou boy if we can just crack this get a confession right ill come down i said ill be right down howard i lowered the receiver hook for a moment figuring out what had happened what must have happened then i called amy her folks were still up so she couldnt talk much and that was a help i made her understand that i really wanted to see her and i did and i shouldnt be gone too long i hung up and took out my wallet and spread all the bills out on the desk i hadnt had any twenties of my own just the twentyfive elmerd given me and when i saw that five of them were gone i went limp clear down to my toenails then i remembered that id used four in forth worth on my railroad ticket and that id only broken one here in town where it would matter only the one with johnnie pappas so so i got out the car and drove down to the courthouse office deputy hank butterby gave me a hurt look and another deputy that was there jeff plummer winked and said howdy to me then howard bustled in and grabbed me by the elbow and hustled me into his office what a break huh lou he was almost slobbering with excitement now ill tell you how to handle it heres what youd better do sweet talk him know what i mean and get his guard down then tighten up on him tell him if hell cooperate well get him off with manslaughter we cant do it of course but what you say wont be binding on me otherwise tell him itll be the chair hes eighteen years old past eighteen and i stared at him he misread my look oh hell he said jabbing me in the ribs with his thumb who am i to be telling you what to do dont i know how you handle these guys havent i you havent told me anything yet i said i know johnnies kind of wild but i cant see him as a murderer what are you supposed to have on him supposed hell weve got he hesitated well heres the situation lou elmer took ten thousand bucks out there to that chippys house he was supposed to have taken that much but when we counted it up five hundred dollars was missing yeah i said it was like id figured that damned elmer hadnt wanted to admit that he didnt have any dough of his own well we thought bob and i did that elmer had probably pissed it off in a crap game or something like that but the bills were all marked see and the old man had already tipped off the local banks if she tried to hang around town after the payoff he was going to crack down on her for blackmail that conway they dont put many past him it looks like theyve put a few past me i said now lou he clapped me on the back theres no reason to feel that way at all we trusted you implicitly but it was conways show and well you were there in the vicinity lou and let it go i said johnnie spent some of the money a twenty he broke it at a drugstore last night and it went to the bank this morning and it was traced back to him a couple hours ago when we picked him up now how do you know elmer didnt blow in the dough and its just now beginning to circulate none of its shown up just this one twenty so wait lou wait just a minute let me give you the whole picture and well save time i was entirely willing to concede that hed come by the money innocently he pays himself there at the filling station and oddly enough that pay comes to exactly twenty dollars for the two nights it looked all right see what i mean he could have taken the twenty in and paid himself with it but he couldnt say he did wouldnt say anything because he damned well couldnt theres damned few cars stopping at murphys between midnight and eight oclock hed have to remember anyone that gave him a twenty we could have checked the customer or customers and hed have been out of here if he was innocent maybe it was in his cash drawer at the start of his shift are you kidding a twentydollar bill to make change with hendricks shook his headwed know he didnt have it even without slim murphys word now wait hold up weve checked on murphy and his alibis airtight the kid huhuh from about nine sunday night until eleven his time cant be accounted for we cant account for it and he wont oh its a cinch lou anyway you look at it take the murders themselves that dame beaten to a pulp thats something a crazy kid would lose his head and do and the money only five hundred taken out of ten grand hes overwhelmed by so much dough so he grabs up a fistful and leaves the rest a kid stunt again yeah i said yeah i guess youre right howard you think hes got the rest cached somewhere either that or hes got scared and thrown it away hes a setup lou man ive never seen one so pretty if he dropped dead right now id consider it a judgment from heaven and im not a religious man either well hed said it all hed proved it in black and white well youd better get busy now lou weve got him on ice havent booked him yet and were not going to until he comes through im not letting some shyster tell him about his rights at this stage of the game i hesitated then i said no i dont reckon that would be so smart theres nothing to be gained by that does bob know about this why bother him theres nothing he can do well i just wondered if we should ask him if it would be all right for me to be all right he frowned why wouldnt it be all right oh i know how you feel lou hes just a kid you know him but hes a murderer lou and a damned coldblooded one keep that in your mind think of how that poor damned woman must have felt while he was beating her face in you saw her you saw what her face looked like stew meat hamburger dont i said for christs sake sure lou sure he dropped an arm around my shoulders im sorry i keep forgetting that youve never become hardened to this stuff well well i said i guess id better get it over with i walked downstairs to the basement the jail the turnkey let me through the gate and closed it again and we went down past the bullpen and the regular cells to a heavy steel door there was a small port or peephole in it and i peered through it but i couldnt see anything you couldnt keep a light globe in the place no matter what kind of guard you put over it and the basement window which was twothirds below the surface of the ground didnt let in much natural light want to borrow a flash lou i guess not i said i can see all i need to he opened the door a few inches and i slid inside and he slammed it behind me i stood with my back to it a moment blinking and there was a squeak and a scrape and a shadow rose up and faltered toward me he fell into my arms and i held him there patting him on the back comforting him its all right johnnie boy everythings going to be all right jjesus lou jesus jesus cachrist i knew i knnew youd come theyd send for you but it was so long so long and i began to think maybe maybe youd you know me bettern that johnnie you know how much i think of you ssure he drew a long breath and let it out slowly like a man thats made land after a hard swim you got a cigarette lou these dirty bastards took all my now now i said they were just doing their duty johnnie have a cigar and ill smoke one with you we sat down side by side on the bolteddown bunk and i held a match for our cigars i shook the match out and he puffed and i puffed and the glow came and went from our faces this is going to burn the old man up he laughed jerkily i guess hell have to know wont he yes i said im afraid hell have to know johnnie how soon can i leave very soon it wont be long now i said where were you sunday night to a picture show he drew hard on his cigar and i could see his jaw beginning to set whats the difference you know what i mean johnnie whered you go after the show between the time you left it and started to work well puff puff i dont see what thats got to do with this i dont ask you puff where you you can i said i intend to tell you i guess maybe you dont know me as well as i thought you did johnnie havent i always shot square with you aw hell lou he said shamed you know how i feel about you but all right id probably tell you sooner or later anyway it was puff heres the way it was lou i told the old man i had this hot date wednesday see but i was afraid of my tires and i could pick up a couple good ones cheap an hand him back something each week until i got em paid for and let me sort that out i said you needed tires for your hot rod and you tried to borrow the money from your father sure just like i said and you know what he says lou he tells me i dont need tires that i gad around too much he says i should bring this babe to the house and momll make some ice cream an well all play cards or somethin for christs sake he shook his head bewilderedly how stupid can a person get i laughed gently you got your two tires anyway then i said you stripped a couple off a parked car well uh to tell the truth lou i took four i wasnt meaning to but i knew where i could turn a couple real quick an well sure i said this gal was kind of hard to get and you wanted to be sure of getting over with her a really hot babe huh mmmmphumph wow you know what i mean lou one of those gals that makes you want to take your shoes off and wade around in her i laughed again and he laughed then it was somehow awfully silent and he shifted uneasily i know who owned the car lou soon as i get squared away a little ill send him the money for those tires thats all right i said dont worry about it are we uh can i in just a little i said youll be leaving in a few minutes johnnie just a few formalities to take care of first boy will i be glad to be out of here gosh lou i dont know how people stand it itd drive me crazy itd drive anyone crazy i said it does drive them crazy maybe youd better lie down a while johnnie stretch out on the bunk ive got a little more talking to do but he turned slowly and tried to look at me to see my face youd better do that i said the air gets kind of bad with both of us sitting up oh he said yeah and he lay down he sighed deeply say this feels pretty good aint it funny lou what a difference it makes having someone to talk to i mean someone that likes you and understands you if youve got that you can put up with almost anything yes i said it makes a lot of difference and thats that you didnt tell em you got that twenty from me johnnie hell no what do you think i am anyway piss on those guys why not i said why didnt you tell them well uh the hard boards of the bunk squeaked well i figured oh you know lou elmer got around in some kind of funny places an i thought maybe well i know you dont make a hell of a lot of dough and youre always tossing it around on other people and if someone should slip you a little tip i see i said i dont take bribes johnnie who said anything about bribes i could feel him shrug who said anything i just wasnt going to let em hit you cold with it until you figured out a until you remembered where you found it i didnt say anything for a minute i just sat there thinking about him this kid that everyone said was no good and a few other people i knew finally i said i wish you hadnt done it johnnie it was the wrong thing to do you mean theyll be sore he grunted to hell with em they dont mean anything to me but youre a square joe am i i said how do you know i am johnnie how can a man ever really know anything were living in a funny world kid a peculiar civilization the police are playing crooks in it and the crooks are doing police duty the politicians are preachers and the preachers are politicians the tax collectors collect for themselves the bad people want us to have more dough and the good people are fighting to keep it from us its not good for us know what i mean if we all had all we wanted to eat wed crap too much wed have inflation in the toilet paper industry thats the way i understand it thats about the size of some of the arguments ive heard he chuckled and dropped his cigar butt to the floor gosh lou i sure enjoy hearing you talk ive never heard you talk that way before but its getting kind of late and yeah johnnie i said its a screwed up bitched up world and im afraid its going to stay that way and ill tell you why because no one almost no one sees anything wrong with it they cant see that things are screwed up so theyre not worried about it what theyre worried about is guys like you theyre worried about guys liking a drink and taking it guys getting a piece of tail without paying a preacher for it guys who know what makes em feel good and arent going to be talked out of the motion they dont like you guys and they crack down on you and the way it looks to me theyre going to be cracking down harder and harder as time goes on you ask me why i stick around knowing the score and its hard to explain i guess i kind of got a foot on both fences johnnie i planted em there early and now theyve taken root and i cant move either way and i cant jump all i can do is wait until i split right down the middle thats all i can do and but you johnnie well maybe you did the right thing maybe its best this way because it would get harder all the time kid and i know how hard its been in the past i i dont i killed her johnnie i killed both of them and dont say i couldnt have that im not that kind of a guy because you dont know i he started to rise up on his elbow then lay back again ill bet you had a good reason lou i bet they had it coming no one has it coming to them i said but i had a reason yes dimly in the distance like a ghost hooting i heard the refinery whistles blowing for the swing shifts and i could picture the workmen plodding in to their jobs and the other shifts plodding out tossing their lunch buckets into their cars driving home and playing with their kids and drinking beer and watching their television sets and diddling their wives and just as if nothing was happening just as if a kid wasnt dying and a man part of a man dying with him lou yes johnnie it was a statement not a question yyou mmean i i should take the rap for you i no i said yes i dddont think i cant lou oh jesus i cant i ccouldnt go through i eased him back on the bunk i ruffled his hair chucked him gently under the chin tilting it back there is a time of peace i said and a time of war a time to sow and a time to reap a time to live and a time to die llou this hurts me i said worse than it does you and i knifed my hand across his windpipe then i reached down for his belt i pounded on the door and after a minute the turnkey came he cracked the door open a little and i slid out and he slammed it again give you any trouble lou no i said he was real peaceful i think weve broken the case hes gonna talk huh theyve talked before i shrugged i went back upstairs and told howard hendricks id had a long talk with johnnie and that i thought hed come through all right just leave him alone for an hour or so i said ive done everything i can if i havent made him see the light then he just aint going to see it certainly lou certainly i know your reputation you want me to call you after i see him i wish you would i said im kind of curious to know if he talks ive loafed around the streets sometimes leaned against a store front with my hat pushed back and one boot hooked back around the other hell youve probably seen me if youve ever been out this way ive stood like that looking nice and friendly and stupid like i wouldnt piss if my pants were on fire and all the time im laughing myself sick inside just watching the people you know what i mean the couples the men and wives you see walking along together the tall fat women and the short scrawny men the teensy little women and the big fat guys the dames with lantern jaws and the men with no chins the bowlegged wonders and the knockkneed miracles the ive laughed inside that is until my guts ached its almost as good as dropping in on a chamber of commerce luncheon where some guy gets up and clears his throat a few times and says gentlemen we cant expect to get any more out of life than what we put into it and i guess it they the people those mismatched people arent something to laugh about theyre really tragical theyre not stupid no more than average anyway theyve not tied up together just to give jokers like me a bang the truth is i reckon that life has played a hell of a trick on em there was a time just for a few minutes maybe when all their differences seemed to vanish and they were just what each other wanted when they looked at each other at exactly the right time in the right place and under the right circumstances and everything was perfect they had that time those few minutes and they never had any other but while it lasted everything seemed the same as usual the shades were drawn and the bathroom door was open a little just to let in a little light and she was sprawled out on her stomach asleep everything was the same but it wasnt it was one of those times she woke up while i was undressing some change dropped out of my pocket and rolled against the baseboard she sat up rubbing at her eyes starting to say something sharp but somehow she smiled instead and i smiled back at her i scooped her up in my arms and sat down on the bed and held her i kissed her and her mouth opened a little and her arms locked around my neck thats the way it started thats the way it went until finally we were stretched out close side by side her arm around my hips and mine around hers limp drained dry almost breathless and still we wanted each other wanted something it was like the beginning instead of the end she burrowed her head against my shoulder and it was nice i didnt feel like shoving her away she whispered into my ear kind of babytalking mad at you you hurt me i did i said gosh im sorry honey hurt real bad iss one punch elbow in it well gosh she kissed me let her mouth slide off mine not mad she whispered she was silent then waiting it seemed for me to say something do something she pushed closer squirming still keeping her face hidden bet i know something yeah honey about that vas that operation what i said do you think you know it was after that after mike what about mike darling she kissed my shoulder i dont care i dont mind but it was then wasnt it your father got ex worried and i let my breath out slowly almost any other night i could have enjoyed wringing her neck but this was one time when i hadnt felt that way it was about that time as i recollect i said but i dont know as that had anything to do with it honey yeah why do you suppose people it beats me i said i never have been able to figure it out ddont some women ill bet you would think it was awful if if what she pushed against me and it felt like she was on fire she shivered and began to cry ddont lou dont make me ask jjust so i didnt make her ask later on when she was still crying but in a different way the phone rang it was howard hendricks lou kid you really did it you really softened him up he signed a confession i said better than that boy he hanged himself did it with his belt that proves he was guilty without us having to screw around before a judge and put the taxpayers to a lot of expense and all that crap goddammit lou i wish i was there right now to shake your hand he stopped yelling and tried to get the gloat out of his voice now lou i want you to promise me that you wont take this the wrong way you mustnt get down about it a person like that dont deserve to live hes a lot better off dead than he is alive yeah i said i guess youre right at that i got rid of him and hung up and right away the phone rang again this time it was chester conway calling from fort worth great work lou fine job fine guess you know what this means to me guess i made a mistake about yes i said nothing dont matter now see you boy i hung up again and the phone rang a third time bob maples his voice came over the wire thin and shaky i know how much you thought of that boy lou i know youd just about as soon itd happened to yourself as soon yeah bob i said i just about would have you want to come over and set a spell lou play a game of checkers or somethin i aint supposed to be up or id offer to come over there i i reckon not bob i said but thanks thanks a heap thats all right son you change your mind come on over no matter what time it is amyd been taking in everything impatient curious i hung up and slumped down on the bed and she sat up beside me for heavens sake what was that all about lou i told her not the truth of course but what was supposed to be the truth she clapped her hands together oh darling thats wonderful my lou solving the case will you get a reward why should i i said think of all the fun i had oh well she drew away a little and i thought she was going to pop off and i reckon she wanted to but she wanted something else worse im sorry lou you have every right to be angry with me she lay back down again turning on her stomach spreading her arms and legs she stretched out waiting and whispered very very angry sure i know tell me something else tell a hophead he shouldnt take dope tell him itll kill him and see if he stops she got her moneys worth it was going to cost her plenty and i gave her value received honest lou that was me let lou titillate your tail i guess i must have got to sweating with all that exercise and not having any clothes on i caught a hell of a cold oh it wasnttoo bad not enough to really lay me low but i wasnt fit to do any chasing around i had to stay in bed for a week and it was kind of a break for me you might say i didnt have to talk to a lot of people and have em asking damned fool questions and slapping me on the back i didnt have to go to johnnie pappas funeral i didnt have to call on his folks like id have felt i had to do ordinarily a couple of the boys from the office dropped by to say hello and bob maples came in a time or two he was still looking very pretty peaked seemed to have aged about ten years we kept off the subject of johnnie just talked about things in general and the visits went off pretty well only one thing came up that kind of worried me for a while it was on the first no i guess the second time he came by lou he said why in hell dont you get out of this town get out i was startled wed just been sitting there quietly smoking and passing a word now and then and suddenly he comes out with this why should i get out whyve you ever stayed here this long he said whyd you ever want to wear a badge why didnt you be a doctor like your dad try to make something of yourself i shook my head staring down at the bedclothes i dont know bob reckon im kind of lazy you got awful funny ways of showin it lou you aint never too lazy to take on some extra job you put in more hours than any man i got an if i know anything about you you dont like the work you never have liked it he wasnt exactly right about that but i knew what he meant there was other work id have liked a lot better i dont know bob i said theres a couple of kinds of laziness the dontwanttodonothin and the stickintherut brand you take a job figuring youll just keep it a little while and that while keeps stretchin on and on and on you need a little more money before you can make a jump you cant quite make up your mind about what you want to jump to and then maybe you make a stab at it you send off a few letters and the people want to know what experience youve had what youve been doin and probably they dont even want to bother with you and if they do youve got to start right at the bottom because you dont know anything so you stay where you are you just about got to and you work pretty hard because you know it you aint young anymore and its all youve got bob nodded slowly yeah i kinda know how that is but it didnt need to be that way with you lou your dad couldve sent you off to school you couldve been a practicin doctor by this time well i hesitated thered been that trouble with mike and dad wouldve been all alone and well i guess my mind just didnt run to medicine bob it takes an awful lot of study you know theres other things you could do and you lack a lot of bein broke son you could get you a little fortune for this property yeah but i broke off well to tell the truth bob i have kind of thought about pulling up stakes but amy dont want to i havent asked her the subject never came up but i dont reckon she would well he said slowly thats sure too bad i dont suppose youd no you wouldnt do that i dont expect no man in his right mind would give up amy i nodded a little like i was acknowledging a compliment agreeing that i couldnt give her up and even with the way i felt about her the nod came easy on the surface amy had everything plus she was smart and she came from a good family which was a mighty important consideration with our people but that was only the beginning when amy went down the street with that round little behind twitching with her chin tucked in and her breasts stuck out every man under eighty kind of drooled theyd get sort of red in the face and forget to breathe and you could hear whispers man if i could just have some of that hating her didnt keep me from being proud of her you trying to get rid of me bob i said kind of looks as though dont it he grinned guess i did too much thinkin while i was laying around the house wondering about things that aint none of my business i got to thinkin about how riled i get sometimes having to give in to things i dont like and hell i aint really fit to do much but what i am doin and i thought how much harder it must be on a man like you he chuckled wryly fact is i reckon you started me thinking that way lou you kind of brought it on yourself i looked blank and then i grinned i dont mean anything by it its just a way of joking sure he said easily we all got our little peculyearities i just thought maybe you was gettin kind of saddlegalled and bob i said what did conway say to you there in fort worth oh hell he stood up slapping his hat against his pants cant even recollect what it was now well i guess i better be he said something he said or did something that you didnt like a little bit you reckon he did huh his eyebrows went up then they came down and he chuckled and put on his hat forget it lou it wasnt nothing important and it dont matter no more anyways he left and like i said i was kind of worried for a while but after id had time to think it looked to me like id fretted about nothing it looked like things were working out pretty good i was willing to leave central city id been thinking about leaving but i thought too much of amy to go against her wishes i sure wouldnt do anything that amy didnt like if something should happen to her though and something was going to happen why of course i wouldnt want to hang around the old familiar scenes any more it would be more than a softhearted guy like me could stand and there wouldnt be any reason to so id leave and itd all seem perfectly natural no one would think anything of it amy came to see me every day in the morning for a few minutes on her way to school and again at night she always brought some cake or pie or something stuff i reckon their dog wouldnt eat and she hardly nagged about anything that i remember she didnt give me any trouble at all she was all sort of blushy and shy and shamed like and she had to take it kind of easy when she sat down two or three nights she drew the bathtub full of warm water and sat in it and soaked and id sit and watch her and think how much she looked like her and afterwards shed lie in my arms just lie there because that was about all either of us was up to and i could almost fool myself into thinking it was her but it wasnt her and for that matter it wouldnt have made any difference if it had been id just been right back where i started id have had to do it all over again id have had to kill her the second time i was glad amy didnt bring up the subject of marriage she was afraid of starting a quarrel i guess id already been right in the middle of three deaths and a fourth coming right on top of em might look kind of funny it was too soon for it anyway i hadnt figured out a good safe way of killing her you see why i had to kill her i reckon or do you it was like this there wasnt any evidence against me and even if there was some quite a bit id be a mighty hard man to stick i just wasnt that kind of guy you see no one would believe i was why hell theyd been seeing lou ford around for years and no one could tell them that good ol lou would but lou could do it lou could convict himself all he had to do was skip out on a girl who knew just about everything about him there was to know who even without that one wild night could probably have pieced some plentyugly stuff together and that would be the end of lou everything would fall into place right back to the time when mike and i were kids as things stood now she wouldnt let herself think things through she wouldnt even let herself start to think shed cut up some pretty cute skylarks herself and that had put a check on her thinking and i was going to be her husband so everything was all right everything had to be all right but if i ran out on her well i knew amy that mental block shed set up would disappear shed have the answer that quick and she wouldnt keep it to herself because if she couldnt have me no one else would yeah i guess i mentioned that she and joyce seemed pretty much alike well anyway anyway it had to be done as soon as it safely could be done and knowing that that there was just no other way out kind of made things easier i stopped worrying thinking about it i should say i tried to be extra pleasant to her she was getting on my nerves hanging around so much but she wouldnt be hanging around long so i thought i ought to be as nice as i could id taken sick on a wednesday by the next wednesday i was up so i took amy to prayer meeting being a school teacher she kind of had to put in an appearance at those things now and then and i sort of enjoy em i pick up lots of good lines at prayer meetings i asked amy i whispered to her how shed like to have a little manna on her honey and she turned red and kicked me on the ankle i whispered to her again asked her if i could mosey into her burning bush i told her i was going to take her to my bosom and cleave unto her and anoint her with precious oils she got redder and redder and her eyes watered but somehow it made her look cute and it seemed like id never seen her with her chin stuck out and her eyes narrowed then she doubled over burying her face in her songbook and she shivered and shook and choked and the minister stood on tiptoe frowning trying to figure out where the racket was coming from it was one of the best prayer meetings i ever went to i stopped and bought some ice cream on the way home and she was giggling and breaking into snickers all the way while i made coffee she dished up the cream and i took part of a spoonful and chased her around and around the kitchen with it i finally caught her and put it in her mouth instead of down her neck like id threatened a little speck of it got on her nose and i kissed it away suddenly she threw her arms around my neck and began to cry honey i said dont do that honey i was just playing i was just trying to give you a good time yyou big i know i said but dont say it lets dont have any more trouble between us ddont her arms tightened around me and she looked up through the tears smiling dont you understand im jjust so happy lou so hhappy i ccant ssstand it and she burst into tears again we left the ice cream and coffee unfinished i picked her up and carried her into dads office and sat down in dads big old chair we sat there in the dark her on my lap sat there until she had to go home and it was all we wanted it seemed to be enough it was enough it was a good evening even if we did have one small spat she asked me if id seen chester conway and i said i hadnt she said she thought it was darned funny that he didnt so much as come by and say hello after what id done and that if she were me shed tell him so i didnt do anything i said lets not talk about it well i dont care darling he thought youd done quite a bit at the time couldnt wait to call you up long distance now hes been back in town for almost a week and hes too busy to i dont care for my own sake lou it certainly means nothing to me but that makes two of us then youre too easygoing thats the trouble with you you let people run over you youre always i know i said i think i know it all amy ive got it memorized the whole trouble is that i wont listen to you and it seems to me like thats about all i ever get done ive been listening to you almost since you learned how to talk and i reckon i can do it a while longer if itll make you happy but i dont think itll change me much she sat up very stiff and straight then she settled back again still holding herself kind of rigid she was silent for about the time it takes to count to ten well just the same i i yeah i said oh be quiet she said keep still dont say anything and she laughed and it was a good evening after all but it was kind of funny about conway how long should i wait that was the question how long could i wait how long was it safe amy wasnt crowding me any she was still pretty shy and skittish trying to keep that barbedwire tongue of hers in her mouth though she wasnt always successful i figured i could stall her off on marriage indefinitely but amy well it wasnt just amy there wasnt anything i could put my finger on but i had the feeling that things were closing in on me and i couldnt talk myself out of it every day that passed the feeling grew stronger conway hadnt come to see me or spoken to me but that didnt necessarily mean anything it didnt mean anything that i could see he was busy hed never given a whoop in hell for anyone but himself and elmer he was the kind of a guy that would drop you when he got a favor then pick you up again when he needed another one hed gone back to fort worth and he hadnt returned but that was all right too conway construction had big offices in fort worth hed always spent a lot of time there bob maples well i couldnt see that he was much different than ever id study him as the days drifted by and i couldnt see anything to fret about he looked pretty old and sick but he was old and he had been sick he didnt have too much to say to me but what he did have was polite and friendly he seemed hellbent on being polite and friendly and hed never been what youd call real talky hed always had spells when you could hardly get a word out of him howard hendricks well well something was sure enough eating on howard id run into howard the first day i was up after my sick spell hed been coming up the steps of the courthouse just as i was heading down them to lunch he nodded not quite looking at me and mumbled out a hare you lou i stopped and said i was feeling a lot better still felt pretty weak but couldnt really complain any you know how it is howard i said it isnt the flu so much as the aftereffects so ive heard he said its kind of like i always say about autymobiles its not the original cost so much as the upkeep but i reckon got to run he mumbled see you but i wasnt letting him off that easy i was really in the clear now and i could afford to open up a little on him as i was sayin i said i reckon i cant tell you much about sickness can i howard not with that shrapnel you got in you i got an idea about that shrapnel howard what you could do with it you could get you some xrays taken and print em on the back of your campaign cards then on the other side you could have a flag with your name spelled out in thermometers and maybe a upside down what do you call them hospital pisspots oh yeah urinal for an exclamation mark whered you say that shrapnel was anyway howard seems like i just cant keep track of it no matter how hard i try one time its in my ass he was looking at me now all right its in my ass id been holding him by the lapel to keep him from running off he took my hand by the wrist still staring at me and he pulled it away and let it drop then he turned and went up the steps his shoulders sagging a little but his feet moving firm and steady and we hadnt passed a word between us since then he kept out of my way when he saw me coming and i did him the same kind of favor so there was something wrong there but what else could i expect what was there to worry about id given him the works and it had probably dawned on him that id needled him plenty in the past and that wasnt the only reason he had to act stiff and cold elections were coming up in the fall and hed be running as usual breaking the conway case would be a big help to him and hed want to talk it up but hed feel awkward about doing it hed have to cut me out of the credit and he figured id be sore so he was jumping the gun on me there was nothing really out of the way then nothing with him or sheriff bob or chester conway there wasnt a thing but the feeling kept growing it got stronger and stronger id been keeping away from the greeks id even stayed off the street where his restaurant was but one day i went there something just seemed to pull the wheels of my car in that direction and i found myself stopping in front of it the windows were all soaped over the doors were closed but it seemed like i could hear people inside i heard some banging and clattering i got out of my car and stood by the side of it a minute or two then i stepped up on the curb and crossed the walk there was a place on one of the double doors where the soap had been scraped away i sheltered my eyes with my hand and peered through it rather i started to peer through it for the door opened suddenly and the greek stepped out i am sorry officer ford he said i cannot serve you we are not open for business i stammered that i didnt want anything just thought id drop by to to yes i wanted to see you i said i wanted to see you the night it happened and it hasnt been off my mind since but i couldnt bring myself to do it i couldnt face you i knew how youd feel how youd be bound to feel and there wasnt anything i could say nothing nothing i could say or do because if thered been anything well it wouldnt have happened in the first place it was the truth and god god what a wonderful thing truth is he looked at me in a way i didnt like to name and then he looked kind of baffled and then he suddenly caught his lip under his teeth and stared down at the sidewalk he was a swarthy middleaged guy in a highcrowned black hat and a shirt with black sateen protectors pulled over the sleeves and he stared down at the sidewalk and looked back up again i am glad you did come by lou he said quietly it is fitting i have felt at times that he regarded you as his one true friend i aimed to be his friend i said there werent many things i wanted much more somehow i slipped up i couldnt help him right when he needed help worst but i want you to know one thing max i i didnt hurt he laid a hand on my arm you need not tell me that lou i do not know why what but he felt lost i said like he was all alone in the world like he was out of step and he could never get back in again yes he said but yes there was always trouble and he seemed always at fault i nodded and he nodded he shook his head and i shook mine we stood there shaking our heads and nodding neither of us really saying anything and i wished i could leave but i didnt quite know how to go about it finally i said i was sorry he was closing the restaurant if theres anything i can do i am not closing it he said why should i close it well i just thought that i am remodeling it i am putting in leather booths and an inlaid floor and airconditioning johnnie would have liked those things many times he suggested them and i suggested he was hardly fitted to give me advice but now we will have them it will be as he wanted it is all that can be done i shook my head again i shook it and nodded i want to ask you a question lou i want you to answer it and i want the absolute truth the truth i hesitated why wouldnt i tell you the truth max because you might feel that you couldnt that it would be disloyal to your position and associates who else visited johnnies cell after you left well there was howard the county attorney i know of that he made the discovery and a deputy sheriff and the jailer were with him who else my heart gave a little jump maybe but no it was no good i couldnt do that i couldnt bring myself to try it i dont have any idea max i said i wasnt there but i can tell you youre on the wrong track ive known all those boys for years they wouldnt do a thing like that any more than i would it was the truth again and he had to see it i was looking straight into his eyes well he sighed well we will talk again lou and i said you bet we will max and i got away from him i drove out on derrick road fivesix miles out i pulled the car off on the shoulder up at the crest of a little hill and i sat there looking down through the blackjacks but i didnt see a thing i didnt see the blackjacks about five minutes after id stopped well maybe no more than three minutes a car drew up behind mine joe rothman got out of it and plodded along the shoulder and looked in at me nice view here he said mind if i join you thanks i knew you wouldnt he said it like that all run together without waiting for me to reply he opened the door and slid into the seat beside me come out this way often lou whenever i feel like it i said well its a nice view all right almost unique i dont suppose youll find more than forty or fifty thousand billboards like that one in the united states i grinned in spite of myself the billboard had been put up by the chamber of commerce and the words on it were you are now nearing central citytex where the hand clasps a little stronger pop pop watch us grow yeah i said thats quite a sign all right you were looking at it then i thought that must be the attraction after all what else is there to see aside from those blackjacks and a little white cottage the murder cottage i believe they call it what do you want i said how many times were you there lou how many times did you lay her i was there quite a few times i said i had reason to be and im not so hard up for it that i have to lay whores no he squinted at me thoughtfully no i dont suppose you would be personally ive always operated on the theory that even in the presence of abundance its well to keep an eye out for the future you never can tell lou you may wake up some morning and find theyve passed a law against it itll be unamerican maybe theyll put a rider on that law i said prohibiting bullshit i see you dont have a legal type of mind lou or you wouldnt say that theres a basic contradiction in it tail we can do without as our penal institutions so righteously prove tail of the orthodox type that is but what could you substitute for bullshit where would we be without it well i said i wouldnt be listening to you but youre going to listen to me lou youre going to sit right here and listen and answer up promptly when the occasion demands get me get me lou i get you i said i got you right from the beginning i was afraid you hadnt i wanted you to understand that i can stack it up over your head and youll sit there and like it he shook tobacco into a paper twirled it and ran it across his tongue he stuck it in the corner of his mouth and seemed to forget about it you were talking with max pappas he said from what i could judge it was a reasonably friendly conversation it was i said he was resigned to the fact of johnnies suicide he had accepted it as suicide i cant say that he was resigned to it i said he was wondering whether someone if someone was in the cell after i left and and lou and i told him no that it couldnt have been that way none of the boys would be up to doing such a thing which settles that rothman nodded or does it what are you driving at i snapped what shut up his voice toughened then went smooth again did you notice the remodeling hes doing do you know how much all that will cost right around twelve thousand dollars where do you suppose he got that kind of money how the hell do i lou well maybe he had it saved max pappas or maybe he borrowed it without collateral well i dont know i said let me make a suggestion someone gave it to him a wealthy acquaintance well say some man who felt he owed it to him i shrugged and pushed my hat back because my forehead was sweating but i was feeling cold inside so cold inside conway construction is handling the job lou doesnt it strike you as rather odd that hed do a job for a man whose son killed his son there arent many jobs that he dont handle i said anyway its the company not him hes not in there swinging a hammer himself moren likely he doesnt even know about it well rothman hesitated then he went on kind of dogged its a turnkey job conways jobbing all the materials dealing with the supply houses paying off the men no ones seen a nickel coming from pappas so what i said conway takes all the turnkey stuff he can get he cuts a half a dozen profits instead of one and you think pappas would hold still for it you dont see him as the kind of guy whod insist on bargaining for every item whod haggle over everything right down to the last nail i see him that way lou its the only way i can see him i nodded so do i but hes not in a real good position to have his own way right now he gets his job like conway construction wants to give it to him or he just dont get it yeah he shifted his cigarette from one side of his mouth to the other he pushed it across with his tongue his eyes narrowed on my face but the money lou that still doesnt explain about the money he lived close i said he could have had it a big enough part anyway sos theyd wait on the rest it didnt need to be in a bank he could have had it salted away around his house yeah said rothman slowly yeah i suppose so he turned back around in the seat so that he was looking through the windshield instead of me instead of at me he flicked his cigarette away fumbled for his tobacco and papers and began rolling another one did you get out to the cemetery lou out to johnnies grave no i said and ive sure got to do that too im ashamed i havent done it before well dammit you mean that dont you you mean every word of it who are you to ask that i snapped what did you ever do for him i dont want any credit for it but im the only man in central city that ever tried to help that kid i liked him i understood him i i know i know he shook his head dully i was just going to say that johnnies buried in sacred ground you know what that means lou i reckon the church didnt call it suicide and the answer lou you do have an answer he was so awful young i said and he hadnt ever had much but trouble maybe the church figured hed been faulted enough and tried to give him a break maybe they figured that it was sort of an accident that hed just been fooling around and went too far maybe said rothman maybe maybe maybe one more thing lou the big thing on the sunday night that elmer and the late occupant of yon cottage got it one of my carpenters went to the last show at the palace he parked his car around in back at now get this lou at ninethirty when he came out all four of his tires were gone i waited and everything got pretty quiet well i said finally thats sure too bad all four tires huh too bad you mean its funny dont you lou plumb funny well it is kind of i said its funny i didnt hear anything about it at the office itd been still funnier if you had lou because he didnt report the theft id hardly call it the greatest mystery of all time but for some reason you fellas down at the office dont take much interest in us fellas down at the labor temple unless you find us on a picket line i cant hardly help never mind lou its really not pertinent the man didnt report the theft but he did mention it to some of the boys when the carpenters and joiners held their regular tuesday night meeting and one of them as it turned out had bought two of the tires from johnnie pappas they do you have a chill lou are you catching cold i bit down on my cigar i didnt say anything these lads equipped themselves with a couple of pisselm clubs or reasonable facsimiles thereof and went calling on johnnie he wasnt at home and he wasnt at slim murphys filling station in fact he wasnt anywhere about that time he was swinging by his belt from the windowbars of the courthouse cooler but his hotrod was at the station and the remaining two stolen tires were on it they stripped them off murphy of course isnt confiding in the police either and that ended the matter but theres been talk about it lou theres been talk even though apparently no one has attached any great significance to the event i cleared my throat i why should they joe i said i guess i dont get you for the birds lou remember the starving sparrows those tires were stolen after ninethirty on the night of elmers and his lady friends demise assuming that johnnie didnt go to work on them the moment the owner parked or even assuming that he did we are driven to the inevitable conclusion that he was engaged in relatively innocent pursuits until well after ten oclock he could not in other words have had any part in the horrible happenings behind yonder blackjacks i dont see why not i said you dont his eyes widened well of course poor old descartes aristotle diogenes euclid et al are dead but i think youll find quite a few people around wholl defend their theories im very much afraid lou that they wont go along with your proposition that a body can be in two places at the same time johnnie ran with a pretty wild crowd i said i figure that one of his buddies stole those tires and gave em to him to peddle i see i see lou why not i said he was in a good position to get rid of them there at the station slim murphy wouldnt have interfered why hell its bound to have been that way joe if hed have had an alibi for the time of the murders hed have told me so wouldnt he he wouldnt have hanged himself he liked you lou he trusted you for damned good reasons he knew i was his friend rothman swallowed and a sort of laughing sound came out of his throat the kind of sound you make when you dont quite know whether to laugh or cry or get sore fine lou perfect every brick is laid straight and the bricklayer is an honest upstanding mechanic but still i cant help wondering about his handiwork and him i cant help wondering why he feels the need to defend his structure of perhapses and maybes his shelter wall of logical alternatives i cant see why he didnt tell a certain labor skate to get the hell on about his business so so there it was i was but where was he he nodded as though id asked him the question nodded and drew a little bit back in the seat humptydumpty ford he said sitting right on top of the labor temple and how or why he got there doesnt make much difference youre going to have to move lou fast before someone before you upset yourself i was kind of figuring on leaving town i said i havent done anything but certainly you havent otherwise as a staunch red fascist republican i wouldnt feel free to yank you from the clutches of your detractors and persecutors your wouldbe persecutors i should say you think that you think maybe he shrugged i think so lou i think you just might have a little trouble in leaving i think it so strongly that im getting in touch with a friend of mine one of the best criminal lawyers in the country youve probably heard of him billy boy walker i did billy boy a favor one time back east and he has a long memory for favors regardless of his other faults id heard of billy boy walker i reckon almost everyone has hed been governor of alabama or georgia or one of those states down south hed been a united states senator hed been a candidate for president on a dividethedough ticket hed started getting shot at quite a bit about that time so hed dropped out of politics and stuck to his criminal law practice and he was plenty good all the high muckymucks cussed and made fun of him for the way hed cut up in politics but i noticed that when they or their kin got into trouble they headed straight for billy boy walker it sort of worried me that rothman thought i needed that kind of help it worried me and it made me wonder all over again why rothman and his unions would go to all the trouble of getting me a lawyer just what did rothman stand to lose if the law started asking me questions then i realized that if my first conversation with rothman should ever come out any jury in the land would figure hed sicked me on the late elmer conway in other words rothman was saving two necks his and mine with one lawyer perhaps you wont need him he went on but its best to have him alerted hes not a man who can make himself available on a moments notice how soon can you leave town i hesitated amy how was i going to do it ill i cant do it right away i said ill have to kind of drop a hint or two around that ive been thinking about leaving then work up to it gradually you know it would look pretty funny yeah he frowned but if they know youre getting ready to jump theyre apt to close in all the faster still i can see your point what can they do i said if they could close in theyd be doing it already not that ive done dont bother dont say it again just move start moving as quickly as you can it shouldnt take you more than a couple of weeks at the outside two weeks two weeks more for amy all right joe i said and thanks for for for what he opened the door for you i havent done a thing im not sure i can make it in two weeks it may take a little it hadnt better he said take much longer he got out and went back to his own car i waited until hed turned around and headed back toward central city and then i turned around and started back i drove slowly thinking about amy years ago there was a jeweler here in central city who had a hell of a good business and a beautiful wife and two fine kids and one day on a business trip over to one of the teachers college towns he met up with a girl a real honey and before long he was sleeping with her she knew he was married and she was willing to leave it that way so everything was perfect he had her and he had his family and a swell business but one morning they found him and the girl dead in a motel hed shot her and killed himself and when one of our deputies went to tell his wife about it he found her and the kids dead too this fellow had shot em all hed had everything and somehow nothing was better that sounds pretty mixed up and probably it doesnt have a lot to do with me i thought it did at first but now that i look at it well i dont know i just dont know i knew i had to kill amy i could put the reason into words but every time i thought about it i had to stop and think why again id be doing something reading a book or something or maybe id be with her and all of a sudden it would come over me that i was going to kill her and the idea seemed so crazy that id almost laugh out loud then id start thinking and id see it see that it had to be done and it was like being asleep when you were awake and awake when you were asleep id pinch myself figuratively speaking i had to keep pinching myself then id wake up kind of in reverse id go back into the nightmare i had to live in and everything would be clear and reasonable but i still didnt know how to go about doing it i couldnt figure out a way that would leave me in the clear or even reasonably in the clear and i sure had to be on this one i was humptydumpty like rothman had said and i couldnt jiggle around very much i couldnt think of a way because it was a real toughie and i had to keep remembering the why of it but finally it came to me i found a way because i had to i couldnt stall any longer it happened three days after my talk with rothman it was a payday saturday and i should have been working but somehow i hadnt been able to bring myself to do it id stayed in the house all day with the shades drawn pacing back and forth wandering from room to room and when night came i was still there i was sitting in dads office with nothing on but the little desk light and i heard these footsteps moving lightly across the porch and the sound of the screen door opening it was way too early for amy but i wasnt jittered any id had people walk in before like this i stepped to the door of the office just as he came into the hail im sorry stranger i said the doctor doesnt practice any more the signs just there for sentimental reasons thats okay bud he walked right toward me and i had to move back its just a little burn but i dont a cigar burn he said and he held his hand out palm up and at last i recognized him he sat down in dads big leather chair grinning at me he brushed his hand across the arm knocking off the coffee cup and saucer id left there we got some talking to do bud and im thirsty you got some whiskey around an unopened bottle i aint no whiskey hog understand but some places i like to see a seal on a bottle ive got a phone around i said and the jails about six blocks away now drag your ass out of here before you find yourself in it huhuh he said you want to use that phone go right ahead bud i started to i figured hed be afraid to go through with it and if he did well my word was still better than any bums no one had anything on me and i was still lou ford and he wouldnt get his mouth open before someone smacked a sap in it go head bud but itll cost you itll sure cost you and it wont be just the price of a burned hand i held onto the phone but i didnt lift the receiver go on i said lets have it i got interested in you bud i spent a year stretch on the houston pea farm and i seen a couple guys like you there and i figured it might pay to watch you a little so i followed you that night i heard some of the talk you had with that labor fellow and i reckon it meant a hell of a lot to you didnt it i said no sir he wagged his head hardly meant a thing to me fact is it didnt mean much to me a couple nights later when you came up to that old farm house where i was shacked up and then cut crossprairie to that little white house that didnt mean much neither then you say you had some whiskey bud an unopened bottle i went into the laboratory and got a pint of old prescription liquor from the stores cabinet i brought it back with a glass and he opened it and poured the glass half full have one on the house he said and handed it to me i drank it i needed it i passed the glass back to him and he dropped it on the floor with the cup and saucer he took a big swig from the bottle and smacked his lips no sir he went on it didnt mean a thing and i couldnt stick around to figure it out i hiked out of there early monday morning and hit up the pipeline for a job they put me with a jackhammer crew way the hell over on the pecos so far out i couldnt make town my first payday just three of us there by ourselves cut off from the whole danged world but this payday it was different wed finished up on the pecos and i got to come in i caught up on the news bud and those things youd done and said meant plenty i nodded i felt kind of glad it was out of my hands now and the pieces were falling into place i knew i had to do it and how i was going to do it he took another swallow of whiskey and dug a cigarette from his shirt pocket im an understandin man bud and the law aint helped me none and i aint helpin it none unless i have to what you figure its worth to you to go on living i i shook my head i had to go slow i couldnt give in too easily i havent got much money i said just what i make on my job you got this place must be worth a pretty tidy sum too yeah but hell i said its all ive got if im not going to have a window left to throw it out of theres not much percentage in keeping you quiet you might change your mind about that bud he said but he didnt sound too firm about it anyway i said its just not practical to sell it people would wonder what id done with the money id have to account for it to the government and pay a big chunk of taxes on it for that matter i reckon youre in kind of a hurry you reckon right bud well it would take quite a while to get rid of a place like this id want to sell it to a doctor someone whod pay for my dads practice and equipment itd be worth at least a third more that way but the deal couldnt be swung in a hurry he studied me suspiciously trying to figure out how much if any i was stringing him as a matter of fact i wasnt lying moren a little bit i dont know he said slowly i dont know much about them things maybe you reckon you could swing a loan on it well id sure hate to do that that aint what i asked you bud but look i said making it good how would i pay it back out of my job i just couldnt do it i probably wouldnt get more than five thousand after they took out interest and brokerage fees and id have to turn right around somewhere and swing another loan to pay off the first one and hell thats no way to do business now if youll just give me fourfive months to find someone who huhuh how long it take you to swing this loan a week well i might have to give her a little longer than that i wanted to give her longer i think thatd be a little bit quick id say two weeks but id sure hate five thousand he said sloshing the whiskey in the bottle five thousand in two weeks two weeks from tonight all right bud well call that a deal an itll be a deal understand i aint no hog about money or nothin i get the five thousand and thats the last well see of each other i scowled and cussed but i said well all right he tucked the whiskey into his hip pocket and stood up okay bud im going back out to the pipeline tonight this aint a very friendly place for easylivin men so ill stay out there another payday but dont get no notions about runnin out on me how the hell could i i said you think im crazy you ask unpleasant questions bud and you may get unpleasant answers just be here with that five grand two weeks from tonight and there wont be no trouble i gave him a clincher i still felt i might be giving in too easy maybe youd better not come here i said someone might see you and no one will ill watch myself like i did tonight i aint no more anxious for trouble than you are well i said i just thought it might be better if we now bud he shook his head what happened the last time you was out wanderin around old empty farm houses it didnt turn out so good did it all right i said suit yourself about it thats just what i aim to do he glanced toward the clock we got it all straight then five thousand two weeks from tonight nine oclock thats it and dont slip up on it dont worry youll get it i said he stood at the front door a moment sizing up the situation outside then he slipped out and off of the porch and disappeared in the trees on the lawn i grinned feeling a little sorry for him it was funny the way these people kept asking for it just latching onto you no matter how you tried to brush them off and almost telling you how they wanted it done whyd they all have to come to me to get killed why couldnt they kill themselves i cleaned up the broken dishes in the office i went upstairs and lay down and waited for amy i didnt have long to wait i didnt have long and in a way she was the same as always sort of snappy and trying not to be but i could sense a difference the stiffness that comes when you want to say or do something and dont know how to begin or maybe she could sense it in me maybe we sensed it in each other i guess thats the way it was because we both came out with it together we spoke at the same time lou why dont we amy why dont we we said we laughed and said bread and butter and then she spoke again you do want to dont you darling honest and truly didnt i just start to ask you i said how when do you well i was thinking a couple of weeks would darling she kissed me that was just what i was going to say there was just a little more that last piece of the picture needed one more little push what are you thinking about darling well i was thinking weve always had to do kinda like people expected us to i mean well what were you thinking about you tell me first lou no you tell me amy well well why dont we elope we said we laughed and she threw her arms around me snuggled up against me sort of shivery but warm so hard but so soft and she whispered into my ear and i whispered into hers bread and butter bad luck stay way from my darling he showed up on well i guess it was the following tuesday the tuesday after the saturday the bum had shown up and amy and i had decided to elope he was a tall stoopshouldered guy with a face that seemed to be all bone and yellowish tightly drawn skin he said his name was dr john smith and that he was just passing through he was just looking around in this section and hed heard hed thought perhaps that the house and the practice might be on the market it was around nine oclock in the morning by rights i should have been headed for the courthouse but i wasnt knocking myself out these days to get downtown and dad had always laid himself out for any doctors that came around ive thought about selling it off and on i said but thats about as far as its gone ive never taken any steps in that direction but come in anyway doctors are always welcome in this house i sat him down in the office and brought out a box of cigars and got him some coffee then i sat down with him and tried to visit i cant say that i liked him much he kept staring at me out of his big yellow eyes like i was really some sort of curiosity something to look at instead of to talk to but well doctors get funny mannerisms they live in an imtheking world where everyone else is wrong but them youre a general practitioner doctor smith i said i wouldnt want to discourage you but im afraid the general practice field is pretty well the monopoly here of longestablished doctors now i havent thought too much about disposing of this place but i might consider it now i do think theres room for a good man in pediatrics or obstetrics i let it hang there and he blinked and came out of his trance as a matter of fact i am interested in those fields mr ford i would uh hesitate to call myself a specialist but uh i think you might find an opening here then i said whats been your experience in treating nephritis doctor would you say that inoculation with measles has sufficiently proven itself as a curative agent to warrant the inherent danger well uh uh he crossed his legs yes and no i nodded seriously you feel that there are two sides to the question well uh yes i see i said id never thought about it quite that way but i can see that youre right thats your uh specialty mr ford childrens diseases i havent any specialty doctor i laughed im living proof of the adage about the shoemakers son going barefooted but ive always been interested in children and i suppose the little i do know about medicine is confined to pediatrics i see well uh as a matter of fact most of my work has been in uh geriatrics you should do well here then i said we have a high percentage of elderly people in the population geriatrics eh well uh as a matter of fact you know max jacobsohn on degenerative diseases what do you think of his theorem as to the ratio between decelerated activity and progressive senility i can understand the basic concept of course but my math isnt good enough to allow me to appreciate his formulae perhaps youll explain them to me well i uh its pretty complicated i see you feel perhaps that jacobsohns approach may be a trifle empirical well i was inclined to that belief myself for a time but im afraid it may have been because my own approach was too subjective for instance is the condition pathological is it psychopathological is it psychopathologicalpsychosomatic yes yes yes it can be one or two or all three but in varying degrees doctor like it or not we must contemplate an x factor now to strike an equation and youll pardon me for oversimplifying lets say that our cosine is i went on smiling and talking wishing that max jacobsohn was here to see him from what id heard of dr jacobsohn hed probably grab this guy by the seat of his pants and boot him out into the street as a matter of fact he interrupted me rubbing a big bony hand across his forehead i have a very bad headache what do you do for headaches mr ford i never have them i said uh oh i thought perhaps that studying so much sitting up late nights when you cant uh sleep i never have any trouble sleeping i said you dont worry a lot i mean that in a town such as this where there is so much gossip uh malicious gossip you dont feel that people are talking about you it doesnt uh seem unbearable at times you mean i said slowly do i feel persecuted well as a matter of fact i do doctor but i never worry about it i cant say that it doesnt bother me but yes yes mr ford well whenever it gets too bad i just step out and kill a few people i frig them to death with a barbedwire cob i have after that i feel fine id been trying to place him and finally it had come to me its been several years since id seen that big ugly mug in one of the outoftown papers and the picture hadnt been so good a resemblance but i remembered it now and some of the story id read about him hed taken his degree at the university of edinburgh at a time when we were admitting their graduates to practice hed killed half a dozen people before he picked up a jerkwater phd and edged into psychiatry out on the west coast hed worked himself into some staff job with the police and then a big murder case had cropped up and hed gotten hogwild raw with the wrong suspects people who had the money and influence to fight back he hadnt lost his license but hed had to skip out fast now well i knew what hed be doing now what hed have to be doing lunatics cant vote so why should the legislature vote a lot of money for them as a matter of fact uh it was just beginning to soak in on him i think id better stick around i said ill show you that corncob or maybe you can show me something from your collection those japanese sex goods you used to flash around whatd you do with that rubber phallus you had the one you squirted into that high school kids face didnt you have time to pack it when you jumped the coast im aafraid you have me confused wwith as a matter of fact i said i do but you dont have me confused you wouldnt know how to begin you wouldnt know shit from wild honey so go back and sign your report that way sign it shitbird and youd better add a footnote to the effect that the next sonofabitch they send out here is going to get kicked so hard hell be wearing his asshole for a collar he backed out into the hall and toward the front door the bones in his face wobbling and twitching under the tight yellow skin i followed him grinning he stuck a hand out sideways and lifted his hat from the hall tree he put it on backwards and i laughed and took a quick step toward him he almost fell out the door and i picked up his briefcase and threw it into the yard take care of yourself doc i said take good care of your keys if you ever lose them you wont be able to get out you youll be the bones were jerking and jumping hed got down the steps and his nerve was coming back if i ever get you up me doc but i sleep swell i dont have headaches im not worried a bit the only thing that bothers me is that corncob wearing out he snatched up the briefcase and went loping down the walk his neck stuck out like a buzzards i slammed the door and made more coffee i cooked a big second breakfast and ate it all you see it didnt make a bit of difference i hadnt lost a thing by telling him off id thought they were closing in on me and now i knew it and theyd know that i knew it but nothing was lost by that and nothing else had changed they could still only guess suspect they had no more to go on than theyd ever had they still wouldnt have anything two weeks well ten days from now theyd have more suspicions theyd feel surer than ever but they wouldnt have any proof they could only find the proof in me in what i was and id never show it to em i finished the pot of coffee smoked a cigar and washed and wiped the dishes i tossed some bread scraps into the yard for the sparrows and watered the sweet potato plant in the kitchen window then i got out the car and headed for town and i was thinking how good it had been to talk even if he had turned out to be phony for a while to talk really talk for even a little while i killed amy stanton on saturday night on the fifth of april at a few minutes before nine oclock it had been a bright crisp spring day just warm enough sos youd know that summer was coming and the night was just tolerably cool and she fixed her folks an early dinner and got them off to a picture show about seven then at eightthirty she came over to my place and well i saw them going by my house her folks i mean and i guess she must have been standing at their gate waving to em because they were looking back and waving then i guess she went back into the house and started getting ready real fast taking her hair down and bathing and fixing her face and getting her bags packed i guess she must have been busy as all hell jumping sideways to get ready because she hadnt been able to do much while her folks were around i guess she must have been chasing back and forth turning on the electric iron shutting off the bathwater straightening the seams in her stockings moving her mouth in and out to center the lipstick while she jerked the pins from her hair why hell she had dozens of things to do dozens of em and if shed just moved a little bit slower ever so little but amy was one of those quick sure girls she was ready with time to spare i guess and then i guess she stood in front of the mirror frowning and smiling pouting and tossing her head tucking her chin in and looking up under her brows studying herself frontwards and sidewards turning around and looking over her shoulder and brushing at her bottom hitching her girdle up a little and down a little and then gripping it by both sides and sort of wiggling her hips in it then then i guess that must have been about all she was all ready so she came over where i was and i i was ready too i wasnt fully dressed but i was ready for her i was standing in the kitchen waiting for her and she was out of breath from hurrying so fast i guess and her bags were pretty heavy i guess and i guess i guess im not ready to tell about it yet its too soon and its not necessary yet because hell we had a whole two weeks before then before saturday april th at a few minutes before nine pm we had two weeks and they were pretty good ones because for the first time in i dont remember when my mind was really free the end was coming up it was rushing toward me and everything would be over soon i could think well go ahead and say something do something and it wont matter now i can stall you that long and i dont have to watch myself any more i was with her every night i took her everywhere she wanted to go and did everything she wanted to do and it wasnt any trouble because she didnt want to go much or do much one evening we parked by the high school and watched the baseball team work out another time we went down to the depot to see the tulsa flyer go through with the people looking out the dining car windows and the people staring back from the observation car thats about all we did things like that except maybe to drive down to the confectionery for some ice cream most of the time we just stayed at home at my house both of us sitting in dads big old chair or both of us stretched out upstairs face to face holding each other just holding each other a lot of nights wed lie there for hours not speaking for an hour at a time sometimes but the time didnt drag any it seemed to rush by id lie there listening to the ticking of the clock listening to her heart beat with it and id wonder why it had to tick so fast id wonder why and it was hard to wake up and go to sleep to go back into the nightmare where i could remember we had a few quarrels but no bad ones i just wasnt going to have them i let her have her own way and she tried to do the same with me one night she said she was going to the barbershop with me some time and see that i got a decent haircut for a change and i said before i remembered whenever she felt like doing that id start wearing it in a braid so we had a little spat but nothing bad then one night she asked me how many cigars i smoked in a day and i said i didnt keep track of em she asked me why i didnt smoke cigarettes like everyone else did and i said i didnt reckon that everyone else did smoke em i said there was two members of my family that never smoked em dad and me she said well of course if you thought more of him than you do of me theres nothing more to be said and i said jesus christ how do you figure whats that got to do with it but it was just a little spat nothing bad at all i reckon she forgot about it right away like she did the first one i think she must have had a mighty good time those two weeks bettern any shed ever had before so the two weeks passed and the night of april fifth came and she hustled her folks off to a show and scampered around getting ready and she got ready and at eightthirty she came over to my place and i was waiting for her and i but i guess im getting ahead of myself again theres some other things to tell first i went to work every working day of those two weeks and believe me it wasnt easy i didnt want to face anyone i wanted to stay there in the house with the shades drawn and not see anyone at all and i knew i couldnt do that i went to work i forced myself to just like always they suspected me and id let em know that i knew but there wasnt a thing on my conscience i wasnt afraid of a thing and i proved that there wasnt by going down because how could a man whod done what they thought i had go right on about his business and look people in the eye i was sore sure my feelings were hurt but i wasnt afraid and i proved it most of the time at first anyway i wasnt given much to do and believe me that was hard standing around with my face hanging out and pretending like i didnt notice or give a damn and when i did get a little job serving a warrant or something like that there was always a reason for another deputy to go along with me hed be embarrassed and puzzled because of course they were keeping the secret at the top between hendricks and conway and bob maples hed wonder what was up but he couldnt ask because in our own way were the politest people in the world well joke around and talk about everything except whats on our minds but hed wonder and hed be embarrassed and hed try to brag me up maybe talk me up about the johnnie pappas deal to make me feel better i was coming back from lunch one day when the hall floors had just been oiled and they didnt make much noise when you stepped on them and when you kind of had to pick your way along they didnt make any at all deputy jeff plummer and sheriff bob were talking and they didnt hear me coming so i stopped just short of the door and listened i listened and i saw them i knew them so well i could see em without looking bob was at his desk pretending to thumb through some papers and his glasses were down on the end of his nose and he was looking up over them now and then and he didnt like what he had to say but youd never know it the way his eyes came up over those glasses and the way he talked jeff plummer was hunkered down in one of the windows studying his fingernails maybe his jaws moving on a stick of gum and he didnt like telling bob off and he didnt sound like he was just easygoing and casual but he was sure as hell doing it no sir bob he drawled been kind of studyin things over and i reckon i aint going to do no spying no more aint going to do it atall you got your mind made up huh youre plumb set well now it sure looks that way dont it yes sir i reckon thats probly the way it is cant rightly see it no other way you see how its possible to do a job ifn you dont follow orders you reckon you can do that now jeff was looking looking real pleased like hed drawn aces to three kings now im sure proud you mentioned that bob i plain admire a man that comes square to a point there was a seconds silence then a clink as jeffs badge hit the desk he slid out of the window and sauntered toward the door smiling but not with his eyes and bob cussed and jumped up you ornery coyote you tryin to knock my eyes out with that thing i ever catch you throwin it around again ill whup you down to a nubbin jeff scuffed his boots he cleared his throat he said it was a plumb purty day out and a mand have to be plain out of his mind to claim different i reckon a man hadnt ought to ask you a question about all the hocuspocus around here now had he bob it wouldnt be what youd call proper well now i dont know as id put it that way dont reckon id even prod him about why he was askin id just figure he was a man and a man just does what he has to i slipped into the mens john and stayed there a while and when i went into the office jeff plummer was gone and bob gave me a warrant to serve by myself he didnt exactly meet my eye but he seemed pretty happy he had his neck out a mile he had everything to lose and nothing to gain and he was happy and i didnt know whether i felt better or not bob didnt have much longer to live and the job was all he had jeff plummer had a wife and four kids and he was just about standing in the middle of his wardrobe whenever you saw him people like that well they dont make up their mind about a man in a hurry but once its made up they hardly ever change it they cant theyd almost rather die than do it i went on about my business every day and things were easier for me in a sense because people acted easier around me and twice as hard in another way because the folks that trust you that just wont hear no bad about you nor even think it those are the ones that are hard to fool you cant put your heart in the job id think about my those people so many of them and id wonder why id have to go through it all again step by step and just about the time id get it settled id start wondering all over again i guess i got kind of sore at myself and at them all those people id think why in the hell did they have to do it i didnt ask em to stick their necks out im not begging for friendship but they did give me their friendship and they did stick their necks out so along toward the last i was sticking mine out i stopped by the greeks place every day i looked over the work and had him explain things to me and id offer him a lift when he had to go some place id say it was sure going to be one uptodate restaurant and that johnnie would sure like it that he did like it because there hadnt ever been a better boy and now he could look on look down and admire things the same as we could i said i knew he could that johnnie was really happy now and the greek didnt have much to say for a while he was polite but he didnt say much then pretty soon he was taking me out in the kitchen for coffee and hed walk me clear out to my car when i had to leave hed hang around me nodding and nodding while i talked about johnnie and once in a while hed remember that maybe he ought to be ashamed and i knew he wanted to apologize but was afraid of hurting my feelings chester conway had been staying in fort worth but he came back in town one day for a few hours and i made it my business to hear about it i was driving by his offices real slow around two in the afternoon when he came barging out looking for a taxi and before he knew what was happening i had him in charge i hopped out took his briefcase away from him and hustled him into my car it was the last thing hedve expected of me he was too set back to talk and he didnt have time to say anything and after we were headed for the airport he didnt get a chance because i was doing all the talking i said ive been hoping to run into you mr conway i wanted to thank you for the hospitality you showed me in fort worth it was sure thoughtful of you at a time like that to think of me and bobs comfort and i guess i wasnt so thoughtful myself i was kind of tired just thinkin of my own problems instead of yours how you must feel and i reckon i was pretty snappy with you there at the airport but i didnt really mean anything by it mr conway and ive been wanting to apologize i wouldnt blame you a bit if you were put out with me because i aint ever had much sense and i guess ive made a hell of a mess of things now i knew elmer was kind of innocent and trusting and i knew a woman like that just couldnt be much good i shoulda done like you said and gone there with him i dont rightly see how i could the way she was acting but i shoulda done that anyway and dont think i dont know it now and if cussing me out will help any or if you want to get my job and i know you can get it i wont hold any grudge no matter what you did it wouldnt be enough it wouldnt bring elmer back an i never got to know him real well but in a way kinda i felt like i did i reckon it mustve been because he looked so much like you id see him from a distance some times and id think it was you i guess maybe thats one reason i wanted to see you today it was kinda like seem elmer again i could sorta feel for a minute that he was still here an nothing had ever happened an wed come to the airport he got out without speaking or looking at me and strode off to the plane moving fast never turning around or looking sideways almost like he was running away from something he started up the ramp but he wasnt moving so fast now he was walking slower and slower and halfway up he almost stopped then he went on plodding dragging his feet and he reached the top and he stood there for a second blocking the door he turned around gave the briefcase a little jerk and ducked inside the plane hed waved to me i drove back to town and i guess i gave up about then it was no use id done everything i could id dropped it in their plates and rubbed their noses in it and it was no use they wouldnt see it no one would stop me so on saturday night april th at a few minutes before nine oclock i but i guess theres another thing or two to tell you first and but i will tell you about it i want to tell you and i will exactly how it happened i wont leave you to figure things out for yourself in lots of books i read the writer seems to go haywire every time he reaches a high point hell start leaving out punctuation and running his words together and babble about stars flashing and sinking into a deep dreamless sea and you cant figure out whether the heros laying his girl or a cornerstone i guess that kind of crap is supposed to be pretty deep stuff a lot of the book reviewers eat it up i notice but the way i see it is the writer is just too goddam lazy to do his job and im not lazy whatever else i am ill tell you everything but i want to get everything in the right order i want you to understand how it was late saturday afternoon i got bob maples alone for a minute and told him i wouldnt be able to work that night i said that amy and me had something mighty important to do and maybe i wouldnt be getting in monday or tuesday either and i gave him a wink well now he hesitated frowning well now you dont think maybe that then he gripped my hand and wrung it thats real good news lou real good i know youll be happy together ill try not to lay off too long i said i reckon things are well kind of up in the air and no they aint he said sticking his chin out everythings all right and its going to stay that way now go on and buss amy for me and dont you worry about nothing it still wasnt real late in the day so i drove out on derrick road and parked a while then i went home leaving the car parked out in front and fixed dinner i stretched out on the bed for about an hour letting my food settle i drew water in the bath tub and got in i lay in the tub for almost an hour soaking and smoking and thinking finally i got out looked at the clock and began laying out clothes i packed my gladstone and cinched the straps on it i put on clean underwear and socks and newpressed pants and my sunday gotomeetin boots i left off my shirt and tie i sat on the edge of the bed smoking until eight oclock then i went downstairs to the kitchen i turned the light on in the pantry moving the door back and forth until i had it like i wanted it until there was just enough light in the kitchen i looked around making sure that all the blinds were drawn and went into dads office i took down the concordance to the bible and removed the four hundred dollars in marked money elmers money i dumped the drawers of dads desk on the floor i turned off the light pulled the door almost shut and went back into the kitchen the evening newspaper was spread out on the table i slid a butcher knife under it and and it was that time i heard her coming she came up the back steps and across the porch and banged and fumbled around for a minute getting the door open she came in out of breath kind of and out of temper and pushed the door shut behind her and she saw me standing there not saying anything because id forgotten why and i was trying to remember and finally i did remember so or did i mention it already on saturday night the fifth of april at a few minutes before nine oclock i killed amy stanton or maybe you could call it suicide she saw me and it startled her for a second then she dropped her two traveling cases on the floor and gave one of em a kick and brushed a wisp of hair from her eyes well she snapped i dont suppose it would occur to you to give me a little help why didnt you leave the car in the garage anyway i shook my head i didnt say anything ill swear lou ford sometimes i think and youre not even ready yet youre always talking about how slow i am and here you stand on your own wedding night of all things and you havent she stopped suddenly her mouth shut tight her breasts rising and falling and i heard the kitchen clock tick ten times before she spoke again im sorry darling she said softly i didnt mean dont say anything more amy i said just dont say anything more she smiled and came toward me with her arms held out i wont darling i wont ever say anything like that again but i do want to tell you how much sure i said you want to pour your heart out to me and i hit her in the guts as hard as i could my fist went back against her spine and the flesh closed around it to the wrist i jerked back on it i had to jerk and she flopped forward from the waist like she was hinged her hat fell off and her head went clear down and touched the floor and then she toppled over completely over like a kid turning a somersault she lay on her back eyes bulging rolling her head from side to side she was wearing a white blouse and a light creamcolored suit a new one i reckon because i didnt remember seeing it before i got my hand in the front of the blouse and ripped it down to the waist i jerked the skirt up over her head and she jerked and shook all over and there was a funny sound like she was trying to laugh and then i saw the puddle spreading out under her i sat down and tried to read the paper i tried to keep my eyes on it but the light wasnt very good not good enough to read by and she kept moving around it looked like she couldnt lie still once i felt something touch my boot and i looked down and it was her hand it was moving back and forth across the toe of my boot it moved up along the ankle and the leg and somehow i was afraid to move away and then her fingers were at the top clutching down inside and i almost couldnt move i stood up and tried to jerk away and the fingers held on i dragged her twothree feet before i could break away her fingers kept on moving sliding and crawling back and forth and finally they got ahold of her purse and held on they dragged it down inside of her skirt and i couldnt see it or her hands any more well that was all right it would look better to have her hanging onto her purse and i grinned a little thinking about it it was so much like her you know to latch onto her purse shed always been so tight and and i guess shed had to be there wasnt a better family in town than the stantons but both her folks had been ailing for years and they didnt have much any more aside from their home shed had to be tight like any damned fool ought to have known because there wasnt any other way of being and thats all any of us ever are what we have to be and i guessed it hadnt been very funny when id kidded her deadpan and acted surprised when she got mad i guess that stuff shed brought to me when i was sick wasnt really crap it was as good as she knew how to fix i guess that dog of theirs didnt have to chase horses unlessn he wanted the exercise i why the hell didnt he come hell she hadnt had a real breath now in almost thirty minutes and it was hard as hell on her i knew how hard it was and i held my own breath for a while because wed always done things together and he came id locked the front screen so that he couldnt just walk in and i heard him tugging at it i gave her two hard kicks in the head and she rose off the floor her skirt falling down off of her face and i knew there wouldnt be any doubt about her she was dead on the night of then i went and opened the door and let him in i pushed the roll of marked twenties on him and said stick this in your pocket ive got the rest back in the kitchen and i started back there i knew he would put the money in his pocket and you do too if you can remember back when you were a kid youd walk up to a guy and say here hold this and probably hed pulled the same gag himself hed know you were handing him a horse turd or a prickly pear or a dead mouse but if you pulled it fast enough hed do just what you told him i pulled it fast and headed right back toward the kitchen and he was right on my heels because he didnt want me to get too far away from him there was just a little light like ive said i was between him and her he was right behind me watching me instead of anything else and we went into the kitchen and i stepped aside quickly he almost stepped on her stomach i guess his foot did touch it for a split second he pulled it back staring down at her like his eyes were steel and she was a magnet he tried to tug them away and theyd just roll going allwhite in his head and finally he got them away he looked at me and his lips shook as though hed been playing a juiceharp and he said yeeeeeeee it was a hell of a funny sound like a siren with a slippy chain that cant quite get started yeeeeee he said yeeeeee it sounded funny as hell and he looked funny as hell did you ever see one of these twobit jazz singers you know trying to put something across with their bodies that they havent got the voice to do they lean back from the waist a little with their heads hanging forward and their hands held up about even with their ribs and swinging limp and they sort of wobble and roll on their hips thats the way he looked and he kept making that damned funny noise his lips quivering ninety to the minute and his eyes rolling allwhite i laughed and laughed he looked and sounded so funny i couldnt help it then i remembered what hed done and i stopped laughing and got mad sore all over you sonofabitch i said i was going to marry that poor little girl we were going to elope and she caught you going through the house and you tried to i stopped because he hadnt done it at all but he could have done it he couldve done it just as easy as not the sonofabitch could have but he was just like everyone else he was too niceynice and pretendsy to do anything really hard but hed stand back and crack the whip over me keep moving around me every way i turned so that i couldnt get away no matter what i did and it was always nowdontyoudonothinbud but they kept cracking that old whip all the time they were sayin it and they hed done it all right and i wasnt going to take the blame i could be just as tricky and pretendsy as they were i could i went blind ma angry seeing him so pretendsy shocked yeeing and shivering and doing that screwy dance with his hands hell he hadnt had to watch her hands and whiterolling his eyes what right did he have to act like that i was the one that should have been acting that way but oh no i couldnt that was their his right to act that way and i had to hold in and do all the dirty work i was as mad as all hell i snatched the butcher knife from under the newspaper and made for him and my foot slipped where shed been lying i went sprawling almost knocking him over backwards if he hadnt moved and the knife flew out of my hands i couldnt have moved a finger for a minute i was laid out flat helpless without any weapon and i could have maybe rolled a little and put my arms around her and wed have been together like wed always been but do you think hed do it do you think hed pick up that knife and use it just a little thing like that that wouldnt have been a bit of trouble oh hell no oh god no oh christ and mary and all the saints no all he could do was beat it just like they always did i grabbed up the knife and took off after the heartless sonofabitch he was out to the street sidewalk by the time i got to the front door the dirty bastard had sneaked a head start on me when i got out to the walk he was bettern a halfblock away heading toward the center of town i took after him as fast as i could go that wasnt very fast on account of the boots ive seen plenty of men out here that never walked fifty miles altogether in their lives but he wasnt moving very fast either he was sort of skipping jerky rather than running or walking he was skipping and tossing his head and his hair was flying and he still had his elbows held in at his sides with his hands doing that funny floppy dance and he kept saying it was louder now that old siren was warming up he kept saying kind of screaming yeeeee yeeeeee yeeeeeeeeee he was skipping and flopping his hands and tossing his head like one of those holy roller preachers at a brushwoods revival meeting yeeeing and gonetojesus and all you miserable sinners get right with gawd like i went and done the dirty sonofabitch how low down can you get murder i yelled stop him stop him he killed amy stanton murder i yelled at the top of my lungs and i kept yelling and windows started banging up and doors slammed and people ran down off their porches and that snapped him out of that crap some of it he skipped out into the middle of the street and started moving faster but i moved faster too because it was still dirt in this block just one short of the business district and boots are meant for dirt he saw that i was gaining a little on him and he tried to come out of that floppy skippy stuff but it didnt look like he could quite make it maybe he was using too much steam with that yeeeeing murder i yelled murder stop him he killed amy stanton and everything was happening awful fast it just sounds like it was a long time because im not leaving out anything im trying to tell you exactly how it was sos youll be sure to understand looking up ahead into the business district it looked like a whole army of automobiles was bearing down on us then suddenly it was like a big plow had come down the street pushing all those cars into the curb thats the way people are here in this section thats the way they get you dont see them rushing into the middle of a commotion to find out whats happening theres men that are paid to do that and they do it prompt without any fuss or feathers and the folks know that no ones going to feel sorry for em if they get in the way of a gun or a bullet yeeeeee yeeeeee yeeeeeeeeeeeeee he screamed skipping and flopping murder he killed amy stanton and up ahead a little old roadster swung crossways with the intersection and stopped and jeff plummer climbed out he reached down on the floor and took out a winchester taking his time easylike he leaned back against the fender one boot heel hooked through the wheel spokes and brought the gun up to his shoulder halt he called he called out the one time and then he fired because the bum had started to skip toward the side of the street and a man sure ought to know better than that the bum stumbled and went down grabbing at his knee but he got up again and he was still jerking and flopping his hands and it looked like he was reaching into his clothes and a man really hadnt ought to do that he hadnt even ought to look anything like that jeff fired three times shifting his aim easylike with each shot and the bum was dropping with the first one but all three got him by the time he hit the dirt he didnt have much left in the way of a head i fell down on top of him and began beating him and they had their hands full dragging me off i babbled out the story how id been upstairs getting ready and id heard some commotion but i hadnt thought much of it and and i didnt have to tell it too good they all seemed to understand how it was a doctor pushed through the crowd dr zweilman and he gave me a shot in the arm and then they took me home i woke up a little after nine the next morning my mouth was sticky and my throat dry from the morphine i dont know why he hadnt used hyoscin like any damned fool should have and all i could think of right then was how thirsty i was i stood in the bathroom gulping down glass after glass of water and pretty soon it began to bounce on me but after a while it stopped i drank a couple glasses more and they stayed down and i scrubbed my face in hot and cold water and combed my hair then i went back and sat down on the bed wondering whod undressed me and all at once it hit me not about her i wouldnt think about that but well this i shouldnt have been alone your friends dont leave you alone at a time like that id lost the girl i was going to marry and id been through a terrible experience and theyd left me alone there wasnt anyone around to comfort me or wait on me or just sit and shake their heads and say it was gods will and she was happy and i a man thats been through something like that needs those things he needs all the help and comfort he can get and ive never held back when one of my friends was bereaved why hell i a man isnt himself when one of these disasters strikes he might do something to himself and the least people can do is have a nurse around and but there wasnt any nurse around i got up and looked through the other bedrooms just to make sure and i wasnt doing anything to myself theyd never done anything for me and i wasnt doing anything for them i went downstairs and and the kitchen had been cleaned up there was no one there but me i started to make some coffee and then i thought i heard someone out in front someone cough and i was so allfired glad i felt the tears come to my eyes i turned off the coffee and went to the front door and opened it jeff plummer was sitting on the steps he was sitting sideways his back to a porch post he slanted a glance at me then let his eyes go straight again without turning his head gosh jeff i said how long you been out here why didnt you knock been here quite a spell he said and he fingered a stick of gum from his shirt pocket and began to unwrap it yes sir i been here quite a spell well come on in i was just kinda like it where i am he said air smells real good been smellin real good anyways he put the gum in his mouth he folded the wrapper into a neat little square and tucked in back into his pocket yes sir he said its been smellin real good and thats a fact i felt like i was nailed there in the doorway i had to stand there and wait watch his jaws move on that gum look at him not looking at me never looking at me has there hasnt anyone been told em you wasnt up to it he said told em you was all broke up about bob maples well i bob shot hisself around midnight last night yes sir pore ol bob killed hisself and i reckon he had to i reckon i know just how he felt and he still didnt look at me i closed the door i leaned against it my eyes aching my head pounding and i ticked them off with the pounding that reached from my head to my heart joyce elmer johnnie pappas amy the him bob maples but he hadnt known anything he couldnt have known had any real proof hed just jumped to conclusions like they were jumping he couldnt wait for me to explain like hell idve been glad to do hadnt i always been glad to explain but he couldnt wait hed made up his mind without any proof like theyd made up theirs just because id been around when a few people got killed just because i happened to be around they couldnt know anything because i was the only one who could tell em show em and i never had and i sure as hell wasnt going to actually well logically and you cant do away with logic there wasnt anything existence and proof are inseparables you have to have the second to have the first i held onto that thought and i fixed myself a nice big breakfast but i couldnt eat but a little bit that darned morphine had taken all my appetite just like it always does about all i could get down was part of a piece of toast and twothree cups of coffee i went back upstairs and lighted a cigar and stretched out on the bed i a man thatd been through what i had belonged in bed about a quarter of eleven i heard the front door open and close but i stayed right where i was i still stayed there stretched out on the bed smoking when howard hendricks and jeff plummer came in howard gave me a curt nod and drew up a straight chair near the bed jeff sat down sort of out of the way in an easy chair howard could hardly hold himself in but he was sure trying he tried he did the best he could to be stern and sorrowful and to hold his voice steady lou he said we im not at all satisfied last nights events these recent events i dont like them a bit lou well i said thats natural enough dont hardly see how you could like em i know i sure dont you know what i mean why sure i do i know just how now this alleged robberrapist this poor devil youd have us believe was a robber and rapist we happen to know he was nothmg of the kind he was a pipeline worker he had a pocket full of wages and and yes we know he wasnt drunk because hed just had a big steak dinner he wouldnt have had the slightest reason to be in this house so miss stanton couldnt have are you saying he wasnt here howard i said that should be mighty easy to prove well he wasnt prowling thats a certainty if why is it i said if he wasnt prowling what was he doing his eyes began to glitter never mind let that go for a minute but ill tell you this much if you think you can get away with planting that money on him and making it look like what money i said i thought you said it was his wages you see the guy didnt have any sense otherwise hed have waited for me to mention that marked money the money you stole from elmer conway the money you took the night you killed him and that woman now wait a minute wait a minute i frowned lets take one thing at a time lets take the woman why would i kill her because well because youd killed elmer and you had to shut her up but why would i kill elmer id known him all my life if id wanted to do him any harm id sure had plenty of chances you know he stopped abruptly yeah i said puzzled why would i kill elmer howard and he couldnt say of course chester conway had given him his orders about that you killed him all right he said his face reddening you killed her you hanged johnnie pappas youre sure not making much sense howard i shook my head you plumb insisted on me talking to johnnie because you knew how much i liked him and how much he liked me now youre saying i killed him you had to kill him to protect yourself youd given him that marked twentydollar bill now you really aint making sense i said lets see there was five hundred dollars missing wasnt there you claiming that i killed elmer and that woman for five hundred dollars is that what youre saying howard im saying that that goddammit johnnie wasnt anywhere near the scene of the murders he was stealing tires at the time they were committed is that a fact i drawled someone see him howard yes i mean well uh see what i mean shrapnel lets say that johnnie didnt do those killings i said and you know it was mighty hard for me to believe that he had howard i said so right along i always did think he was just scared and kind of out of his mind when he hanged himself id been his only friend and now it sort of seemed like i didnt believe in him anymore an his friend jesus so i reckon he didnt do it after all poor little amy was killed in pretty much the same way that other woman was and this man you say he had a big part of the missing money on him five hundred dollars would seem like a lot of money to a man like that an seeing that the two killings were so much alike i let my voice trail off smiling at him and his mouth opened and went shut again shrapnel thats all he had youve got it all figured out havent you he said softly four five murders six counting poor bob maples who staked everything he had on you and you sit there explaining and smiling you arent bothered a bit how can you do it ford how can i shrugged somebody has to keep their heads and it sure looks like you cant you got some more questions howard yes he nodded slowly ive got one how did miss stanton get those bruises on her body old bruises not made last night the same kind of bruises we found on the body of the lakeland woman how did she get them ford shrap bruises i said gosh you got me there howard how would i know hhow he sputtered how would you know yeah i said puzzled how why goddam you youd been screwing that gal for years you dont say that i said no said jeff plummer dont say that but howard turned on him then turned back to me all right i wont say it i dont need to say it that girl had never gone with anyone but you and only you could have done that to her youd been beating on her just like youd beaten on that whore i laughed sort of sadly and amy just took it huh howard i bruised her up and she went right ahead seeing me she got all ready to marry me that wouldnt make sense with any woman and it makes no sense minus about amy you sure wouldnt say a thing like that if youd known amy stanton he shook his head staring like i was some kind of curiosity that old shrapnel wasnt doing a thing for him now maybe amy did pick up a bruise here and there i went on she had all sorts of work to do keepin house and teaching school and everything there was to be done itd been mighty strange if she didnt bang herself up a little now and thats not what i mean you know thats not what i mean but if youre thinking i did it and that she put up with it youre way off base you sure didnt know amy stanton maybe he said you didnt know her me but you just got through sayin wed gone together for years i he hesitated frowning i dont know it isnt all clear to me and i wont pretend that it is but i dont think you knew her not as well as yeah i said he reached into his inside coat pocket and brought out a square blue envelope he opened it and removed one of those double sheets of stationery i could see it was written on both sides four pages in all and i recognized that small neat handwriting howard looked up from the paper and caught my eye this was in her purse her purse shed written it at home and was planning apparently to give it to you after you were out of central city as a matter of fact he glanced down at the letter she intended to have you stop at a restaurant up the road and have you read it while she was in the restroom now it begins lou darling let me have it i said ill read its his letter said jeff let him have it very well howard shrugged and he tossed me the letter and i knew hed planned on having me read it all along he wanted me to read it while he sat back and watched i looked down at the thick double page holding my eyes on it lou darling now you know why i had you stop here and why ive excused myself from the table it was to allow you to read this the things i couldnt somehow otherwise say to you please please read carefully darling ill give you plenty of time and if i sound confused and rambling please dont be angry with me its only because i love you so much and im a little frightened and worried darling i wish i could tell you how happy youve made me these last few weeks i wish i could be sure that youd been even a tiny fraction as happy just a teens yweensie bit as much sometimes i get the crazy wonderful notion that you have been that you were even as happy as i was and at others i tell myself oh i dont know lou i suppose the trouble is that it all seemed to come about so suddenly wed gone on for years and you seemed to be growing more and more indifferent you seemed to keep drawing away from me and taking pleasure in making me follow im not trying to excuse myself darling i only want to explain to make you understand that im not going to behave that way any more im not going to be sharp and demanding and scolding and i may not be able to change all at once but if youll just love me lou just act like you love me im sure do you understand how i felt just a little do you see why i was that way then and why i wont be anymore everyone knew i was yours almost everyone i wanted it to be that way to have anyone else was unthinkable but i couldnt have had anyone else if id wished to i was yours id always be yours if you dropped me and it seemed lou that you were slipping further and further away still owning me yet not letting yourself belong to me you were leaving me with nothing and knowing that you were doing it knowing i was helpless and apparently enjoying it you avoided me you made me chase you you made me question you and beg you and and then youd act so innocent and puzzled and forgive me darling i dont want to criticize you ever ever again i only wanted you to understand and i suppose only another woman could do that lou i want to ask you something a few things and i want to beg you please please please not to take it the wrong way are you oh dont be darling are you afraid of me do you feel that you have to be nice to me there i wont say anything more but you know what i mean as well as i do at least and you will know i hope and pray i am wrong darling i do so hope but im afraid are you in trouble is something weighing on your mind i dont want to ask you more than that but i do want you to believe that whatever it is even if its what i whatever it is lou im on your side i love you and i know you i know youd never knowingly do anything wrong you just couldnt and i love you so much and let me help you darling whatever it is whatever help you need even if it should involve being separated for a while a long while lets let me help you because ill wait for you however long and it mightnt be long at all it might be just a question of well it will be all right lou because you wouldnt knowingly do anything i know that and everyone else knows it and it will be all right well make it all right you and i together if youll only tell me if youll just let me help you now i asked you not to be afraid of me but i know how youve felt how you used to feel and i know that asking you or telling you might not be enough thats why i had you stop at this place here at a bus stop thats why im giving you so much time to prove to you that you dont need to be afraid i hope that when i come back to the table youll still be there but if you arent darling if you feel that you cant then just leave my bags inside the door i have money with me and i can get a job in some other town and do that lou if you feel that you must ill understand and itll be perfectly all right honestly it will lou and oh darling darling darling i love you so much ive always loved you and i always will whatever happens always darling always and always forever and forever always and forever amy well well what are you going to do what are you going to say what are you going to say when youre drowning in your own dung and they keep booting you back into it when all the screams in hell wouldnt be as loud as you want to scream when youre at the bottom of the pit and the whole worlds at the top when it has but one face a face without eyes or ears and yet it watches and listens what are you going to do and say why pardner thats simple its easy as nailing your balls to a stump and falling off backwards snow again pardner and drift me hard because thats an easy one youre gonna say they cant keep a good man down youre gonna say a winner never quits and a quitter never wins youre gonna smile boy youre gonna show em the ol fightin smile and then youre gonna get out there an hit em hard and fast and low an an fight rah i folded the letter and tossed it back to howard she was sure a talky little girl i said sweet but awful talky seems like if she couldnt say it to you shed write it down for you howard swallowed that thats all you have to say i lit a cigar pretending like i hadnt heard him jeff plummers chair creaked i sure liked miss amy he said all four of my younguns went to school to her an she was just as nice as if theyd had one of these oilmen for a daddy yes sir i said i reckon she really had her heart in her work i puffed on my cigar and jeffs chair creaked again louder than the first time and the hate in howards eyes seemed to lash out against me he gulped like a man choking down puke you fellows getting restless i said i sure appreciate you dropping in at a time like this but i wouldnt want to keep you from anything important you yyou you starting to stutter howard you ought to practice talking with a pebble in your mouth or maybe a piece of shrapnel you dirty sonofabitch you dont call me that i said no said jeff dont call him that dont never say anything about a mans mother to hell with that crap he you he shook his fist at me you killed that little girl she as good as says so i laughed she wrote it down after i killed her huh thats quite a trick you know what i mean she knew you were going to kill her and she was going to marry me anyway she knew youd killed all those other people yeah funny she didnt mention it she did mention it she dont recall seeing anything like that dont see that she said anything much just a lot of womanworry talk you killed joyce lakeland and elmer conway and johnnie pappas and president mckinley he sagged back in his chair breathing hard you killed them ford you killed them why dont you arrest me then what are you waiting on dont worry he nodded grimly dont you worry im not waiting much longer and im not either i said what do you mean i mean you and your courthouse gang are doing spite work youre pouring it on me because conway says to just why i cant figure out you havent got a shred of proof but youve tried to smear me now wait a minute we havent youve tried to you had jeff out here this morning chasing visitors away youd do it but you cant because you havent got a shred of proof and people know me too well you know you cant get a conviction so you try to ruin my reputation and with conway backing you up you may manage it in time youll manage it if you have the time and i guess i cant stop you but im not going to sit back and take it im leaving town howard oh no youre not im warning you here and now ford dont you even attempt to leave whos going to stop me i am on what grounds mur suspicion of murder but who suspects me howard and why the stantons i reckon not mike pappas huhuh chester conway well ive got kind of a funny feeling about conway howard ive got a feeling that hes going to stay in the background hes not going to do or say a thing no matter how bad you need him i see he said i see you see that opening there behind you i said well thats a door howard in case you were wonderin and i cant think of a thing to keep you and mister plummer from walking through it were walking through it said jeff and so are you huhuh i said no i aint i sure aint aimin to do nothing like that mister plummer and thats a fact howard kept his seat his face looked like a blob of reddish dough but he shook his head at jeff and kept his seat howard was really trying hard i its to your own interest as well as ours to get this settled ford im asking you to place yourself to remain available until you mean you want me to cooperate with you i said yes that door i said i wish youd close it real careful im suffering from shock and i might have a relapse howards mouth twisted and opened and snapped shut he sighed and reached for his hat i sure liked bob maples said jeff i sure liked that little miss amy sure enough i said is that a fact i laid my cigar down on an ashtray leaned back on the pillow and closed my eyes a chair creaked and squeaked real loud and i heard howard say now jeff and there was a sound like hed sort of stumbled i opened my eyes again jeff plummer was standing over me he was smiling down at me with his lips and there was a in his hand and the hammer was thumbed back you right sure you aint coming with us he said you dont reckon you could change your mind the way he sounded i knew he hoped i wouldnt change it he was just begging waiting for me to say no and i reckoned i wouldnt say all of even a short word like that before i was past saying anything i got up and began to dress if id known that rothmans lawyer friend billy boy walker was tied up in the east and was having trouble getting away i might have felt different i might have cracked up right off but on the other hand i dont think i would have i had a feeling that i was speeding fast down a oneway trail that i was almost to the place i had to get to i was almost there and moving fast so why hop off and try to run ahead it wouldnt have made a particle of sense and you know i dont do things that dont make sense you know it or you will know it that first day and that night i spent in one of the quiet cells but the next morning they put me on ice down in the cooler where id where johnnie pappas had died they hows that well sure they can do it to you they can do anything theyre big enough to do and youre little enough to take they dont book you no one knows where you are and youve got no one on the outside that can get you out its not legal but i found out long ago that the place where the law is apt to be abused most is right around a courthouse yeah they can do it all right so i was saying i spent the first day and night in one of the quiet cells and most of the time i was trying to kid myself i couldnt face up to the truth yet so i tried to play like there was a way around it you know those kid games youve done something pretty bad or you want something bad and you think well if i can just do such and such i can fix it if i can count down from a thousand backwards by three and a third or recite the gettysburg address in piglatin while im touching my little toes with my big ones everything will be all right id play those games and their kinkind doing real impossible things in my imagination id trot all the way from central city to san angelo without stopping or theyd grease the pipeline across the pecos river and id hop across it on one foot with my eyes blindfolded and an anvil around my neck id really get to sweating and panting sometimes my feetd be all achy and blistered from pounding that san angelo highway and that old anvil would keep swinging and dragging at me trying to pull me off into the pecos and finally id win through just plumb worn out and and id have to do something still harder well then they moved me down into the cooler where johnnie pappas had died and pretty soon i saw why they hadnt put me there right away theyd had a little work to do on it first i dont know just how theyd rigged the stunt only that that unused lightsocket in the ceiling was part of it but i was stretched out on the bunk fixing to shinny up the water tower without using my hands when all at once i heard johnnies voice hello you lovely people im certainly having a fine time and i wish you were here see you soon yes it was johnnie speaking in that sharp smartalecky way he used a lot i jumped up from the bunk and started turning around and looking up and down and sideways and here his voice came again hello you lovely people im certainly having a fine time and i wish you were here see you soon he kept saying the same thing over and over about fifteen seconds between times and hell as soon as i had a couple minutes to think i knew what it was all about it was one of those little fourbit voice recordings like youve just about got time to sneeze on before its used up johnnied sent it to his folks the time he visited the dallas fair hed mentioned it to me when he told me about the trip and id remembered because i liked johnnie and would remember hed mentioned it apologizing for not sending me some word but hed lost all his dough in some kind of wheel game and had to hitchhike back to central city hello you lovely people i wondered what kind of story theyd given the greek because i was pretty sure he wouldnt have let em have it if hed known what it was going to be used for he knew how i felt about johnnie and how johnnied felt about me they kept playing that record over and over from maybe five in the morning until midnight i dont know just what the hours were because theyd taken away my watch it didnt even stop when they brought me food and water twice a day id lie and listen to it or sit and listen and every once in a while when i could remember to do it id jump up and pace around the cell id pretend like it was bothering the hell out of me which of course it didnt at all why would it but i wanted em to think it did so they wouldnt turn it off and i guess i must have pretended pretty good because they played it for three days and part of a fourth until it wore out i reckon after that there wasnt much but silence nothing but those faraway sounds like the factory whistles which werent any real company for a man theyd taken away my cigars and matches of course and i fidgeted around quite a bit the first day thinking i wanted a smoke yeah thinking because i didnt actually want one id been smoking cigars for well around eleven years ever since my eighteenth birthday when dad had said i was getting to be a man so he hoped id act like one and smoke cigars and not go around with a coffinnail in my mouth so id smoked cigars from then on never admitting to myself that i didnt like them but now i could admit it i had to and i did when life attains a crisis mans focus narrows nice lines huh i could talk that way all the time if i wanted to the world becomes a stage of immediate concern swept free of illusion i used to could talk that way all the time no one had pushed me around or even tried to question me since the morning theyd locked me up no one at all and id tried to tell myself that that was a good sign they didnt have any evidence id got their goats so theyd put me on ice just like theyd done with plenty of other guys and pretty soon theyd simmer down and let me go of their own accord or billy boy walkerd show up and theyd have to let me out thats what id told myself and it made sense all my reasoning does but it was topofthecliff sense not the kind you make when youre down near the tagend of the rope they hadnt tried to beat the truth out of me or talk it out of me for a couple of reasons first of all they were pretty sure it wouldnt do any good you cant stamp on a mans corns when hes got his feet cut off second the second reason was they didnt think they had to they had evidence theyd had it right from the beginning why hadnt they sprung it on me well there were a couple of reasons behind that too for one thing they werent sure that it was evidence because they werent sure about me id thrown them off the track with johnnie pappas for another thing they couldnt use it it wasnt in shape to be used but now they were sure of what id done though they probably werent too clear as to why id done it and that evidence would be ready to be used before long and i didnt reckon theyd let go of me until it was ready conway was determined to get me and theyd gone too far to back down i thought back to the day bob maples and i had gone to fort worth and how conway hadnt invited us on the trip but had got busy ordering us around the minute wed landed you see what could be clearer hed tipped his hand on me right there then bob had come back to the hotel and he was all upset about something conway had said to him ordered him to do and he wouldnt tell me what it was he just talked on and on about how long hed known me and what a swell guy i was and hell dont you see dont you get it id let it go by me because i had to i couldnt let myself face the facts but i reckon youve known the truth all along then id brought bob home on the train and hed been babbling drunk and hed gotten sore about some of my kidding so hed snapped back at me giving me a tip on where i stood at the same time hed said what was it its always lightest just before the dark hed been sore and drunk so hed come out with that he was telling me in so many words that i might not be sitting nearly as pretty as i thought i was and he was certainly right about that but i think hed got his words twisted a little he was saying em to be sarcastic but they happen to be the truth at least it seemed so to me it is lightest just before the dark whatever a man is up against it makes him feel better to know that he is up against it thats the way it seemed to me anyhow and i ought to know once id admitted the truth about that piece of evidence it was easy to admit other things i could stop inventing reasons for what id done stop believing in the reasons id invented and see the truth and it sure wasnt hard to see when youre climbing up a cliff or just holding on for dear life you keep your eyes closed you know youll get dizzy and fall if you dont but after you fall down to the bottom you open em again and you can see just where you started from and trace every foot of your trail up that cliff mine had started back with the housekeeper with dad finding out about us all kids pull some pretty sorry stunts particularly if an older person edges em along so it hadnt needed to mean a thing but dad had made it mean something id been made to feel that id done something that couldnt ever be forgiven that would always lie between him and me the only kin i had and there wasnt anything i could do or say that would change things i had a burden of fear and shame put on me that i could never get shed of she was gone and i couldnt strike back at her yes kill her for what id been made to feel shed done to me but that was all right she was the first woman id ever known she was woman to me and all womankind bore her face so i could strike back at any of them any female the ones it would be safest to strike at and it would be the same as striking at her and i did that i started striking out and mike dean took the blame dad tightened the reins on me after that i could hardly be out of his sight an hour without his checking up on me so years passed and i didnt strike out again and i was able to distinguish between women and the woman dad slacked off on the reins a little i seemed to be normal but every now and then id catch myself in that deadpan kidding trying to ease the terrific pressure that was building up inside of me and even without that i knew though i wouldnt recognize the fact that i wasnt all right if i could have got away somewhere where i wouldnt have been constantly reminded of what had happened and id had something i wanted to do something to occupy my mind it might have been different but i couldnt get away and there wasnt anything here i wanted to do so nothing had changed i was still looking for her and any woman whod done what she had would be her id kept pushing amy away from me down through the years not because i didnt love her but because i did i was afraid of what might happen between us i was afraid of what id do what i finally did i could admit now that id never had any real cause to think that amy would make trouble for me she had too much pride shed have hurt herself too much and anyway she loved me id never had any real cause either to be afraid that joyce would make trouble she was too smart to try to from what id seen of her but if she had been sore enough to try if shed been mad enough sos she just didnt give a damn she wouldnt have got anywhere after all she was just a whore and i was old family quality and she wouldnt have opened her mouth more than twice before she was run out of town no i hadnt been afraid of her starting talk i hadnt been afraid that if i kept on with her id lose control of myself id never had any control even before i met her no control only luck because anyone who reminded me of the burden i carried anyone who did what that first her had done would get killed anyone amy joyce any woman who even for a moment became her id kill them id keep trying until i did kill them elmer conway had had to suffer too on her account mike had taken the blame for me and then hed been killed so along with the burden i had a terrible debt to him that i couldnt pay i could never repay him for what hed done for me the only thing i could do was what i did try to settle the score with chester conway that was my main reason for killing elmer but it wasnt the only one the conways were part of the circle the town that ringed me in the smug ones the hypocrites the holierthanthou guys all the stinkers i had to face day in and day out i had to grin and smile and be pleasant to them and maybe there are people like that everywhere but when you cant get away from them when they keep pushing themselves at you and you cant get away never never get away well the bum the few others id struck out at i dont know im not really sure about them they were all people who didnt have to stay here people who took what was handed them because they didnt have enough pride or guts to strike back so maybe that was it maybe i think that the guy who wont fight when he can and should deserves the worst you can toss at him maybe im not sure of all the details all i can do is give you the general picture and not even the experts could do more than that ive read a lot of stuff by a guy name of kraepelin i believe and i cant remember all of it of course or even the gist of all of it but i remember the high points of some the most important stuff and i think it goes something like this difficult to study because so seldom detected the condition usually begins around the period of puberty and is often precipitated by a severe shock the subject suffers from strong feelings of guilt combined with a sense of frustration and persecution which increase as he grows older yet there are rarely if ever any surface signs of disturbance on the contrary his behavior appears to be entirely logical he reasons soundly even shrewdly he is completely aware of what he does and why he does it that was written about a disease or a condition rather called dementia praecox schizophrenia paranoid type acute recurrent advanced incurable it was written you might say about but i reckon you know dont you i was in jail eight days but no one questioned me and they didnt pull any more stunts like that voice recording i kind of looked for them to do the last because they couldnt be positive about that piece of evidence they had about my reaction to it that is they werent certain that it would make me put the finger on myself and even if they had been certain i knew theyd a lot rather i cracked up and confessed of my own accord if i did that they could probably send me to the chair the other way if they used their evidence they couldnt but i reckon they werent set up right at the jail for any more stunts or maybe they couldnt get ahold of the equipment they needed at any rate they didnt pull any more and on the eighth day around eleven oclock at night they transferred me to the insane asylum they put me in a pretty good room bettern any id seen the time id had to take a poor guy there years before and left me alone but i took one look around and i knew i was being watched through those little slots high up on the walls they wouldnt have left me in a room with cigarette tobacco and matches and a drinking glass and water pitcher unless someone was watching me i wondered how far theyd let me go if i started to cut my throat or wrap myself in a sheet and set fire to it but i didnt wonder very long it was late and i was pretty well worn out after sleeping on that bunk in the cooler i smoked a couple of handrolled cigarettes putting the butts out real careful then with the lights still burning there wasnt any switch for me to turn em off i stretched out on the bed and went to sleep about seven in the morning a huskylooking nurse came in with a couple of young guys in white jackets and she took my temperature and pulse while they stood and waited then she left and the two attendants took me down the hall to a shower room and watched while i took a bath they didnt act particularly tough or unpleasant but they didnt say a word more than they needed to i didnt say anything i finished my shower and put my shorttailed nightgown back on we went back to my room and one of em made up my bed while the other went after my breakfast the scrambled eggs tasted pretty flat and it didnt help my appetite any to have them cleaning up the room emptying the enamel nightcan and so on but i ate almost everything and drank all of the weak lukewarm coffee they were through cleaning by the time id finished they left locking me in again i smoked a handrolled cigarette and it tasted good i wondered no i didnt either i didnt need to wonder what it would be like to spend your whole life like this not a tenth as good as this probably because i was something pretty special right now right now i was a hideout id been kidnapped actually and there was always a chance that thered be a hell of a stink raised but if that hadnt been the case if id been committed well id still be something special in a different way id be worse off than anyone in the place conway would see to that even if doc bonyface didnt have a special sort of interest in me id kind of figured that the doc might show up with his hardrubber playthings but i guess he had just enough sense to know that he was out of his class plenty of pretty smart psychiatrists have been fooled by guys like me and you cant really fault em for it theres just not much they can put their hands on know what i mean we might have the disease the condition or we might just be coldblooded and smart as hell or we might be innocent of what were supposed to have done we might be any one of those three things because the symptoms we show would fit any one of the three so bonyface didnt give me any trouble no one did the nurse checked on me night and morning and the two attendants carried on with pretty much the same routine bringing my meals taking me to the shower cleaning up the room the second day and every other day after that they let me shave with a safety razor while they stood by and watched i thought about rothman and billy boy walker just thought wondered without worrying any because hell i didnt have anything to worry about and they were probably doing enough worrying for all three of us but but im getting ahead of myself they conway and the others still werent positive about that piece of evidence they had and like i say they preferred to have me crack up and confess so on the evening of my second night in the asylum there came the stunt i was lying on my side in bed smoking a cigarette when the lights dimmed way down down to almost nothing then there was a click and a flash up above me and amy stanton stood looking at me from the far wall of the room oh sure it was a picture one that had been made into a glass slide i didnt need to do any figuring at all to know that they were using a slide projector to throw her picture against the wall she was coming down the walk of her house smiling but looking kind of fussed like id seen her so many times i could almost hear her saying well you finally got here did you and i knew it was just a picture but it looked so real it seemed so real that i answered her back in my mind kinda looks that way dont it i guess theyd got a whole album of her pictures which wouldnt have been any trouble since the old folks the stantons were awfully innocent and accommodating and not given to asking questions anyway after that first picture which was a pretty recent one there was one taken when she was about fifteen years old and they worked up through the years from that they i saw her the day she graduated from high school she was sixteen that spring wearing one of those white lacy dresses and flatheeled slippers and standing real stiff with her arms held close to her sides i saw her sitting on her front steps laughing in spite of herself it always seemed hard for amy to laugh because that old dog of theirs was trying to lick her on the ear i saw her all dressed up and looking kind of scared the time she started off for teachers college i saw her the day she finished her twoyear course standing very straight with her hand on the back of a chair and trying to look older than she was i saw her and id taken a lot of those pictures myself it seemed just like yesterday i saw her working in the garden in a pair of old jeans walking home from church and kind of frowning up at the little hat shed made for herself coming out of the grocery store with both arms around a big sack sitting in the porch swing with an apple in her hand and a book in her lap i saw her with her dress pulled way up high shed just slid off the fence where id taken a snap of her and she was bent over trying to cover herself and yelling at me dont you dare lou dont you dare now shed sure been mad about me taking that picture but shed saved it i saw her i tried to remember how many pictures there were to figure out how long they would last they were sure in a hell of a hurry to get through with them it looked like to me they were just racing through em it seemed like id just be starting to enjoy a picture remembering when it was taken and how old amy was at the time when theyd flash it off and put on another one it was a pretty sorry way to act the way i saw it you know it was as though she wasnt worth looking at like maybe theyd seen someone that was better to look at and im not prejudiced or anything but you wouldnt find a girl as pretty and wellbuilt as amy stanton in a month of sundays aside from being a slight on amy it was damned stupid to rush through those pictures like they were doing like they seemed to be doing after all the whole object of the show was to make me crack up and how could i do it if they didnt even let me get a good look at her i wasnt going to crack up of course i felt stronger and better inside every time i saw her but they didnt know that and it doesnt excuse them they were lying down on the job they had a doggone ticklish job to do and they were too lazy and stupid to do it right well theyd started showing the pictures about eightthirty and they should have lasted until one or two in the morning but they had to be in a hell of a hurry so it was only around eleven when they came to the last one it was a picture id taken less than three weeks before and they did leave it on long enough well not long enough but they let me get a good look at it she and i had fixed up a little lunch that evening and eaten it over in sam houston park and id taken this picture just as she was stepping back into the car she was looking over her shoulder at me wideeyed smiling but sort of impatient saying cant you hurry a little darling hurry well i reckon so honey ill sure try to when lou how soon will i see you darling well now honey i i i was almost glad right then that the lights came back on i never was real good at lying to amy i got up and paced around the room i went over by the wall where theyd flashed the pictures and i rubbed my eyes with my fists and gave the wall a few pats and tugged my hair a little i put on a pretty good act it seemed to me just good enough to let em think i was bothered but not enough to mean anything at a sanity hearing the nurse and the two attendants didnt have any more to say than usual the next morning it seemed to me though that they acted a little different more watchful sort of so i did a lot of frowning and staring down at the floor and i only ate part of my breakfast i passed up most of my lunch and dinner too which wasnt much of a chore hungry as i was and i did everything else i could to put on just the right kind of act not too strong not too weak but i was too anxious i had to go and ask the nurse a question when she made the night check on me and that spoiled everything will they be showing the pictures tonight i said and i knew doggone well it was the wrong thing to do what pictures i dont know anything about pictures she said the pictures of my girl you know will they show em maam she shook her head a kind of mean glint in her eye youll see youll find out mister well tell em not to do it so fast i said when they do it so fast i dont get to see her very good i hardly get to look at her at all before shes gone she frowned she shook her head staring at me like she hadnt heard me right she edged away from the bed a little you she swallowed you want to see those pictures well uh i you do want to see them she said slowly you want to see the pictures of the girl you you sure i want to see em i began to get sore why shouldnt i want to see them whats wrong with that why the hell wouldnt i want to see them the attendants started to move toward me i lowered my voice im sorry i said i dont want to cause any trouble if you folks are too busy maybe you could move the projector in here i know how to run one and id take good care of it that was a pretty bad night for me there werent any pictures and i was so hungry i couldnt go to sleep for hours i was sure glad when morning came so that was the end of their stunt and they didnt try any others i reckon they figured it was a waste of time they just kept me from then on just held me without me saying any more than i had to and them doing the same that went on for six days and i was beginning to get puzzled because that evidence of theirs should have been about ready to use by now if it was ever going to be ready the seventh day rolled around and i was really getting baffled and then right after lunch billy boy walker showed up where is he he yelled what have you done with the poor man have you torn out his tongue have you roasted his poor broken body over slow fires where is he i say he was coming down the corridor yelling at the top of his lungs and i could hear several people scurrying along with him trying to shush him up but no one had ever had much luck at that and they didnt either id never seen him in my life just heard him a couple of times on the radio but i knew it was him i reckon id have known hed come even if i hadnt heard him you didnt have to see or hear billy boy walker to know he was around you could just kind of sense it they stopped in front of my door and billy boy started beating on it like they didnt have a key and he was going to have to knock it down mr ford my poor man he yelled and man ill bet they could hear him all the way into central city can you hear me have they punctured your eardrums are you too weak to cry out be brave my poor fellow he kept it up beating on the door and yelling and it sounds like it mustve been funny but somehow it wasnt even to me knowing that they hadnt done a thing to me really it didnt sound funny i could almost believe that they had put me through the works they managed to get the door unlocked and he came bounding in and he looked as funny he should have looked as funny as he should have sounded but i didnt feel the slightest call to laugh he was short and fat and potbellied and a couple of buttons were off his shirt and his belly button was showing he was wearing a baggy old black suit and red suspenders and he had a big floppy black hat sitting kind of crooked on his head everything about him was sort of offsize and outofshape as the saying is but i couldnt see a thing to laugh about neither apparently could the nurse and the two attendants and old doc bonyface billy boy flung his arms around me and called me a poor man and patted me on the head he had to reach up to do it but he didnt seem to reach and it didnt seem funny he turned around all at once and grabbed the nurse by the arm is this the woman mr ford did she beat you with chains fie fah abomination and he scrubbed his hand against his pants glaring at her the attendants were helping me into my clothes and they werent losing any time about it but youd never have known it to hear billy boy fiends he yelled will your sadistic appetites never be satiated must you continue to stare and slaver over your handiwork will you not clothe this poor tortured flesh this broken creature that was once a man built in gods own image the nurse was spluttering and sputtering her face a halfdozen different colors the docs bones were leaping like jumpingjacks billy boy walker snatched up the nightcan and shoved it under his nose you fed him from this eh i thought so bread and water served in a slop jar shame shame fie you did do it answer me sirrah you didnt do it fie fah paah perjurer suborner answer yes or no the doc shook his head and then nodded he shook and nodded it at the same time billy boy dropped the can to the floor and took me by the arm never mind your gold watch mr ford never mind the money and jewelry they have stolen you have your clothes trust me to recover the rest and more much much more mr ford he pushed me out the door ahead of him and then he turned around real slow and pointed around the room you he said softly pointing them out one by one you and you and you are through this is the end for you the end he looked them all in the eye and no one said a word and none of them moved he took me by the arm again and we went down the corridor and each of the three gates were open for us before we got to em he squeezed in behind the wheel of the car hed rented in central city he started it up with a roar and a jerk and we went speeding out through the main gate to the highway where two signs facing in opposite directions read warning warning hitchhikers may be escaped lunatics he lifted himself in the seat reached into his hip pocket and pulled out a plug of tobacco he offered it to me and i shook my head and he took a big chew dirty habit he said in just a quiet conversational voice got it young though and i reckon ill keep it he spat out the window wiped his chin with his hand and wiped his hand on his pants i found the makings id had at the asylum and started rolling a cigarette about joe rothman i said i didnt say anything about him mr walker why i didnt think you had mr ford it never occurred to me that you would he said and whether he meant it or not he sure sounded like it you know somethin mr ford there wasnt a bit of sense in what i did back there no i said no sir not a bit ive been snorting and pawing up the earth around here for four days couldnt have fought harder getting christ off the cross and i reckon it was just habit like this chewing tobacco i knew it but i kept right on chawing i didnt get you free mr ford i didnt have a thing to do with it they let me have a writ they let me know where you were thats why youre here mr ford instead of back there i know i said i figured it would be that way you understand theyre not letting you go theyve gone too far to start backing water i understand i said theyve got something something you cant beat theyve got it maybe youd better tell me about it i hesitated thinking and finally i shook my head i dont think so mr walker theres nothing you can do or i can do youd be wasting your time and you might get joe and yourself in a fix well now pshaw he spat out the window again i reckon i might be a better judge of some things than you are mr ford you uh arent maybe a little distrustful are you i think you know im not i said i just dont want anyone else to get hurt i see put it hypothetically then just say that there are a certain set of circumstances which would have you licked if they concerned you just make me up a situation that doesnt have anything to do with yours so i told him what they had and how they planned to use it hypothetically and i stumbled around a lot because describing my situation the evidence they had in a hypothetical way was mighty hard to do he got it though without me having to repeat a word thats the whole thing he said they havent got they cant get well say anything in the way of actual testimony im pretty sure they cant i said i may be wrong but im almost positive they couldnt get anything out of this evidence well then as long as youre i know i nodded theyre not taking me by surprise like they figured on i i mean this fellow im talking about go right ahead mr ford just keep on using the first person its easier to talk that way well i wouldnt cut loose in front of em i dont think i would but id do it sooner or later with someone its best to have it happen now and get it over with he turned his head a moment to glance at me the big black hat flopping in the wind you said you didnt want anyone else to get hurt you meant it i meant it you cant hurt people that are already dead good enough he said and whether he knew what i really meant and was satisfied with it i dont know his ideas of right and wrong didnt jibe too close with the books i sure hate to give up though he frowned just never got in the habit of giving up i reckon you cant call it giving up i said do you see that car way back behind us and the one up in front the one that turned in ahead of us a while back those are county cars mr walker youre not giving up anything its been lost for a long time he glanced up into the rearview mirror then squinted ahead through the windshield he spat and rubbed his hand against his pants wiped it slowly against the soiled black cloth still got quite a little ride ahead of us mr ford about thirty miles isnt it about that maybe a little more i wonder if youd like to tell me about it you dont need to you understand but it might be helpful i might be able to help someone else do you think i could that im able to tell you why not he said i had a client years ago mr ford a very able doctor one of the most pleasant men youd want to meet and he had more money than he knew what to do with but hed performed about fifty abortions before they moved in on him and so far as the authorities could find out every one of the abortion patients had died hed deliberately seen that they did die of peritonitis about a month after the operation and he told me why and he couldve told anyone else why when he finally faced up to the facts hed done it he had a younger brother who was unfinished a prematurely born monstrosity as the result of an attempted latepregnancy abortion he saw that terrible halfchild die in agony for years he never recovered from the experience and neither did the women he aborted insane well the only legal definition we have for insanity is the condition which necessitates the confinement of a person so since he hadnt been confined when he killed those women i reckon he was sane he made pretty good sense to me anyhow he shifted the cud in his jaw chewed a moment and went on i never had any legal schooling mr ford picked up my law by reading in an attorneys office all i ever had in the way of higher education was a couple years in agricultural college and that was pretty much a plain waste of time crop rotation well howre you going to do it when the banks only make crop loans on cotton soil conservation howre you going to do terracing and draining and contour plowing when youre cropping on shares purebred stock sure maybe you can trade your razorbacks for poland chinas i just learned two things there at that college mr ford that was ever of any use to me one was that i couldnt do any worse than the people that were in the saddle so maybe id better try pulling em down and riding myself the other was a definition i got out of the agronomy books and i reckon it was even more important than the first it did more to revise my thinking if id really done any thinking up until that time before that id seen everything in black and white good and bad but after i was set straight i saw that the name you put to a thing depended on where you stood and where it stood and and heres the definition right out of the agronomy books a weed is a plant out of place let me repeat that a weed is a plant out of place i find a hollyhock in my cornfield and its a weed i find it in my yard and its a flower youre in my yard mr ford so i told him how it had been while he nodded and spat and drove a funny potbellied shrimp of a guy who really had just one thing understanding but so much of it that you never missed anything else he understood me bettern i understood myself yes yes hed say you had to like people you had to keep telling yourself you liked them you needed to offset the deep subconscious feelings of guilt or hed say hed interrupt and of course you knew youd never leave central city overprotection had made you terrified of the outside world more important it was part of the burden you had to carry to stay here and suffer he sure understood i reckon billy boy walkers been cussed more in high places than any man in the country but i never met a man i liked more i guess the way you felt about him depended on where you stood he stopped the car in front of my house and id told him all i had to tell but he sat there for a few minutes spitting and sort of studying would you care to have me come in for a while mr ford i dont think itd be smart i said i got an idea its not going to be very long now he pulled an old turnip of a watch from his pocket and glanced at it got a couple of hours until train time but well maybe youre right im sorry mr ford id hoped if i couldnt do any better to be taking you away from here with me i couldnt have gone no matter how things were its like you say im tied here ill never be free as long as i live youve got no time at all but it seems like youve got forever youve got nothing to do but it seems like youve got everything you make coffee and smoke a few cigarettes and the hands of the clock have gone crazy on you they havent moved hardly theyve hardly budged out of the place you last saw them but theyve measured off a half twothirds of your life youve got forever but thats no time at all youve got forever and somehow you cant do much with it youve got forever and its a mile wide and an inch deep and full of alligators you go into the office and take a book or two from the shelves you read a few lines like your life depended on reading em right but you know your life doesnt depend on anything that makes sense and you wonder where in the hell you got the idea it did and you begin to get sore you go into the laboratory and start pawing along the rows of bottles and boxes knocking them on the floor kicking them stamping them you find the bottle of one hundred percent pure nitric acid and you jerk out the rubber cork you take it into the office and swing it along the rows of books and the leather bindings begin to smoke and curl and wither and it isnt good enough you go back into the laboratory you come out with a gallon bottle of alcohol and the box of tall candles always kept there for emergencies for emergencies you go upstairs and then on up the little flight of stairs that leads to the attic you come down from the attic and go through each of the bedrooms you come back downstairs and go down into the basement and when you return to the kitchen you are emptyhanded all the candles are gone all the alcohol you shake the coffee pot and set it back on the stove burner you roll another cigarette you take a carving knife from a drawer and slide it up the sleeve of your pinkishtan shirt with the black bow tie you sit down at the table with your coffee and cigarette and you ease your elbow up and down seeing how far you can lower your arm without dropping the knife letting it slide down from your sleeve a time or two you think well how can you how can you hurt someone thats already dead you wonder if youve done things right sos therell be nothing left of something that shouldnt ever have been and you know everything has been done right you know because you planned this moment before eternity way back yonder someplace you look up at the ceiling listening up through the ceiling and into the sky beyond and there isnt the least bit of doubt in your mind thatll be the plane all right coming in from the east from fort worth itll be the plane shes on you look up at the ceiling grinning and you nod and say long time no see how you been doin anyway huh baby how are you joyce just for the hell of it i took a peek out the back door and then i went part way into the living room and stooped down so i could look out the window it was like id thought of course they had the house covered from every angle men with winchesters deputies most of em with a few of the safety inspectors on conways payroll it would have been fun to take a real good look to step to the door and holler howdy to em but it would have been fun for them too and i figured they were having far too much as it was anyway some of those inspectors were apt to be a mite trigger happy anxious to show their boss they were on their toes and i had a little job to do yet i had to get everything wrapped up to take with me i took one last walk through the house and i saw that everything the alcohol and the candles and everything was going fine i came back downstairs closing all the doors behind me all the doors behind me and sat back down at the kitchen table the coffee pot was empty there was just one cigarette paper left and just enough tobacco to fill it and yeah yeah i was down to my last match things were sure working out fine i puffed on the cigarette watching the redgray ashes move down toward my fingers i watched not needing to knowing theyd get just so far and no further i heard a car pull into the driveway i heard a couple of its doors slam i heard them crossing the yard and coming up the steps and across the porch i heard the front door open and they came in and the ashes had burned out the cigarette had gone dead and i laid it in my saucer and looked up i looked out the kitchen window first at the two guys standing outside then i looked at them conway and hendricks hank butterby and jeff plummer two or three fellows i didnt know they fell back watching me letting her move out ahead of them i looked at her joyce lakeland her neck was in a cast that came clear up to her chin like a collar and she walked stiffbacked and jerky her face was a white mask of gauze and tape and nothing much showed of it but her eyes and her lips and she was trying to say something her lips were moving but she didnt really have a voice she could hardly get out a whisper lou i didnt sure i said i didnt figure you had baby she kept coming toward me and i stood up my right arm raised like i was brushing at my hair i could feel my face twisting my lips pulling back from my teeth i knew what i must look like but she didnt seem to mind she wasnt scared what did she have to be scared of this lou not like this sure you cant i said dont hardly see how you could not anyway without two hearts that beat as one i said two ha ha ha two ha ha ha ha ha ha ha two jjesus chri ha ha ha ha ha ha ha two jesus and i sprang at her i made for her just like theyd thought i would almost and it was like id signaled the way the smoke suddenly poured up through the floor and the room exploded with shots and yells and i seemed to explode with it yelling and laughing and and because they hadnt got the point shed got that between the ribs and the blade along with it and they all lived happily ever after i guess and i guess thats all yeah i reckon thats all unless our kind gets another chance in the next place our kind us people all of us that started the game with a crooked cue that wanted so much and got so little that meant so good and did so bad all us folks me and joyce lakeland and johnnie pappas and bob maples and big ol elmer conway and little ol amy stanton all
