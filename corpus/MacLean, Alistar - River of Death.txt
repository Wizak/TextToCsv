river of death alistair maclean river of death alistair maclean prologue darkness was falling over the ancient grecian monastery and the first of the evening stars were beginning to twinkle in the cloudless aegean sky the sea was calm the air was still and did indeed as is so often claimed for it smell of wine and roses a yellow moon almost full had just cleared the horizon and bathed in its soft and benign light the softly rolling landscape and lent a magical quality to the otherwise rather harsh and forbidding outlines of the dark and brooding monastery which any evidence to the contrary slumbered on peacefully as it had done for countless centuries gone by at that moment unfortunately conditions inside the monastery could hardly be said to reflect the dreamlike outer world magic had taken wings noone slumbered peace was markedly absent darkness had given way to a score of smoking oil torches and there was little enough around in the way of wine and roses eight uniformed members of the nazi ss were carrying oaken chests across the flagged hallway the brassbound boxes were small but so heavy that it required four men to carry one of them a sergeant supervised their operations watching them were four men two of those were highranking ss officers of those one wolfgang von manteuffel a tall thin man with cold blue eyes was a majorgeneral no more than thirtyfive years old the second heinrich spaatz a thickset swarthy man who had apparently elected to choose a scowl as his permanent expression in life was a colonel of about the same age the other two watchers were monks in cowled brown habits old proud men but now with mingled fear and pride in their eyes eyes that never left the oaken chests von manteuffel touched the sergeant with the tip of his goldhandled malacca cane which could hardly have been regulation issue to ss officers a spotcheck i think sergeant the sergeant gave orders to the nearest group who not without difficulty lowered their chest to the floor the sergeant knelt knocked away the retaining pins in the iron hasps and lifted the hinged lid the screeching of the ancient metal being testimony enough to the fact that many years must have passed since this had last been done even in the wavering light of the malodorous oil torches the revealed contents glittered as if they were alive the chest contained literally thousands of golden coins so fresh and gleaming they could have been minted that same day von manteuffel contemplatively stirred the coins with the tip of his cane looked with satisfaction at the resulting iridescence then turned to spaatz genuine you would say heinrich i am shocked spaatz said he didnt look it shocked beyond words the holy fathers traffic in dross von manteuffel shook his head sadly you cant trust anyone these days with what appeared to be as much a physical effort as an exercise of will one of the monks averted his fascinated gaze from the glittering chest and looked at von manteuffel he was a very thin man very stooped very oldhe must have been nearer ninety than eighty his face was carefully expressionless but there wasnt much he could do about his stricken eyes these treasures are gods he said and we have guarded them for generations now we have broken our trust you cant take all the credit for that von manteuffel said we helped dont worry well look after them for you yes indeed spaatz said be of good cheer father we shall prove worthy of our stewardship they stood in silence until the last of the treasure chests was removed then von manteuffel gestured towards a heavy oaken door join your comrades im sure you will be released as soon as our planes are heard to leave the two old men clearly as broken in spirit as they were in body did as ordered von manteuffel closing the door behind them and sliding home the two heavy bolts the troopers entered carrying a fiftylitre drum of petrol which they laid on its side close to and facing the oaken door it was clear that they had been well briefed in advance one trooper unscrewed the cap of the petrol drum while the other laid a trail of gunpowder to the outside doorway more than half of the petrol gushed out on to the flags some of it seeping under the oaken door the trooper seemed content that the rest of the petrol should remain inside the drum following the departing troopers von manteuffel and spaatz walked away and halted at the outside doorway von manteuffel struck a match and dropped it on the gunpowder fuse for all the expression that his face registered he could have been sitting in a church the airfield was only two minutes walk away and by the time the ss officers arrived there the troopers had finished loading and securing the chests aboard the two junkers s engines already running parked side by side on the tarmac at a word from von manteuffel the troopers ran forward and scrambled aboard the farther plane von manteuffel and spaatz doubtless to emphasize the superiority of the officer class sauntered leisurely to the nearer one three minutes later both planes were airborne in robbery looting and plundering as in all else teutonic efficiency shonethrough at the rear of the lead plane beyond rows of boxes secured to painstakingly prepared racks on the floor von manteuffel and spaatz sat with glasses in their hands they appeared calm and unworried and had about them the air of men secure in the knowledge that behind them ky a job well done spaatz glanced casually out of a window he had no trouble at all in locating what he knew he was bound to locate a thousand maybe fifteen hundred feet below the gently banking wing a large building burnt ferociously illuminating the landscape shore and sea for almost half a mile around spaatz touched von manteuffel on the arm and pointed von manteuffel glanced through the window and almost immediately looked indifferently away war is hell he said he sipped his cognac looted of course from france and touched the nearest chest with his cane nothing but the best for our fat friend what value would you put on our latest contribution to his coffers im no expert wolfgang spaatz considered a hundred million deutschmarks a conservative estimate my dear heinrich very conservative and to think he already has a thousand million overseas ive heard it was more in any event we will not dispute the fact that the fieldmarshal is a man of gargantuan appetites you only have to look at him do you think he will some day look at this von manteuffel smiled and took another sip of his cognac how long will it take to fix things wolfgang how long will the third reich last weeks not if our beloved fuehrer remains as commanderinchief spaatz looked gloomy and i alas am about to join him in berlin where i shall remain to the bitter end the very end heinrich spaatz grimaced a hasty amendment almost the bitter end and i shall be in wilhelmshaven naturally a code word von manteuffel pondered briefly then said we fight to the death spaatz sipped his cognac and smiled sadly cynicism wolfgang never did become you at the best of times the docks at wilhelmshaven would have no difficulty in turning away the tourist trade and that present moment was not the best of times it was cold and raining and very dark the darkness was quite understandable for the port was bracing itself for the by now inevitable attack by the rafs lancasters on the north sea submarine base or what by this time was left of it there was one small area of illumination and subdued illumination at that for it came from lowpowered lamps in hooded shades faint though this area of light was it still contrasted sufficiently with the total blackness around to offer marauding bombers a pinpoint identification marker for the bombardiers crouched in the noses of the planes of the surely approaching squadrons noone in wilhelmshaven was feeling terribly happy about those lights but then noone was anxious to question the orders of the ss general responsible for their being switched on especially when that general was carrying with him the personal seal of fieldmarshal goering general von manteuffel stood on the bridge of one of the latest of the german navys longest range uboats beside him stood a very apprehensive uboat captain who clearly didnt relish the prospect of being caught moored alongside a quay when the raf appeared as he was certain they would he had about him the air of a man who would have loved nothing better than to pace up and down in an agony of frustration only there isnt much room for pacing on the conningtower of a submarine he cleared his throat in the loud and unmistakable fashion of one who is not about to speak lightly general von manteuffel i must insist that we leave now immediately we are in mortal danger my dear captain reinhardt i dont fancy mortal danger any more than you do von manteuffel didnt give the impression of caring about any danger mortal or otherwise but the reichsmarshal has a very short way of dealing with subordinates who disobey his orders ill take a chance on that captain reinhardt didnt just sound desperate he was desperate im sure admiral doenitz i wasnt thinking about you and admiral doenitz i was thinking about the reichsmarshal and myself those lancasters carry tenton bombs captain reinhardt said unhappily ten tons it took only two to finish off the tirpitz the tirpitz the most powerful battleship in the world can you imagine i can imagine all too well i can also imagine the wrath of the reichsmarshal the second truck god knows why has been delayed we stay he turned and looked along the quay where groups of men were hurriedly unloading boxes from a military truck and staggering with them across the quay and up the gangway to an opened hatchway forard of the bridge small boxes but inordinately heavy they were unmistakably the oaken chests that had been looted from the greek monastery noone had to exhort those men to greater effort they too knew all about the lancasters and were as conscious as any of the imminent danger the threat to their lives a bell rang on the bridge captain reinhardt lifted a phone listened then turned to von manteuffel a top priority call from berlin general you can take it from here or privately below here will do von manteuffel said he took the phone from reinhardt ah colonel spaatz we fight to the death spaatz said the russians are at the gates of berlin my god so soon von manteuffel appeared to be genuinely upset at the news as indeed in the circumstances he had every right to be my blessings on you colonel spaatz i know you will do your duty by the fatherland as will every true german spaatzs tone as clearly overheard by captain reinhardt was a splendid amalgam of resolution and resignation we fall where we stand the last plane out leaves in five minutes my hopes and prayers are with you my dear heinrich heil hitler von manteuffel handed back the phone looked out towards the quay stiffened then turned urgently towards the captain look there the second truck has just arrived every man you can spare for the job every man i can spare for the job is already on the job captain reinhardt seemed oddly resigned they all want to live just as much as you and i do high above the north sea the air thundered and reverberated to the throbbing roar of scores of aero engines on the lancaster flight deck of the point plane ojf the squadrons the captain turned to his navigator our eta over target area twentytwo minutes the navigator said heaven help those poor sods in wilhelmshaven tonight never mind about the poor sods in wilhelmshaven the captain said spare a thought for us poor sods up here we must be on their screens by now at that precise instant another aircraft a junkers was approaching wilhelmshaven from the east there were only two people aboard which seemed a poor turnout for what was supposed to be the last plane out of berlin colonel spaatz seated beside the pilot looked uncommonly nervous and unhappy a state of mind that was not induced by the fact that their junkers was being almost continuously bracketed by exploding antiaircraft shellspractically the entire length of their flight lay over what was now alliedoccupied territory colonel spaatz had other things on his mind he glanced anxiously at his watch and turned impatiently to the pilot faster man faster impossible colonel both troopers and seamen were working in a frenzy of activity to transfer the remaining treasure chests from the second military truck to the submarine suddenly the air raid warning sirens began their ululating banshee wailing as if by command and in spite of the fact that they had known this was inevitable the workers stopped and looked up fearfully into the night sky then once more again as if by command they resumed their frantic efforts it would have appeared impossible that they could have improved upon their previous workrate but this they unquestionably did it is one thing to be almost certain that the enemy may appear at any time it is quite another to have the last lingering vestiges of hope vanish and know that the lancasters are upon you five minutes later the first bomb fell fifteen minutes later the wilhelmshaven naval base appeared to be on fire clearly this was no runofthemill raid by this time von manteuffel could have ordered the most powerful arclamps searchlights if necessary to be switched on and it wouldnt have made the slightest difference the entire dock area was an inferno of dense and evilsmelling smoke shot through with great columns of flame through which shadowy danteesque figures moved as in some nameless nightmare seemingly as oblivious of their surroundings as they were of the screaming aero engines the earnumbing explosion of bombs the sharp whiplike cracks of heavy antiaircraft fire the ceaseless stuttering of machineguns although what the machineguns hoped to achieve was difficult to imagine through all this the ss men and the seamen reduced now despite all their will to the contrary to almost zombie slow motion by the increasingly heavy burden of the chests continued their by now fatalistic loading of the submarine on the conningtower of the submarine both von manteuffel and captain reinhardt were coughing harshly as the dense and evilsmelling smoke from the burning oil tanks enveloped them tears streamed down the cheeks of both men captain reinhardt said gods sake that last one was a tentonner and straight on top of the uboat pens concrete ten feet thick twenty what does it matter there cant be a man left alive there now the concussion would have killed them all in heavens name general lets go weve had the devils own luck till now we can come back when its all over look my dear captain the air raid is at its height now try moving out of the harbour now a slow business as you know and you have as good a chance of being blown out of the water as you have alongside the quay here maybe so herr general maybe so but at least wed be doing something reinhardt paused then went on if i may say so without offence sir surely you must know that a captain is in command of his own vessel even as a soldier i know that captain i also know that youre not in command until you have cast off and are under way we complete loading i could be courtmartialled for saying this but you are inhuman general the devil rides your back von manteuffel nodded he does he does at the wilhelmshaven airfield a dimly seen plane later identifiable as a junkers made so violently bumpy a touchdown that its undercarriage could well have collapsed under the impact the bumpiness was understandable the drifting smoke being so intense that the pilot could make only a blind guess as to his height above the runway under normal conditions he would never have dreamed of attempting so hazardous a landing but the conditions were far from normal colonel spaatz was a man of a highly persuasive cast of mind even before the plane had rolled to rest he had the door open peering anxiously for his waiting transport when finally he saw it an open mercedes staff carhe was aboard it within twenty seconds urging the driver to make all possible haste the smoke surrounding the submarine was if anything even denser and more acrid than it had been minutes before although a sudden gusting wind no doubt the result of the firestorm gave promise of an early amelioration of the conditions but choking and halfblinding though the smoke still was it didnt prevent von manteuffel from seeing what despite his coolly relaxed calm he had so desperately wanted to see thats it then captain reinhardt thats it the last chest aboard and now your men aboard captain and let the devil ride on your back captain reinhardt was hardly in the frame of mind to require any second bidding shouting hoarsely to make himself heard above the still thunderous din he ordered his men aboard ropes to be cast off and engines slow ahead the last of his men were still frantically climbing up the sliding gangway as the submarine inched away from the quayside it hadnt moved more than a few feet when the sound of a motor car screeching and skidding to a halt made von manteuffel turn sharply and look at the quay spaatz had leapt from the mercedes while it was still moving he stumbled recovered himself and stared at the still very slowly moving submarine his face contorted in desperate anxiety wolfgang spaatzs voice wasnt a shout it was a scream wolfgang gods sake wait then the anxiety on his face yielded abruptly to an expression of utter incredulity von manteuffel had a pistol lined up on him for some seconds spaatz remained quite still shocked into a frozen and uncomprehending immobility then comprehension came with the crack of von manteudfels pistol and he hurled himself to the ground as a bullet struck only a foot away spaatz dragged his luger from its holster and emptied it after the slowly moving submarine which apart from giving vent to his feelings was an otherwise futile gesture as the conningtower was apparently empty von manteuffel and captain reinhardt having obviously and prudently ducked beneath the shelter of the steel walls off which spaatzs bullets ricocheted harmlessly and then abruptly the submarine was lost in the swirling banks of smoke spaatz pushed himself to his hands and knees and then stood upright and stared in bitter fury in the direction of the vanished submarine may your soul rot in hell majorgeneral von manteuffel spaatz said softly the nazi partys funds the ss funds part of hitlers and goerings private fortunes and now the treasures from greece my dear and trusted friend he smiled almost reminiscently but its a small world wolfie my friend a small world and ill find you besides the third reich is gone a man must have something to live for unhurriedly he reloaded his luger brushed the mud and moisture from his clothes and walked steadily towards the mercedes staff car the pilot was in his seat poring over a chart when spaatz clambered aboard the junkers and took his seat beside him the pilot looked at him in mild astonishment spaatz said your tanks full ii didnt expect you colonel i was about to leave for berlin madrid madrid this time the astonishment was more than mild but my orders here are your new orders spaatz said he produced his luger chapter one the cabin of the thirtyseater aircraft was battered scruffy unclean and more than a little noisome which pretty accurately reflected the general appearance of the passengers who would never have made it to the ranks of the international jetset two of them could have been classified as exceptions or at least as being different from the others although neither of them would have made the jetset division either lacking as they did the pseudoaristocratic veneer of your true wealthy and idle layabout one who called himself edward hillerin this remote area of southern brazil it was considered poor form to go by your own given namewas around thirtyfive thickset fairhaired hardfaced obviously european or american and dressed in tan bushdrills he seemed to spend most of his time in moodily examining the scenery which in truth was hardly worth the examining inasmuch as it duplicated tens of thousands of square miles in that virtually unknown part of the world all that was to be seen was an amazonian tributary meandering its way through the endless green of the rain forest of the planalto de mato grosso the second exception again because he seemed not unacquainted with the basic principles of hygieneclaimed to be called serrano was dressed in a reasonably offwhite suit was about the same age as hiller slender black haired black moustached swarthy and could have been mexican he wasnt examining the scenery he was examining hiller and closely at that we are about to land at romono the loudspeaker was scratchy tinny and the words almost indistinguishable please fasten seatbelts the plane banked lost altitude rapidly and made its approach directly above and along the line of the river several hundred feet below the flightpath a small open outboard motorboat was making its slow way upstream this crafton closer inspection a very dilapidated craft indeedhad three occupants the largest of the three one john hamilton was tall broadshouldered powerfully built and about forty years of age he had keen brown eyes but that was about the only identifiable feature of his face as he was uncommonly dirty dishevelled and unshaven giving the impression that he had recently endured some harrowing ordeal an impression heightened by the fact that his filthy clothes were torn and his face neck and shoulders were liberally bloodstained comparatively his two companions were presentable they were lean wiry and at least ten years yoьnger than hamilton clearly of latin stock their olivetinged faces were lively humorous and intelligent and they looked so much alike that they could have been identical twins which they were for reasons best known to themselves they liked to be known as ramon and navarro they considered hamiltonwhose given name was oddly enough hamiltonwith critical and speculative eyes ramon said you look bad navarro nodded his agreement anyone can see hes been through a lot but do you think he looks bad enough perhaps not ramon said judicially a soupcon perhaps a little touch here a little touch there he leaned forward and proceeded to widen some of the already existing rents in hamiltons clothing navarro stooped touched some small animal lying on the floorboards brought up a bloodied hand and added a few more artistically decorative crimson touches to hamiltons face neck and chest then leaned back to examine his handiwork critically he appeared more than satisfied with the result of his creative handiwork my god he shook his head in sorrowful admiration you really have had it rough mr hamilton the faded peeling sign on the airport building hardly more than a shackread welcome to romono international airport which was in its own way a tribute to the blind optimism of the person who had authorised it or the courage of the man who had painted it as no international plane had ever landed or ever would land there not only because noone in his right senses would ever voluntarily come from abroad to visit romono in the first place but primarily because the single grass runway was so short that no aircraft designed later than the fortyyearold dc could possibly hope to land there the aircraft that had been making the downriver approach landed and managed not without some difficulty to stop just short of the ramshackle terminal the passengers disembarked and made for the waiting airport bus that was to take them into town serrano kept a prudent ten passengers behind hiller but was less fortunate when they boarded the bus he found himself four seats ahead of hiller and therefore was in no position to observe him any more hiller was now observing serrano very thoughtfully hamiltons boat was now closing in on the river bank hamilton said however humble theres no place like home using the word humble hamilton was guilty of a grave understatement romono was quite simply a jungle slum and an outstandingly malodorous example of the genre on the left bank of the aptly named rio da morte it stood partly on a filledin miasmic swamp partly in a clearing that had been painfully hacked out from a forest and jungle that pressed in menacingly on every side anxious to reclaim its own the town looked as if it might contain perhaps three thousand inhabitants probably there were double that number as three or four persons to a room represented the accommodation norm of romono a typically sleazy endofthelineonly there was no linefrontier town it was squalid decaying and singularly unprepossessing a maze of narrow haphazardly crisscrossing alleys by no stretch of the imagination could they have been called streets with the buildings ranging from dilapidated wooden shacks through wineshops gambling dens and bordellos to a large and largely falsefronted hotel rejoicing according to a garish blue neon sign in the name of the otel de aris some misfortune having clearly overtaken the missing capitals h and p the waterfront was splendidly in keeping with the town it was difficult to say where the river bank began for almost all of it was lined with houseboatsthere had to be some name for those floating monstrositiesrelying for their construction almost entirely on tar paper between the houseboats were piles of driftwood oil cans bottles garbage sewage and great swarms of flies the stench was overwhelming hygiene had it ever come to romono had gratefully abandoned it a long time ago the three men reached the bank disembarked and tied up the boat hamilton said when youre ready take off for brasilia ill join you in the imperial navarro said draw your marble bath my lord lay out your best tuxedo something like that three suites the best after all were not paying for it who is mr smith he doesnt know it yet of course but hell pay ramon said curiously you know this mr smith met him i mean no then might it not be wise to wait for the invitation first no reason to wait invitations guaranteed our friend must be nearly out of his mind by now youre being downright cruel to that poor mr hiller navarro said reproachfully he must have gone out of his mind during the three days we stayed with your muscia indian friends not him hes sure he knows he knows when you get to the imperial keep close to a phone and away from your usual dives ramon looked hurt there are no dives in our fair capital mr hamilton youll soon put that right hamilton left them and made his way in the gathering dusk through winding illlit alleyways until he had passed clear through the town and emerged on its western perimeter here on the outskirts of the town and on the very edge of the forest and jungle stood what had once passed for a log cabin but was now no more than a hut and even at that one would have thought a hut scarcely fit for animal far less human habitation the grass and weedcovered walls leaned in at crazy angles the door was badly warped and the single window had hardly an unbroken pane of glass left in it hamilton not without some difficulty managed to wrench open the creaking door and passed inside he located and lit a guttering oil lamp which gave off light and smoke in about equal proportions from what little could be seen from the fitful yellow illumination the interior of the hut was a faithful complement of the exterior the hut was very sparsely furnished with the bare essentials for existencea dilapidated bed a couple of bentwood chairs in no better condition than the bed a warped deal table with two drawers some shelving and a cooker with some traces of the original black enamel showing under the almost total covering of brown rust on the face of it hamilton didnt care too much for the sybaritic life he sat wearily on the bed which predictably sagged and creaked in an alarmingly disconcerting fashion he reached under the bed came up with a bottle of some undetermined liquid drank deeply from the neck and set the bottle down somewhat unsteadily on the table hamilton was not unobserved a figure had appeared just outside the window and was peering inside from a prudent distance a probably unnecessary precaution it is more difficult to see from a lighted area to a darkened one than the other way round and the windows were so filthy that it was difficult to see through them anyway the watchers face was indistinct but the identity of the man not hard to guess serrano was probably the only man in romono who wore a suit far less an offwhite one serrano was smiling a smile composed of an odd mixture of amusement satisfaction and contempt hamilton extracted two leather pouches from the torn remains of his buttoned pockets and poured the contents of one of them into the palm of his hand staring in rapt admiration at the handful of roughcut diamonds which he let trickle on to the table with an unsteady hand he fortified himself with another drink then opened the other pouch and emptied the contents on the table they were coins glittering golden coins all told there must have been at least fifty of them gold it is said has attracted men from the beginning of recorded time it unquestionably attracted serrano seemingly oblivious of the possibility of discovery he had moved closer to the window so close indeed that a keeneyed and observant person inside the hut might well have seen the pale blur of his face but hamilton was being neither keeneyed nor observant he just stared in apparent fascination at the treasure before him so did serrano the amusement and contempt had disappeared from his face the unblinking eyes seemed huge in his face and his tongue licked his lips almost continuously hamilton took a camera from his rucksack removed a cassette of exposed film examined it closely for a moment and in doing so dislodged two diamonds which fell and rolled under the table apparently unobserved he put the cassette on a shelf beside some other cassettes and cheap camera equipment then turned his attention to the coins again he picked one up and examined it carefully almost as if seeing it for the first time the coin indisputably gold did not appear to be of any south american origin the likeness of the engraved head was unmistakably of classical greek or latin origin he looked at the obverse side the characters clear and unblemished were unmistakably greek hamilton sighed lowered some more of the rapidly diminishing contents of the bottle returned the coins to the pouch paused as if in thought shook some coins into his hand put them in a trouser pocket put the pouch into one of his buttoned shirt pockets returned the diamonds to their pouch and his other buttoned pocket had a last drink turned out the oil lamp and left he made no attempt to lock the door for the sufficient reason that even with the door as fully closed as it would go there was still a twoinch gap between the key bolt and door jamb although it was by now almost dark he did not appear to require any light to see where he was going within a minute he vanished into the shantytown maze of corrugated iron and tarpaper shacks which formed the salubrious suburbs of romono serrano waited a prudent five minutes then entered a small flashlight in his hand he lit the oil lamp placing it on a shelf where it could not be seen directly from the outside then using his flashlight located the fallen diamonds under the table and placed them on the tabletop he crossed to the shelves took the cassette which hamilton had placed there replaced it with another from the pile of cassettes and had just put the cassette on the table beside the diamonds when he became suddenly and uncomfortably conscious of the fact that he was not alone he whirled around and found himself staring into the muzzle of a gun expertly and unwaveringly held in hillers hand well well hiller said genially a collector i see your name serrano serrano didnt look any too happy why are you pointing that gun at me calling cards you cant get in romono so i use this instead are you carrying a gun serrano no if you are and i find it im going to kill you hiller was still geniality itself are you carrying a gun serrano serrano reached slowly for an inside pocket hiller said the classic way of course my friend finger and thumb on the gun barrel then gently on the table serrano carefully as directed produced a small snubnosed automatic and laid it on the table hiller advanced and pocketed it along with the diamonds and the cassette youve been following me all day hiller said consideringly for hours before we boarded that plane and i saw you the previous day and the day before that in fact ive seen you quite a few times in the past weeks you really should get yourself another suit serrano a shadower in a white suit is no shadower at all his tone changed in a fashion that serrano clearly didnt care much for why are you following me serrano its not you im after serrano said were both interested in the same man hiller lifted his gun a perceptible inch if hed lifted it only one millimetre it would have carried sufficient significance for serrano who was in an increasingly apprehensive state of mind im not sure hiller saidthat i like being followed around jesus serranos apprehension had become very marked indeed youd kill a man for a thing like that what are vermin to me hiller said carelessly but you can stop knocking your knees together ive no intention of killing youat least not yet i wouldnt kill a man just for following me around but i wouldnt draw the line at shattering a kneecap so that you couldnt totter around after me for a few months to come i wont talk to anyone serrano said fervently i swear to god i wont aha thats interesting if you were going to talk who would you talk to serrano nobody nobody who would i talk to that was just a manner of speaking was it now but if you were to talk what would you tell them what could i tell them all i know well i dont know but im pretty sure is that hamilton is into something big gold diamonds something like thathes found a cache somewhere i know that youre on his track mr hiller thats why i am following you you know my name how come youre a pretty important man around these parts mr hiller serrano was trying to be ingratiating but he wasnt very good at it a sudden thought appeared to occur to him for he brightened and said seeing were both after the same man mr hiller we could be partners partners i can help you mr hiller serrano was eagerness itself but whether from the prospect of partnership or the understandable desire not to be crippled by hiller it was difficult to say i can help you i swear i can a terrified rat will swear to anything i can prove what i say serrano seemed to have regained a measure of confidence i can take you to within five miles of the lost city hillers initial reaction was one of astonishment and suspicion what do you know about it he paused and recovered himself well i suppose everybodys heard about the lost city hamiltons always shooting off his mouth about it mebbe so mebbe so serrano sensing the change in the atmosphere was almost relaxed now but how many have followed him four times to within a few miles of it if serrano had been at the gambling table hed have leaned back in his chair his trump card played hiller had become very interested indeed even to the extent of lowering then pocketing his own gun you have a rough idea where it is rough immediate danger past serrano invested himself with an air very close to benign superiority close is more like it very close then if youve come all that close why dont you go looking for it yourself look for it myself serrano looked almost shocked mr hiller you must be out of your mind you dont understand what youre talking about have you any idea what the indian tribes in the area are like pacified according to the indian protection service pacified serrano gave a contemptuous laugh pacified there isnt enough money in the country to make those deskbound pansies leave those lovely airconditioned offices in brasilia and go see for themselves theyre terrified just plain terrified even their fieldagents and there are some pretty tough cookies among them are terrified and wont go near the area well four of them did go there once some years back but none of them ever returned and if theyre terrified mr hiller im terrified too that creates quite a problem not surprisingly hiller had become quite thoughtful an approach problem whats so special about those bloodthirsty people there are many tribes who dont care all that much for people from the outside what you and i would regard as other civilised people apparently hiller saw nothing incongruous in categorising himself and serrano as civilised special ill tell you whats special about them theyre the most savage tribes in the mato grosso correction theyre the most savage tribes in the whole of south america not one of them have moved out of the stone age so far in fact they must be a damned sight worse than the stone age people if the stone age people had been like them theyd have wiped each other outwhen those tribes up there have nothing better to do they just go around massacring each otherto keep their hand in i supposeand there would have been no human left on this planet today there are three tribes up there mr hiller first there are the chapates god knows theyre bad enough but all they do is use their blowpipes pump a few curaretipped poison darts into you and leave you lying there almost civilised you might say the horenas are a bit different they use darts that only knock you unconscious then youre dragged back to their village and tortured to deaththis i understand can take a day or two then they cut off your head and shrink it but when it comes to sheer savagery the muscias are the pick of the bunchi dont think any white man has ever seen them but one or two of the outside indians who have met them and survived say that theyre cannibals and if they see what they regard as being a particularly appetising meal they dump him alive into boiling water something like lobsters you know go looking for a lost city surrounded by all those monsters why dont you go looking i can point you in the right direction me i only like cooking pots from the outside well maybe ill have to do a little more thinking on that one absently almost he handed serrano back his gun hiller was no mean psychologist when it came to gauging the extent of a mans cupidity hiller said where do you live a room in the hotel de paris if you saw me in the bar there ive never seen you before in my life an unbiased guidebook to the better taverns of south america would have had some difficulty in finding the space to list the bar of the hotel de paris romono in its pages the bar was not a thing of beauty the indeterminately coloured paint what little there was of it was peeling and blistered the splintered wooden floor was blackened and filthy and the roughcut softwood bar bore the imprint of the passage of time a thousand spilt drinks a thousand stubbedout cigars it was not a place for the fastidious the clientele fortunately were not of an overly fastidious nature exclusively male and dressed for the most part in scarecrows clothing they were rough uncouth illfavoured and harddrinking especially harddrinking as many customers as possibleand there were many pushed up to the bar and consumed huge quantities of what could only be described as rotgut whisky there were a scattering of bentwood chairs and rickety tables largely unoccupied the citizens of romono were mostly vertical drinkers among the currently vertical were both hiller and serrano separated from each other by a prudent distance in such surroundings then the entrance of hamilton did not provoke the horrorstricken reaction that it would have in the plusher caravanserais of brasilia or rio even so his appearance was sufficient to cause a marked drop in the conversational level with his tangled hair a weeks growth of matted and bloodied beard and ripped and bloodstained shirt he looked as if he had just returned from the scene of a successfully if messily executed triple murder his expression as was indeed customary with himlacked anything in the way of encouragement towards social chitchat he ignored the stares and although the crowd before the bar was at least four deep a path opened magically before him in romono such a path always opened for john hamilton a man very obviously held and for a variety of good reasons in considerable respect by his fellow citizens a large very fat barman the boss of the four men serving nonstop behind the bar hurried forward towards hamilton his eggbald pate gleamed in the light inevitably he was known as curly mr hamilton whisky gods name mr hamilton what happened you deaf right away mr hamilton curly reached under the bar produced a special bottle and poured a generous measure that hamilton should be thus privileged apparently aroused no resentment among the onlookers not so much because of their innate courtesy of which they had none but because hamilton had demonstrated in the past his reaction to those who interfered in what he regarded as his own private business hed only had to do it once but once had been enough curlys plump genial face was alive with curiosity as were those of the bystanders but hamilton was not a man to share confidences as everyone was well aware he tossed two greek coins on to the bar hiller who was standing close by observed this and his face grew very still indeed his face was not the only one to assume sudden immobility banks shut hamilton said those do curly picked up the two shining coins and examined them with an air of unfeigned reverence will those do will those do yes mr hamilton i think those will do gold pure gold this is going to buy you an awful lot of scotch mr hamilton an awful lot one of those im going to keep for myself yes sir the other ill take and have valued in the bank tomorrow up to you hamilton said indifferently curly examined the coins more closely and said greek arent they looks like hamilton said with the same indifference he drank some of his scotch and looked at curly with a speculative eye you wouldnt of course be dreaming of asking me if i went all the way to greece to get those certainly not curly said hastily certainly not will i will i get the doctor mr hamilton thanks but its not my blood how many of them who did this to you i mean who did you do it to just two horenas same again although most people at the bar were still looking at hamilton or the coins the hubbub of conversation was slowly resuming hitler glass in hand elbowed his purposeful way towards hamilton who regarded hillers approach with his customary lack of enthusiasm hiller said i hope youll excuse me i dont want to intrude hamilton i understand that after tangling with headhunters a man would like some peace and quiet but what id like to say to you is important believe me could i have a word about what hamiltons tone was less than encouraging and i dont like discussing businessi assume it is business with a dozen pairs of ears hanging on to every word we say hiller looked around inevitably their conversation was attracting attention hamilton paused for a moment as if in thought then picked up his bottle jerked his head and led the way to the corner table most remote from the bar hamilton as always looked aggressive and forbidding and his tone matched his expression out with it he said and no shillyshallying hiller took no offence suits me thats theway i like it the only way to do business ill lay it on the line its my belief youve found this lost city of yours know a man whod pay you a sixfigure fee to take him there that straight enough for you if you throw away that rotgut rubbish you have there ill give you some decent scotch hiller did as requested and hamilton topped up both glasses hiller was clearly aware that hamilton was less interested in dispensing hospitality than in having time to think and from the just perceptibly slurred note in hamiltons voice it could well have been that he could be taking just slightly longer than normal to think quickly and clearly well ill say this hamilton said you dont beat about the bush who says ive found the lost city nobody how could they noone knows where you go when you leave romono except maybe those two young sidekicks of yours hiller smiled thinly they dont look like the type that would talk too much sidekicks oh come off it hamilton the twins everybody in romono knows them but it would be my guess that you would be the only person to know the exact location so okay im only going on a hunchand a couple of brand new golden coins that may be a thousand years old two thousand just supposing supposing what supposing youd found it of course cruzeiros hiller kept his face impassive a rather remarkable feat in view of the wave of elation that had just swept through him when a man talks money it means that he is prepared to dicker to make a deal and hamilton had the means to bargain hamilton had his quid pro quo and that could mean only one thing he knew where the lost city was he had his fish hooked hiller thought exultantly now all he had to do was gaff and land him that might well take time hiller knew but he had every confidence in himself he rather fancied his prowess as a fisherman us dollars hiller said hamilton thought this over for a few moments then said an attractive proposition very attractive but i dont accept propositions from strangers you see hiller i dont know you what you are what you do and how come you are empowered to make this proposition a con man possibly possibly oh come weve had a drink a dozen times in the past months strangers hardly we all know why youve been searching those damned forests for the past four months and other huge stretches of the amazon and parana basins for the past four years for the fabled lost city of the mato grossoif that is indeed where it isfor the golden people who lived there who may still live theremost of all for the fabled man who found it huston dr hannibal huston the famous explorer who vanished into the forests all those many years ago and was never seen again you talk in cliches hamilton said hiller smiled what newspaperman doesnt newspaperman yes odd id have put you down for something else hiller laughed a con a convict on the lampnothing so romantic im afraid he leaned forward suddenly serious listen as i said we all know why youre out hereno offence hamilton but goodness knows youve told everyone often enough although why i dont know id have thought youd have kept it secret from everybody three good reasons my friend in the first place there has to be some reason to account for my presence here secondly anybody will tell you that i know the mato grosso better than any white man and no one would dream of following me where i go finally the more people who know what im after the greater the likelihood that some person some time and in some place will drop a hint or a clue that could be invaluable to me i was under the impression that you didnt require hints or clues any longer thats as maybe just you go ahead and form any impressions you like well all right so ninetynine per cent of the people laugh at your wild notions as they call them though god knows theres not a man in romono would dare say it to your face but i belong to the one per cent i believe you i further believe that your search is over and that the dream has come true id like to share in a dream id like to help a man my employer make his dream come true im deeply moved hamilton said sardonically im sorry well no im not reallybut something gives here that i just cant figure and besides hiller you are an unknown quantity is the mccormickmackenzie international is it what unknown of course not one of the biggest multinational companies in the americas probably the usual bunch of crooks using the usual screen of a battery of similarly crooked international lawyers to bend the laws any which way that suits them hiller took a deep breath manfully restraining himself because im in the position of asking a favour of you hamilton i wont take exception to that in point of fact the record of mccormickmackenzie is impeccable they have never been investigated far less impeached on any count smart lawyers like i said you can be glad that joshua smith is not here to hear you say that hamilton was unimpressed he the owner yes and the chairman and managing director the multimillionaire industrialist if were talking about the same man we are and the owner of the largest newspaper and magazine chain in the americas well well well he broke off and stared at hiller so thats why you exactly so hes your boss a newspaper magnate and youre one of his newspapermen and a pretty senior one at that would guess i mean he wouldnt send out a cub reporter on a story like this very well your connections your credentials established but i still dont see what dont you see this man joshua smith a multimillionaire a bultimillionaire anyway as rich as croesus whats left on earth for him that he doesnt already have what more can a man like that want hamilton took a long pull at his whisky in short whats in it for him you are a suspicious bastard arent you hamilton money of course not are you in it for the money of course not a man like you could make money anywhere no and again no like youand if i may say a little bit like myself hes a man with a dream a dream thats become an obsession i dont know which fascinates him the more the huston case or the lost city although i dont suppose you can really separate the two i mean you cant have the one without the other he paused and smiled almost dreamily and what a story for his publishing empire and that i take it is your part of the dream what else hamilton considered using some more scotch to help him with his consideration mustnt rush things mustnt rush things a man needs time to think about these things of course how much time two hours sure my place the negresco hiller looked around him and gave a mock shudder which could almost have been real its almost as good as it is here hamilton drained his glass rose picked up his bottle nodded and left noone could have accused him of being under the weather but his gait didnt appear to be quite as steady as it might have been hiller looked around until he located serrano who had been looking straight at him hiller glanced after the departing hamilton looked back at serrano and nodded almost imperceptibly serrano did the same in return and disappeared after hamilton romono had not yet got around to and was unlikely ever to get around to streetlighting with the result that the alleyways in the occasional absence of saloons and bordellos fronting on them tended to be very poorly lit hamilton all trace of his unsteady gait vanished strode briskly along clearly unbothered by the fitful or nonexistent lighting he rounded a corner carried on a few yards stopped suddenly and turned into a narrow and almost totally dark alleyway he didnt go farj into the alleynot more than two feet he poked his head cautiously out from his narrow niche and peered back along the way he had just come he saw no more than he had expected to see serrano had just come into view serrano it was clear wasnt out for any leisurely evening stroll he was walking so quickly that he was almost running hamilton shrank back into the shadows he no longer had to depend on his hearing serrano was wearing steeltipped shoes which no doubt he found indispensable for the subtler intricacies of unarmed combat on a still night serrano could have been heard a hundred yards away hamilton no more than another shadow in his shadowy place of concealment listened to the rapidly approaching footsteps serrano almost running now looked neither to right nor to left but just peered anxiously ahead in quest of his suddenly and mysteriously vanished quarry he was still peering anxiously ahead when he passedthe alleyway entrance hamilton a shadow detaching itself from the deeper shadow behind stepped out swiftly and in silence brought his locked hands down on the base of serranos neck he caught the already unconscious man before he could strike the ground and dragged him into the dark concealment from serranos breast pocket he removed a wellfilled wallet extracted a gratifying wad of cruzeiro notes pocketed them dropped the empty wallet on top of serranos prone form and continued on his way this timewithout a backward glance he had no doubt that serrano had been on his own back in his tumbledown hut the guttering oil lamp lit hamilton sat on his cot and pondered the reason for his being shadowed that serrano had acted under hillers instructions he did not for a moment doubt he did not think that serrano had intended to waylay or attack him for he could not doubt that hiller was almost desperately anxious to have his services and an injured hamilton would be the last thing he would want on his hands nor could robbery have been a motivealthough they may well have seen the bulges of the two pouches in his shirt pocketsand hamilton had been well aware that serrano had been watching him through the hut windowcomparatively petty theft would not have interested hiller what he was after was the pot of gold at the foot of the rainbow and only he hamilton knew where that rainbow ended that hiller and his boss smith had dreams hamilton did not for a moment doubt what he did doubt and profoundly was killers version of those dreams hiller had wanted to find out if he had been going to contact his two young assistants or other unknown parties perhaps he thought that hamilton might lead him to a larger and worthwhile cache of gold and diamonds perhaps he thought hamilton had gone to make some mysterious phone call perhaps anything on balance hamilton thought it was just because hiller was of a highly suspicious nature and just wanted to know what if anything hamilton was up to there could be no other explanation and it seemed pointless to waste further time and thought on it hamilton poured himself a small drink the nondescript bottle did in fact contain an excellent highland malt which his friend curly had obtained for him and topped it up with some mineral water the romono water supply was an excellent specific for those who wished to be laid low with dysentery cholera and a variety of other unpleasant tropical diseases hamilton smiled to himself when serrano came to and reported his woes to his master neither he nor hiller would be in any doubt as to the identity of the assailant responsible for the sore and stiff neck from which serrano would assuredly be suffering if nothing else hamilton mused it would teach them to be rather more circumspect and respectful in their future dealings with him hamilton had no doubt whatsoever that he would be meeting serrano officiallyin the very near future and would thereafter be seeing quite a deal of him hamilton took a sip of his drink dropped to his knees ran his hand over the floor under the table found nothing and smiled in satisfaction he crossed to the shelving picked up a solitary cassette examined it carefully and smiled in even wider satisfaction he drained his glass turned out the light and headed back into town in his room in the hotel negrescothe famous hotel in nice would have cringed at the thought that such a hovel should bear the same name hiller was making or trying to make a telephone call his face bearing the unmistakable expression of longsuffering impatience that characterized any person so foolhardy as to try to phone out of romono but at long last his patience was rewarded and his face lit up aha he said his voice understandably had a note almost of triumph in it at last at last mr smith if you please chapter two the drawingroom of joshua smiths villathe villa haydn in brasilia demonstrated beyond all question the vast gulf that lay between a bultimillionaire and the merely rich the furnishings mainly louis xiv and not the shadow of an imitation in sight the drapes from belgium and malta the carpets ancient persian to the last one and the pictures ranging all the way from dutch old masters to the impressionists all spoke not only of immense wealth but also a hedonistic determination to use it to its maximum but for all that vast opulence there was nonetheless displayed an exquisite good taste in that everything matched and blended in something very very close to perfection clearly no modern interior decorator had been allowed within a mile of the place the owner matched up magnificently to all this magnificence he was a large wellbuilt and dinnersuited man of late middle age who looked absolutely at home in one of the huge arm chairs that he occupied close to a sparkling pine log fire joshua smith still dark in both hair and moustache the one brushed straight back the other neatly trimmed was a smooth and urbane man but not too smooth not too urbane much given to smiling and invariably kind and courteous to his inferiors which in his case meant just about everybody in sight with the passage of time the carefully and painstakingly acquired geniality and urbanity had become second nature to him only a specialist could have detected the extensive plastic surgery that had transformed smiths face from what it once had been there was another man in his drawingroom and a young woman jack tracy was a youngmiddleaged man blond with a pockmarked face and a general air of capable toughness about him the toughness and capability were undoubtedly therethey had to be for any man to be the general manager of smiths vast chain of newspapers and magazines maria schneider with her slightly dusky skin and brown eyes could have been south american southern mediterranean or middle eastern her hair was the colour of a raven whatever her nationality she was indisputably beautiful with a rather inscrutable face but invariably watchful penetrating eyes she didnt look kind or sensitive but was both she looked intelligent and had to be when not doublingas rumour had it as smiths mistress she was his private and confidential secretary and it was no rumour that she was remarkably skilled in her official capacity the phone rang maria answered told the caller to hold and brought the phone on its extension cord across to smiths armchair he took the phone and listened briefly ah hiller smith unusually for him leant forward in his armchair there was anticipation in both his voice and posture you have i trust some encouraging news for me you have good good good proceed smith listened in silence to what hiller had to say the expression on his face gradually changing from pleasure to the near beatific it was a measure of the mans selfcontrol that although apparently in a near transport of excitement he refrained from either exclamations questions or interruptions and heard hiller through in silence to the end excellent smith was positively jubilant truly excellent frederik you have just made me the happiest man in brazil although hiller claimed to be called edward his true given name would have appeared to be otherwise nor i assure you will you have cause to regret this day my car will await you and your friends at the airport at eleven am he replaced the receiver i said i could wait forever forever is today moments passed while he gized sightlessly into the flames tracy and maria looked at each other without expression smith sighed gradually bestirred himself leaned back into his armchair reached into his pocket brought out a gold coin and examined it intently my talisman he said he still didnt appear to be quite with them thirty long years ive had it and ive looked at it every day in those thirty years hiller has seen this very coin he says the ones this man hamilton has are identical in every way hiller is not a man to make mistakes so this can mean only one thing hamilton has found what can only be the foot of the rainbow tracy said and at the far end of the rainbow lies a pot of gold smith looked at him without really seeing him who cares about the gold there was a long and for tracy and maria rather uncomfortable silence smith sighed again and replaced the coin in his pocket another thing smith went on hamilton appears to have stumbled across some sort of an el dorado it seems less and less likely that hamilton is the kind of man to stumble across anything maria said hes a hunter a seeker but never a stumbler he has sources of information denied other socalled civilised people especially among the tribes not yet classified as pacified he starts off with some sort of clue that points him in the right direction then starts quartering the ground narrowing the area of search until he finally pinpoints what hes after the element of chance doesnt enter into that mans calculations you might be right my dear smith said in fact youre almost certainly right anyway what matters is that hiller says that hamilton seems to have located some diamond hoard maria said part of the war loot overseas investments my dear overseas investments never war loot in this case however no they are uncutroughcut rather brazilian diamonds and hiller is an expert on diamonds god knows hes stolen enough in his lifetime anyway it appears that hamilton has fallen for hillers story hook line and sinker in hillers rather uninspired phrase two birds with one stonehes found both the european gold and the brazilian diamonds looks as if this is going to be even easier than we thought tracy looked vaguely troubled he hasnt the reputation for being an easy man among the tribes of the mato grosso agreed smith said he smiled as if anticipating some future pleasure but hes going to find himself in a different kind of jungle here maybe you overlook one thing maria said soberly maybe youre overlooking the fact that youve got to go back into that jungle with him hiller in his room in the hotel negresco was studying a gold coin which he held in his hand when he was disturbed by an erratic knock on the door he pulled out a gun held it behind his back crossed to the door and opened it hiller put his gun away the precaution had been unnecessary serrano both hands clutching the back of his neck swayed dizzily and practically fell into the room brandy serranos voice was a strangled croak what the hells happened to you brandy brandy coming up hiller said resignedly he gave a generous double to serrano who downed it in a single gulp he had just finished his third brandy and was pouring out his tale of woe when another sharp rattattat came on the door this knocking far from erratic again hiller took his precautionary measures and again they proved unnecessary the hamilton who stood in the doorway was scarcely recognisable as the hamilton of two hours previously two hours in the hotel de pariss grandiloquently named presidential suiteno president had ever or would ever stay there but it had the only bath in the hotel not corroded with rusthad transformed him he had bathed and was cleanshaven he wore a fresh set of khaki drills a fresh khaki shirt without a rent in sight and even a pair of gleaming new shoes hiller glanced at his watch two hours precisely you are very punctual the politeness of princes hamilton entered the room and caught sight of serrano who was busy pouring himself another large brandy by this time it was difficult to judge whether he was suffering the more from the effects of the blow or the brandy holding the glass in one rather unsteady hand and massaging the back of his neck with the other he continued the restorative process without seeming to notice hamilton hamilton said whos this character serrano hiller said an old friend it would have been impossible to guess from hillers casual offhandedness that hed met serrano for the first time only that evening dont worry he can be trusted delighted to hear it hamilton said he couldnt remember the month or the year when he last trusted anybody makes a welcome change in this day and age he peered at serrano with the air of a concerned and kindly healer looks to me as if hes coming down with something hes been down hiller said mugged he was observing hamilton closely but could well have spared himself the trouble mugged hamilton looked mildly astonished he was walking the streets this time of night yes and alone yes hiller said and added in what he probably regarded as a rather pointed fashion you walk alone at night i know romono hamilton said much more importantly romono knows me he looked pityingly at serrano ill bet you werent even walking in the middle of the road and ill bet youre that much lighter by the weight of your wallet serrano nodded scowled said nothing and got back to his selfmedication lifes a great teacher hamilton said absently but it beats me how a citizen of romono could be so damned stupid okay hiller when do we leave hiller had already turned towards a glassfronted wall cupboard scotch he said no firewater guaranteed he showed hamilton a famous proprietary brand of scotch with the seal unbroken thanks hillers gesture had not been motivated by an undiluted spirit of hospitality he had turned his back on hamilton to conceal what he knew must have been a momentary flash of triumph in his face moreover this was definitely a moment for celebration back in the bar of the hotel de paris he had been sure that he had his fish hooked now he had it gaffed and landed cheers he said we leave at first light tomorrow how do we go bush plane to cuiaba he paused then added apologetically rickety old bus of cardboard and wire but its never come down yet after that smiths private jet thats something else again it will be waiting for us at cuiaba how do you know hiller nodded towards the phone carrier pigeon pretty sure of yourself werent you not really we like to arrange things in advance i just go on probabilities hiller shrugged one call to fix things then another call to cancel then from cuiaba to smiths private airfield in brasilia he nodded towards serrano hes coming with us why why ever not hiller even managed to look puzzled my friend smiths employee good jungle man always wanted to meet one of those hamilton looked consideringly at serrano one can only hope that hes a little bit more alert in the depths of the mato grosso than he is in the alleys of romono serrano had nothing to say to this but he was clearly thinking prudently he refrained from voicing his thoughts smith it would seem was both a considerate man and one who thought of everything not only had he stocked his lear with a splendid variety of liquor liqueurs wines and beers hed even provided an exceptionally attractive stewardess to serve them up all three menhamilton hiller and serrano had long cold drinks in their hands hamilton gazed happily at the green immensity of the amazonian rain forest passing by beneath them this fairly beats hacking your way through that lot down there he said he looked round the cabin of the luxuriously appointed jet but this is for the carriage trade what transport is smith thinking of using when we make our trip into the mato grosso no idea hiller said matters like that smith doesnt consult me hes got his own advisers for that youll be seeing him in a couple of hours i suppose hell tell you then i dont think you quite understand hamilton said in an almost gently explanatory tone i only asked what transport he was thinking of using any decisions he and his experts have made are not really very relevant hiller looked at him in slow disbelief you are going to tell him what were to use hamilton beckoned the stewardess smiled and handed over his glass for a refill nothing like savouring the good lifewhile it lasts he turned to hiller yes thats the idea i can see hiller said heavilythat you and smith are going to get along just fine oh i hope so i hope so you said wed be seeing him in two hours could you make it three he looked disparagingly at his wrinkled khaki drills these look well enough in romono but i have to see a tailor before i go calling on multimillionaires you say were being met when we arrive you think you can drop me off at the grand jesus hiller was clearly taken aback the grandand a tailor thats expensive how come last night in the bar you said you had no money i came into some later on hiller and serrano exchanged very peculiar looks hamilton continued to gaze placidly out of the window as promised a car met them at the private airport in brasilia car was really too mundane a word to describe it it was an enormous maroon rollsroyce big enough one would have thought to accommodate a football team in the back it had television a bar and even an icemaker up front very far up frontwere two uniformed men in dark green livery one drove the car the others main function in life appeared to be opening doors when the back seatseatspassengers entered or left the engine predictably was soundless if it were part of smiths pattern to awe visitors he most certainly succeeded in the case of serrano hamilton appeared quite unimpressed possibly because he was too busy inspecting the bar smith had somehow overlooked providing a stewardess for the rear of the rolls they drove through the wide avenues of that futuristic city and pulled up outside the grand hotel hamilton dismountedthe door having magically been opened for him of course and passed swiftly through the revolving door once inside he looked out through the glassedin porch the rolls already more than a hundred yards away was turning a corner to the left hamilton waited until it had disappeared from sight left by the revolving door by which he had entered and started to walk briskly back in the direction from which they had come he gave the impression of one who knew the city and he did he knew brasilia very well indeed five minutes after dropping hamilton the rolls pulled up outside a photographers shop hiller went inside approached a smiling and affable assistant and handed over the film that had been taken from hamilton have this developed and sent to mr joshua smith haydn villa there was no need for hiller to add the word immediately smiths name guaranteed immediacy hiller went on no copy is to be made of this film and neither the person who develops it nor any other member of your staff is ever to discuss it i hope that is clearly understood yes sir of course sir the smile and the affability had vanished to be replaced by total obsequiousness speed and secrecy those are guaranteed sir and a perfect print if the negative is perfect so will the print be hiller couldnt think of how else he could threaten the now thoroughly apprehensive assistant so he nodded and left another ten minutes later and hiller and serrano were in the drawingroom of the villa haydn serrano was seated as were tracy maria and a fourth and as yet unidentified man smith talked somewhat apart with hillersomewhat apart in that huge drawingroom meant a considerable distanceglancing occasionally in serranos direction hiller said of course i cant vouch for him but he knows an awful lot that we dont and i can always see to it that hell make no trouble come to that so would hamilton hamilton has a rough way of dealing with people who step out of line hiller went on to tell the sad tale of serranos mugging well if you say so hiller smith sounded doubtful and if there was one thing smith didnt like it was being doubtful about anything you certainly havent let me down so far he paused but your friend serrano seems to have no history no past neither have most men in the mato grosso usually for thesimple reason that they have too much of a past but he knows his jungleand he knows more indian dialects than any man except maybe hamilton certainly more than any man in the indian protection service all right smith had made up his mind and seemed relieved for that and hes been close to the lost city could be a useful backup man hiller nodded towards the unidentified person a tall very heavily built darkly handsome man in his midthirties whos that mr smith heffner my chief staff photographer hiller said mr smith hamilton would think it extremely strange if i didnt take a staff photographer along on this historic trip smith said reasonably he smiled slightly i will confess though that he can use one or two instruments other than his cameras iil bet he can hiller looked at heffner with even closer interest another with or without a past smith smiled again but made no answer a phone rang tracy who was nearest to it picked it up listened briefly and replaced the receiver well well surprise surprise the grand hotel has no one registered there under the name of hamilton not only that no member of the staff can recall ever seeing a man answering to the description hamilton at that moment was in a lavishly furnished suite in the hotel imperial ramon and navarro seated on a couch were admiring hamilton who was admiring himself in front of a fulllength mirror always did fancy myself in a fawn seersucker hamilton said complacently dont you agree this should knock smith for six i dont know about smith ramon said but in that outfit youd terrify even the muscias so no trouble with getting the invitation none when he saw me flashing those gold coins in public he must have panicked in case someone else would step in fast now im pleased to say hes convinced hes got me hooked you still think that gold hoard exists navarro said im convinced it sexist not that it does then why did you want those coins when this is over they will be returned and the money reimbursedall except the two that are now in the possession of curly the head barman at the hotel de paris but those were necessary the shark as we know took the bait so no hoard huh ramon said disappointing there is a hoard and a huge one but not of those coins perhaps melted down although thats unlikely what is likely is that its been split up into private collectors hands if you want to dispose of an art treasure be it a stolen tintoretto or a penny black then brazil is the place in the world the number of brazilian millionaires who spend hours in their airconditioned humiditycontrolled burglarproof deep underground cellars gloating over stolen old masters boggles the imagination ramon theres a wet bar right behind you and im developing a sore and thirsty throat from lecturing callow youngsters on the facts of criminal life ramon grinned rose and brought a large whisky and soda to hamilton and a soda each for himself and his brotherthe twins never drank anything stronger having eased his throat hamilton said what did you get on smith nothing more than you expected ramon said the number of companies he controls is beyond counting hes a financial genius charming and courteous totally ruthless in his business dealings and must by any reckoning be the richest man in the southern hemisphere a sort of howard hughes in reverse about hughess early days everything was known in detail but the latter part of his life was so wrapped in mystery that many people who should have been in a position to know could scarcely believe that he had died on that flight from mexico to the states having been firmly convinced that he had died many years previously smith dead opposite his past is a closed book and he never talks about it neither do any of his colleagues friends or supposed intimatesnoone really knows whether he has any intimates for the good reason that none of them was around in his early days today his life is an open book he conceals nothing and operates in a totally straightforward fashion any one of the shareholders in his fortyodd companies can inspect the firms books whenever they wish he appears to have absolutely nothing to hide and i would suppose when you are as brilliant as he unquestionably is theres just no point in being dishonest after all whats the point in it if you can make more money being honest today he knows everybodys business and lets anyone who wishes know all about his businesses hes got something to hide hamilton said i know he has navarro said what thats what were going to find out isnt it hamilton said i wish you wouldnt play your cards so close to your chest navarro said what cards we look forward to watching you at work mr hamilton ramon said his tone was neutral to the point of being ambiguous it should be worth watching by every account the man is totally above suspicion he goes everywhere sees everyone knows everyone and everyone knows that he and the president are blood brothers the presidents blood brother was leaning forward in a chair in his splendid drawingroom oblivious of the company around him staring in fascination at the silver screen the room had been so efficiently darkened by the heavy drapes that he would have had difficulty in seeing those around him had it been broad daylight he still wouldnt have seen them his absorption was total the transparencies were of superb quality taken with a superb camera by an expert photographer who knew precisely what he was about the colour was true the clarity and the resolution impeccable and the projector the best that smiths money could buy the first group showed a ruined and ancient city impossibly clinging to the top of a narrow plateau with at the far end a breathtakingly wellpreserved ziggurat as imposing as the best surviving works of the aztecs or the maya a second group showed one side of the city perched on the edge of a cliff that dropped vertically to a river and the rain forest beyond the third group showed the other side of the city overlooking a similar gorge with a river sliding swiftly past in the distant depths a fourth group clearly taken from the top of the hills showed a reverse view of the ancient city with a brief glimpse of scrubland beyondonce obviously terraced for cultivation and with the two cliffsides meeting in the middle distance a fifth group obviously taken from the same position showed a flat grassy plateau the sides curving to meet like the bows of a boat nearly incredible as those pictures were the next few groups were staggering they were taken from the air and as transparency succeeded transparency it became evident that they like a number of the previous ones could only have been taken from a helicopter the first of those helicopter shots showed the entire ruined city from above the second from perhaps five hundred feet higher up showed that the city was perched on top of a verticallysided boatshaped pinnacle of rock splitting a river which swept by on either side of it both arms of the river were rockstrewn foaming white and clearly unnavigable the third and fourth groups from an even higher altitude were a shock taken horizontally they showed pictures of a densely crowded rainforest reaching out it seemed almost to touch the camera and extending unbroken to the distant horizon the fifth set vertically downwards made it clear that the great outer cliffwalls of the twin gorges were at least several hundred feet higher than the top of the cliffwalls that formed the island on which the lost city was built the sixth group taken at a still higher elevation showed just a narrow gap between two great stretches of forest reaching towards each other with the lost city just vaguely visible in the gloomy depths below the seventh and last group taken anywhere between five hundred and a thousand feet higher up again revealed nothing but the continuous majestic sweep of the amazonian rainforest unbroken from pictorial horizon to pictorial horizon it was small wonder then that the planes of the brazilian ordnance survey services whose pilots claimed probably rightly to have crisscrossed every square mile of the mato grosso had never discovered the site of the lost city it just could not be seen from the air but the ancients had stumbled across it discovered the most invisible the most inaccessible the most impregnable fortress ever created by nature or devised by man the viewers in the villa haydn drawingroom had sat throughout in silence they knew they had seen something that no white man with the exception of hamilton and his helicopter pilot had ever seen before something perhaps that noone had ever seen for generations maybe even for centuries they were hard people tough people cynical people people who counted value only in the terms of cost people conditioned to disbelieve almost automatically the evidence of their own eyes but there is yet to be born a man or woman the atavistic depths of whose soul cannot be touched by that one questing finger that will not be denied that primitive ancestral awe inseparable from watching the veil of unsuspected history being swept aside the slowly comprehending silence stretched out for at least a minute then almost inaudibly smith exhaled his breath in a long sigh sonofagun he whispered sonofagun he found it if your intention was to impress us maria said youve succeeded what on earth was that and where is it the lost city smith spoke absently brazil in the mato grosso the brazilians built pyramids not that i know of may have been some other race anyway theyre not pyramids theyretracy this is more in your field well not really my field either one of our magazines had an article on those socalled pyramids and i spent a couple of days with the writer and photographer on the job curiosity only and wasted curiosityi didnt learn much pyramidshaped sure but those steppedsided and flattopped structures are called ziggurats noone knows where they originated although it is known that the assyrians and babylonians had them oddly enough this style bypassed the virtually neighbouring country of egypt which went in for the smoothsided and conicallytopped version but turned up again in ancient mexico where some are still to be seen archaeologists and suchlike use this as a powerful argument of prehistoric contact between east and west but the only sure fact is that their origins are lost in the mists of those same prehistoric times my word mr smith this is going to drive those poor archaeologists up the wall a ziggurat in the mato grosso ricardo hamilton said i shall be leaving our friends place in about two hours time ill be driving moment he broke off and turned to ramon lounging in the couch in the imperial suite ramon what shall i be driving black cadillac a black cadillac hamilton said into the phone i do not wish to be followed thank you chapter three there were six people in smiths drawingroom that sunny afternoon smith himself tracy maria hiller serrano and hamilton all had glasses in their hands another said smith his hand reached out to touch the button that would summon the butler hamilton said id rather talk smith raised an eyebrow in slight if genuine astonishment not only had he heard from hiller of hamiltons reputation as a hard drinker but his slightest suggestion was usually treated as a royal command he withdrew his hand from the buzzer as you wish so we are agreed on the purpose of our visit i tell you hamilton i have done many things in the past that have given me a great deal of pleasure but ive never been so excited hamilton interrupted him something noone ever did to smith lets get down to details by god you are in a hurry id have thought that after four years its a lot longer than that but even after only four years a man starts to become a little impatient he pointed towards maria and tracy people never pointed in smiths drawingroom who are they we all know your rough diamond reputation hamilton when smith chose to use a cold tone he could do so most effectively but theres no need to be rude hamilton shook his head not rude just a man as you observed in a hurry i just like to check on the company im keeping as you do as i do again the eyebrow my dear fellow if you would kindly explain and thats another thing hamilton said that made it twice in thirty seconds that smith had been interrupted which must have constituted some sort of a record i dont like being condescended to i am not your dear fellow i am not as you may come to learn anybodys dear fellow as you do i said check up or perhaps you dont know the identity of the person who rang the grand hotel to see if i was actually staying there it was a guess but in the circumstances a safe one and the flickered glance between smith and tracy was all the confirmation hamilton required he nodded towards tracy see what i mean hamilton said thats the nosey bastard who is he you would insult my guests hamilton smiths tone was now positively arctic i dont much care who i insultor should i say whom hes still a nosey bastard another thing when i ask questions about people i do it honestly and in the open not behind their backs who is he tracy smith said stiffly is the managing director of mccormickmackenzie international publications division hamilton looked unimpressed maria is my confidential secretary and i might add a close personal friend hamilton looked away from tracy and maria almost as if he had already dismissed them from his mind as being of no importance im not interested in your relationships my fee smith was obviously taken aback gentlemen did not discuss business negotiations in this crude and abrupt fashion momentarily his expression hovered between astonishment and anger many years had passed since any man had dared talk to him in such a way he required considerable willpower to repress his anger hiller mentioned it i think smith said a sixfigure sum one hundred thousand dollarsus dollars friend im not your friend a quarter million ludicrous i could say thanks for the drink and walk out im not childish i hope youre not either smith had not become the man he was without the ability to make his mind up very rapidly indeed without in any way appearing to capitulate he capitulated immediately a man would want an awful lot of service for money like that lets get our terms clear you get cooperation not service ill return to this point later i regard my fee as being far from excessive in view of the fact that im damned certain youre in this not just to get a few nice photographs and a human interest story who ever heard of joshua smith engaging upon any enterprise where money was not the prime and motivating factor as far as the past is concerned i would agree with you smiths voice was quiet in this particular instance money is not the principal factor hamilton nodded in acknowledgment that could well be in this particular instance i could well believe you smith looked taken aback at hamiltons concession then his expression changed to one of speculation hamilton smiled youre doubtless trying to figure out what ive figured out as the other motivation you need not concern yourself for that in no way concerns me now transportation what what was that smith had been caught offbalance by the sudden switch in topic which he should not have been as it was a favourite tactic of his own ah transportation yes what kind of transportation air and water we can forget landdo your companies have available a great deal as you can imagine what we dont have we can hire although i should think the need would be unlikely tracy has all the details tracy by the way is both a qualified pilot and helicopter pilot helps where are the details tracy has the details smith said this in such a way as to convey the impression that he was not the man to be concerned with details which was probably quite an accurate impression for he was famous for his gift in picking topflight lieutenants and delegating the bulk of the executive work to them tracy who had been following the conversation closely rose crossed to where they were standing and handed hamilton a folder the expression on tracys face bespoke a marked lack of affection managing directors do not take kindly to being called nosey bastards hamilton appeared to notice nothing amiss he took the folder read rapidly through the looseleaf contents pausing briefly now and again as something in particular caught his attention then closed the folder one could have been forgiven for assuming that hamilton had already absorbed the contents he probably had for once hamilton seemed fairly impressed quite an airsea fleet havent you everything from a boeing to a piper comanche double rotor freight helicopter this is a sikorsky skycrane yes and a hovercraft can the helicopter lift the hovercraft naturally thats why it was bought wheres the hovercraft corrientes smith said how the devil do you know logic wouldnt be much good to you here or in rio would it ill take this folder see you this evening this evening smith looked unhappy damn it man we have to draw up our plans and ill draw up the plans ill explain them when i return with my assistants this evening damn it all hamilton i am putting up all the money the man who pays the piper calls the tune this time out youre second fiddle hamilton left leaving behind him a brief but profound silence tracy said well of all the arrogant hardnosed intransigent bastards agreed agreed smith said but he holds the cards all of them he looked thoughtful enigma rough tough but dresses well speaks well obviously at home in any territory nuances clever nuances at ease in my drawingroom not many strangers are come to that nobody is tracy said and hes come to the conclusion that this lost city is so dangerously inaccessible that hes not prepared to try the same route again so a helicopter or hovercraft i wonder smith was still looking thoughtful why else would a man like that throw in his lot with us because hes convinced he can eat us alive maria said she paused maybe he will at that smith looked at her without expression then crossed to the diningroom window hamilton was just moving away in his black cadillac a chauffeur stopped polishing a nondescript ford glanced towards smiths window nodded climbed into his car and followed the cadillac hamilton was driving down one of brasilias broad boulevards he consulted his rear mirror the ford was about two hundred yards behind hamilton increased his speed so did the ford both cars were now traveling well above the speed limit a police car appeared behind the ford switched on the siren overtook and flagged the ford to a stop the ministry of justice was a rather splendid building and the large airy office in which hamilton sat opposite across a polished leather table from colonel ricardo diaz was suitably sumptuous diaz in an immaculately cut uniform was large tanned and looked competent to a degree which indeed he was diaz took a sip of some indeterminate liquid and sighed about smith mr hamilton you know as much as we do everything and nothing his past is a mystery his present an open book that anyone is welcome to read the dividing line between the present and the past cant be precisely delineated but it is known that he appeared or rather emerged or surfaced in santa catharina a province with a traditionally heavy germanic settlement in the late forties whether he is of similar origin is not known his english is as immaculate as his portuguese but as far as is known he has never been heard to speak german his first business venture was to produce a newspaper aimed primarily at the native german speakers in the province but printed in portuguese it was conservative and strongly proestablishment and marked the beginning of a long and close association with the government of the time an association that has persisted despite changes of government until this day he then branched out into the fields of early plastics and early ballpoint pens smith was never an innovatorhe was and remains a takeover specialist and a share manipulator of genius both the publishing and the industrial sides of his businesses expanded at a remarkable speed and within ten years he was by any standards a very wealthy man hamilton said he couldnt have been without the odd cruzeiro to begin with agreed expansion on a scale such as smiths must have called for a great deal of capital and the source of capital is unknown totally but thats nothing to hold against any man in this countryas in many otherswe dont care to enquire too closely into those things now we come to tracy he is indeed the general manager of smiths publication division very tough very able nothing known about him in the criminal line which could mean that hes either honest or very clever the best you can say of him is that hes a soldier of fortune the police are certain that the bulk of his activities are illegaldiamonds have an odd habit of disappearing when hes in the neighbourhoodbut hes never been arrested far less convicted serrano is a smalltime crook not too bright and a fearful coward he cant be all that cowardly if he ventures alone into the rainforests of the mato grosso not many white people would that thought i admit has also occurred to me im merely passing on reported reputation accuracy not guaranteed now heffner heffners the joker wouldnt recognise a camera if he tripped over one well known to the new york police associated with crimes of violence and alleged gangland killings but hes always beaten the rap not too surprising really no police in any country are going to come over all zealous and excited when one hoodlum dispatches another curious fellow usually well spoken and civilised enoughlook at those pillars of society the mafia bossesbut the veneer vanishes when he gets next to a bottle of bourbon and he has a weakness for bourbon and all this leaves smith unaffected nothing known against him as i said but you cant associate with characters like hiller heffner and tracy without some tar rubbing off could well be the other way round of course he looked up as a knock came at the door come in come in ramon and navarro entered the twins were clad in khaki suits and smiling cheerfully diaz looked at them and winced the famous detectivesergeant herera and the famous detectivesergeant herera or infamous you are far from home gentlemen senor hamiltons fault sir ramon spread his hands apologetically hes always leading us astray marys little lambs ah major a young officer entered and unrolled on the table a map of southern brazil it was marked with legends of varying kinds differently coloured flags in circles and squares indicated different tribes races and languages other symbols indicated the state of hostility or friendliness of the tribes the major said this is the most uptodate picture the indian protection service can give you there are some places you understand where even the service do not care to investigate too closely most of the tribes are friendlypacified if you like some are hostile nearly always the white mans fault a very few cannibal tribes those are known and to be avoided of course the chapate horenas and muscias especially hamilton pointed at a town on the map and looked at diaz corrientes smith has a hovercraft there for obvious reasons its at the junction of the parana and paraguay rivers and he must be pretty sure the lost city lies near the headwaters of one of those im going up the paraguay i dont know it well there may be bad rapids for all i know but the helicopter can help if there are diaz said your friend has a helicopter my friend as you call him has got everything this is a gianta sikorsky skycrane well enough namedit can just about lift any damn thing well base the helicopter at asuncion the hovercraft can go up in three stagesto either puerto casado or puerto sastre in paraguay then into brazil to corumba then finally to cuiaba from there the helicopter can airlift it to rio da morte and you would like to have some units of the federal army exercising near cuiaba is that it if it can be arranged that has already been done i am in your debt colonel diaz it would be more accurate to say that we are in your debt if that is to say if i come back precisely hamilton gestured towards the two young men with the heavenly two to watch my back what harm can befall me diaz looked at him briefly and doubtfully then pressed a button an aide came in carrying a brown leather case extracted what looked to be a large movie camera and handed it to hamilton who pressed a button on the base there came the faint whirring noise typical of an electricpowered camera diaz said you wont believe this but it will even take pictures if you wish hamilton smiled but without humour i dont think ill be indulging in any photography this time out whats the radio transmitting range five hundred kilometres enough waterproof naturally you leave tomorrow no we have to get provisions and jungle gear and fly them to cuiaba we must get the hovercraft on the move more important though i must go ahead and check on our friend mr jones back to the colony back to the colony diaz said slowly you are an extraordinarily persistent man mr hamilton god knows youve every right to be he shook his head i greatly fear for the health of your travelling companions in your forthcoming expedition hamilton had rejoined his travelling companionstobe outside the uncurtained windows of the villa haydns drawingroom the sky was dark the room itself was brightly but not harshly lit by the light from the three crystal chandeliers there were nine people in the room most of them standing most of them with aperitif glasses in their hands present were hamilton the twin sergeants herera smith and his entourage heffner to whom hamilton had just been introduced was slightly flushed of face slightly loud of voice and was sitting on an arm of the chair maria was occupying tracy was regarding him with disfavour smith said to hamilton i must say your heavenly twins as you call them have an air of competence about them theyre not much at home in drawingrooms but in the jungle yes theyre good squirrelhunters eyes meaning either of them with his rifle can hit a playingcard at a hundred yards most people cant even see a card at that distance that meant to sound intimidating threatening neither reassuring very useful accomplishment when wild boars or alligators or headhunters or cannibals come at you lets not confuse this coming trip with a sunday school picnic im aware of that smith was trying to sound patient well your plan sounds reasonable we leave in a couple of days more like a week i repeat no picnic you dont go dashing off into the amazonian rainforest at a couple of hours notice especially when you are going to be passing through hostile territoryand believe me we will be we have to allow several days for the hovercraft to get up to cuiaba we dont know what difficulties it might encounter then we have to get all our provisions and equipment and fly them over to cuiaba at least you will i have some business to attend to first smith raised an eyebrow he was very good at raising eyebrows what business sorry hamilton didnt sound sorry where can one hire a helicopter in this city smith took a deep breath then clearly made up his mind to ignore the outright rebuff well you know i have this freight sikorsky that lumbering giant no thank you i have a smaller one and a pilot again no thanks tracys not the only one who can fly a helicopter smith looked at him in silence his face was without expression but it was not difficult to guess what he was thinking it would have been perfectly in keeping with hamiltons secretive nature his policy of never letting his left hand know what his right was doing to have flown his own helicopter over the lost city so that no other person could share his knowledge at last smith said gracious arent you you dont see a little friction arising when we set off on this search hamilton shrugged indifferently it isnt a search i know where im going and if you think some friction is going to arise then why dont you leave behind those liable to give rise to friction its a matter of indifference to me who comes along ill decide that hamilton will you now again the same indifferent infuriating shrug i dont think youve quite got the picture yet it was significant of smiths perturbation that he actually went to the bar and poured another drink for himself normally indeed invariably he would have summoned his butler to perform such menial tasks he returned to hamilton and said another point you got your own way about making the plansbut we havent yet decided whos going to be in charge of our little expedition have we i have i am smiths impassive air deserted him he looked every inch the bultimillionaire he was reputed to be i repeat hamilton im the paymaster the shipowner pays his captain whos in charge at sea even more importantly whos in charge in the jungle you wouldnt last a day without me there was a sudden silence in the room the tension between the two men was all too obvious heffner rose from the arm of the chair lurched once and then crossed to where the two men were standing the light of battle was in his truculent and bloodshot eyes but boss you dont seem to understand heffner didnt speak the words he sneered them this is the intrepid explorer himself the one and only hamilton havent you heard hamilton is always in charge hamilton glanced briefly at heffner then at smith this is the kind of irritant i mean born to give trouble bound to give rise to friction what function does he perform my chief staff photographer looks the artistic type he coming along of course he is smiths tone was glacial why on earth do you think mr tracy and i brought him down here i thought maybe he had to leave some place in a hurry heffner took a step closer what does that mean hamilton nothing really i just thought that maybe your friends in the new york police department were beginning to take too close an interest in you heffner was momentarily taken aback then he took another menacing step forward i dont know what the hell you mean you wouldnt think of stopping me would you hamilton stopping you from coming along dear me no ramon looked at navarro both men winced amazing heffner said all you require is twenty pounds over a man to make him see it your way provided of course that youre halfway sober by that time heffner gazed at him in alcoholic disbelief then swung a roundhouse right at hamiltons head hamilton moved inside it and brought up his own right in a wicked jab as heffners fist swept harmlessly by his head greyfaced and doubled over heffner sank to his knees his hands clutching his midriff ramon said thoughtfully i do believe senor hamilton that hes halfway sober already a short way with mutineers eh smith was unmoved by the plight of his trusty chief photographer and his irritation had given way to curiosity you seem to know something about heffner i read the occasional new york paper hamilton said bit late when i get them mind you but that hardly matters as heffners activities covet a fair period what the americans call a scofflaw suspected involvement in various crimes of violence even gangland killings hes cleverer than he looks which i dont believe or he has a clever lawyer anyway hes always beaten the rap so far it is impossible mr smith that you had no inkling of this i confess that there have been stories rumours i discount them two things he knows his job and a man is innocent until proved guilty smith paused and went on you know anything to my detriment nothing everybody knows your life is an open book a man in your position cant afford to have it otherwise me said tracy i dont want to hurt your feelings but i never heard of you until today smith glanced down casually at a still prostrate heffner as if seeing him for the first time and rang a bell the butler entered his face remained expressionless at the sight of the man on the floor it was not difficult to imagine that he had seen such things before mr heffner is unwell smith said have him taken to his quarters dinner is ready yes sir as they left the drawingroom maria took hamiltons arm in a quiet voice she said i wish you hadnt done that dont tell me ive unwittingly clobbered your fiancй my fiancй i cant stand him but he has a long memoryand a bad reputation hamilton patted her hand next time ill turn the other cheek she snatched her hand away and walked quickly ahead of him dinner over hamilton and the twins left in the black cadillac navarro said admiringly so now heffner is labelled in their minds as your bad apple in the barrel while smith tracy hiller and for all i know serrano think that they are the driven snow you really are a fearful liar senor hamilton one really has to be modest about such things as in all else practice makes perfect chapter four as dusk approached a helicopter equipped with both floats and skids set down on a sandy stretch on the left bank of the river parana both upriver and down on the same bank as far as the eye could see in the gloom stretched the dense and virtually impenetrable rain forest of the region the far side of the river the right or western bank was invisible in the gathering gloom at this point close to where the river iquelmi flowed into the parana the parent river was more than five miles wide the helicopter cabin was dimly lit even although the precaution had been taken of pulling black drapes across the windows hamilton navarro and ramon were having their evening meal of cold meat bread beer and soda the beer for hamilton soda for the twins ramon shivered theatrically i dont think i much care for this place not many people do hamilton said but it suits brownalias mr jonesand his friends well enough defensively speaking its probably the most impregnable place in south america years ago i traced brown and his fellowrefugees to a place called san carlos de bariloche near lake ranco on the argentinechilean border god knows that was fortress enough but he didnt feel secure even there so he moved to a hideout in the chilean andes then came here navarro said he knew you were after him yes for years our wealthy friend in brasilia has been after him for much much longer there may well be others and now he no longer feels secure even here im almost certain he doesnt i know he was in the lost city this year and several times in the past few years but he likes his comforts and there are none in that ruin he may have taken a chance and returned its highly unlikely but i have to check otherwise theres no point in going to the lost city you have to have this confrontation between brown and his friend yes i have no proof this ah meeting will give me all the proof i ever require remind me to take care of myself i want to be alive to see it navarro turned and gazed at the curtain facing downstream it will not be easy to get into this place it will not be easy browns estate here its known as kolonie waldner is better guarded than the presidential palace the estate is hotching with trained killers as guards and when i say that i mean theyre trained and proven killers theres dense jungle to the north and south paraguay lies to the south and brown is a close friend of the president theretheres this river to the east and a large number of german settlements populated almost exclusively by exmembers of the ss lie astride the roads to asuncion and bella vista you wont even find a single river pilot here who is brazilian born theyre all germans from the river elbe ramon said in view of the fact of what youve just told us a thought occurs to me how do we get in ill admit ive given the matter some thought myself not much option really theres a road used by supply trucks but its too long too dangerous and has to pass through an armed gatehouse with electrified fences stretching away on both sides theres also a landing stage about ten miles downriver from hereabout fifteen miles north of the paraguayan border the road up to the compound is about a mile long and usually heavily patrolled but its the only other way at least there are no electrified fences along the right bank of the paranaor there werent the last time i was there well wait two hours and move on in would it be in order navarrd said if we gave you what is known as a couple of oldfashioned looks help yourself hamilton said agreeably he opened a rucksack brought out three silenced lugers three spare magazines and three sheathed hunting knives and distributed those sleep if you can ill watch the helicopter not under power drifted with the current down the right bank of the parana keeping as close inshore as possible to avoid the bright light of a brilliant half moon riding high in a cloudless sky a door in the fuselage opened a figure appeared stepped down on to one of the pontoons and lowered an anchor quietly to the bed of the river a second figure appeared with a bulky package under his arm there came a subdued hiss and within thirty seconds a rubberised dinghy was fully inflated a third man emerged from the fuselage carrying a small outboard motor and a mediumsized battery the first two men stepped gingerly into the dinghy and took those items from him the engine was clamped on to the transom aft the battery lowered to the duckboard floor and coupled up to the engine the engine once started was almost soundless and the southeast wind the prevailing one in that area carried what little noise there was upstream the painter was unhitched from the helicopter and the dinghy moved downstream the three occupants were crouched forward listening intently and peering not without some apprehension into the gloom beneath the overhanging branches of the rainforest trees a hundred yards ahead the river curved to the right hamilton switched off the electric motor the twins dipped paddles into the water and very soon a paddle occasionally touching the bank they rounded the bend the landing stage less than two hundred yards ahead projecte d out into the river for a distance of twenty feet behind it on land there was a guardhouse which threw enough light to illuminate the cracked and splintered timber of the stage and two men rifles shoulderslung maintaining a comfortable and relaxed guard on a couple of bentwood chairs both were smoking and they were sharing a bottle they stood up as two other men came out from the guardhouse they talked briefly then the two relieving guards took over their chairsand the bottlewhile the previous guards went inside the guardhouse the dinghy grounded silently on the muddy bank of the river and was secured by its painter to the lowhanging branch of a tree the three men disembarked and disappeared into the undergrowth after they had gone about ten yards hamilton said to navarro in a barely audible whisper what did i tell you no electrified fences watch out for the beartraps there were four men inside the guardhouse all dressed in uniforms of the fieldgrey colour used by the wehrmacht in the second world war fully clad they were lying on camp beds three were asleep or appeared to be the fourth was reading a magazine some instinctthere was certainly no soundmade him glance upwards and towards the doorway ramon and navarro were smiling benevolently at him there was nothing particularly benevolent however about the discouragingly steady silenced lugers held in their hands on the landing stage the two new guards were gazing out over the parana when someone cleared his throat almost apologetically behind them they immediately swung around hamilton wasnt even bothering to smile inside the guardhouse all six guards were securely bound beyond any hope of escape and were more than adequately gagged ramon looked at the two telephones then questioningly at hamilton who nodded and said no chances ramon sliced through the wires while navarro started to collect the prisoners rifles he said to hamilton still no chances hamilton nodded the three men left threw the rifles into the parana then began to move up the road connecting the landing stage with kolonie the twins pressed in closely to the forest on the lefthand side of the road while hamilton kept to the right they moved slowly with the stealth and silence of indians they had long moved at will through the disaffected tribes of the mato grosso when they were only yards from the compound hamilton waved his two companions to a halt the compound of the kolonie was well lit by the moon it was built in the basic form of a barrack square and was perhaps fifty yards across eight huts faced on to this central square most of those were extremely ramshackle but one at the far left of the square was a solidly built bungalow close by that was an arched metal shed and beyond that a short runway at the entrance to the compound diagonally across the square from the bungalow was a thatched hut which could well have been a guardhouse a probability reinforced by the fact that a solitary figure leaned against the entrance wall like his colleagues on the landing stage he was in paramilitary uniform and carried a slung rifle hamilton gestured to ramon who waved back the three men vanished into the undergrowth the sentry still leaning against the wall had his head tilted back a bottle to his lips there came the sound of a muffled blow the sentrys eyes turned up in his head and three disembodied hands appeared from apparently nowhere one took the bottle from the already powerless hand while the other two took him under the armpits as he began to sag in what was indeed the guardhouse six more men lay trussed and gagged hamilton alone in the middle of the room and engaged in rendering rifles and pistols inoperable looked up as ramon and navarro each with torch in hand reentered the room shaking their heads the three men left and began to move around the other huts as they passed by each one on each occasion hamilton and ramon remained outside while navarro entered each time navarro emerged shaking his head finally they arrived at the last building the solidly constructed bungalow all three entered hamilton in the lead found a switch and flooded the room with light it was a combination office and living quarters and furnished in considerable comfort drawers and filing cabinets were searched but they had nothing that interested hamilton they moved on to another apartment a bedroom and again a very comfortable place of accommodation pride of place on the walls were given to three framed and inscribed photographsthose of hitler goebbels and stroessner a former paraguayan president the contents of the wardrobes were very sparse indicating that the owner had removed the bulk of the contents in one cupboard stood a pair of brown riding boots the nazis had always insisted on black riding boots despising brown ones as being decadent stroessner on the other hand had favoured brown from there the three moved into what was browns communication centre containing two large multicalibrated transceivers of the latest design they located a toolbox and while hamilton and ramon used chisels and screwdrivers to remove the faceplates and destroy the inner mechanisms navarro located all the spares and reduced them too to scrap metal and shattered glass navarro said hes also got a very nice radio and transmitting set here you know what to do dont you navarro knew what to do from there they moved on to the arched metal shed it was rather a remarkable place inasmuch as there ran down the middle of it what must have been the kolonies pride and joy a genuine fulllength american bowling alley they paid no attention to this what did attract their attention was a piper cub in a bay alongside the bowling alley it took the men less than ten minutes to ensure that that particular piper cub would never fly again on their way back to the parana this time walking openly in the middle of the road ramon said so your friend has gone in that inelegant phrase the bird has flown the coop taking most of his hard cases with himnazis renegade poles renegade ukrainians as fine a collection of war criminals as youll ever meet this bunch here belong strictly to the second division where do you think theyve gone well ask shall we the three men entered the landingstage guardhouse wordlessly they sliced the anklebonds of one of the prisoners removed his gag dragged him to his feet and led him outside down to the river edge of the landing stage hamilton said brown had three piper cubs where have the other two gone the guard spat in contempt at a signal from hamilton navarro cut the back of the guards hand the blood flowed freely the guard was then led forward until he was teetering on the very edge of the landingstage pirhana hamilton said can smell blood at a quarter of a mile ninety seconds and youll be white bones if a crocodile doesnt get you first either way being eaten to death is unpleasant the guard looked in horror at his bleeding hand he was trembling north he said north to campo grande and after that i swear to god throw him in planalto de mato grosso thats all i know i swear to you hamilton said wearily stop your damned swearing i believe you brown would never entrust his secrets to vermin ramon said what do we do with the prisoners nothing but but nothing i daresay someone will happen by and free them take this character inside and hobble and gag him navarro looked doubtful its a pretty deep cut he could bleed to death dear oh dear chapter five hamilton ramon and navarro were in a taxi driving along one of brasilias broad boulevards ramon said this woman maria she comes hamilton looked at him and smiled she comes there will be danger the more the better it will at least help to keep those clowns under control navarro was thoughtfully silent for a moment then he said my brother and i hate all they stand for but you senor hamilton hate so much more i have the reason but i dont hate them ramon and navarro looked at each other in lost comprehension then nodded as if in understanding a rollsroyce and a cadillac had been backed out of smiths sixcar garage to make storage room for what smith regarded as being more important however temporarily than the two cars hamilton in the company of the eight people who were going to accompany him surveyed with an apparently uncritical eye the extremely comprehensive layout of the most modern and expensive equipment necessary for survival in the amazonian rainforests he took his time about it so much so in fact that one or two of the watchers were beginning to look if not apprehensive then at least uncomfortable smith was not one of those there was a slight tightening of the lips presumably indicative of a growing impatience it was almost a law of nature that tycoons do not care to be kept waiting smith immediately proved that his patience was on a very short fuse indeed well hamilton well so how the multior is it bultimillionaire travels into the boondocks but good really excellent smith visibly relaxed but theres one exception though indeed one has to be very wealthy before one canor is permitted toraise ones eyebrows in the proper fashion and what might that be nothing missing i assure you just some items surplus to requirements who are those guns and pistols for us no deal ramon navarro and i carry weapons you dont none of you do we do deals off why you are children in the rainforests no popguns for kids but hiller and serrano i admit they know more than you do that doesnt mean very much in the mato grosso they might even rate as adolescents forget what theyve ever told you smith lifted his shoulders looked at the rather splendid armoury of weapons he had assembled then back at hamilton selfprotection well protect you i dont much fancy the prospect of you lot going around shooting harmless animals and innocent indians even less do i fancy the prospect of being shot in the back when ive finally shown you where the lost city is heffner stepped forward he obviously had no doubt that the reference had been to himself his fingers were actually clutching and unclutching his face dusky with anger look here hamilton id rather not stop it smiths voice was cold and incisive but when he spoke again the tone had changed to one of bitterness and left no doubt that he was addressing hamilton if i may say so you have a splendid capacity for making friends oddly enough i do i have quite a few in this city alone but before i make a man my friend i have to make sure hes not my enemy or potential enemy very sensitive about those things i am but sos my back sensitive i mean sensitive to having a knife stuck in it i should know ive had it done twice to me i suppose i should have you all searched for flickknives or some such toys but in your case i really dont think ill bother the harmless animals and innocent indians are safe from any ill intentions you may develop for quite frankly i cant see any of you lot taking on an armed indian or a jaguar with what is after all little more than a penknife he made a small gesture with his right hand as contemptuous as it was dismissive and from the sudden tightening and whitening of smiths lips it occurred to hamilton not for the first time that smith might well and easily be the most dangerous man of them all hamilton gestured again this time towards the very considerable pile of equipment lying on the garage floor how did those arrivethe packaging i mean crates we crate them up again no too damned awkward to handle aboard a helicopter or hovercraft i think waterproof canvas bags he smiled at the slight surprise on hamiltons face we thought you might require something like that he pointed towards two large cardboard boxes we bought them at the same time as we got the equipment were not mentally retarded you know fine your plane a dc understandwhats its state of readiness superfluous question i suppose where are the hovercraft and helicopter almost at cuiaba shall we join them the dc parked at the end of the runway of smiths private airfield may not have been in the first flush of youth but if the gleaming fuselage were anything to go by its condition would have ranked anywhere as immaculate hamilton ramon and navarro aided by an unexpectedly helpful serrano were supervising the loading of the cargo it was a thorough rigorous painstaking supervision each canvas bag in turn was opened its contents removed examined returned and the bag then sealed to make it waterproof it was a necessarily lengthy and timeconsuming process and smiths patience was eroding rapidly he said sourly dont take many chances do you hamilton glanced at him briefly how did you make your millions smith turned and clambered aboard the aircraft after halfanhours flying time out from brasilia the passengers with the exception of hamilton were all asleep or tryingto sleep noone it seemed felt philosophical enough or relaxed enough to read the clamour from the ancient engines was so great as to make conversation virtually impossible hamilton as if prompted by some instinct looked around and his gaze focused heffner sprawled in his seat appeared from his partly opened mouth and slow deep breathing to be asleep a probability lent credence by the fact that his white drill jacket inadvertently unbuttoned lay so as to reveal under his left armpit a white felt container which had obviously been designed to accommodate the aluminium flask inside this did not give concern to hamilton it was perfectly in character with the man what did concern him was that on the other side of his chest could just be seen a small pearlhandled gun in a white felt underarm holster hamilton rose and made his way aft to the rear end of the compartment where the equipment provisions and personal luggage were stored it made for a very considerable pile but hamilton didnt have to rummage around to find what he was looking for when loading he had made a mental note of where every item had been stored he retrieved his rucksack opened it looked casually around to see that he was unobserved removed a pistol and thrust it into an inside pocket of his bush jacket he replaced the rucksack and resumed his seat up front the flight to cuiaba airport had been uneventful and so now was the landing the passengers disembarked and gazed around them in something like wonder which was more than understandable as the contrast between cuiaba and brasilia was rather more than marked maria was gazing around her in apparent disbelief she said so this is the jungle quite quite fascinating this is civilisation hamilton said he pointed to the east the jungle lies over there thats where well be very soon and once we get there perhaps youd sell your soul to be back here he turned and said sharply to heffner where do you think youre going heffner had been walking in the direction of the airport building now he stopped turned and looked at hamilton with a languid insolent air talking to me im looking at you and i dont squint where are you going look i cant see its any of your businessbut im going to a bar im thirsty any objections every objection were all thirsty but theres work to be done i want all the equipment food and luggage transferred to that dc there and i want it done now two hours on and it will be too hot to work heffner glared at him then looked at smith who shook his head sullenly heffner retraced his steps and approached hamilton his face heavy with anger next time ill be ready so dont be fooled by last time hamilton turned to smith and said almost wearily hes your employee any more trouble or threats of trouble and hes on the dc back to brasilia if you disagree im on the plane back there simple choice hamilton brushed contemptuously by heffner who stared after him with clenched fists smith took heffner by the arm and led him to one side clearly having trouble keeping his anger in check he said lowvoiced damned if i dont agree with hamilton want to ruin everything theres a time and a place to get tough and this is neither the time nor the place bear in mind that were entirely dependent upon hamilton you understand sorry boss its just that the bastard is so damned arrogant pride cometh before a fall my turn will come and the fall is going to be a mighty big one smith was almost kind i dont think you quite understand hamilton regards you as a potential troublemakerwhich i have to say you areand hes the sort of man who will eliminate any potential source of trouble god man cant you see hes trying to provoke you so that he can have a reason or at least an excuse for disposing of you and how would he do that having you sent back to brasilia and failing that dont even let us talk about such things i can take care of myself mr smith taking care of yourself is one thing taking care of hamilton is another kettle of fish altogether they watched some of them with evident apprehension as a giant twinrotored helicopter cables attached to four lifting bolts clawed its way into the air raising a small hovercraft with it the hovercrafts rate of climb was barely perceptible at five hundred feet it slowly began to move due east smith said uneasily those hills look mighty high to me sure theyll make it youd better hope so after all theyre your machines hamilton shook his head do you think the pilot would have taken off unless he knew it was on the cards only three thousand feet no trouble how far the headwaters of the rio da morte is only a hundred miles away to reach the landingstrip perhaps eighty in halfanhours time well leave in the dc well still be there before them hamilton moved off and sat by the side of the river idly lobbing stones into the dark waters some minutes later maria appeared and stood uncertainly beside him hamilton looked up smiled briefly then glanced indifferently away she said is it safe to sit here boyfriend let you off the leash hes not my boyfriend she spoke with such vehemence that hamilton looked at her quizzically you could have fooled me misinterpretations so easily come by you have come no doubt or been sent to ask a few craftily probing questions she said quietly do you have to insult everybody wound everybody antagonise everybody provoke everybody back in brasilia you said you had friends it is difficult to understand how you came by them hamilton looked at her in some perplexity then smiled now look whos doing the insulting between gratuitous insults and the plain truth theres a big difference im sorry to have disturbed you she turned to walk away oh come and sit down childish childish maybe i can ask a few probing questions while you congratulate yourself on having found a chink in hamiltons armour i suppose that could be misinterpreted as an insult too just sit down she looked at him doubtfully i asked if its safe to sit here a damn sight safer than trying to cross a street in brasilia she sat down gingerly a prudent two feet away from him things can creep up on you youve read the wrong books or talked to the wrong people who or what is going to creep up on us indians theres not a hostile indian within two hundred miles of here alligators jaguars snakes theyre a damned sight more anxious to avoid you than you are to avoid them there are only two dangerous things in the forest the quiexada the wild boar and the carangageiros they attack on sight the caran what giant spiders great hairy creatures the size of soup plates they come at you one yard at a time jumping i mean one yard and thats it how horrible no problem none in those parts besides you didnt have to come here we go again maria shook her head you really dont care much for us do you a man has to be alone at times evasion evasion she shook her head again youre always alone married no but you were it wasnt a question it was a statement hamilton looked at her at the remarkable brown eyes which reminded him painfully of the only pair hed ever seen like them you can tell i can tell well yes divorced no no you mean yes oh oh i am sorry howhow did she die come on plane to catch please what happened she was murdered hamilton stared out across the river wondering what had caused him to make this admission to a total stranger ramon and navarro knew but they were the only two in the world hed told perhaps a minute passed before he became conscious of the light touch of fingertips on his forearm hamilton turned to look at her and knew at once that she wasnt seeing him the big brown eyes were masked in tears hamiltons first reaction was one of an almost bemused incomprehension this was totally out of character with the image sheably abetted by smithprojected of herself as a worldlywise streetwise cosmopolitan hamilton gently touched the back of her hand and at first she didnt appear to notice perhaps half a minute passed before she wiped her eyes with the back of her free hand disengaged her other hand smiled apologetically and said im sorry what must you think of me i think i may have misjudged you i also think that in some way some time you may have suffered a lot she had nothing to say to this just wiped her eyes again rose and turned away battered is the adjective invariably and usually inevitably used to describe vintage and superannuated dc and this one was no exception if anything it was an epitome a prime example the gleaming silver fuselage of yesteryear was but a fond and distant memory the metal skin was pitted and scarred and appeared to be held together chiefly by large areas of rust the engines when started up were a splendid complement to the rest of the plane coughing spluttering and vibrating to such an extent that it seemed improbable that they would not be shaken free from the airframe but the plane lived up to its reputation of being one of the toughest and most durable ever built with what seemed a herculean effortit couldnt have been it was underloadedit clambered off the runway and headed east into the late afternoon sky there were eleven people in the plane hamiltons party the pilot and copilot heffner as was customary was taking counsel with a bottle of scotch the aluminium flask presumably was being held as an emergency reserve seated across the aisle from hamilton he turned to him and spoke or rather shouted for the rackety clamour from the ancient engines was almost deafening wouldnt kill you to tell us your plans would it hamilton no it wouldnt kill me but what does that matter hows that going to help you curiosity no secret we land at romono airstrip about the same time as the helicopter and hovercraft helicopter refuelseven those big birds have only a limited rangetakes the hovercraft downstream leaves it returns and takes us down to join it in the morning smith sitting in the seat next to hamilton and listening put a cupped hand to hamiltons ear and said how far downstream and why id say about sixty miles there are falls about fifty miles from romono not even a hovercraft could negotiate them so this is the only way we can get it past there heffner said do you have a map as it happens i have not that i require it why do you ask if anything happens to you it would be nice to know where we are you better pray nothing happens to me without me youre finished smith said into hamiltons ear you have to antagonise him you have to be so arrogant you have to provoke him hamilton looked at him his face cold i dont have to but its a pleasure romono airstrip like romono itself looked as it always did a miasmic horror the dc and the helicoptercumhovercraft arrived on the strip within minutes of each other the helicopters rotor had hardly stopped when a small fuel tanker moved out towards it the passengers disembarked from the dc and looked around them their expressions ranged from the incredulous to the appalled smith contented himself with saying merely good god i dont believe it heffner said what a stinking nauseating dump jesus hamilton is this the best you could do for us what are you complaining about hamilton pointed to the tin shed which constituted both the arrival and departure terminals look at that sign there romono international airport what more reassuring than that this time tomorrow gentlemen you may well be thinking of this as home sweet home enjoy it think of it as the last outpost of civilisation look as the poet says your last on all things lovely every hour take what you need for the night we have a splendid hotel here the hotel de paris those who dont fancy it well im sure hiller will put you up he paused on second thoughts i think i could have a better use for miller smith said what kind of use with your permission of course you know that this hovercraft is the lynchpin to everything im not a fool the hovercraft will be anchored tonight in very dicey waters indeed by which i mean that the natives on either side of the rio da morte range from the unreliable to the downright hostile so it must be guarded i suggest that this is not a task for one man kellner the pilot to do in fact im not suggesting im telling you even if a man could keep awake all night it would still be extremely difficult so another guard i suggest hiller he turned to hiller how are you with automatic weapons can find my way around i guess fine he turned back to smith youll find a bus waiting outside the terminal he reboarded the plane and emerged two minutes later bearing two automatic weapons and some drums of ammunition by this time hiller was alone lets go to the hovercraft kellner the hovercraft pilot was standing by his craft he was thirtyish suntanned tough hamilton said when you anchor tonight dont forget to do so in midstream therell be a reason for that kellner clearly was an irishman because if you tie up to either bank the chances are good that youll wake up with your throat cut only of course you dont wake up i dont think id like that kellner didnt seem unduly perturbed midstream for me even there you wont necessarily be safe thats why hiller is coming with you needs two men to guard against an attack from both sides and thats why we have those two nasty little israeli submachines along i see kellner paused im not much sure that i care for killing helpless indians when those same helpless indians puncture your hide with a few dozen darts and arrowheads all suitably or perhaps even lethally poisoned you might change your mind ive already changed it know anything about guns i was in the sas if that means anything to you it means a great deal to me the sas was britains elite commando regiment well that saves me explaining those little toys to you i suppose i know them one of my luckier days hamilton said well see you both tomorrow the saloon of the hotel de paris after closing hours had six occupants heffner glass in hand was slumped in a chair but his eyes were open hamilton ramon navarro serrano and tracy were asleep or apparently so stretched out on benches or on the floor bedrooms were that night at a premium in the hotel de paris as they were all equally dreadful and bugridden hamilton had explained this was not a matter for excessive regret heffner stirred stooped removed his boots rose and padded his noiseless way across to the bar deposited his glass on the counter then crossed silently to the nearest rucksack it was inevitably hamiltons heffner opened it searched briefly removed a map and studied it intently for some minutes before returning it to the rucksack he returned to the bar poured himself a generous measure of the hotel de pariss scotch wherever the birthplace of that particular brand was it hadnt been among the highlands and islands of scotland he returned to his seat replaced his shoes leaned back in his chair to enjoy his nightcap spluttered and emptied half the contents on the floor hamilton ramon and navarro heads propped on hands were regarding him with a quietly speculative air hamilton said well did you find what you were looking for heffner didnt say whether he had or not one of the three of us is going to keep an eye on you for the remainder of the night you try to stir from that chair and i will take the greatest pleasure in clobbering you i dont much care for people who meddle in my private belongings hamilton and the twins slept soundly throughout the night heffner did not once leave his chair chapter six just after dawn the helicopter pilot john silvergenerally known as long johnwas at the controls the party of nine embarked and stowed their overnight luggage with the food and equipment that had been transferred from the dc hamilton took the copilots seat so cavernous was the interior of the giant helicopter that it seemed virtually empty it rose effortlessly and flew more or less east paralleling the course of the rio da morte all the passengers had their heads craned peering through what few windows there were they were seeing for the first time the true amazonian rainforest hamilton turned in his seat and pointed forward thats an interesting sight his voice was a shout on a wide mud flat perhaps almost a mile long and on the left bank scores of alligators lay motionless as if asleep good god it was smith good god are there so many gators in the world he shouted to silver take her down man take her down then to heffner your camera quick he paused as if in sudden thought then turned to hamilton or should i have asked the expedition commanders permission hamilton shrugged whats five minutes the helicopter came down over the river in great sweeping controlled circles long john was clearly a firstrate pilot the alligators hemmed in the narrow strip between forest and river seemed to stretch as far as the eye could see it was depending upon ones point of view a fascinating horrifying or terrifying spectacle tracy said almost in awe my word i wouldnt care to crashland amongst that lot hamilton looked at him believe me thats the least of the dangers down there the least this is the heart of the chapate territory that meant to mean something to me you have a short memory ive mentioned them before it would mean something to you if you ended up in one of their cookingpots smith looked at him doubtfully clearly not knowing whether to believe him or not then turned to the pilot thats low enough silver he twisted in his seat and shouted at the top of his voice gods sake man hurry moment moment heffner bawled back theres such a damned jumble of equipment here there was in fact no jumble whatsoever heffner had already found his own camera which lay at his feet in hamiltons rucksack he had found something that he had missed the previous night for the good enough reason that he hadnt been looking for it he held a leatherbound case in his hand the one colonel diaz had given to hamilton he extracted the camera from the case looked at it in some puzzlement then pressed a switch in the side a flap fell down noiselessly on oiled hinges his face registered at first bafflement then understanding the interior of the camera consisted of a beautifully made transistorised radio transceiver even more importantly it bore some embossed words in portuguese heffner could read portuguese he read the words and his understanding deepened the radio was the property of the brazilian defence ministry which made hamilton a government agent he clicked the flap in position heffner smith had twisted again in his seat heffner if you heffner heffner radio case in one hand and his pearlhandled pistol in the other approached his face was a smiling mask of vindictive triumph he called out hamilton hamilton swung around saw the wickedly smiling face his own camera held high and the pearlhandled pistol and at once threw himself to the floor of the aisle his gun coming clear of his bush jacket even so despite the swiftness of hamiltons movement heffner should have had no trouble in disposing of hamilton for he had the clear drop on him and his temporarily defenceless target was feet away but heffner had spent a long night of agony in the hotel de paris as a consequence his hand was less than steady his reactions were impaired his coordination considerably worse hefftier his face contorted fired twice with the first came a cry of pain from the flightdeck with the second the helicopter gave a sudden lurch then hamilton fired just once and a red rose bloomed in the centre of heffners forehead hamilton took three quick steps up the aisle and had reached heffner before anyone else had begun to move he stooped over thedead man retrieved the cameraradio case checked that it was closed then straightened smith appeared beside him a badly shaken man and stared down in horror at heffner between the eyes between the eyes smith shook his head in total disbelief between the eyes christ man did you have to do that three things hamilton said if he was upset he had his distress well under control i tried to wing him and im a good shot especially at four paces but the helicopter lurched he twice tried to kill me before i pulled the trigger third place i gave orders that noone was to carry guns as far as im concerned hes dead by his own hand gods sake why did he pull a gun on me was he mad smith perhaps fortunately was given no time to lend consideration to either of those things even had he then been of a mind to which he almost certainly was not the helicopter had given another and even more violent lurch and although it still carried a good deal of forward momentum seemed to be fluttering and falling from the sky like a wounded bird it was a singularly unpleasant sensation hamilton ran forward clutching at whatever he could to maintain his balance silver blood streaming from a cheek wound was fighting to regain control of the uncontrollable helicopter hamilton said quick can i help help no i cant even help myself whats happened first shot burnt my face nothing superficial second shot must have gone through one or more hydraulic lines cant see exactly but it cant have been anything else what happened back there heffner had to shoot him he tried to shoot me but he got you and your controls instead no loss considering the circumstances silver was remarkably phlegmatic heffner i mean this machine is a different matter altogether hamilton took a quick look backwards the scene understandably was one of confusion and consternation although there were no signs of panic maria serrano and tracy all three with almost comically dazed expressions were sitting or sprawling in the central aisle the others clung desperately to their seats as the helicopter gyrated through the sky luggage provisions and equipment were strewn everywhere hamilton turned again and pressed his face close to the windscreen the now pendulumlike motion of the craft was making the land below swing to and fro in a crazy fashion the river was still directly beneath the one plus factor appeared to be that they had now left behind them the mudflats where the alligators had lain in so lifeless a manner hamilton became suddenly aware that an island perhaps two hundred yards long by half as wide lay ahead of them in the precise middle of the river at a distance of about half a mile it was wooded but not heavily so hamilton turned to silver this thing float like a stone see that island ahead they were now less than two hundred feet above the broad brown waters of the river the island was about a quarter of a mile ahead i can see it silver said i can also see all those trees look hamilton control is close to zero ill never get it down in one piece hamilton looked at him coldly never mind the damned chopper can you get us down in one piece silver glanced briefly at hamilton shrugged and said nothing the island was now two hundred yards distant as a landing ground it looked increasingly discouraging apart from scattered trees it was but for one tiny clearing thickly covered with dense undergrowth even for a helicopter in perfect health it would have made an almost impossible landing site even in that moment of emergency some instinct made hamilton glance to the left directly opposite the island at about fifty yards distance and on the bank of the river was a large native village from the expressionor lack of iton hamiltons face it was clear that he didnt care for large native villages or at least this particular one silvers face streaked with rivulets of sweat and blood reflected a mixture of determination and desperation with the former predominating the passengers tense immobile gripped fiercely at any available support and stared mutely ahead they too could see what was about to happen the helicopter swinging and sideslipping weaved its unpredictable way towards the island silver was unable to bring the helicopter to the hover as they approached this one much too small clearing the helicopter was still going far too fast its groundlevel clearance was by then no more than ten feet the trees and undergrowth rushed at them with accelerating speed silver said no fire no fire no ignition silver switched off one second later the helicopter dipped sharply crashed into the undergrowth slid about twenty feet and came to a jarring stop against the bole of a large tree for a few moments the silence was complete the engine roar had vanished it was a silence compounded of the dazed shock caused by the violence of their landing and the relief of finding themselves still alive noone appeared to have sustained any injury hamilton reached out and touched silvers arm ill bet you couldnt do that again silver dabbed at his wounded cheek i wouldnt ever care to try if he was in any way proud of his magnificent airmanship it didnt show out all out smiths voice was a stentorian shout he seemed unaware that normal conversational tones were again in order we can go up any moment dont be so silly hamilton sounded weary ignitions off stay put if i want to go out then thats your business nobodys going to stop you later on well bury your boots what the hell is that meant to mean a civilised interment of the remains maybe even those wont be left if youd be look out your window smith looked at hamilton then turned to the window standing so as to achieve a ground view his eyes widened his lips parted and his complexion changed for the worse two very large alligators were only feet from the helicopter fearsome jaws agape their huge tails swinging ominously from side to side wordlessly smith sat down hamilton said i warned you before you left the mato grosso is no place for mindless little children our two friends out there are just waiting for such children and not only those two therell be more around lots of them also snakes tarantulas and suchlike not to mention he broke off and pointed to the port windscreen id rather you didnt have to but take a look anyway they did as he asked among the trees on the left bank could be seen a number of huts perhaps twenty in all with an especially large circular one in the centre several columns of smoke shimmered up into the morning air canoes and what looked like a pinnace fronted the village a large number of natives nearly naked stood on the bank talking and gesticulating but this is luck smith said you should have stayed in brasilia hamilton sounded unwontedly sour sure its luckthe most fiendishly bad luck i see the chiefs are getting ready there was a fairly long silence then maria said almost in a whisper the chapate none else complete as you can now see with olive branches and calling cards every native ashore was now armed or was in the process of getting armed they carried spears bows and arrows blowpipes and machetesthe angry expressions on their faces went well with the menacing gesticulations in the direction of the island theyll be calling soon hamilton said and not for tea maria would you give mr silver a hand to fix up his face tracy said but were safe here surely we have guns plenty theyre carrying nothing that could penetrate our screens far less the fuselage true ramon navarro get your rifles and come with me smith said what are you going to do discourage them from crossing shame really they may not even know what a gun is tracy made sense smith said were safe here you have to be a hero hamilton stared at him until smith looked uncomfortable hamilton said heroism doesnt enter into it just survival i wonder whether you would be halfway brave enough to fight for your own survival i suggest you leave this to someone who knows how the chapate wage war or do you want to be ready for immediate consumption when they get you whats that supposed to mean smith tried to sound blustery but his heart wasnt in it his ego had been too severely dented just this if they get as much as a foothold on this island the first thing theyll do is to set fire to the undergrowth and roast you alive in this metal coffin there was a silence that lasted until hamilton ramon and navarro had left the helicopter ramon the first to touch the ground had his rifle on the nearest alligator immediately but the precaution proved needless both alligators immediately turned and scuttled away into the undergrowth hamilton said just keep an eye on our backs ramon ramon nodded hamilton and navarro moved towards the rear took shelter behind the tail of the helicopter and looked cautiously ashore a squat powerfully built indian dressed in a pink feather headdress teeth necklace a series of arm bracelets and little elsedefinitely the chiefwas ordering warriors into halfadozen canoes he himself was standing on the bank navarro looked at hamilton his reluctance plain he said no choice with equal regret hamilton agreed shaking his head navarro lifted his rifle aimed and fired in one swift motion the report of the rifle momentarily paralysed all activity on the bank only the chief moved he cried out in pain and clutched his upper right arm a second later while the warriors were still immobilised in shock another report was heard and another warrior struck in precisely the same place navarro was clearly a marksman of the most extraordinary accuracy navarro said not nice senor hamilton not nice as the old saying goes its people like us who have made people like them what they are but this is hardly the time and place to explain that to them ashore the warriors rapidly abandoned their canoes and ran for the shelter of their huts and the forest taking the two wounded men with them from those shelters they could be seen almost immediately drawing bows and lifting blowpipes to their mouths hamilton and navarro prudently dropped behind cover as arrows and darts rattled and rebounded harmlessly off the fuselage navarro shook his head in sorrow and wonderment iil bet theyve never even heard a rifle report before it is something less than a fair contest senor hamilton hamilton nodded but made no comment for comment would have been superfluous he said thats all for now i dont think theyll try anything again before dark but ill keep watchor arrange for others to do it meantime you and ramon get rid of our fourlegged friends and the creepycrawlies try to chase them away shoo them away if you have to shoot for goodness sake dont do it by the waters edge or in the water bathtime tonight and i dont want to attract every piranha for miles around hamilton reboarded the helicopter tracy said that was quite a hailstorm out there arrows and darts i assume didnt you see i wasnt too keen on looking im sure those windows are made of toughened glass but i wasnt going to be the one to put them to the test poisoned certainly but almost equally certainly no curare nothing lethal they have a less final but equally effective poison that merely stuns too much curare affects the flavour of the stew smith said sourly you certainly have a summary way of dealing with the opposition i should have parleyed with them the brightly coloured beads approach why dont you go and try it smith said nothing if you have any futile suggestions to offer i suggest you either translate them into action or shut up theres a limit to the number of niggling remarks a man can take silver his face bandaged intervened pacifically and now a lovely long siesta until dusk for me that is i shall have to ask you to take turns in keeping watch not only the village but as far upstream and downstream as you can see the chapate might contemplate launching a canoe attack at some distance from their village although i consider it highly unlikely if anything happens let me know ramon and navarro should be back in twenty minutes dont bother letting me know tracy said you place a great deal of faith in your lieutenants total smith said so we keep awake while you sleep why recharging my batteries for the night ahead and then hamilton sighed this helicopter obviously will never be airborne again so we have to find some other means of rejoining the hovercraft which i reckon must be about thirty miles downstream we cant go by land it would take us days to hack our way down there and anyway the chapate would get us before we covered a mile we need a boat so well borrow one from the chapate theres a nice big and very ancient motor launch moored to the bank there not their property for a certainty the original owners were probably eaten long ago and the engine will be a solid block of rust and quite useless but we dont need power to go downstream tracy said and how do you propose weah obtain this boat mr hamilton iil get it after sunset he smiled faintly thats why i intend recharging my batteries in advance smith said you really do have to be a hero hamilton dont you and youll really never learn will you no i dont have to be a hero i dont want to be a hero you can go instead you be the hero go on volunteer impress your girlfriend smith slowly unclenched his fists and turned away hamilton sat and appeared to compose himself for slumber oblivious of the dead heffner laid now across the aisle from him the others looked at one another in silence it was many hours later at dusk when hamilton said everything packed guns ammunition last nights overnight bags food water medicines and silver the choppers two compasses might come in handy silver indicated a box by his feet theyre already in there excellent hamilton looked around him well that seems to be all heighho i think what do you mean that seems to be all smith said he nodded towards the dead heffner how about him well how about him you going to leave him here thats up to you hamilton spoke with an almost massive indifference he did not have to spell out his meaning smith turned and stumbled down the helicopter steps at the downstream end of the island only navarro of all the party was absent in the gathering darkness hamilton again checked all the various packs he seemed satisfied there will be a moon he said but it will be too late to save us moonrise is in about two and a half hours when they attacktheres no if about itit must be inside those two and a half hours which means it could be any time now although i should guess that theyll wait a bit until it is as dark as possible ramon join navarro now if they attack before you get my signal hold them off as best you can for as long as you can if my signal comes first get back here at once tracy tracy said i can tell you i havent been too happy here for the past hour no no alligators no sign not a ripple no gun guns make noises guns get wet maria shivered and pointed to his big sheath knife and that does neither sometimes the first blow doesnt kill then there can be a lot of noise but no heroics i dont expect to have to use it if i do it means ive botched my job hamilton looked out across the river the darkness had now so deepened that the shoreline was no more than a dimly seen blur he checked that the coil of rope the waterproof torch and the sheath knife were securely attached to his waist walked noiselessly into the river and then slowly silently began to swim the water was warm the current was gentle and around him he could see nothing but the calm dark water suddenly he stopped swimming trod water and stared ahead he could see what he imagined to be a tiny ripple in the black smoothness without being able to see what caused it his right hand came clear of the water clenched round the haft of his sheath knife the tiny ripple was still there but even as he strained to watch it it disappeared hamilton replaced the knife in its sheath he wasnt the first person to have mistaken a drifting log for a crocodile a considerably healthier position than the other way round he resumed his silent swimming a minute later he drifted in towards the bank and caught hold of a convenient tree root he straightened paused looked carefully around listened intently then emerged swiftly and silently from the river and disappeared into the forest a hundred yards brought him to the perimeter of the village there were at least a score of native huts haphazardly arranged none of them showing any sign of life in their approximate centre was the much larger circular hut light could be seen through the numerous chinks in its walls ghostlike hamilton moved off to his right and moved round the perimeter of the village until he was directly to the rear of the large hut here he waited until he was sureor as sure as he could possibly bethat he was alone then moved forward to the rear of the hut he selected a small lighted chink in the wall and peered through it the communal hut was illuminated by some scores of tallow tapers it was completely unfurnished dozens of natives were standing several deep round a cleared space in the middle where an elderly man was using a stick to make a diagram on the sandcovered floor while at the same time explaining something in an unintelligible tongue the diagram was the outline of the island also shown was the left bank of the river on which the village stood the speaker had drawn lines from the village from above the village and from below the village all towards the island a multipronged attack was to be launched on the helicopter and its passengers the lecturer lifted his stick from time to time and pointed it at various natives it was apparent that he was allocating canoe crews for their lines of attack hamilton moved away in the direction of the upper river bank still circling the village perimeter as he passed the last hut he stopped at least twenty canoes some quite large were tethered to the bank almost at the end of the row upriver was the dilapidated paintflaked motor launch a little over twenty feet in length it was deep in the water but floating so to that extent might be deemed riverworthy two indian warriors talking quietly stood guard at the downstream end of the row of canoes as hamilton watched one of them gestured towards the village and walked away hamilton moved around to one side of the hut and crouched there the indian walked by on the other side another problem had arisen one that hamilton could well have done without even fifteen minutes ago he could have remained where he had been and the remaining indian could have come within a few feet without seeing him not any more the sun was gone moonrise was still some time away but unfortunately the evening clouds which earlier had so obligingly offered concealment had passed away and the southern skies were alive with stars and in the tropics stars always seem so much bigger and brighter than they do in temperate climes visibility had become disconcertingly good hamilton knew that the last thing he could afford to do was to wait he straightened and advanced soundlessly knife held in the throwing position the indian was gazing out towards the island now quite visible a shadow appeared behind him and there came the sound of a sharp but solid blow as the haft of hamiltons knife caught him on the base of the neck hamilton caught him as he was about to topple into the water and lowered him none too gently to the bank hamilton ran upstream he came to the motor launch pulled out his signal torch hooded the beam with his hand and shone it inside the launch was filthy and had at least four inches of water in the bottom the torch beam lit on the centrally positioned engine which as hamilton had expected was now no more than a solid block of rust floating incongruously in its vicinity were three cooking pans obviously intended as bailers at a guess the property of some optimistic but now departed missionaries the beam played swiftly around the entire interior of the boat there was no means of propulsion whatsoever no mast no sail no oars not even a solitary paddle hamilton straightened and moved quickly to examine some of the nearest canoes within a minute he had collected at least a dozen paddles he deposited those in the launch hurried away selected two large canoes and pulled them close to the launch he unwound the rope around his waist cut off two sections and used those to tie the canoes in tandem to the launch he sliced through the manila painter pushed the launch into deeper water scrambled in seized a paddle and began to move silently away from the bank paddling the launchand its attendant canoesdiagonally downstream hamilton was soon making heavy weather of it the launch was naturally cumbersome and made more so by the amount of water in it and hamilton able to use only one paddle had to switch continuously from side to side to keep it on course briefly he paused located what he could discern to be the upstream end of the island now almost directly opposite him pulled out his torch and pressed the button three times he then pointed his torch diagonally downstream and flashed again three times he replaced his torch and resumed paddling ashore an indian warrior emerged from the communal hut and walked casually towards the upper riverbank suddenly he hurried forward and stooped over an indian lying facedown on the bank a trickle of blood was coming from what was the beginning of a massive bruise on the base of his neck his fellow tribesman straightened and began to shout repeatedly and urgently hamilton momentarily ceased paddling and glanced involuntarily over his shoulder then he bent himself again to his task but with even more energy this time ramon and navarro as by prearrangement had already begun to move to the other end of the island now they stopped abruptly when they heard the cry ashore a cry now taken up by the shouting of many more angry voices ramon said i think senor hamilton must have been up to something i also think wed better wait a little the two men crouched on the island shore rifles at the ready and peered out across the channel the bulky outline of hamiltons launch and the two canoes he was towing were now visible not thirty yards from where they were not as visible but still distinct enough to be unmistakable were the shadowy forms of canoes putting out from the village in pursuit ramon shouted as close to the island as you can well cover you hamilton glanced over his shoulder the nearest of half a dozen canoes was already less than thirty yards away two men stood in the bows one with a blowpipe to his mouth the other pulling back the string of his bow hamilton crouched as low as possible in the boat glancing almost desperately to his right he could now see both ramon and navarro and he could see that they had their rifles levelled the two shots came simultaneously the warrior with the blowpipe toppled backwards in the canoe the one with the drawn bow pitched into the water his arrow hissing harmlessly into the river quickly hamilton called join the others ramon and navarro loosed off a few more shots more for the sake of discouragement than with the intent of hitting anything then began to run thirty seconds later they rejoined the remainder of the party at the downstream end of the island all looking anxiously upriver hamilton was struggling unsuccessfully to bring his unwieldy trio of boats ashore it looked as if he would miss the tip of the island by feet only ramon and navarro handed over their rifles plunged into the river seized the bows of the motorlaunch and turned it into the shore there were no orders given no shouts for haste such were needless within seconds all the equipment and passengers were aboard the motorlaunch the boat pushed off and paddles distributed they cast frequent and apprehensive glances astern but there was no cause for concern the canoes unmistakably were dropping behind there was going to be no pursuit smith said not even grudgingly that was rather well managed hamilton and now first we bail out there should be three cooking pans floating around somewhere then we move out into the middle of the riverjust in case theyve sent some sharpshooters down the left bank theres going to be a full moon shortly the skies are cloudless so we might as well carry on kellner and hiller must be distinctly worried about us by this time tracy said why the two empty canoes i told you yesterday evening that there were falls about fifty miles below the town thats why we had to airlift the hovercraft beyond them the falls are about twenty miles farther on now well have to make a portage there and it would be impossible to make it with this elephant when we get there and have emptied her well give her a shove over the edge maybe shell survive the falls are only fifteen feet some little time later the now bailedout motorlaunch glided gently down the centre of the river six men at the paddles but not exerting themselves the current bore them along the newly risen moon gleamed softly on the brown water it was a peaceful scene five hours later as hamilton guided the launch into the left bank the passengers could distinctly hear the sound of the falls ahead no niagara roar but unmistakably falls they made the bank and tied up to a tree the portage was not more than a hundred yards first all the equipment food and personal luggage were carried down then the two canoes and just in case the motorlaunch should survive its fall the three cooking utensils for bailing as well hamilton and navarro climbed into a canoe and reached a spot where the white water ended about a hundred feet below the foot of the falls and paddled gently to maintain position both men were looking upriver towards the falls beyond which they knew ramon was at work for half a minute there was only the brownwhite smoothness of the rio da morte sliding vertically downwards then the bows of the motorlaunch came in sight appeared to hesitate until suddenly the entire boat was over and plunging down there was a loud smack and a considerable cloud of spray as the launch first entered the water then disappeared entirely all of ten seconds elapsed before it reappeared but reappear it did and remarkably right side up the launch so full of water that there were only about four inches of freeboard left drifted sluggishly downstream until hamilton got a line aboard with no little difficulty he and navarro towed it to the left bank and tied up bailing operations commenced the brightly illuminated hovercraft lay anchored in midriver navigation deck and cabin lights were on kellner and hiller were already close to despair because the expected arrivals were already fifteen hours late and it hardly seemed likely that if they hadnt arrived by that time that they would be arriving at all they had no cause for worry as far as they themselves were concerned they had only to continue downriver till they came to the junction with the araguaia and some form of civilisation both men were prepared to wait indefinitely and both for the same unexplained reason they had faith in hamiltons powers of survival and so kellner had his hovercraft lit up like a christmas tree he was taking no chances that the helicopter would bypass him in the darkness he and hiller both men with their machinepistols immediately and constantly ready to hand stood on the brief afterdeck between the fans ears always straining for the first faint intimation of the rackety clamour of the sikorsky but it was his eyes that gave kellner the answer he was waiting for not his ears he peered upriver peered more closely then switched on and trained the hovercrafts powerful searchlight a powerless but impassively manned motorlaunch and two canoes had just appeared in line ahead round a bend in the rio da morte chapter seven the hovercrafts cabin was luxuriously furnished although on a necessarily small scale the bar was splendidly if selectively equipped and at the moment well patronised most of the passengers from the wrecked helicopter gave the impression of having escaped from the jaws of death the atmosphere was relaxed almost convivial and the spirit of the departed heffner did not appear to hover over the company hamilton said to kellner any trouble during the night not really a couple of canoeloads of indians approached us just after midnight we turned the searchlight on them and they turned and headed back for shore no shooting none good now the big question tomorrow is the rapids that the indians call the hoehna rapids kellner said there are no rapids shown on the chart i daresay nevertheless theyre there never been through them myself although ive seen them from the air dont look anything special from up there but then nothing ever does much experience with rapids a fair bit kellner said nothing that a boat hasnt navigated though im told boats have made it through the hoehna so wheres the problem a hovercraft can navigate rapids that no boat made by man could ever hope to serrano said knowing you senor hamilton i thought you would have had us on our way by this time a clear night bright moon a beautiful night for sailing or is it flying in one of those machines we need a good nights rest all of us its going to be a hard day tomorrow the hoehna rapids are less than a hundred miles away how long to get there kellner three hours less if you want one does not navigate rapids by night and only a madman goes there in the hours of darkness because of the horena you see tracy said the horena another indian tribe yes like the chapate theyre not at all like the chapate the horena are the roman lions the chapate the christians the horena put the fear of living death into the chapate but you said the muscias ah the muscias are to the horena what the horena are to the chapate or so they say goodnight rapids ramon called out rapids ahead in the two and a half hours since the hovercrafts dawn departure the rio da morte though flowing at a rate of about fifteen knots had been almost glassily calm and although visibility had been poor because of fairly heavy rain no problems had been encountered but now conditions had dramatically altered at first indistinctly through the now sheeting rain but then suddenly frighteningly and all too vividly rocks could be seen some jagged some curved thrusting up from the river bed for as far as the eye could see hundreds of them spanned the entire width of the river with whiteveined seething water coursing down between them the hovercraft throttled back to a point where directional control could just be maintained was almost at once into this white and seething cauldron when kellner had said that he had some little experience of navigating rapids he had been doing himself less than justice as far as the untrained observer could see he was masterly he was positively dancing a jig at the controls he no longer had the throttle pulled back but kept altering it between half and full ahead which considering their speed might have seemed foolhardy but wasnt by doing this and by ignoring the air ducts and maintaining the cushion pressure as high as possible he could all the more easily avoid making violent course alterations which would have slewed the hovercraft broadside and into disaster instead he was deliberately aiming for and riding his hovercraft over the less fearsome rocks in his pat even here he had to be selective searching out the more rounded rocks and avoiding the jagged ones which at that speed would have ripped even the abnormally tough apron skirts leading to the collapse of the cushion and turning the hovercraft into a boat which would then have foundered in short order one moment he was jerking the pitch control back putting power on the left fan then if this proved insufficient applying right rudder to give him directional stability while only seconds later he had to reverse the procedure his task was made harder by the fact that even the highspeed windscreen wipers were capable only intermittently of clearing the spray and rain kellner said to hamilton who was seated beside him tell me again about all those boats that were supposed to navigate the hoehna i guess i must have been misinformed further back in the hovercraft noone spoke because all their energies were concentrated on hanging on to their seats the general effect of the motion was that of a rollercoasterexcept that this rollerboaster unlike the fairground type also shook violently from side to side up front kellner said do you see what i see some fifty yards ahead the river appeared to come to an abrupt end they were obviously approaching a waterfall of sorts unfortunately what are you going to do about it funny the hovercraft was being swept helplessly along to what was indeed a waterfall the drop in the river level must have been at least ten feet kellner was doing the only thing he could dotrying to keep the hovercraft on a perfectly straight course the hovercraft swept over the fall dipped sharply and plunged downwards at an angle of fortyfive degrees with an explosion of sound and spray the hovercraft momentarily disappeared save for the stern not only the bows but part of the front of the cabin had gone completely under and in that way and at that angle the hovercraft remained for several seconds before it slowly struggled to the surface again water cascading off its decks it settled deeper in the water the effect of partially losing its air cushion when the stern had come completely clear of the water the interior of the craft was a scene of appalling confusion the angle of fall and the stunning impact had catapulted everyone to the deck equipment which had been stored but not lashed aft was now scattered throughout the cabin to make matters worse a window had been smashed and hundreds of gallons of water were sloshing about the interior of the cabin one by one the passengers struggled upright they were bruised dazed and slightly concussed but there seemed to be no broken bones as the air cushion began to fill again and the water gurgled away through the selfdraining ports they could feel the hovercraft rise slowly to its normal position three times in the next few minutes the hovercraft went through a similar experience although none of the overfalls were as high as the first time at last the hovercraft passed into an area of smooth rockfree water but it was then that another danger manifested itself the forested banks gave way to what was at first low rock which quickly became higher and higher until they were passing through what was virtually a cliffsided canyon at the same time the river swiftly narrowed to about a third of its original width and the speed of the river and hence that of the hovercraft rapidly more than doubled hamilton and kellner stared through the windscreens glanced at each other then looked forward again ahead the steepsided river walls fell sharply away but this promised no surcease a quarter of a mile ahead a jumble of huge black rocks blocked the river from side to side bloouy charts kellner said indeed pity really these machines are very expensive make for the left any particular reason the horena live on the right bank left as the man says the rocks were about three hundred yards away they appeared to form an impenetrable barrier no two sufficiently far apart to afford passage to the hovercraft hamilton and kellner looked at each other simultaneously they shrugged hamilton turned and faced the rear hang on tight he said were about to stop very suddenly he had no sooner spoken than he realised that his warning had been unnecessary they had seen what was coming up they were already hanging on for dear life the rocks were now no more than a hundred yards distant kellner was guiding the craft towards the biggest gap between any two of them the first and the second from the left bank for one brief moment it seemed that the hovercraft might just have one chance of making the passage as kellner arrowed straight for the centre of the gap the crafts bows passed through but that was all the passage was at least eighteen inches narrower than the midships beam of the hovercraft with a grinding screeching tearing of metal the hovercraft came to an abrupt halt immovably jammed kellner went into reverse and applied maximum power nothing happened kellner eased off the fans but kept the engine running to maintain the cushion he straightened up muttering to himself now with an oceangoing tug ten minutes later there was a pile of rucksacks canvas bags and other improvised luggage containers on deck and hamilton was securing a rope around his waist he said its only twenty feet to that bank but the waters mighty fast so kindly dont let go of the end of that rope it was a danger but not the only one even as he finished speaking there came a sudden grunt and kellner collapsed to the deck a dart protruded from the back of his neck hamilton swung round on the far right bank less than fifty yards away stood a group of indians ten or twelve in all every man had a blowpipe to his mouth horena hamilton shouted down take cover behind the cabin inside the cabin ramon navarro almost immediately ramon and navarro all humanitarian principles forgotten at the sight of kellner were on the cabin roof stretched out on their elbows rifles in hand more darts struck the metal sheathing but none found a target in three seconds the twins fired six shots at five hundred yards either man was accurate at fifty yards they were deadly one after another in those few seconds three horena toppled into the river three others crumpled and died where they stood and the others melted away hamilton gazed down in bitterness at the lifeless kellner not for the horena the use of timbo the poisonous bark of a forest vine which merely stunned the dart which took kellner had been tipped with curare hamilton said if it werent for kellner wed all be dead and now kellner is dead without another word he jumped into the river the only danger here was the speed of the water neither alligators nor piranha ever inhabit rapids at first he was swept downstream and had to be hauled back on the second attempt he succeeded in reaching the bank he stood there some time regaining his breaththe buffeting had been severethen undid the rope around his waist and secured it to the bole of a tree another rope was thrown across to him this he passed round a branch and threw back to the hovercraft where in turn it was passed round a fan bracket and thrown back to hamilton forming in effect an endless pulley the first item of equipmenthamiltons own rucksackwas ferried across well clear of the water as was all the rest of the equipment the members of the party had to make it the wet way chapter eight sweatsoaked and stumbling mostly from near exhaustion the heavily laden party of nine made their painfully slow way through the afternoon gloom of the rainforest even at high noon there was never more than halflight in its depths the crowns of the great lianafestooned trees stretched out and intertwined a hundred feet or more above the ground effectively blocking out the sunlight progress was not slow because they had to hack their way with machetes through the dense undergrowth because of dense undergrowth there was none for plants to grow at groundlevel sunshine is essential jungle in the true african sense of the term did not exist the progress was slow primarily because there was as much swampland as there was firm ground and quicksands were an everpresent peril a man could step confidently on to what appeared to be an inviting stretch of greensward and on his second step find himself shoulder deep in a swamp for safe locomotion inthe forest a probe in the form of a hackedoff and trimmed branch was essential for every mile covered as the crow flew it was not uncommon to have to traverse five miles that and the time it took to locate patches of firm ground made for timeconsuming frustrating and exhausting travel smith in particular was making heavy weather of it his clothes were so saturated with sweat that he might well have just been dragged from the river his legs had gone rubbery and he was gasping for breath smith said what the hell are you trying to prove hamilton how tough you are and how out of condition we city dwellers are gods sake man a break an hour wouldnt kill us would it no but the horena might but you said their territory was on the right bank thats what i believe but dont forget we killed six of their men great lads for revenge the horena i wouldnt put it past them to have crossed the river and be following us there could be a hundred of them within a hundred yards of here just waiting to get within blowpipe range and we wouldnt know a thing about it until too late smith it appeared was possessed of reserves of strength and endurance of which he had been unaware he hurried on towards evening they reached a small and largely swampy clearing most of the party were now shambling not walking enough hamilton said well make camp with the approach of dusk the forest appeared to come alive all around them was sound mainly it carme from birdsparrots macaws parakeets but there was animal life too monkeys screeched bullfrogs barked and now and again the deeply muffled roar of a jaguar came at them from the depths of the forest everywhere there were creepers vines parasitic orchids and there in the clearing exotic flowers of almost every conceivable colour the air was damp and fetid a miasmic smell allprevalent the heat overpowering and leaden and enervating the floor underfoot almost an unbroken expanse of thick clinging evilsmelling mud everyone even hamilton sank gratefully to what few patches of dry ground they could find over the river not much higher than the treetops several birds with huge wingspreads seemed suspended against the sky for their wings were motionless they looked evil sinister maria said what are those horriblelooking creatures urubus hamilton said amazonian vultures they seem to be looking for something maria shuddered everybody gazed unhappily at the vultures a poor choice i suppose hamilton said the cookingpots headhunters orthe vultures and speaking of cookingpots some fresh meat might help curassowa kind of wild turkey armadillo wild boar all very tasty navarro ramon said iil come too you stay ramon a little more thoughtfumess please someone has to look after these poor souls tracy said to keep an eye on us you mean i dont see what mischief you can get up to here your haversack i dont understand tracy said deliberately heffner appeared to find something there just before you murdered him ramon said before mr heffner met hisunfortunate end is what mr tracy means hamilton eyed tracy thoughtfully then turned away into the forest navarro following less than two hundred yards from the camp hamilton put a restraining hand on navarros arm and pointed ahead not forty yards away was a quiexada that most savage of all the worlds wild boars they are so devoid of fear that they have been known to invade towns in herds driving the citizens into their houses supper hamilton said navarro nodded arid raised his rifle one single shot was all that navarro would ever need they began to make their way towards the dead animal then halted abruptly a herd of perhaps three dozen quiexada had suddenly appeared from the forest they halted pawed the ground then came on again there was no mistaking their intention only on the riversides do amazonian trees have breaches for only there can they get sunlight hamilton and navarro reached the lowermost branches of the nearest tree a short distance ahead of the boars which proceeded to encircle the tree and then as if in response to some unseen signal began to use their vicious tusks to savage the roots of the tree the roots of the amazonian trees like those of the giant sequoia of california are extremely longand extremely shallow i would say they have done this sort of thing before navarro said how long is this going to take do you think not long at all hamilton sighted his pistol and shot a quiexada that seemed to be more industrious than its companions the dead animal toppled into the river within seconds the smooth surface of the river was disturbed by a myriad ripples and there came the highpitched spinechilling buzzing whine as the needle teeth of the voracious piranha proceeded to strip the quiexada to the bone navarro cleared his throat and said perhaps you should have shot one not quite so close to the river hamilton said quiexada to one side piranha to the other you dont by any chance see a constrictor lurking in the branches above involuntarily navarro glanced upwards then down at the boars which had redoubled their efforts both men started firing and within seconds a dozen quiexada lay dead navarro said next time i go boarhunting if there is a next timei shall bring a submachinegun with me my magazine is empty mine too the sight of their dead companions seemed only to increase the blood lust of the boars they tore at the roots with savage frenzy and already several of the roots had been severed navarro said senor hamilton either im shaking or this tree is becoming ratherwhat is the word for it wobbly wobbly i dont think i know a rifle shot rang out and a boar dropped dead hamilton and navarro swung round to look back the way they had come ramon who seemed to be carrying a pack of some sort on his back was less than forty yards away and was prudently standing by a lowbranched tree he fired steadily and with deadly accuracy suddenly an empty click was heard hamilton and navarro looked at each other thoughtfully but ramon remained unperturbed he reached into his pocket extracted another magazine clip fitted it and resumed firing three more shots and it finally dawned on the quiexada that they were on to a hiding to nothing those that remained turned and ran off into the forest the three men walked back towards the camp dragging a quiexada behind them ramon said i heard the shooting so i came of course i brought plenty of spare ammunition with me deadpan he patted a bulging pocket then shrugged apologetically all my fault i should never have let you go alone one has to be a man of the forest oh shut up hamilton said thoughtful of you to bring my rucksack along with you ramon said pontifically one should not expose the weakminded to temptation do be quiet navarro said he turned to hamilton god only knows he was insufferable enough before but now after this the cooking fire burned in the near darkness and boar steaks sizzled in a glowing bed of coals smith said i appreciate the necessity for all the shots but if the horena are aroundwell that must have attracted the attention of everyone within miles no worry hamilton said no horena will ever attack at night if he dies at night his soul will wander for ever in the hereafter his gods must see him die he prodded a steak with his sheath knife i would say those are just about ready ready or not the steaks were dispatched with every sign of gusto and when they were finished hamilton said better if it had hung a week but tasty tasty bed we leave at dawn ill keep the first watch they prepared for sleep some lying on waterproof sheets others in lightweight hammocks slung between trees at the edge of the clearing hamilton flung some fuel on the fire and kept on flinging it until it flared up so brightly that the flames were almost ten feet high machete in hand hamilton departed to obtain some more fuel and returned with an armful of branches most of which he cast on the already blazing fire smith said well granted granted you know how to make bonfires but whats it all in aid of safety measures keeps the creepyerawlies at bay wild animals fear fire he was to be proved half right half wrong he was on his third fuelhunting trip and was returning to camp when he heard the piercing scream of fear he dropped the fuel and ran into the brightly lit clearing he knew the highpitched scream could only have come from maria and as he closed on her hammock the reason for her terror was obvious a giant anaconda at least thirty feet in length and with its tail still anchored to one of the trees that supported marias hammock had one of its deadly coils wrapped round the base of her hammock she was in no way pinned down just too paralysed with fear to move the anacondas vast jaws were agape it was not hamiltons first anaconda and he had a nodding respect for them but no more a fullgrown specimen can swallow a opound prey in its entirety but while they could be endlessly patient even cunning in waiting for their next meal to come along they were extremely slowwitted in action while maria continued to scream in the same mindless terror he approached within feet of the fearsome head no more than any other creature on earth could an anaconda withstand three luger bullets in the head it died immediately but even in its death the coil slipped over the girls ankles and continued to contract hamilton struggled to pull the slimy coil free but was brushed aside by ramon who carefully placed two rifle bullets into the upper centre of the coil severing the main spinal nerve the anaconda at once went limp hamilton carried her across to his groundsheet close by the fire she was in a state of mild shock keep a shocked patient warm hamilton had often heard and the thought had no sooner occurred to him than ramon knelt alongside a sleepingbag in his hands together they eased the girl inside zipped up the bag and sat to wait navarro came to join them and jerked a thumb in the direction of an apparently sleeping smith observe our gallant hero he said asleep hes wide awake has been all the time i watched him ramon said complainingly you might have come and watched us when you and senor hamilton cant take care of a simpleminded reptile like that its time for us all to retire i saw his face and he was terrified seemed quite unable to move not i am sure that he wanted to move or had any intention of moving has the girl been hurt not physically hamilton said im afraid this is basically my fault i had a big fire going to frighten off wild animals well anacondas are also wild creatures and as frightened of fire as any other this one just wanted out it was the devils bad luck that it was roosting in the tree that helped support marias hammock im pretty sure she would have come to no harm the reptile was simply easing its way down the tree apart from the fact that its belly is swollen and obviously would not be requiring another meal for a fortnight it probably had a much greater matter on its mind such as getting the hell out of here all very unfortunate but no harm done perhaps ramon said i hope you hope hamilton said trauma ramon said how deep does a trauma lie this has been a traumatic experience but i think thats only a side issue i have the feeling that her whole life has been a traumatic experience you plunging into the deep waters of psychology psychiatry or whathaveyou ramon hamilton didnt smile as he spoke i agree with ramon navarro said twins you know he added apologetically something is wrong or not what it appears to be her actions her behaviour the way she talks and smilesi find it hard to believe that this is a bad person a common whore smith we know is a bad person she doesnt care for him any fool can see that so what goes on well hamilton said judicially hes got a lot to offer ignore senor hamilton ramon said hes just trying to provoke us navarro nodded in agreement then said i think she is a prisoner in some way or another possibly hamilton said possibly has it occurred to either of you that he might be in some way her prisoner without ever knowing it navarro looked at ramon then accusingly at hamilton there you go again senor hamilton you know something that we dont know and youre not telling us i know nothing that you dont know and far be it from me to suggest that i look more closely and perhaps think a little more deeply but then you are young young navarro was indignant neither of us senor hamilton will ever see thirty again thats what i meant he put his fingers to his lips beside him maria was stirring she opened her eyes still huge with fear and horror hamilton touched her gently on the shoulder its all right now he said gently its all over that horrible ghastly head her voice was no more than a husky whisper and she was shaking ramon rose and walked away that awful snake the snake is dead hamilton said and you are unharmed we promise you no harm will come to you she lay there breathing shallowly her eyes closed she opened them again when ramon returned and knelt by her side he had an aluminium cup in one hand a bottle in the other hamilton said and what do we have here the finest cognac ramon replied as is only to be expected smiths private supplies i dont like brandy she said ramon is right youd better like it you need it ramon poured a generous measure she tasted it coughed screwed her eyes shut and emptied the cup in two gulps good girl hamilton said awful she said she looked at ramon but thank you i feel better already she glanced across the clearing and fear touched her eyes again that hammock youre not going back to that hammock hamilton said its safe enough now of course it was just sheer bad luck that the anaconda was up the tree when your hammock was slung but we can understand your not wanting to go back there youre in ramons sleepingbag and on a groundsheet youll stay just where you are well keep a big fire going all night and one of the three of us will keep an eye on you till the morning come the dawn i promise you not even a mosquito will have come near you slowly she looked at the three men in turn then said huskily you are all very kind to me she tried to smile but it was only a try damsel in distress is that it perhaps theres a little bit more to it than that hamilton said but nows not the time to talk about it just you try to sleepim sure ramon will give you a nightcap to help you on your way oh hell smith who obviously felt that he had maintained his distance long enough was approaching his whole attitude manifesting his resentment of marias close proximity to the three men as he dropped to his knees beside her hamilton rose looked at him turned and walked away the twins following ramon said senor hamiltonquiexada piranha anaconda a sick girl and a villain to pick so divine a resting spot in such unique company is a gift not given to many hamilton just looked at him and moved off into the forest to retrieve his load of firewood early in the morning hamilton led the others in single file through the rainforest and across firm ground firm because the terrain was gently rising and the water table was now well below them after about two hours walking hamilton stopped and waited until the others gathered round him from here on hamilton said no talking not one word and watch where you put your feet i dont want to hear as much as the crackle of a broken twig understood he looked at maria who looked pale and exhausted not so much from the rigours of the walk for there had been none but because she had not slept at all the previous nights experience as ramon had said had been something more than traumatic its not much further half an hour at most then well have a rest and carry on during the afternoon im all right she said its just that im beginning to hate this rainforest i suppose youll be telling me again that noone asked me to come a snake on every tree is that it she nodded no more worry hamilton said youll never again spend a night in the forest thats another promise tracy said slowly i take it that that can mean only one thing i take it that well be in the lost city tonight if things go as i hope yes you know where you are yes youve known ever since we left the hovercraft true how did you know because you havent used your compass since half an hour later exactly as he had forecast hamilton finger to his lips stopped and waited for the others to come up to him when he spoke it was in a whisper on your lives not a sound stay hidden until i tell you otherwise on your hands and knees then lie prone until i give the word and so on hands and knees they advanced in total silence hamilton dropped forward and eased himself slowly ahead using elbows and toes he stopped again and waited until the others had joined him he pointed forward through the trees irr a lush green valley below them they could see an indian village there were dozens of large huts and in the centre a very large communal hut which looked as if it could accommodate at least two hundred people with ease the place seemed to be deserted until suddenly a small coppercoloured child appeared carrying a flint axe and a nut which he placed on a flat stone and proceeded to belabour it was like a scene from the stone age from the dawn of prehistory a laughing woman statuesque and also coppercoloured emerged from the same hut and picked up the child in slow wonderment tracy said that colour that appearance those arent indians keep your voice down hamilton said urgently theyre indians all right but they do not come from the amazon basin they come from the pacific tracy stared at him still in wonderment and shook his head suddenly people scores of them began to emerge from the communal hut that they were not amazonian indians was obvious from the fact that there were as many women as men among them normally in the amazonian basin women are banned from the meeting places of elders and warriors all were of the same copper colour all possessed of a proud almost regal bearing they began to disperse towards their huts smith touched hamilton on the arm and said in a low voice who are those people the muscias smith turned pale goddamned muscias he said in a vicious whisper what the hell are you playing at headhunters you said headshrinkers cannibals im off off where you clown youve got no place left to run to stay here dont dont dont show yourselves the advice was probably superfluous noone clearly had the slightest intention of showing himself hamilton rose and walked confidently into the clearing he had gone at least ten paces before he was noticed there was a sudden silence the babble of voices ceased then the chatter redoubled in volume an exceptionally tall indian old and with his forearms almost covered in what were unquestionably gold bracelets gazed for some seconds then ran forward he and hamilton embraced each other the old man who was surely the chief and hamilton engaged in an animated if incomprehensible conversation the chief with an expression of incredulity on his face repeatedly shook his head just as firmly hamilton nodded his suddenly hamilton extended his right arm and made a semicircular motion bringing his arm to a sudden halt the chief looked long at him seized him by the arms smiled and nodded his head he turned and spoke rapidly to his people tracy said id say those two people have met somewhere before the chief finished addressing his people all of whom had now gathered in the clearing and spoke again to hamilton who nodded and turned hamilton shouted to his waiting companions you can come now keep your hands well away from any weapon not quite dazedly but not understanding what was happening the other eight members of the party entered the clearing hamilton said this is chief corumba he introduced each of the eight in turn the chief gravely acknowledged each introduction shaking each in turn by hand hiller said but indians dont shake hands this indian does maria touched hamilton on the arm but those savage headhunters these are the kindliest most gentle most peaceable people on earth in their language they do not have a word for war because they do not know what war is they are a lost children from a lost age and the people who built the lost city serrano said and i thought i knew more about the tribes of the mato grosso than any man alive and so you may serrano so you may if that is to say i can take the word of colonel diaz colonel diaz smith said he was clearly floundering in deep water whos colonel diaz a friend of mine tracy said but their ferocious reputation a fiction invented by dr hannibal huston the man who found these lost people he thought that such a reputation might ensure themwhat shall we saya little privacy huston hiller said huston you you found huston years ago but youve only been in the mato grosso for four months i have known it for many years remember in the hotel de paris in romono you mentioned my search for the golden people i forgot to mention that i also met them years ago here they are the children of the sun maria said and dr huston is still in the lost city hes still there come i believe these good people want to offer us some hospitality first however i owe you a small explanation about them high time too smith said why all the dramatic stealthy approach to them because if we had approached as a group they would have run away they have every good reason to fear those from the outside world we ironically known as the civilizados in practically everything that matters theyre a damned sight more civilised than we arebring them socalledprogress which harms them socalled change which harms them socalled civilisation which harms them even more and disease which kills them these people have no natural resistance to measles or influenza either of those are to them what bubonic plague was to europeans and asiatics in the middle ages half a tribe can be wiped out in a fortnight the same thing happened to the people of tierra del fuego wellmeaning missionaries gave them simple clothes primarily so that the women could cover their nakedness the blankets came from a hospital where there had been a measles epidemic most of the people were wiped out tracy said but our presence here surely that endangers them no almost half the muscias were destroyed by measles or influenza or a combination of both these people here are the survivors having acquired natural immunity the hard way as i said it was dr huston who found them although mainly famous as an explorer his real lifes work lay elsewhere he was one of the original sertanistasmen wise in jungle waysand a founder member of the funai the national foundation for the indian people who dedicate their lives to protecting the indians and rendering them harmless to civilizados pacification is the term generally used but in truth what they mainly required was protection against the civilizados sure many of the tribes were genuinely savagewell not so many there are less than two hundred thousand pureblood indians leftbut their savagery sprang from fear and very understandably so even in modern times those civilised gentlemen from the outer world and by no means all brazilians either have machinegunned them dynamited them from the air and given them poisoned food this is all news to me smith said and ive lived in this country for many years frankly i find it very hard to believe serrano will confirm it i confirm it i take it that you too are a sertanista yes not always a very happy job we have our failures the chapate and the horena as youve seen are not too keen on the idea of cooperation with the outside world and inevitably we bring disease as we did here come along chief corumba is summoning us to eat it may taste a little odd but i can assure you that no harm will come to any of you one hour later the visitors were still seated around a rough wooden table outside the communal hut before them lay the remains of an excellent if rather exotic mealgame fish fruit and other unknown delicacies concerning the nature of which it had been thought more prudent not to ask all had been washed down with cachassa a rather potent brew at the end hamilton thanked chief corumba on behalf of all of them and turned to the others i think its time we were on our way tracy said one thing intrigues me ive never seen so many gold ornaments in my life i thought that might intrigue you where do these people come from they dont know themselves a lost people who have lost everything and that includes their history it was dr hustons theory that they are the descendants of the quimbaya an ancient tribe from the cauca or magdalena valleys in the western andes of colombia smith stared at him so what in gods name are they doing here nobody knows huston thinks they left their homeland all those hundreds of years ago he thinks they may have fled to the east found the headwaters of the amazon come all the way down until they reached the rio tocantis turned up that until they came to the araguaia then up the rio da morte again who knows stranger migrations have happened it could have taken them generations they were weighed down with many possessions i believe it wait till you see the lost city and youll understand why i do believe it smith said how far away is this damned city five hours six five hours and easy going uphill but no swamps no quicksands he turned to chief corumba who smiled and again warmly embraced hamilton wishing us good luck smith said among quite a few other things ill have a longer chat with him tomorrow tomorrow why ever not smith tracy and hiller exchanged flickering glances none of the three said anything just before they walked away hamilton spokequietly to maria stay behind with these people they will look after you i promise where were going is no place for a lady im coming suit yourself theres an excellent chance youll be dead by nightfall you dont much care for me do you enough to ask you to stay behind in the late afternoon hamilton and his party were still making their way towards the lost city the going underfoot was excellent dry leafy and springy unfortunately for people like smith the incline was fairly severe and the heat was of course as always oppressive hamilton said i think well have a halfhour break here were ahead of timewe cant move in until its dark besides some of you may think youve earned a rest too bloody right we have smith said how much longer do you intend to crucify us he sank wearily to the ground and mopped his streaming face with a bandana he was not the only one co do so with the exception of hamilton and the twins everyone seemed to be suffering from a shortage of breath and leaden aching legs hamilton had indeed been setting a brisk pace youve done very well all of you hamilton said mind you you might have done even better if you hadnt guzzled and drunk like pigs down in the village weve climbed almost two thousand feet since leaving there smith said howmuchlonger from here to the top another half hour no more im afraid well have to do a bit more climbing after thatdownhill mind you but a pretty steep downhill half an hour smith said nothing wait until you start going down the last lap hamilton said we are ten yards from the brink of a ravine anyone who hasnt a head for heights had better say so now if anyone didnt have a head for heights he or she wasnt saying so hamilton began to crawl forward the rest followed hamilton stopped and motioned to the others to join him hamilton said you see what i see smith said jesus maria said the lost city tracy said shangrila el dorado hamilton said what smith said what was that nothing really there never was an el dorado it means the golden man new inca rulers were covered in gold dust and dippedonly temporarily of coursein a lake you see that peculiar stepped pyramid with the flat top at the far end the question was really unnecessary it was the dominant feature of the lost city thats one of the reasonsthere are two others why huston thought that the children of the sun came from colombia its what you call a ziggurat originally it was a templetower in babylonia or assyria no traces of those remain in the old worldthe egyptians built a quite different form of pyramid tracy said as if not knowing this is the only one by no means youll find wellpreserved examples in mexico guatemala bolivia and peru but only in central america and the northwest of south america but nowhere else in the worldexcept here serrano said so theyre andean you couldnt ask for better proof you couldnt but i have it complete proof total ill show you later he pointed with outstretched arm you see those steps stretching from the river to the top of the plateau and hewn from the vertical rockface the stone stairway terrifying to look at even from a distance angled upwards at two hundred and fortyeight steps hamilton said each thirty inches wide worn smooth and slipperyand no hand rail tracy said who counted them i did you mean yes wouldnt do it again though there had been a hand rail once and id brought along equipment to rig a rope rail its still on the hovercraft for obvious reasons mr hamilton silver spoke in an urgent whisper mr hamilton whats the excitement about i saw someone moving in the ruins down there i swear to it the pilots eagleeye eh no need to swear to anything there are quite a number of people down there why do you think i didnt fly in by helicopter serrano said they are not friends no no he turned to smith speaking of helicopters i dont have to explain the layout of this place to you you know it already i dont understand that film cassette you had hiller steal for you i dont know what i took them a year ago i left hiller no option but to steal them taken from a helicopter not bad for an amateur were they smith didnt say whether they were or not he hiller and tracy had again momentarily assumed very odd expressions mainly of deep unease hamilton said look to your left there just where the river forks to go round the island at a distance of about half a mile and about three hundred feet below their present elevation a spidery sagging and apparently twisted series of ropes spanned the gorge between the top of the plateau and a point about halfway up the top of the cliff on which they were lying immediately below the cliff anchorage a small waterfall arced out into the river a rope bridge hamilton said well a liana bridge or a straw bridge those are normally renewed once a year this one cant have been renewed for at least five years must be in a pretty rotten state by this time so smith said the apprehension in his voice was unmistakable so thats the way we go in the silence that followed was long and profound at last serrano said another proof of andean ancestry no i mean there are no rope bridges in the mato grossowell theres not one now nor as far as i know anywhere in brazil the indians never learnt how to make them why should they have donethey never needed them but the incas and their descendants knew how to make themliving in the andes they had to know ive seen one hamilton said on the apurimac river high up in peru about twelve thousand feet they use six heavy braided straw cables for the main supports four for the footpaths two for the hand rails smaller ropes for closing in the sides and a bed of twigs spread over the footpath so that only a threeyearold could possibly fall through can support scores of people when new im afraid this one is not new a narrow cleft ran down the cliff at an angle of close on a small stream probably fed from some spring above fell rather than flowed down this cleft leaping whitely from spur to spur on one side of this cleft a series of rough steps had been cut obviously a very long time ago hamilton and the others started to descend it was a fairly arduous descent but not really either difficult or dangerous as hamilton had taken the precaution of binding together a series of tough lianas anchoring one end to a tree and letting the rest fall down the cleft at the foot of the cleft just above where the waterfall arced out above the river a platform about eight feet by eight had been quarried out of the cliffface hamilton was already standing there one by one he was joined by the others hamilton moved to examine a stone bollard and an iron post that had been hammered into the platform three now threadbare lianas were attached to both hamilton produced his sheath knife and scraped at the iron post thick brown flakes were shaved away keep your voices down hamilton said rusty isnt it he turned away to look over the gorge the others did the same the straw bridge was very flimsy and clearly venerable both the hand supports and the footpath were severely frayed several of the straw ropes appeared to have rotted and fallen away hamilton said not in the best condition wouldnt you say smith his eyes wide was obviously appalled good god in heaven thats suicide only a madman would go on it do you expect me to risk my life on that of course not why on earth should you youre only here for the story for the pictures youd be crazy to risk your life just for that tell you what give me your camera and ill take the pictures for you and dont forgetthe people over there may not be welcoming trespassers smith was silent for some time then said im a man who sees things through to the end maybe the end is closer than you think its dark enough now im going first navarro said senor hamilton am much lighter thank you but thats just the point im a heavy man and im carrying a heavy pack if it takes my weight well you should all be okay ramon said a thought occurs to me and to me he moved towards the straw bridge what was that meant to mean maria said he thinks perhaps that they will have a welcome mat out over there oh a guard hamilton moved steadily across the straw bridge that is he made steady progress the bridge itself was shockingly unsteady swaying from side to side hamilton was now more than halfway across the bridge sagged so badly in the middle that he had to haul himself up a fairly steep incline but he was experiencing no great difficulty he arrived safely on a platform similar to the one he had left on the other side of the gorge he crouched low for the platform was only a few feet lower than the plateau cautiously he lifted his head there was indeed a guard but he was not taking his duties too seriously he was smoking a cigarette and of all things relaxing in a deck chair hamiltons bent arm was raised to shoulder level his handkerchiefwrapped hand held the blade of his heavy sheath knife the guard drew deeply on his cigarette clearly illuminating his face he made no sound as the haft of the knife struck him between the eyes just tipped to one side and fell out of his chair hamilton turned and flashed his torch three times within minutes he was joined one by one by eight people who had not enjoyed their passage across the rope bridge hamilton said lets go and see the boss man he could find his way blindfolded and led them silently through the ancient ruins shortly he stopped and pointed there was a large and fairly new wooden hall with lights showing the sound of voices carried barracks hamilton said mess hall and sleeping accommodation guards tracy said guards why guilty conscience somewhere whats that noise smith said generator where do we go from here there hamilton pointed again at the foot of the giant ziggurat was another but much smaller wooden building lights also shone from that building thats where the guilty conscience lives hamilton was silent for a few moments the man j who every night feels dead feet trampling over his grave silver said mr hamilton nothing nothing ramon navarro i wonder if you see what i see yes indeed ramon said there are two men standing in the shadow of that porch hamilton seemed to ponder for a few moments i wonder what they could be doing there well go and ask them ramon and navarro melted into the shadows smith said who are these two your assistants i mean they are not brazilian no european yes ramon and navarro returned as silently and unobtrusively as they had left well hamilton said what did they say not a great deal navarro said i think they may tell us when they wake up chapter nine inside the smaller wooden house was a large diningcumlivingroom the walls were much behung with flags banners portraits swords rapiers guns and pictures all german behind a table a large rather redfaced heavily jowled man was eating a solitary meal to be washed down by beer from a pewter litre mug beside him he looked up in amazement as the door crashed open hamilton pistol in hand entered he was followed by smith then the others guten abend hamilton said ive brought an old friend along to see you he nodded towards smith i think old friends should smile and shake hands and say hallo dont you you dont hamiltons pistol fired gouging a hole in the seated mans desk nervous hands hamilton said ramon ramon went behind the desk and removed a gun from an already halfopened drawer try the other drawer hamilton said ramon did so and came up with a second gun cant really blame you hamilton said there are thieves and robbers everywhere these days well embarrassing silences bother me let me introduce you to each other behind the desk majorgeneral wolfgang von manteuffel of the ss variously known as brown or jones beside me colonel heinrich spaatz also known as smith also of the ss inspector general and assistant inspector general of the north and central polish concentration and extermination camps thieves on a colossal scale murderers of old men in holy orders and despoilers of monasteries remember thats where you last metin that grecian monastery where you cremated the monks but then you were specialists in cremation werent you they werent saying whether they were or not the stillness in the room was total all eyes were on hamilton with the exception of those of von manteuffel and spaatz they had eyes only for each other sad hamilton said very sad spaatz came all this long way to see you von manteuffel admittedly he came to kill you but he did come something i believe to do with a rainy night in the wilhelmshaven docks there came the sharp crack of a smallbore automatic hamilton looked at tracy who gun loose in an already nerveless hand was sinking to the floor and from the state of his head it was clear he would never rise again maria had a gun in her hand and was very pale hamilton said my gun is on you she put her automatic back in her bush jacket pocket he was going to kill you he was ramon said hamilton looked at her in bafflement he was going to kill me so you killed him i was waiting for it navarro said thoughtfully i do believe the young lady is not all that we thought she was so it would seem hamilton was equally thoughtful he said to her whose side are you on yours spaatz at last looked away from von manteuffel and stared at her in total incredulity she went on quietly it is sometimes quite difficult to tell a jewish girl from other girls hamilton said israeli yes intelligence yes ah would you like to shoot spaatz too they want him back in tel aviv failing that yes my apologies and without any reservations youre becoming quite unpopular spaatz but not yet in von manteuffels class the israelis want him for obvious reasons the greekshe nodded to ramon and navarro in turnthose two gentlemen are greek army intelligence officerswant you for equally obvious reasons he looked at hiller they supplied me with those gold coins by the way he turned back to von manteuffel the brazilian government want you for dispossessing the muscia tribe and for the killing of many of them and i want you for the murder of dr hannibal huston and his daughter lucy von manteuffel smiled and spoke for the first time im afraid you all want a great deal and im afraid youre not going to get it there came a loud crashing of glass and simultaneously the barrels of three submachineguns protruded through three smashed windows von manteuffel smiled contentedly any person found with a gun on him will be shot out of hand do i have to tell you what to do next he didnt all guns were dropped on the floor including two that hamilton had not known that spaatz and hiller were carrying so von manteuffel nodded in satisfaction so much better than a blood bath dont you think simpletons how do you think i have survived for so long by taking endless precautions such as this little press button my right foot rests on he broke off as four armed men entered and watched them in silence as they searched the captives for further weapons predictably they found none and the rucksacks von manteuffel said again the search failed to turn up any weapon von manteuffel said i would have a word with my old friend heinrich who would appear to have come a very long way for nothing ah and this man he indicated hiller i gather hes an accomplice of my dear excomrade in arms the rest take them and their pestilential luggage i across to the old grain store perhaps i shall be subjecting them to some intensive and i fear verypainful questioning on the other hand perhaps not i shall decide after ive had my chat with heinrich chapter ten the old grain store was built entirely of beautifully cut and fitted stone without any mortar whatsoever it was about twenty feet by twelve and had three storage bins on either side the sides and the partitions of the bins were made of heavy adzecut wood a single weak and naked electric lamp suspended from the ceiling burned in the centre of the store there were no windows and only one dooropening without a door which the presence outside of a man with a cocked machine carbine made superfluous anyway there were no furnishings of any description hamilton and his fellow captives had nothing to do but to look at each other or at the sentry who faced them his elderly but no doubt still lethal schmeisser levelled directly at them he had about him the look of a man who was yearning for an excuse to use it navarro finally broke the silence i fear for the health of our mr smith hiller too come to that never mind about their damned health hamilton said start fearing for your own when hes finished with those two who do you think is next on his list whether or not he indulges in a little torture beforehand he sighed trust old trusty secret agent hamilton to tell all von manteuffel knows who i am who maria is and who you two socalled greek intelligence officers are he cant let us live and im afraid he cant let silver or serrano live citherobviously speaking of serrano ramon said could i have a word with you go ahead in private if you please if thats what you want the two men moved to a corner of the room where ramon spoke in a low rapid tone hamilton lifted his eyebrows and his face registered surprise an emotion he had practically never betrayed then he shrugged his shoulders nodded twice turned thoughtfully away and looked at the sentry big man hamilton said my size black from head to toeberet jacket trousers shoes i want those clothes more importantly i want that gun even more importantly still i want them both fast easy ramon said just ask him hamilton didnt reply savagely almost and to the accompaniment of the indrawn hiss of marias breath he bit the ball of his left thumb at once the blood began to flow he squeezed the torn flesh until the blood flowed even more freely then smeared it over ramons uncomprehending face all in the interest of art hamilton told him brother what a fight this is going to be the fight started in the corner of the store just out of the sentrys line of sight the sentry would have been less than human not to locate the source of the sound of the heavy blows the shouting and swearing he moved forward into the doorway hamilton and ramon were belabouring each other mightily fighting in apparently vicious fury kicking and punching and obviously intent on inflicting grievous and mutual bodily harm the sentry was clearly startled but not suspicious he had a heavily brutalised face behind which there lurked no great intelligence stop that he shouted you madmen stop it or he broke off as one of the combatants received a seemingly murderous blow and came staggering to fall flat on his back half in and half out of the doorway eyes turned up in his head the face masked with blood the sentry stepped by him ready to quell any further signs of trouble ramons hands closed round his ankles four men prepared to carry three blanketcovered stretchered forms from von manteuffels room von manteuffel said it can be fatal to allow an enemy to live longer than is necessary he paused briefly for thought over the side with them think of all those poor starving piranha as for our other friends in the grain store i dont think they can supply me with any more useful information you know what to do yes herr general one of the men said we know what to do his face was wolfish in anticipation von manteuffel glanced at his watch i will expect you back in exactly five minutes after youve given the piranha their second course a figure dressed all in black faced the grain store with a levelled schmeisser in his hands he heard the sound of footsteps some way off and glanced quickly over his shoulder four men the four who had disposed of spaatz and hiller were about thirty yards away their machine carbines were shoulder slung the dark figure continued to gaze at the door of the grain store waited until his ears told him that the approaching group were no more than five yards away then swung round with his schmeisser blazing maria said in a subdued tone you play for keeps dont you you didnt have to kill them true true but then i didnt want them to kill me you dont play footsy with cornered rats those are desperate men and you can bet that each one is a trained efficient and practiced killer i dont much feel like apologising and no need said ramon who like his brother had remained unmoved by the proceedings the only good nazi is one who has stopped breathing so five guns what do we do we stay here because here were safe von manteuffel may have thirty forty men maybe even more out in the open wed be massacred he glanced down at the stirring figure of the sentry ah junior is coming to i think well send him for a little walk so that he can apprise his boss that theres been a slight change in the status quo remove his uniform should give von manteuffel quite a turn von manteuffel was making some notes at his desk when the knock came on the door he glanced at his watch and smiled in satisfaction exactly five minutes had elapsed since his four men had departed just over two minutes since he had heard the burst of machinegun fire which could only have signalled the end of the six captives he called out permission to enter made a final note said you are very punctual and looked up his expression of surprise vanished and his eyes opened almost impossibly widely the stumbling figure before him was clad only in his underclothes the store was deep in shadow the single lamp had been switched off and what little light there was came from a newly risen moon fifteen minutes and nothing navarro said is that good its inevitable i suppose hamilton said were in darkness von manteuffels men are exposed or would be if they showed themselves and they dont dare show themselves what can they do smoke us out if the wind is right but no wind so no smoke ramon said starve us out we should live that long the time crawled by apart from navarro who stood by the doorway everyone was lying down they may or may not have been trying to sleep for some had their eyes shut but were unquestionably wide awake navarro said two hours thats two hours gone now still nothing would you mind watchman im trying to sleep hamilton sat up dont think i will sleep they may be up to something ive no cigarettes anybody no serrano proffered a packet i thought you were asleep thanks you know i wasnt quite sure whether or not to believe what you told me but i believe you now if for no other reason than the fact that it has to be as you say so i guess i owe you an apology he paused reflectively apologising seems to have become a habit with me ramon said curiously may we know what the present apology is about of course serrano is government on the needtoknow principle i suppose colonel diaz kind of forgot to tell me government ministry of culture fine arts god help us all ramon said i would have thought there were enough genuine vultures in those godforsaken parts without adding culture vultures to the list what on earth are you doing here serrano thats what i hope to find out forthcoming arent we senor hamilton i told you i only learnt of this a couple of hours ago ramon looked at him reproachfully senor hamilton youre at it again at what being enigmatic and evasive hamilton shrugged and said nothing serrano said an honest doubt doesnt require an apology theres a little more to it than that hamilton said i thought you were hillers man back in romono that is when i first met you im afraid im the person who clobbered you ill give you back the money i took from your wallet theres not much i can do about your stiff neck forgive me forgive forgive maria said i dont suppose anyone is going to forgive me there was a brief silence then hamilton said mildly enough i have apologised apologies and forgiveness are not the same thing and youre clearly of the opinion that my i association thats the nicest way i can put it was unforgivable it all depends upon who is doing the judging and casting the first stones all four of my grandparents died in auschwitz and the chances are high that it was von manteuffel or spaatz who sent them there or both i suppose the world is tired of hearing about it but six million jews did die in the concentration camps was i so wrong i knew if i stayed with smith long enough hed lead me to von manteuffel and he was the one we really wanted i knew of only one way of staying with him so iwefound von manteuffel was i so wrong tel aviv hamilton made no attempt to conceal his distaste another of those barbaric eichmann show trials yes von manteuffel will never leave the lost city this dr huston serrano said carefully he meant so much and his daughter yes you were here at the time theyahdied murdered no i was in vienna but a friend of minejim clintonwas here he buried them he even gave them a tombstone and inscription burnt on wood with a redhot poker von manteuffel killed him also some time later vienna maria said wiesenthal the institute serrano said whats this young lady you should watch those slips of the tongue mr serrano such as calling me a young lady the institute is a jewish central organisation for hunting down war criminals based in austria not israel mr hamilton why can they never let the left hand know what the right is doing same old needtoknow principle i suppose all that i really know is that id a double reason for hunting von manteuffel down i got close to him twice in the argentine twice in chile once in bolivia twice in the kolonie an elusive character always on the run always surrounded by his nazi thugs but ive caught up with him or the other way around serrano said hamilton remained silent your friends are buried here yes im hungry and im thirsty navarro said plaintively it was half an hour before dawn i am deeply moved by your sufferings hamilton said whats a damned sight more important is that youre alive i didnt want to depress anyone any more than we already were by saying what was in my mind but i didnt really think wed see the night out ramon said and how could that have been quite simple really lots of ways with a small cannon a rocket launcher any kind of antiaircraft gun or a mortar they could have directed two orthree very nasty pounds of high explosive straight through this open doorway maybe the shrapnel would not have got us all but the concussion in this confined space would have finished us off or they could have crawled over the grain store roof from the back and lobbed in a few grenades or a stick or so of blasting powder the effect would have been the same maybe they didnt have any of those materials to hand which i dont for a moment believe von manteuffel lugs around with him enough weaponry and artillery for an armoured battalion maybe the idea just didnt occur to them which i dont believe either i think that von manteuffel believes as he has reason to that we are dangerous in the dark and is waiting for daylight before moving in for the kill serrano said unhappily it will be daylight quite soon it will wont it in the first faint glimmering of light maria serrano and silver stared at hamilton without comprehension as he extracted the camera from his haversack opened it released the flap to display the transceiver extended an aerial and spoke into the microphone nightwatch hamilton said nightwatch the speaker crackled and the reply was immediate we have you nightwatch now now it is how many vultures thirty forty a guess repeat after me stay under cover napalm stay under cover napalm hamilton switched off useful no very thoughtful is colonel diaz napalm ramon said you heard the man but napalm very tough those airborne commandos but no they dont use it directly theyve no intention of dropping the stuff on us they ring the area not a new technique but very intimidating hamilton made another switch on the camera and a faint bleeping sound could be heard homing signal ramon explained to noone in particular how else do you think theyd ever locate this place youve got everything organised havent you maria sounded slightly bitter never thought to tell us did you why should i hamilton said indifferently nobody ever tells me anything how long will they take to get here twenty minutes no more and dawn is in about the same time about its starting to get light already they could still attack before your friends get here most unlikely in the first place itll take von manteuffel and his minions some time to get organised and if we cant hold them off for a few minutes after that then weve no right to be here in the first place secondly as soon as they hear the sound of the helicopter engines theyre going to forget all about us it was becoming quite light now but still the courtyard remained deserted if von manteuffel and his men were preparing to launch an attack they were being extremely discreet about it by and by ramon said engines i can hear them now theyre coming in from the south i dont hear them myself but if you say theyre coming in then theyre coming in do you see what i see ramon yes indeed i see a man on the roof of their mess hall with a pair of binoculars to his eyes he must have good hearing too the legs if you would in his typical onesweep movement ramon lifted his rifle and squeezed the trigger the man with the binoculars collapsed to the roof then after some seconds scuttled crabwise away on two hands and a knee dragging a useless leg behind him hamilton said our friend general von manteuffel must as they say be losing his cool or he wouldnt have taken a stupid liberty like that i dont think well be seeing any more skywatchers he paused i can hear them now the sound of the aeroengines was nowunmistakable and increased rapidly in strength as the craft approached finally the rackety clamour of the engines reached an almost intolerable pitch as three large gunships began to descend between the reverberating walls of the cliff sides hamilton said inside i think maria paused in the doorway okay to look hamilton pushed her roughly inside and behind a wooden partition where he joined her napalm you ninny some of that stuff could fly loose rockets bombs jesus this is an historic monument moments later almost having to shout to make herself heard over the clamour she said that awful smell napalm shouldnt we shouldnt we go out and help them help them wed only be in their way believe me those lads dont require help of any kind and has it occurred to you that theyd probably mow us down before we got three paces beyond that doorway they dont know who we are and airborne commandos have the odd habit of shooting you first and asking who you are afterwards a little discretion and patience until peace and calm reign again the peace and calm came within two minutes the sound of the helicopter engines died away a klaxon sounded presumably to indicate an allclear not one shot had been fired hamilton said i think the intrepid captain hamilton and his gallant crew may now safely risk a peek outside they filed out through the open doorway three gunships stood in the courtyard before the ziggurat the ruins of the ancient city were ringed with smoke from the still burning napalm at least fifty commandos looking very tough and very competent and certainly armed to the teeth had their guns trained on about three dozen of von manteuffels followers while four commandos one of them carrying a carton of handcuffs which had been brought along for the purpose moved along them securing their wrists behind their backs in the forefront of the captives was von manteuffel himself already handcuffed as hamilton and the others reached the centre of the courtyard an army officer advanced to meet them mr hamilton he said major ramirez at your service you have already been of more than enough service they shook hands we are most grateful that really was efficient my men are disappointed ramirez said we had expected a rather moreah challenging training exercise you wish to leave now an hour if we may hamilton pointed to von manteuffel id like to speak to that man von manteuffel was brought forward between two soldiers his face was grey and without expression hamilton said major this is majorgeneral wolfgang von manteuffel of the ss the last of the infamous nazi wartime criminals no i do not have to shake hands no hamilton looked consideringly at von manteuffel you have of course murdered colonel spaatz and hiller along of course with dr huston his daughter scores of muscias and god knows how many others to every road there is an end with your permission major there are a couple of things i would like to show von manteuffel accompanied by a group of soldiers armed with shovels powerful electric torches and two large batterypowered floodlamps they made their way towards the base of the ziggurat this ziggurat is unique hamilton said every other known one is solid throughout this one has been hollowed out and honeycombed like the great egyptian ones please follow me he led them along a winding crumbling passageway until they came to a low vaulted cavern smoothwalled with no further passageway leading from it the floor was deeply covered with broken fragments of rock and a great deal of gravel to a depth of between one and two feet hamilton spoke to ramirez and indicated a particular area eight soldiers with shovels immediately began to excavate this area in a short time an area of about six feet by six had been cleared to reveal a square slab of stone with an inset iron ring at either end crowbars were inserted into the rings and the slab not without some considerable difficulty lifted clear a shallow flight of stairs led down from the opening in the cavern floor they moved down these along a roughhewn passage and halted before a heavy wooden door hamilton said well serrano this is where you come into your own as for you von manteuffel let your last reflections on earth be the most ironic youve ever had youd have given your heart and your soul if you ever had one for what lies beyond that door but you sat atop it all those years and never dreamed it was there he paused as if deep in thought then said its a mite dark in there there are no windows or lights if you would be so kind major as to have your men switch on all torches and floodlamps im afraid the air will also be a bit musty but it wont kill you ramon navarro give me a hand with this door the door proved to be reluctant to yield but with a sepulchral creaking sound yield it eventually did hamilton took one of the floodlights and passed through the others crowding close behind the large square cavern was hewn from the solid rock all four sides had stepped rock shelves cut into them to a depth of fifteen inches the spectacle was astonishing far beyond any belief the entire cavern gleamed and glittered with thousands upon thousands of artifacts in solid gold there were bowls crocks crockery all in solid gold there were helmets shields plaques necklets busts and figurines all in solid gold there were bells flutes ocarinos ropechains vases breastplates openwork headdresses filigree masks and knives all in solid gold there were monkeys alligators snakes eagles and condors pelicans and vultures and innumerable jaguars all in solid gold and for good measure there were half a dozen open boxes sparkling and glittering with an untold fortune in precious stones more than half of them emeralds it was a treasurehouse inconceivably far beyond the dreams of avarice it seemed as if the awed silence would last for ever serrano at last was the first to speak the lost treasure of the indies the el dorado of a million dreams the spanish always believed that some vanished tribe had taken with them a huge treasure trove such as this mankind has believed in the myth ever since and thousands have lost their lives in the search for the el dorado but it was no myth no myth serrano it was clear was scarcely capable of believing the evidence of his eyes it was a myth all right hamilton said but the golden treasure was there all right but everybody looked for it in the wrong placeup in the guianas and they all looked for the wrong thingthey thought it was royal inca gold but it wasnt the people who made those were the quimbaya of the cauca valley the greatest masters of the goldsmiths art in history for them gold had no commercial value it was solely a thing of beauty and the spaniards would have melted the lot and sent it back to spain in ingot form mr hamilton you have done the world of art an immeasurable service and you were the only nonindian alive who knew of this you could have been the richest man alive hamilton shrugged once a quimbaya always a quimbaya ramirez said what will become of this it is to be a national museum the rightful owners the muscias will return and become the custodians few people im afraid will ever see thisjust accredited scholars from all over the world and but a few of those at a time the brazilian governmentwho dont even know the location of this place yet is determined that the muscias whats left of them will not be destroyed by civilisation hamilton looked at von manteuffel who was gazing trancelike at the immense fortune that had lain beneath his feet he was stunned but then so too was everyone else hamilton said von manteuffel von manteuffel turned his head slowly and looked at him like a sightless man come i have one last thing to show you hamilton led the way into another much smaller cavern side by side at the far end lay two stone sarcophagi above each was a plain pine board with pokerburnt inscriptions hamilton said a friend of mine did those von manteuffel jim clinton remember jim clinton you should after all you murdered him shortly afterwards read them read them aloud still in the same odd sightless fashion von manteuffel looked slowly around looked at hamilton and read dr hannibal huston rip and the other hamilton said lucy huston hamilton beloved wife of john hamilton rip everyone stared at hamilton shocked comprehension came slowly but it came von manteuffel said i am a dead man hamilton with ramon and navarro von manteuffel and the others trudging along closely behind made their way to a helicopter which was parked at the edge of the courtyard only yards from the rim of the plateau suddenly von manteuffel wrists still handcuffed behind his back ran towards the edge of the cliff ramon started after him but hamilton caught him by the arm let him be you heard what he said hes a dead man the end
