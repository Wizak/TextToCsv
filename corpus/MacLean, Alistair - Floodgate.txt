similar incidents although both happening on the night of february rd and both involving army ammunition storage installations had no discernible connection the occurrence at de dooms in holland was mysterious spectacular and tragic the one at metnitz in germany was a good deal less mysterious unspectacular and faintly comic three soldiers were on guard at the dutch ammunition dump set in a concrete bunker one and a half kilometres north of the village of de dooms when about onethirty in the morning the only two citizens who were awake in the village reported a staccato burst of machinepistol fire it was later established that the guards were carrying machinepistols followed immediately by the sound of a gigantic explosion which was later found to have blasted in the earth a crater sixty metres wide by twelve deep houses in the village suffered moderately severe damage but there was no loss of life it was presumed that the guards had fired at intruders and that a stray bullet had triggered the detonation no traces of the guards or supposed intruders were found afterwards in germany a group calling themselves the red army faction a well known and well organized band of terrorists claimed that they had easily overcome the twoman guard at the us nato arms dump near metnitz both men it had been claimed had been drinking and when the intruders had left both were covered with blankets it had been a bitterly cold night the us army denied the drinking allegation but made no mention of the blankets the intruders claimed that they had acquired a quantity of offensive weapons some so advanced that they were still on the secret list the us army denied this the west german press heavily favoured the intruders account when it came to penetrating army bases the red army faction had an impressive record when it came to protecting them the us army had an unimpressive one the red army faction customarily list the nature of their thefts in meticulous detail no such details of the alleged secret weapons were published it has been assumed that if the factions account was true the us army or the us army through the german government had issued a stop order to the press one it is clear that it is the work of a madman jon de jong tall lean grey ascetic and the general manager of schiphol airport looked and sounded very gloomy indeed and in the circumstances he had every justification in looking and sounding that way insanity a man has to be deranged unhinged to perform a wanton mindless pointless and purposeless task like this like the monkish professor he so closely resembled de jong tended to be precise to the point of pedantry and as now had a weakness for pompous tautology a lunatic one sees your point of view de graaf said colonel van de graaf a remarkably broad man of medium height with a deeply trenched tanned face had about him an imperturbability and an unmistakable cast of authority that accorded well with the chief of police of a nations capital city i can understand and agree with it but only to a certain extent i appreciate how you feel my friend your beloved airport one of the best in europe amsterdam airport is the best in europe de jong spoke as if by rote his thoughts elsewhere was and will be again the criminal responsible for this is it is certain not a man of a normal cast of mind but that does not mean that he is instantly certifiable maybe he doesnt like you has a grudge against you maybe hes an exemployee fired by one of your departmental managers for what the manager regarded as a perfectly valid reason but a reason with which the disgruntled employee didnt agree maybe hes a citizen living close by on the outskirts of amsterdam say or between here and aalsmeer who finds the decibel level from the aircraft intolerably high maybe hes a dedicated environmentalist who objects in what must be a very violent fashion to jet engines polluting the atmosphere which they undoubtedly do our country as you are well aware has more than its fair share of dedicated environmentalists maybe he doesnt like our governments policies de graaf ran a hand through his thick irongrey hair maybe anything but he could be as sane as either of us maybe youd better have another look colonel de jong said his hands were clenching and unclenching and he was shivering violently both of those were involuntary but for different reasons the former accurately reflected an intense frustration and anger the latter was due to the fact that when an icecold wind blows eastnortheast off the jsselmeer and before that from siberia the roof of the main concourse of schiphol airport was no place to be as sane as you or i would you or i have been responsible for this this atrocity look colonel just look de graaf looked had he been the airport manager he reflected it would hardly have been a sight to gladden his heart schiphol airport had just disappeared its place taken by a waverippled lake that stretched almost as far as the eyes could see the source of the flooding was all too easy to locate close to the big fuel storage tanks just outwith the perimeter of the airport itself a wide breach had appeared in the dyke of the canal to the south the debris stones and mud that were scattered along the top of the dyke on either side of the breach left no doubt that the rupture of the containing dyke had not been of a natural or spontaneous origin the effect of the onrush of waters had been devastating the airport buildings themselves though flooded in the ground floors and basements remained intact the damage done to the sensitive electric and electronic machinery was very considerable and would almost certainly cost millions of guilders to replace but the structural integrity of the buildings was unaffected schiphol airport is very solidly built and securely anchored to its foundations aircraft unfortunately when not operating in their natural element are very delicate artifacts and of course have no means at all of anchoring themselves a momentary screwing of de graafs eyes showed that this was all too painfully evident small planes had drifted away to the north some were still floating aimlessly around some were known to be sunk and out of sight and two had their tailplanes sticking up above the water those would have been singleengined planes carried down headfirst by the weight of the engines in their noses some twoengined passenger jets s and dcs and three engined planes trident s and s had also moved and were scattered randomly over a large area of the airfield their noses pointing in every which direction two were tipped on their sides and two others were partially submerged with only parts of their upper bodies showing their undercarriages had collapsed the big planes the s the tristars the dc s were still in situ held in position by their sheer massive weight these planes fuelled can weigh between three and four hundred tons two however had fallen over to one side presumably because the undercarriages distant from the onrush of water had collapsed one did not have to be an aeronautical engineer to realize that both planes were writeoffs both port wings were angled upwards at an angle of about twenty degrees and only the roots of the starboard wings were visible a position that could only have been accounted for by the fact that both wings must have broken upwards somewhere along their lengths several hundred yards along a main runway an undercarriage projecting above the water showed where a fokker friendship accelerating for takeoff had tried to escape the floodwaters and fed it was possible that the pilot had not seen the approach of the flood waters possible but unlikely it was more likely that he had seen them reckoned that he had nothing to lose either way continued accelerating but failed to gain liftoff speed before being caught there was no question of his plane having been engulfed in those initial stages according to observers there had been only an inch or two of water fanning out over the airfield but that had been enough to make the fokker aquaplane with disastrous results airport cars and trucks had simply drowned under the water the only remaining signs of any wheeled vehicles were the projecting three or four steps of aircraft boarding ramps and the top of a tanker even the ends of two crocodile disembarkation tubes were dipped forlornly into the murky waters de graaf sighed shook his head and turned to de jong who was gazing almost sightlessly over his devastated airfield as if still quite unable to comprehend the enormity of what had happened you have a point jon you and i are sane or at least i think the world at large would think so and it is not possible that we could have been responsible for such appalling destruction but that doesnt mean that the criminal responsible for this wanton destruction is insane we will doubtless find either through our own efforts or because he chooses to inform us that there was a very compelling reason for what he did i shouldnt have used the word wanton there you shouldnt have used words like mindless and pointless this is no random arbitrary spurofthemoment act of an escaped mental patient this is a deliberately calculated act designed to produce a deliberately calculated effect reluctantly as if by a giant effort of will de jong looked away from the flooded airfield effect the only effect it has on me is one of sheer outrage what other effects could there be do you have any suggestions none ive had no time to think about it dont forget ive only just come to this sure sure we knew yesterday that this was promised but like everyone else i thought the idea was so preposterous as to be not worth considering but i have two other suggestions i suggest that well achieve nothing by staring out over lake schiphol and i suggest were not going to help anyone or anything by hanging around here and getting pneumonia de jongs briefly pained expression showed what he thought of the term lake schiphol but he made no comment the staff canteen was an improvement on the rooftop inasmuch as there was no wind but it wasnt all that much warmer all electric heating had inevitably been shortcircuited and the butane heaters that had been brought in had as yet had a minimal effect on the chilled atmosphere an abundance of hot coffee helped something rather more sustaining de graaf reflected would have been in order but for those with a taste for schnapps or jonge jenever the presence of the airport manager had a markedly inhibiting effect as became his ascetic appearance de jong was a lifelong teetotaller a difficult thing to be in holland he never made a point of this he had never even been heard to mention this but somehow people just didnt drink anything stronger than tea or coffee when de jong was around de graaf said lets summarize briefly what we know it has to be brief because we know virtually damn all three identical messages were received yesterday afternoon one to a newspaper one to the airport authorities in effect mr de jong and one to the rijkswaterstaat of the ministry of transport and public works he paused briefly and looked across at a burly darkbearded man who was placidly polluting the atmosphere with the smoke from what appeared to be a very ancient pipe ah of course mr van der kuur the rijkswaterstaat deputy projects engineer how long to clear up this mess van der kuur removed his pipe we have already started we seal off the breach in the canal with metal sheeting a temporary measure only of course but sufficient after that well we do have the best and biggest pumps in the world a routine job how long thirtysix hours at the outside there was something very reassuring about der kuurs calm and matteroffact approach provided of course that we get a degree of cooperation from the tugboat men barge men and private owners whose boats are at the moment resting on the mud at the bottom of the canal the boats that settled on an even keel are no problem those which have fallen over on their sides could well fill up i suppose selfinterest will ensure cooperation de graaf said any loss of life in the canal or anybody hurt one of my inspectors reports a considerable degree of high blood pressure among the skippers and crews of the stranded craft that apart no one was harmed thank you the messages came from a man or a group signing themselves fff it was not explained what those initials were meant to stand for the intention it was said was to demonstrate that they could flood any part of our country whenever and wherever they wished by blowing up a strategically placed dyke and that accordingly they intended to give a small scale demonstration that would endanger no one and cause as little inconvenience as possible as little inconvenience small scale de jong was back at his fist clenching i wonder what the devil they would regard as a large scale demonstration de graaf nodded quite they said the target was schiphol and that the flooding would come at ix am not one minute before eleven not one minute after as we know the breach was blown at precisely i i am at police headquarters quite frankly this was regarded as a hoax after all who in his right mind would want to turn schiphol airport into an inland sea perhaps they saw some symbolic significance in their choice after all the dutch navy defeated the spanish navy at this very spot when the present schiphol really was a sea hoax or not we took no chances the canal was the obvious choice for any saboteur so we had both sides of the north bank of the canal closely examined there were no signs of any kind of disturbance that could have indicated a preparation for the blowing of the dyke so we assumed it was some kind of practical joke de graaf shrugged palms uplifted as we know too late nothing was further from the mind or minds of the fff than fun and games he turned to the man seated on his left side peter youve had time to think have you any idea sorry gentlemen sorry some of you may not know my colleague here lieutenant peter van effen lieutenant van effen is my senior detective lieutenant he is also an explosives expert and for his sins the head of the citys bomb disposal squad have you figured out yet how it was done peter van effen was an unremarkable figure like his boss he was just over medium height uncommonly broad and looked suspiciously as if he were running to fat he was in his mid or late thirties had thick dark hair a dark moustache and an almost permanent expression of amiability he didnt look like a senior detective lieutenant in fact he didnt even look like a policeman many people including quite a number of people in dutch prisons tended to take van effens easygoing affability at its face value it didnt take much figuring sir anythings easy with hindsight but even had we had foresight there was nothing we could have done about it anyway well almost certainly find that two boats were tied up bow to stem alongside the north bank unusual but theres no law say against an engine breakdown and a sympathetic owner of a passing vessel stopping to lend a hand i should imagine that well find that those boats were almost certainly stolen because there is traffic on the canal and any habitual waterway user would have been able to identify them the two boats would have been very close or even overlapping leaving a clear hidden area where scuba divers could took place during dusk or nighttime as im sure it did they would have bright lights on deck and when you have those on anything below gunwale level is in deep shadow they would have had a drilling machine something like the ones you use on oilrigs only of course this one would have been on a very small scale and operated horizontally not vertically it would have been electrically powered either by batteries or a generator because the exhausts of a petrol or diesel plant make a great deal of noise for an expert and there are literally hundreds of experts operating on or around the north sea this would have been a childishly simple operation they would drill through to say a foot of the other side of the dyke we may be sure they would have taken very careful measurements beforehand withdraw the bit and insert a waterproof canvas tube packed with explosives maybe just plain oldfashioned dynamite or tnt although a real expert would have gone for amatol beehives they would then attach an electrical timing device nothing elaborate an oldfashioned kitchen alarm clock will do very well plug the hole with mud and gravel not that there would be a chance in a million of anyone ever looking there and sail away i could almost believe mr van effen that you masterminded this operation yourself van der kuur said so thats how it was done its how i would have done it and within the limits of a slight variation thats how they did it there is no other way van effen looked at de grad were up against a team of experts and the person directing them is no clown they know how to steal boats they know how to handle them they know where to steal drilling equipment they know how to use that equipment and theyre obviously at home with explosives no wildeyed sloganchanting cranks among this lot theyre professionals ive asked head office to notify us immediately if they receive any complaints from factories wholesalers or retailers of the theft of any equipment from the manufacturers or distributors of drilling equipment also to notify us of the theft of any vessels from that area and beyond that de graaf said nothing we have no leads de graaf nodded and looked down at the paper he held in his hands that message from the mysterious fff no indication whatsoever as to the reason behind this threatened now actual sabotage just a warning that nobody should be at ground level at i x am this morning and that all planes should be flown out yesterday afternoon or evening to adjacent airfields as the needless destruction of property formed no part of their plans very considerate of them i must say and even more considerate jon was the phone call you got at nine oclock this morning urging you to evacuate all those planes immediately but of course we all knew it was a hoax so we paid no attention would you recognize that voice again jon not a chance it was a womans voice a young woman and speaking in english all young women speaking english sound the same to me fist clenched de jong gently thumped the table before him they dont even hint at the reason for carrying out this this monstrous action what have they achieved by this action nothing absolutely nothing i repeat that any person or persons who behave in this fashion have to be mentally unbalanced van effen said im sorry sir i disagree i do agree with what the colonel said on the roof theyre almost certainly as sane as any one no one who is mentally unbalanced could have carried out this operation and theyre not as i said wildeyed terrorists throwing bombs in crowded marketplaces in two separate warnings they did their best to ensure that neither human lives nor property would be put at risk that was not the behaviour of irresponsible people and who then was responsible for the deaths of the three people who lost their lives when that fokker friendship cartwheeled and crashed on takeoff the saboteurs indirectly one could equally well say that you were also indirectly it might be argued you might at least have considered the possibility that the threat was not a hoax taken even the most remote possibility into account and refused permission for the fokker to take off at exactly i i am but that permission was given personally i understand by you it is as certain as certain can be that the saboteurs had carefully checked landing and takeoff schedules and made sure that there were no planes either taking off or landing at or near that time that fokker was the private plane of a german industrialist and was therefore not listed on the scheduled departures i suggest mr de jong that its futile to ascribe the blame for those three deaths to anyone sheer bad luck an unfortunate coincidence in timing an act of god call it what you like there was nothing planned nothing calculated no motive behind those deaths it was nobodys fault de jong had substituted fingerdrumming for table thumping if those evil men were as considerate as you say why didnt they postpone the explosion when they saw people boarding the plane because we dont know that they were in a position to see anything and even if they were they were almost certainly unable to do anything about it had the explosives been activated by a radiocontrolled device sure they could have stopped it but as i told you im pretty certain it was an electrical timer and to deactivate that they would have had to assemble a boat scuba gear and diver and all in broad daylight in a matter of minutes in the time available that would have been impossible there was a faint but unmistakable sheen of sweat on de jongs forehead they could have phoned a warning van effen looked at de jong for a long moment then said how much attention did you pay to the previous warning this morning de jong made no reply and youve just said that the saboteurs have achieved nothing absolutely nothing by their action i know youre upset sir and it seems unfair to press the point but can you really be so naive as to believe that theyve already made a considerable achievement they have achieved the beginnings of a climate of fear and uncertainty a climate that can only worsen with the passing of the hours if theyve struck once apparently without a blind bit of motivation are the chances not high that they win strike again if they do when if they do where and above theres the why what overpowering reason do they have to behave as they dohe looked at de graaf soften up the victim but keep him in suspense as to your purpose in behaving in this fashion its a novel form of blackmail and i see no reason why it shouldnt work i have the strong feeling that we are going to hear from the fff in the very near future not to state the reasons for acting as they do certainly not to make any specific demands dear me no not that thats not the way you conduct psychological warfare one turns the wheel that stretches the rack very very slowly over a calculated period of time gives the victim time to ponder more deeply about the hopelessness of his situation while his morale sinks lower and lower at least thats how i believe they operated in the middle ages when using the actual instrument of course de jong said sourly you seem to know a lot about the workings of the criminal mind a little van effen smiled agreeably i wouldnt presume to tell you how to run an airport and what am i to understand from that mr van effen just means that a cobbler should stick to his last de graaf made a placatory gesture with his hand hes the author of the now established textbook on the psychology of the criminal mind never read it myself so peter you seem sure the fff will contact us very soon but not to tell us about themselves or their objectives tell us what the where and the when their next ah demonstration what else a profound and rather gloomy silence was ended by the entrance of a waiter who approached de jong telephone sir is there a lieutenant van effen here me van effen followed the waiter from the canteen and returned within a minute and addressed himself to de graaf duty sergeant apparently two men reported their boats missing some hours ago pleasure boat owners the sergeant who took their complaint didnt think it necessary to notify our department quite right of course the boats have now been recovered one it would seem was taken by force the boats are in our hands i told them to take a couple of fingerprint men aboard return the boats to the owners but not to allow the owners aboard if you can spare the time sir we can interview the two owners after we leave here they live less than a kilometre from here a promising lead yes no i dont think so either however no stone unturned we may as well go now and he broke off as the same waiter reappeared and approached him phone again for you this time colonel de graaf returned in a matter of seconds jon have you such a thing as a shorthand typist of course jan sir a blond youngster was on his feet you heard the colonel yes sir he looked at de graaf what shall i say ask her to take that phone call and type it out for me peter you have clairvoyance the second sight the fff indeed the press i need hardly say the fff have their publicity priorities right usual anonymous phone call the subeditor who took the call was smart enough to taperecord it but id be surprised if that is of the slightest help a fairly lengthy statement i understand shorthand is not my forte let us possess our souls in patience they had possessed their souls for not more than four minutes when a girl entered and handed a typewritten sheet to de graaf he thanked her looked briefly at the sheet and said action this day would appear to be their motto this i understand is their statement in full and a fairly arrogant example of its kind it is too this is what the fff says next time perhaps the responsible citizens in amsterdam will listen to what we say believe what we say and act accordingly it is because you did not believe what we said that a misadventure occurred today for this misadventure we hold mr de jong entirely responsible he was given due warning and chose to ignore that warning we deplore the unnecessary deaths of the three passengers aboard the fokker friendship but disclaim all responsibility it was not possible for us to arrest the explosion de graaf paused and looked at van effen interesting very so they had an observer well never find him he could have been in the airport but hundreds of people who dont work here visit here every day for all we know there could have been someone outside the airport with a pair of binoculars but thats not what is interesting the four firstaid men who brought in the most seriously injured passengers did not know at the time whether the three men who were later pronounced dead were in fact dead or alive two of them i understand died after admission but none was officially pronounced dead until the doctor certified them as such how did the fff know neither the doctor nor the firstaid men could have been responsible for leaking the news for they would be the obvious suspects and all too easily checked on apart from them the only people who knew of those deaths arc in this room van effen looked leisurely around the sixteen men and three women seated at the canteen tables then turned to de jong it hardly needs spelling out does it sir we have an infiltrator here an informant the enemy has a spy in our camp again he carried out the same slow survey of the room i do wonder who it can be in this room de jong looked both disbelieving and unhappy at the same time i dont have to repeat the obvious do i de jong looked down at his hands which were now tightly clasped on the table no no of course not but surely well we can find out you can find out the usual rigorous enquiries is that it trace the movements of every person in this room after the fokker crashed find out if anyone had access to the phone or indeed used a phone sure we can do that pursue the rigorous enquiries well find nothing youll find nothing de jong looked his perplexity how can you be so sure so sure in advance because de graaf said the lieutenant has a policemans mind not a bunch to be underestimated are they peter theyre clever de jong looked from de graaf to van effen then back to de graaf if someone would kindly explain simple reallyde graaf said it hasnt occurred to you that the fff didnt have to let us know that they knew of the deaths gratuitous information if you like they would know that we would know this they would know as the lieutenant has just pointed out that we would know that someone had informed them and that someone would have to be one of us they would be certain that we would check on the possibility of someone here having made a phone call so they made certain that no one here made a phone call he passed the word on to an accomplice who is not in this room the accomplice made the call im afraid jon that you have another mole burrowing away inside here maybe even more you are aware of course that every word of our conversation will be reported back to the fff whoever they may be we will naturally go through the motions and make the necessary routine enquiries as van effen says we will of course draw a blank but but it all seems so pointless de jong said why should they be so devious so as to achieve nothing theyre not really devious and they do achieve something a degree of demoralization for one thing more important they are saying that they are a force to be reckoned with that they can infiltrate and penetrate security when they so choose they are giving the message that they are a highly organized group one that is capable of carrying out any threats that it chooses to make and one that is to be ignored at our peril speaking of threats and perils lets return to the fffs latest phone call they go on to say we are sure that the dutch people are well aware that in the face of an attacker determined to bring it to its knees it is the most defenceless nation in the world the sea is not your enemy we are and the sea is our ally you will not need reminding that the netherlands has about kilometres of sea dykes a certain cornelius rijpma president of the sea polder board in leeuwarden in friesland is on record as saying some months ago that the dykes in his area consist of nothing more than layers of sand and that if a big storm comes they are certain to break by a big storm one would assume that it would have to be a storm of the order of the one that breached the delta defences in and took lives our information supplied to us by the rijkswaterstaat is that what what van der kuur redfaced and almost incoherent with anger was on his feet are those devils daring to suggest that they got information from us dastardly impossible let me finish mr van der kuur cant you see that theyre using the same technique again trying to undermine confidence and demoralize just because we know that they have contacts with one or more of mr de jongs staff is no proof that they have any with your people anyway theres worse to come they go on our information is that a storm of not more than of the power of the one would be sufficient to breach the dykes mr rijpma was talking about vulnerable dykes of the netherlands kilometres of dykes almost exactly three hundred have deteriorated to a critical condition by the best estimates no repairs will be carried out to the threatened dykes for another twelve years that is to say all we propose to do is to accelerate the advent of the inevitable de graaf paused and looked around a chilled hush seemed to have fallen over the canteen only two people were looking at him the others were either gazing at the floor or into the far distance in both cases it was not difficult to guess that they didnt like what they saw the dykes cannot be repaired because there is no money to repair them all the money available or likely to be available in the future is being sunk or will be sunk into the construction of the east scheldt stormsurge barrier the last link in the socalled delta plan designed to keep the north sea at bay the costs are staggering due to gross original underestimates cost overruns and inflation the likely bill will probably be in excess of nine billion guilders and this massive sum for a project that some engineering experts say will not work anyway the project consists of lockgates fitted between enormous i tonne freestanding concrete pillars the dissident experts fear that heavy seas could shift the pillars jam the locks and render the barrier inoperable a shift of two centimetres would be enough ask mr van der kuur of the rijkswaterstaat de graaf paused and looked up van der kuur was on his feet again every bit as apoplectic as on the previous occasion the thought was inevitable that van der kuurs normal air of pipepuffing imperturbability was a very thin veneer indeed lies he shouted rubbish balderdash defamation calumny lies i tell you lies youre the engineer in charge you should know so really theres no need to get so worked up about it de graafs tone was mild conciliatory the dissidents the fff speak about they have no hydraulic engineering qualifications the dissidents a handful qualifications of course paper qualifications not one of them has any practical experience as far as this matter is concerned van effen said does anybody have on this project practical experience i mean i understood that the east scheidt involved completely untested engineering techniques and that you are in effect moving into the realms of the unknown he raised a hand as van der kuur was about to rise again sorry this is all really irrelevant what is relevant is that there is a mind or minds among the fff that is not only highly intelligent but has a clear understanding about the application of practical psychology first they introduce the elements of doubt dismay dissension and the erosion of confidence into schiphol then they apply the same techniques to the rijkswaterstaat and now through the medium of every paper in the land this evening or tomorrow morning and doubtless through television and radio they will introduce those same elements into the nation at large if you ask me they have or will have achieved a very great deal in a very short space of time a remarkable feat they are to be respected as strategists if not as human beings i trust that the traitor in our midst will report that back to them indeed de graaf said and i trust the same traitor will understand if we dont discuss the steps we plan to undertake to combat this menace well ladies and gentlemen to the final paragraph of their message and incidentally no doubt to introduce some more of what the lieutenant referred to as doubt dismay dissension erosion of confidence or whatever they go on to say in order to demonstrate your helplessness and our ability to strike at will wherever and whenever we choose we would advise you that a breach will be made in the texel sea dyke at pm this afternoon what the word came simultaneously from at least half a dozen people shook me a bit too de graaf said thats what they say i dont for a moment doubt them brinkman this to a uniformed young police officer contact the office no urgency probably but check that people on the island know whats coming to them mr van der kuur im sure i can leave it to you to have the necessary men and equipment to stand by he consulted the sheet again not a big operation they say we are sure that damage will be minimal but it might behove the citizens of oosterend and de waal to stand by their boats or take to their attics shortly after very shortly damned arrogance they end up by saying we know that those names will give you a fairly accurate idea as to where the charges have been placed we defy you to find them and thats all van der kuur said thats all no reasons no explanations for those damned outrages no demands nothing nothing i still say were up against a bunch of raving maniacs and i say that were up against clever and very calculating criminals who are more than content to let us stew in our own juice for the time being i wouldnt worry about the demands if i were you these will come in due time their time well nothing more we can achieve here not on reflection that we have achieved anything i bid you good day mr de jong and hope that youll be back in operational services some time tomorrow itll take days i suppose to replace the machinery ruined in your basements on their way out van effen made a gesture to de graaf to hold back he looked casually around to make sure that no one was within earshot and said id like to put tails on a couple of gentlemen who were in that room well you dont waste time i will say you have of course your reasons i was watching them when you broke the news of the proposed texel breach it hit them most of them just stared away into space and those who didnt were studying the floor au of them i assume were considering the awful implications two did neither they just kept on looking at you maybe they didnt react because it didnt come as any news to them straws youre just clutching at straws isnt that what a drowning man is supposed to do with all the water thats around present and promised you might have picked a less painful metaphor who alfred van rees ah the rijkswaterstaats locks weirs and sluices man preposterous friend of mine honest as the days long maybe the mr hyde in him doesnt come out until after sunset and fred klassen klassen schiphols security chief preposterous thats twice or is he a friend of yours too impossible twenty years unblemished service the security chief if you were a criminal and were given the choice of subverting any one man in a big organization who would you go for de graaf looked at him for a long moment then walked on in silence two bakkeren and dekker were the names of the two boatowners who had been involuntarily deprived of their vessels during the previous night as it turned out they were brothersinlaw bakkeren was phlegmatic about the borrowing of his beat and not particularly concerned by the fact that he had not yet been allowed to examine his boat to see what damage if any had been done to it dekker by contrast and understandably was seething with rage he had as he had informed de graaf and van effen within twenty seconds of their arrival at his suburban home been rather roughly handled during the previous evening is no man safe in this godforsaken city he didnt speak the words he shouted them but it was reasonable to assume that this was not his normal conversational custom police you say you are police ha police a fine job you do of guarding the honest citizens of amsterdam there i was sitting in my own boat and minding my own business when those four gangsters moment van effen said were they wearing gloves gloves dekker a small dark intense man stared at him in outraged disbelief gloves here am i the victim of a savage assault and all you can think of gloves something in van effens tone had reached through the mans anger one could almost see his blood pressure easing a few points gloves eh funny that yes they were all of them van effen turned to a uniformed sergeant bernhard yes sir ill tell the fingerprint men to go home sorry mr dekker tell it your way if there was anything that struck you as unusual or odd let us know it was all bloody odd dekker said morosely he had been as he had said minding his own business in his little cabin when he had been hailed from the bank hed gone on deck and a tall man it was almost dark and his features had been indistinguishable had asked him if he could hire the boat for the night he said he was from a film company and wanted to shoot some night scenes and offered a thousand guilders dekker had thought it extremely odd that an offer of that nature should have been made at such short notice and with night falling he had refused next thing he knew three other men had appeared on the scene hed been dragged from the boat bundled into a car and driven to his home van effen said did you direct them are you mad looking at the fiery little man it was impossible to believe that he would volunteer information to anyone so theyve been watching your movements for some time you werent aware that you were under surveillance at any time under what being watched followed seeing the same stranger an unusual number of times whod watch and follow a fishmonger well who would think they would so they hauled me into the house didnt you try to escape at any time would you listen to the man dekker was justifiably bitter how far would you get with your wrists handcuffed behind your back handcuffs i suppose you thought that only police used those things so they dragged me into the bathroom tied my feet with a clothes line and taped my mouth with elastoplast then they locked the door from the outside you were completely helpless completely the little mans face darkened at the recollection i managed to get to my feet and a hell of a lot of good that did me theres no window in the bathroom if there had been i dont know of any way i could have broken it and even if i bad there was no way i could shout for help was there not with god knows bow many strips of plaster over my mouth three or four hours later im not sure how long it was they came back and freed me the tall man told me theyd left fifteen hundred guilders on the kitchen table a thousand for the hire of the boat and five hundred for incidental expenses what expenses how should i know dekker sounded weary they didnt explain they just left did you see them go type of car number anything like that i did not see them go i did not see their car far less its number dekker spoke with the air of a man who is exercising massive restraint when i say they freed me i meant that they had unlocked and removed the handcuffs took me a couple of minutes to remove the strips of elastoplast and damnably painful it was too took quite a bit of skin and my moustache with it too then i hopped through to the kitchen and got the bread knife to the ropes round my ankles the money was there all right and id be glad if youd put it in your police fund because i wont touch their filthy money almost certainly stolen anyway they and their car of course were to hell and gone by that time van effen was diplomatically sympathetic considering what youve been through mr dekker i think youre being very calm and restrained could you describe them ordinary clothes raincoats thats all their faces it was dark on the canal bank dark in the car and by the time we reached here they were all wearing hoods well three of them one stayed on the boat slits in the hoods of course van effen wasnt disappointed hed expected nothing else round holes more like did they talk among themselves not a word only the leader spoke how do you know he was the leader leaders give orders dont they i suppose would you recognize the voice again dekker hesitated i dont know well yes i think i would ah something unusual about his voice yes well he talked funny dutch funny it wasnt what shall i say dutch dutch poor dutch is that it no the other way around it was very good too good like the newsreaders on tv and radio too precise yes book dutch a foreigner perhaps thats what i would guess would you have any idea where he might have come from there you have me lieutenant ive never been out of the country i hear often enough that many people in the city speak english or german or both not me i speak neither foreign tourists dont come to a fishmongers shop i sell my fish in dutch thanks anyway could be a help anything else about this leader if thats what he was he was tall very tall he tried his first halfsmile of the afternoon you dont have to be tall to be taller than i am but i didnt even reach up to his shoulders ten maybe twelve centimetres taller than you are and thin very very thin he was wearing a long raincoat blue it was that came way below his knees and it fell from his shoulders like a coat hanging from a coathanger the hoods had holes you say not slits you could see this tall mans eyes not even that this fellow was wearing dark eyeglasses sunglasses i did ask you to tell me if there was anything odd about those people didnt you think it odd that a person should be wearing a pair of sunglasses at night odd why should it be odd look lieutenant a bachelor like me spends a lot of time watching movies and tv the villains always wear dark glasses thats how you can tell theyre villains true true van effen turned to dekkers brotherinlaw i understand mr bakkeren that you were lucky enough to escape the attentions of those gentlemen wifes birthday in town for a dinner and show anyway they could have stolen my boat any time and i would have known nothing about it if they were watching maks here they would have been watching me and theyd know that i only go near my boat on weekends van effen turned to de graaf would you like to see the boats sir do you think well find anything no well might find out what theyve been doing ill bet they havent left one clue for hardworking policemen to find might as well waste some more time the brothersinlaw went in their own car the two policemen in van effens an ancient and battered peugeot with a far from ancient engine it bore no police distinguishing marks whatsoever and even the radio telephone was concealed de graaf lowered himself gingerly into the creaking and virtually springless seat i refrain from groaning and complaining peter i know there must be a couple of hundred similar wrecks rattling about the streets of amsterdam and i appreciate your passion for anonymity but would it kill you to replace or reupholster the passenger seat i thought it lent a nice touch of authenticity but it shall be done pick up anything back in the house there nothing that you didnt interesting that the tall thin man should be accompanied by a couple of mutes it has occurred to you that if the leader as dekker calls him is a foreigner then his henchmen are also probably foreigners and may very well be unable to speak a word of dutch it had occurred and it is possible dekker said that the leader gave orders which would give one to understand that they spoke or at least understood dutch doesnt necessarily follow of course the orders may have been meaningless and given only to convince the listener that the others were dutch pity that dekker has never ventured beyond the frontiers of his own homeland he might i say just might have been able to identify the country of origin of the owner of that voice i speak two or three languages peter you even more do you think if wed heard this person speaking wed have been able to tell his country theres a chance i wouldnt put it higher than that i know what youre thinking sir the taperecording that this newspaper subeditor made of the phone call they received chances there would be much poorer you know how a phone call can distort a voice and they dont strike me as people who would make such a fairly obvious mistake besides even if we did succeed in guessing at the country of origin how the hell would that help us in tracking them down de graaf lit up a very black cheroot van effen wound down his window de graaf paid no attention he said youre a great comforter give us a few more facts or lets dig up a few more and it might be of great help to us apart from the fact not yet established that he may be a foreigner all we know about this lad is that hes very tall built along the lines of an emaciated garden rake and has something wrong with his eyes wrong the eyes i mean sir all we know for certain is that he wears sunglasses at nighttime could mean anything or nothing could be a fad maybe he fancies himself in them maybe as dekker suggested he thinks sunglasses are de rigueur for the better class villain maybe like the american presidents secret service bodyguards he wears them because any potential malefactor in a crowd can never know whether the agents eyes are fixed on him or not thereby inhibiting him from action or he might be just suffering from nyctalopia i see nyctalopia every schoolboy knows of course i am sure peter that you will enlighten me at your leisure funny old word to describe a funny old condition i am told its the only english language word with two precisely opposite meanings on the one hand it means nightblindness the recurrent loss of vision after sunset the causes of which are only vaguely understood on the other hand it can be taken to dayblindness the inability to see clearly except by night and here the causes are equally obscure a rare disease whatever meaning you take but its existence has been well attested to the sunglasses as we think of them may well be fitted with special correctional lenses it would appear to me that a criminal suffering from either manifestation of this disease would be labouring under a severe occupational handicap both a housebreaker who operates by daylight and a burglar who operates by night would be a bit restricted in their movements if they were afflicted respectively by day or night blindness just a little bit too farfetched for me peter i prefer the oldfashioned reasons badly scarred about the eyes crosseyed maybe hes got a squint maybe an eye whose iris is streaked or particoloured maybe walleyed where the iris is so light that you can hardly distinguish it from the white or where the pupils are of two different colours maybe a sufferer from exophthalmic goitrc which results in very protuberant eyes maybe hes only got one eye in any event id guess hes suffering from some physical abnormality by which he would be immediately identifiable without the help of those dark glasses so now all weve got to do is to ask interpol for a list worldwide of all known criminals with eye defects there must be tens of thousands of them even if there were only ten on the list it still wouldnt help us worth a damn chances are good of course that he hasnt even got a criminal record van effen pondered briefly or maybe they could give us a list of all albino criminals on their books they need glasses to hide their eyes the lieutenant is pleased to be facetious de graaf said morosely he puffed on his cheroot then said almost wonderingly by jove peter you could be right ahead dekker had slowed to a stop and now van effen did also two boats were moored alongside a canal bank both about eleven or twelve metres in length with two cabins and an open poop deck the two policemen joined dekker aboard his boat bakkeren boarded his own which lay immediately ahead dekker said well gentlemen what do you want to check first de graaf said how long have you had this boat six years in that case i dont think lieutenant van effen or i will bother to check anything after six years you must know every comer every nook and cranny on this boat so wed be grateful if youd do the checking just tell us if there is anything here even the tiniest thing that shouldnt be here or anything thats missing that should be here you might first be so good as to ask your brotherinlaw to do the same aboard his boat some twenty minutes later the brothersinlaw were able to state definitely that nothing had been left behind and that in both cases only two things had been taken beer from the fridges and diesel from the tanks neither dekker nor bakkeren could say definitely how many cans of beer had been taken they didnt count such things but both were adamant that each fuel tank was down by at least twenty litres twenty litres each van effen said well they wouldnt have used two litres to get from here to the airport canal bank and back so they used the engine for some other purpose can you open the engine hatch and let me have a torch van effens check of the engineroom battery was cursory seconds only but sufficient he said do either of you two gentlemen ever use crocodile clips when using or charging your batteries you know those springloaded grips with the serrated teeth no well someone was using them last night you can see the indentations on the terminals they had the batteries in your two boats connected up in parallel or series it wouldnt have mattered theyd have been using a transformer and ran your engines to keep the batteries charged hence the missing forty litres i suppose dekker said that was what that gangster meant by incidental costs i suppose it was de graaf lowered himself not protesting too much into the springless creaking passenger seat of the ancient peugeot just as the radio telephone rang van effen answered then passed the phone across to de graaf who spoke briefly then returned the phone to its concealed position i feared this de graaf said he sounded weary my minister wants me to fly up with him to texel taking half the cabinet with him i understand good god those rubbernecking clowns what on earth do they hope to achieve by being up there theyll only get in everyones way gum up the works and achieve nothing but then theyre very practised in that sort of thing i would remind you lieutenant van effen that you are talking about elected ministers of the crownif the words were intended as a reprimand de graafs heart wasnt in it a useless and incompetent bunch make them look important perhaps get their name in the papers might even be worth a vote or two among the more backward of the electorate still im sure youll enjoy it sir de graaf glowered at him then said hopefully i dont suppose youd like to come peter you dont suppose quite correctly sir besides i have things to do do you think i dont de graaf looked and sounded very gloomy ah but im only a cop you have to be a cop and a diplomat ill drop you off at the office join me for lunch like to sir but im having lunch at an establishment shall we say where amsterdams chief of police wouldnt be seen dead la caracha its called your wife and daughters wouldnt approve sir business of course of course a little talk with a couple of our friends in the krakers you asked me a couple of months ago to keep a discreet apart from an official eye on them they report occasionally usually at la caracha ah the krakers havent had much time to think of them in the past two months and how are our disenchanted youth the antieverything students the flower men the hippies the squatters and the drugpushers and gunrunners keeping a suspiciously low profile these days i must say i feel happier no thats not the word less worried when theyre heaving iron bars and bricks at our uniformed police and overturning and burning the odd car because then we know where we are with this unusual peace and quiet and uncharacteristic inactivity i feel theres trouble brewing somewhere youre not actually looking for trouble peter ive got the nasty feeling im going to find it anyway looking will be quite unnecessary yesterday afternoon when that call came from the fff i sent two of our best people into the area they might come across something an offchance but the crime in amsterdam is becoming more and more centralized in the kraker area the fff would you say qualify as criminals birds of a feather well maybe but the fff seem like pretty smart boys maybe too smart to associate with the krakers who could hardly be called the intellectual titans of crime the fff so far weve got a pretty tall fellow with maybe something wrong with his eyes and maybe of foreign extraction weve practically got it all wrapped up sarcasm ill becomes you all right all right no stone unturned any action is better than nothing whats the food like at la caracha for that area surprisingly good ive had a few meals he broke off and looked at de graaf you are going to honour us at the table sir well i thought i mean as chief of police of course of course delighted and no one will know where i am de graaf seemed cheered at the prospect that damned radio phone can ring its head off for all i care i wont be able to hear it nobody else will be able to hear it either that damned phone as you call it will be switched off the moment we park how do you think the dockland citizens are going to react when they hear a phone go off in this relic they drove off by and by de graaf fit another cheroot van effen lowered his window and de graaf said you have of course checked up on the proprietor of la caracha whats he called he prefers to be known just as george i know him moderately well hes held in high regard among the local people a kindly man a dogooder charitable an upstanding citizen you would say hes reputed to be a ranking member of three perhaps four successful criminal organizations not drugs not prostitution he despises those and wont touch them robbery it is said is his forte usually armed with or without violence according to the amount of resistance offered he himself can be extremely violent i can testify to that personally the violence of course was not directed at me you have to be out of your mind to attack a police lieutenant and george is very far from being out of his mind you do have a genius for picking your friends associates or whatever you call them peter de graaf puffed at his cheroot and if he was ruffled in any way he didnt show it why isnt this menace to society behind bars you cant arrest charge try and convict a man on hearsay i cant very well go up to george with a pair of handcuffs and say people have been telling me stories and i have to take you in besides were friends youve said yourself that he can be excessively violent you can pull him in on that no hes entitled to eject any person who is drunk abusive uses foul language or is guilty of causing an affray thats the limit of georges violence ejection usually two at a time the law says he can we are the law sounds an interesting character unusual one might say two at a time eh wait till you see george and how do you propose to introduce me no need to emphasize the police connections just colonel de graaf this is shall we say a semiofficial visit i may be recognized colonel there isnt a selfrespecting criminal in this city who wouldnt recognize you at a distance of half a kilometre when their kids are misbehaving they probably whip out your picture show it to their offspring and tell them if they dont mend their ways the bogeyman will come and get them extremely witty youre not exactly unknown yourself peter id be curious to know what the ah criminal element hereabouts think about you you dont have to be curious they think im bent the unprepossessing entrance to la caracha was located halfway down a lane so narrow that not even a car could enter it the cracker plaster of the tiny entrance porch the fading and peeling paint belied the bar room that lay beyond this was well lit and clean with gleaming knottedpine walls halfadozen tables each with four small armchairs instead of the usual metal or plastic seats a semicircular bar flanked by fixed stools and beyond the bar the barman when one looked at him one forgot about the rest of the room he was huge very tall and very broad he probably weighed in about a hundred and thirty kilos he wore a rather splendid mexican sombrero one assumed there was some connection between the barmans headgear and the vaguely latin american name of the restaurant a white shirt a black string tie an open black waistcoat and black leather trousers the absence of a gunbelt and a holstered peacemaker colt struck a discordant note the eyes were dark the bushy eyebrows black and the equally black moustache equally bushy luxuriant and dropping down past the corners of his mouth perfectly complemented the spectacular sombrero the craggy face appeared to have been hacked from granite by an enthusiastic but ungifted stonemason he was the epitome of all those wanted portraits that used to adorn the walls of nineteenth century western american saloons thats george van effen didnt bother to answer the superfluous question when he ejects them two at a time i assume he uses only one hand george caught sight of them and hurried round the corner of the bar a wide welcoming smile revealing startlingly white teeth the nearer he approached the bigger he seemed to become his hand was outstretched while he was still quite some distance away welcome peter my friend welcome and colonel van de graaf my word this is indeed an honour he pumped the colonels hand as if he were a twin brother he hadnt seen for twenty years de graaf smiled you know me then if there is anyone in the city who doesnt recognize our commissioner of police he must either be blind or never read newspapers or magazines peter as of this moment my reputation is made he looked at de graaf and dropped his voice provided of course that this is not an official visit purely unofficial de graaf said regard me as the lieutenants guest it is my pleasure to celebrate this auspicious occasion george said borreltje jonge jenever whisky beer wine la caracha has an excellent wine cellar no better in amsterdam but i recommend my bessenjenever gentlemen ice just beginning to form on the top he touched his lips incomparable so it proved and in the quantities that george supplied it the bessenjenever redcurrant gin was as formidable as it was incomparable george remained with them for a few minutes discoursing freely on a variety of subjects but mainly and inevitably about the dyke breach that had brought back into existence the longvanished haarlem lake no need to look for the perpetrators of this crime among the professional criminals of the netherlands george sounded very positive i use the word professional because one would have to exclude the pitifully amateurish criminals among the krakers hotheaded madmen capable of any atrocity no matter how many innocents suffer in the name of their crazy and woolly ideals totally amoral lunatics mindless idiots who love destruction for destructions sake but they are not dutchmen though they may have been born in this country theyre just members of a terminally sick subculture that youll find in many other countries but i dont think theyre responsible for the schiphol flooding however much one may deplore the action of the saboteurs one has to admire the clearheaded intelligence that lies behind it nobody with a clearheaded intelligence would ever dream of associating with the retarded morons who make up the krakers though thats not to say the krakers couldnt be employed in some subordinate capacity where they wouldnt be allowed to know enough to do any damage but no dutchman however criminally minded would or could have been responsible every dutchman is born with the belief the certain knowledge that our dykes are inviolable it is an act of faith i am not what is the word gentlemen i am not xenophobic but this is a foreigninspired ideaing carried out by foreigners and its only the beginning there will be further atrocities wait and sec we wont have to wait long de graaf said theyre going to breach the texel sea dyke at fourthirty this afternoon george nodded as if the news had come as no surprise to him so soon so soon and then the next dyke and then the next and the next when the blackmail demands come as come they must for nothing other than blackmail can lie behind this they will be horrendous he glanced towards his bar where a group of men were making urgent signals that they were dying of thirst you will excuse me gentlemen an extraordinary fellow de graaf said he would have made a splendid politician he could hardly be accused of being at a loss for words strange type to be a criminal alleged to be associated with violence hes an intelligent and clearly well educated man so on the other hand were a number of famous notorious rather and highly successful criminals in the past but i find him especially intriguing he seems well into the criminal mind but at the same time he thinks and speaks like a cop and he got on to the possibility that those criminals might come from another country in a fraction of the time that it took us to arrive at the possibility and unlike us he had nothing to help or guide him towards that conclusion maybe you and i are fractionally less clever than we like to think we are maybe you should hire george on an ad hoc basis substantive rank of sergeant as a dykebreach investigator rather a fine title dont you think the title is fine the idea is not set a thief to catch a thief the idea never did work do not jest with your superior in his hour of need speaking of need when do we eat lets ask george had returned with fresh supplies of besssenjenever wed like lunch george the colonel will eat here la caracha is doubly honoured this table will do im expecting vasco and annemarie of course george picked up the drinks tray and led the way up four steps into a dining room bright cheerful and so small that it held only two tables george produced a menu everything is excellent the rodekool met rolpens is superb shall we have the superb peter de graaf said fine and george as our chief of police is with us i think the expense account could stand a bottle of reasonable wine reasonable do i believe my ears a superb wine to go with a superb dish and strictly on la caracha a chateau latour perhaps i have said that there is no better cellar than mine in the city equally beyond dispute is the fact that i have far the best bordeaux cellar george handed them their aperitifs sharpen your appetites gentlemen annelise i promise will excel herself when george left de graaf said whos annelise his wife less than half his size hes terrified of her a wonderful cook she is aware of his what shall we say extracurricular activities she knows nothing you mentioned a vasco and an annemarie those i assume are your informants george seems to know about them he knows them pretty well theyre friends does he also know that theyre working undercover for you van effen nodded and de graaf frowned is this wise is it politic is it dammit even professional i trust george maybe you do i dont have to to say you have the best bordeaux cellar in amsterdam is to make a pretty large claim that would cost money a great deal of money is he into the highjacking and smuggling rackets too or does he earn enough from his extracurricular activities to buy honestly on the open market look sir i never said george was a rogue thief crook gangster or whatever i was only quoting the neighbourhood opinion of him i wanted you to make up your own mind about him i do think you already have only you still have reservations owing to the fact that you have a nasty devious suspicious mind which is why i suppose youre the citys chief of police annelise knows nothing about georges extracurricular activities as you call them because there are none george has never earned an illegal guilder in his life hes totally straight and if every man in amsterdam were as honest as he is youd join the unemployed by nightfall i was certain youd caught on to this when you said he thought and spoke like a cop he is or was a cop and a damned good one a sergeant in line for his inspectorate when he decided to retire last year phone the chief of police in groningen and find out who hed give a bag of gold for to have back on his staff i am staggered de graaf said he didnt look staggered he just sat placidly puffing his cheroot and sipping his bessenjenever as if van effen had been discussing the weather or crops different yes different he didnt say what was different might have given me some kind of warning though thought youd guess sir hes got cop written all over him at least he had until he grew his moustache after retirement any specialities drugs and counterterrorism i should have said drugs then counterterrorism drugs the only drug in the province of groningen comes out of a gin bottle heres the place for him or if i take you rightly was why was he taken off who took him off nobody nature took him off to be a successful drugs cop you have to be able to merge unobtrusively into your background youve seen him he wasnt built to merge into anything whats more theyve never even seen a terrorist up north theyre not all that thick on the ground down here either sir maybe thats why george resigned no challenge nothing left for him to do a waste an intelligence like that devoting its life to serving up superfluous calories to already overweight amsterdamers could be useful maybe theres something to your idea of ad hoc recruitment in an emergency could always have him coopted yes sir i thought that to coopt anyone you required a committee a quorum theres only one committee and quorum in the amsterdam police force and im it if you think he could be of help just ask me in fact dont bother to ask me im hungry ah yes george normally serves up hors doeuvre maybe he thought there was no urgency he surveyed de graafs ample frame superfluous calories howeverhe rose opened a wooden cupboard door to reveal a refrigerator opened this and said half a smoked salmon smoked trout mountain ham gouda edam and a few other odds and ends there are no limits to the heights you might reach my boy some time later the first sharp edge of his appetite temporarily blunted he said if youre too busy or too cowardly to accompany me to texel may one ask what you intend to do depends on what i learn from annemarie and vasco if of course anything on balance however i think ill go and do what poor george couldnt merge unobtrusively among the krakers in their garden suburb you youre mad the unchallenged bite noire of krakerdom two minutes after your arrival all activity and conversation will wither on the vine ive been there more than once in the past and the vine has remained unaffected i dont wear this rather nice pinstripe you see before you or my official uniform i wear another uniform my kraker uniform i dont think ive ever discussed my wardrobe with you before van effen sipped some more bessenjenever ive a sealskin jacket with lots and lots of tassels and a coonskin hat with a wolverines tail attached to the back rather dashing really de graaf closed his eyes screwed them tightly shut and then opened them again the trousers are made of some other kind of skin i dont know what it is with lots of little leather strips down the sides moccasins of course those were a mistake the moccasins i mean they leak then my hair and my moustache are blond not platinum you understand that would attract too much attention the rest of your outfit doesnt the dye is impervious to any rainstorm have to use a special detergent to get it off a painful process then i wear half a dozen rings solid brass on my right hand that the hand you hit people with among other things im a green peace antinuclear environmental pacifist i also have a multicoloured bead necklace double chain and an earring only one earring two are passй this some day i must see i can get you one like it if you like de graaf closed his eyes again and was saved further comment by the arrival of george with lunch george served the rodekool met rolpens opened the chateau latour with a suitably reverential air and departed the meal was a simple one red cabbage rolled spiced meat and sliced apple but as george had promised splendidly cooked as was customary in amsterdam there was enough food for four the wine also as george had promised was superb they had just finished when george brought in coffee annemarie is outside bring her in please annemarie was a young lady of undeniably striking appearance she wore a rollnecked pullover of indeterminate colour which had once perhaps been white it was about four sizes too large for her a defect she had tried to remedy by hauling a threeinch studded belt tightly about her midriff as she had a rather slender waist the effect was incongruous in the extreme she resembled nothing so much as a potato bag that had been tied around the middle the faded and patched blue jeans were fashionably frayed at the cuffs and she teetered rather than walked into the room on a pair of stained short leather boots with ludicrously pointed high heels the condition of her streaky blonde hair showed that she regarded combs as an unnecessary luxury the jetblack mascara had been applied with a heavy hand as had the turquoise eyeshadow the ghastly pallor of her face which could only have been caused by an overenthusiastic application of some cheap powder was in stunning contrast to the two circular red patches on her cheeks which equally owed nothing to nature the lipstick was purple and the bloodred nail varnish which showed to advantage when she removed the cigarette holder from between her stained teeth was chipped and flaking the nosewrinkling smell of her cheap perfume suggested that she had been bathing in it although the impression was overwhelming that she hadnt bathed in anything for a very long time her brass earrings tinkled as she teetered van effen looked at de graaf but de graaf didnt look at him he was either mesmerized or petrified by the apparition before him van effen cleared his throat loudly this is annemarie sir yesyes annemarie de graaf was still staring at her and it was by a visibly conscious effort of willpower that he turned his head to look at van effen of course of course annemarie but there are one or two things i havent had the opportunity yet to discuss with you and i understand sir annemarie my dear would you mind for a few minutes im sure george will give you something she blew a long puff of smoke smiled and tottered from the room annemarie my dear de graaf sounded and looked appalled annemarie my dear you in your kraker uniform and that that creature what a couple you would make level headed id always thought you eminently sensible this must be some kind of joke where on earth did you pick up that hussy that harlot that harridan that ghastly spectacle god that makeup that bordello perfume its not like you sir to go by appearances snap judgements snap judgements those preposterous shoes that filthy jersey that was built for for a gorilla a very practical jersey sir that way no one would suspect the existence of the beretta automatic she carries strapped beneath her waist a beretta that creature that spectacle she carries an automatic that that caricature of a human being carries a gun you must be mad he drew deeply on his cheroot no youre not mad im not complaining peter but its been a shock to my system i can see that sir should have warned you i suppose she does have rather an effect on people whomake her acquaintance for the first time that awful harridan is in fact a rather lovely young lady or would be if she soaked in a bath for about an hour shes very nice charming really intelligent speaks four languages is a university graduate and is also a lady policewoman from rotterdam dont you see sir im making a point if she can fool the chief of police who has become chief of police by among other things being fooled by fewer people than anyone else around she can fool anyone how did you come by this paragon exchange basis not a very fair exchange really i knew shed spent six months underground in rotterdam and we had no one comparable up here it wasnt easy but my opposite number down there is a friend of minewhy wasnt i informed of this because you gave me a free hand remember i would have informed you if there had been anything to report so far there has been nothing didnt want to bother you with trifles de graaf smiled i doubt whether the young lady would care to be called a trifle have her in would you van effen did so and de graaf waved her courteously to a seat sorry you were kept waiting you know who i am of course colonel van de graaf my boss the slightly husky voice was low and pleasant at complete variation with her appearance lieutenant van effen told you he didnt have to sir i work for him and i know he works for you and ive seen your picture dozens of times that outfit youre wearing annemarie dont you feel it makes you look rather conspicuous among the people im supposed to be investigating i can assure you sir that compared to some of the clothes worn there mine are low key positively understated isnt that so peter ah peter is it a lowly ranker addresses my senior lieutenant by his given name on orders sir weve been out a couple of times together among your ah friends yes sir i wish i had seen that we do form rather a striking couple i told annemarie that it would be unwise to call me lieutenant in such company but to call me peter and always think of me as peter that way you dont make mistakes someone drummed this into me years ago i was the drummer i understand that you carry a gun young lady you can use it i was trained at the police range ever used it no and i must admit i hope i never have to would you use it i dont know if it was to stop someone from killing a person well perhaps yes but i couldnt kill a person i dont like guns im afraid im not very brave sir nonsense your sentiments do you credit feel exactly the same way myself and it takes a brave girl to venture into krakerland she halfsmiled thats where the rollneck comes in so useful they cant see the pulse in my neck rubbish how are things among your friends anything untoward or exciting afoot theyre not a very exciting lot sir rather dull really most of them are not the social rebels and antiauthority stormtroopers they would like to be thought to be of course there are the drugpushers and drugusers and there is a hard core that trade in armaments selling russian smallarms to the irish republican army and other disaffected elements but peter has told me not to bother about the armsrunning side disaffected elements i rather like that so peter the young lady does not concern herself with gun running why you ask me sir america russia britain france trade in arms legally to the tune of billions of dollars yearly the israelis do it as do the iranians libyans and god knows how many other countries all with their governments blessings who are we to become all godfearing moralistic and holier thanthou when private enterprise move in on a tiny scale anyway i know youre not really interested in that side and that the only things you really are interested in are drugs and those mysterious and increasing threats to the royal family and members of the government yes yes of course anything interesting to report on any of these fronts annemarie shook her head vasco youve heard of vasco yes never met him though supposed to meet him today in fact i thought i was meeting him with you i thought so too wed arranged to meet in a cafe close by here almost an hour ago no signs which is most unlike vasco this friend of yours hes a dyedinthewool trueblue kraker well he seems to be but he cant be can he they have some kind of leaders nobody with any personality or charisma a kind of loose council and vasco appears to be a member or close to it but he says hes basically against them and i believe him after all he works for you sort of but youre in two minds about him my intelligence if i have any says that well im ambivalent about him my instincts trust him peter her instincts are right hes a cop detective sergeant a policeman annemaries lips were compressed her eyes angry thank you thank you very much dont be childish van effen said you told him you were a policewoman she didnt answer and de graaf said hastily its the needtoknow principle my dear he didnt even tell me i take it he thinks i didnt need to know you were about to say something about vasco yes could be important i dont know he told me late last night that he thought he had a lead he said he had been approached by one of the council a person who knew that he vasco moved quite often about the outside world to them everything beyond their suburban boundaries is the outside world he said he was being taken to a meeting about midnight to meet someone important i dont know who the person was van effen said who was the person who approached him can you describe him i can describe him all right short balding pepperandsalt beard and a bad squint in his right eye de graaf looked at van effen another eye disorder but this one for real this person have a name julius julius what just she hesitated julius caesar i know its crazy but then theyre crazy nobody out there ever uses his real name right now as far as names are concerned theyre going through an historical phase thats the kind of followmy leader sheep they are weve got alexander the great genghis khan charlemagne lord nelson helen of troy cleopatra i could go on they go for macho men or beautiful women everything that theyre not anyway julius caesar van effen said and thats all you know no indications as to what kind of lead it was no she pursed her lips thats not to say that he didnt know an odd comment to make de graaf said what do you mean nothing i just dont know whether he knows or not lieu me de graaf studied her quizzically you dont trust your fellow officer he doesnt trust me well once again dear me this does make for a happy relationship in the field van effen said sergeant westenbrink doesnt distrust her its just that three years working undercover tends to make you secretive a loner westenbrink is it i thought i knew all my sergeants hes from utrecht sir you cast a wide net lieutenant van effen annemarie works on the same principle as vasco whose name i feel quite certain is not vasco the need to know how can you be hurt when you see me being treated in this cavalier fashion george entered apologised picked up a phone set from a side table and placed it in front of annemarie she lifted the receiver listened to the crackling voice for all of two minutes said thank you five minutes and hung up van effen said the hunters horn i presume whats the message from vasco the hunters horn de graaf frowned i trust thats not the hunters horn that theres only one ah establishment of that name in amsterdam beggars cant be choosers apart from la caracha its our only safe house in amsterdam a private connection colonel the fair name of the amsterdam police department remains unbesmirched not to know de graaf muttered not to know youre half right annemarie said almost reluctantly it was the hunters horn but it wasnt vasco never said it was i said whats the message from vasco it was henri henri sit is the owner vasco is under observation but whoever is tailing him didnt know wasnt to know that its virtually impossible to follow vasco without vasco being aware of it so he couldnt come here the person or persons following him would have raised their eyebrows if they saw you here theyd have gone into shock if theyd found me which would have been a small disaster for us and the end of the usefulness of both vasco and yourself so the only place left for vasco was the hunters horn even there he couldnt use the telephone for he would still be being watched so he wrote a small note for henri who did the telephoning youre to ask me a question and youre to give henri my answer inside five minutes annemarie sighed did you have to spoil it for me then she brightened but you didnt get it all did you im brilliant at deducing the obvious im not clairvoyant the rest what i didnt get can wait including the reasons why vasco is going to call me back i didnt say that henri did the message she made a moue it went like this two tails understand cant ditch meet two de graaf interrupted what was that meant to mean westenbrinks shorthand i imagine van effen said only two ways of getting rid of his tails he could throw them into the nearest canal which hes perfectly capable of doing or he could easily have lost them which he is again perfectly capable of doing either course of action would have ended any connection hes succeeded in making annemarie went on meet two three men fourthirty hunters horn she pushed across a piece of paper stephan danilov van effen read pole radom explosives expert oil well fires texas clear enough interesting sir it is indeed how do you feel about blowing up banks should be interesting to see the law from the other side theyll bring along a polish speaker of course annemarie said you think this is a polish criminal group no just to check on me but if they speak to you in if they speak to him in polish my dearde graaf said hell answer in polish in which language hes very fluent your friend from utrecht peter of course knew this annemarie said but but youll be recognised everybody in that that ghetto knows you i mean knows who you are ninny sorry but please if you think im going to present myself as lieutenant van effen you cant be feeling too well i shall in the best traditions as befits the circumstances be heavily disguised i shall put on about twenty kilos i have a suit and shirt designed to cope with the excess avoirdupois fatten my cheeks tint hair and moustache wear a sinister scar and a black leather glove thats to disguise the fearful scars and burns i sustained when let me see yes of course when i was putting out this oil fire in saudi arabia or wherever its remarkable what a single black glove does it becomes the focal point for identification in nearly everyones mind and if youre not wearing it youre not you if you follow me and dont call krakerdom a ghetto its an insult to decent jews i didnt mean to i know im sorry call henri tell him its ok and to let a few minutes pass before giving vasco the nod she made the call and hung up everything seems all right a few minutes she looked at van effen you already have all the details you want why have vasco make the call why have vasco make the call van effen tried to look patient vasco goes back every afternoon to this empty block of flats that theyve taken over under socalled squatters rights hes been under surveillance since his meeting with the council or whatever they call themselves since last night and its a safe assumption that hell remain under surveillance until the time of the meeting in the hunters horn hows he supposed to have communicated with me to arrange this meeting telepathy de graaf cleared his throat and looked at annemarie you must forgive our lieutenant his oldworld gallantry do you go back to the dreadful place now very soon and you stay there overnight she gave a mock shudder there are limits sir to my loyalty to the police force no i dont sleep there at nights no raised eyebrows among the fraternity not at all sir i have a gentleman friend who comes calling for me every evening the krakers understand this sort of thing and you go back in the morning yes sir she put her hand to her mouth to cover a smile but de graaf had seen it you are amused young lady his tone had lost some warmth well yes i am a little sir your voice and expression of disapproval and disappointment this friend is really a very gallant gentleman especially as hes married inevitably de graaf was not amused he takes me to his cousins house leaves me there and comes for me in the morning thats why hes gallant because hes very much in love with his own wife his cousin colonel de graaf is a lady de graaf said the chief of police is in his usual condition namely out of his depth he was noticeably relieved you will of course peter have carried out a check on this cousin this lady no i have not van effen spoke with some feeling i wouldnt dare de graaf frowned briefly then leaned back and laughed behold our intrepid lieutenant annemarie hes terrified of his young sister so youre staying with julie you know her then sir my favourite lady in all amsterdam except of course for my wife and two daughters im her godfather well well the phone rang van effen picked it up and listened for perhaps half a minute then said can anyone overhear my voice if i speak apparently nobody could for van effen said say that youll give me half a minute to think it over at the end of that period van effen spoke again say to me stephan i swear to you its no police trap my life on it and if it were a police trap what would my life be worth then dont be silly a few moments later van effen said that was fine will you be coming with them fine be sure to tell whoever comes with you im sure it wont be the gentlemen who have you under surveillance at the moment that i have a police record in poland and have a united states extradition warrant out against me i shall be wearing a black leather glove he hung up nice touch about the police record and extradition warrant de graaf said nice criminal touch and two statements they have no way of checking on you will be carrying a gun i assume certainly it would be expected of me and ill have it in a shoulder holster that should make it obvious to even the most myopic that i am armed annemarie said doubtfully perhaps they will take it off you before discussions start just as a precaution i mean one must take a chance about those things i shall be brave what peter means de graaf said drily is that he always carries a second gun its like his single glove theory that people only concentrate on one thing at a time its in that book of his im sure if a person finds a gun on you hes got to be almost pathologically suspicious to start looking for another its not in the book i dont put thoughts like those in criminal minds curious sir that well both be engaged in something interesting at exactly fourthirty you and the minister schnapps in hand peering down at the texel sea dyke from the safety of your helicopter seats while i am entering the lions den id switch with you any time de graaf said morosely i should be back from texel by six damn all i can do up there anyway lets meet at seven provided we both survive you the schnapps me the lions the would be in order sir de graaf didnt say that the would be in order on the other hand he didnt say it wouldnt three the chinook helicopter a big fast experimental model on demonstration loan from the us army of the rhine suffered from the same defect as other smaller and less advanced models in that it was extremely noisy the rackety clamour of the engines making conversation difficult and at times impossible this wasnt helped by the fact that it had two rotors instead of the customary one the passengers were a very mixed bag indeed apart from de graaf and his justice minister robert kondstall there were four cabinet ministers of whom only the minister of defence could claim any right to be aboard the other three including incredibly the minister of education were aboard only because of the influence they wielded and their curiosity about things that in no way concerned them much the same could have been said about the senior air force officer the brigadier and rearadmiral who sat together behind de graaf flight evaluation purposes had been their claim the evaluation tests had been completed a week ago they were along purely as rubberneckers the same could be said of the two experts from the rijkswaterstaat and the two from the delft hydraulics laboratory superficially it would have seemed their presence could be more than justified but as the pilot had firmly stated that he had no intention of setting his chinook down in floodwaters and the experts portly gentlemen all had indicated that they had no intention of descending by winch or rope ladder only to be swept away it was difficult to see how their presence could be justified the handful of journalists and cameramen aboard could have claimed a right to be there but even they were to admit later that their trip had hardly been worthwhile the chinook flying at no more than two hundred metres and about half a kilometre out to sea was directly opposite oosterend when the sea dyke broke it was a singularly unspectacular explosion a little sound a little smoke a little rubble a little spray but effective enough for all that the waddenzee was already rushing through the narrow gap and into the polder beyond less than half a kilometre from the entrance to the gap an oceangoing tug was already headed towards the breach as the pilot turned his chinook westwards presumably to see what the conditions were like in the polder de graaf leaned over to one of the rijkswaterstaat experts he had to shout to make himself heard how bad is it mr okkerse how long do you think it will take to seal off the break well damn their souls damn their souls villains devils monsters okkerse clenched and unclenched his hands monsters i tell you sir monsters okkerse was understandably upset dykes the construction care and maintenance of were his raison detre yes yes monsters de graaf shouted how long to fix that moment okkerse rose lurched forwards spoke briefly to the pilot and lurched his way back to his seat got to see it first pilots taking us down the chinook curved round passing over the waters flooding across the first reaches of the polder and came to hover some fifteen metres above the ground and some twenty metres distant okkerse pressed his nose against a window after only a few seconds he turned away and gave the wave off signal to the pilot the chinook curved away inland clever fiends okkerse shouted very clever fiends its only a small breach and they chose the perfect moment for it what does the time of day matter it matters very much rather the state of the tide matters they didnt pick high tide because that would have caused heavy flooding and great destruction so they cant be all that villainous okkerse didnt seem to hear him and they didnt pick low tide because they knew how i cant even guess that we would do what we are just about to do and that is to block the gap with the bows of a vessel which is what we are about to do with the bows of that oceangoing tug down there at low water the tug probably wouldnt have found enough water to get close to the dyke he shook his head i dont like any of this you think our friends have inside information i didnt say that i suggested that to your friend jon de jong that those people have either an informant in or somebody employed in the rijkswaterstaat ridiculous impossible in our organization preposterous thats more or less what jon said nothings impossible what makes you think your people are immune to penetration look at the british secret service where security is supposed to be a religion theyre penetrated at regular intervals and with painful frequency if it can happen to them with all their resources its ten times more likely to happen to you thats beside the point how long to seal the breach the tug should block off about eighty per cent of the flow the tides going out weve got everything ready to hand concrete blocks matting divers steel plates quicksetting concrete a few hours technically a minor job thats not what worries me de graaf nodded thanked him and resumed his seat beside kondstaal okkerse says its no problem sir straightforward repair job didnt think it would be a problem the villains said there would be minimal damage and they seem to mean what they say thats not what worries me thats what okkerse has just said the worry is of course that they can carry out their threats with impunity were in an impossible situation what would you wager sir that we dont receive another threat this evening nothing theres no point in wondering what those people are up to theyll doubtless let us know in their own good time and theres no point i suppose in asking you what progress youve made so far de graaf concentrated on lighting his cheroot and said nothing sergeant westenbrink wore an offwhite boiler suit unbuttoned from throat to waist to show off a garishly patterned and coloured hawaiian shirt a dutch bargees cap and a circular brass earring compared to those among whom he lived and had his being vasco van effen thought looked positively underdressed but was still outlandish enough to make himself and the two men sitting opposite him across the table in the booth in the hunters horn look the pillars of a respectable society one of them clad in an immaculately cut dark grey suit was about van effens age darkly handsome slightly swarthy with tightly curled black hair black eyes and when he smiled which was often what appeared to be perfect teeth any mediterranean country van effen thought or at the outside not more than two generations removed his companion a short slightly balding man of perhaps ten or fifteen years older than the other wore a conservative dark suit and a hairline moustache the only really and slightly unusual feature in an otherwise unremarkable face neither of them looked the slightest bit like a bona fide member of the criminal classes but then few successful criminals ever did the younger man he went it seemed by the name of romero agnelli which might even have been his own produced an ebony cigaretteholder a turkish cigarette and a gold inlaid onyx lighter any of which might have appeared affected or even effeminate on almost any man with agnelli all three seemed inevitable he lit the cigarette and smiled at van effen you will not take it amiss if i ask one or two questions he had a pleasant baritone voice and spoke in english one cannot be too careful these days i cannot be too careful any day if your question is pertinent of course ill answer it if not i wont am i ah accorded the same privilege certainly except you can ask more what you consider pertinent questions than i can i dont quite understand just that i take it that were talking on a potential employer employee relationship the employer is usually entitled to ask more questions now i understand i wont take advantage of that i must say mr danilov that you look more like the employer class yourself and indeed van effens overstuffed suit and padded cheeks did lend a certain air of prosperity it also made him look almost permanently genial am i mistaken in thinking that you carry a gun unlike you mr agnelli im afraid im not in the habit of patronizing expensive tailors guns make me nervous the disarming smile didnt show a trace of nervousness guns make me nervous too thats why i carry one in case i meet a man who is carrying one that makes me very nervous van effen smiled removed his beretta from its shoulder holster clicked out the magazine handed it to agnelli and replaced his pistol that do anything for your nerves agnelli smiled all gone then they shouldnt be van effen reached below the table and came up with a tiny automatic a lilliput a toy in many ways but lethal up to twenty feet in the hands of a man who can fire accurately he tapped out the magazine handed this in turn to agnelli and replaced the lilliput in its ankle holster thats all three guns would be just too much to carry about so i should imagine agrenlis smile which had momentarily vanished was back in place he pushed the two magazines across the table i dont think well be requiring guns this afternoon indeed but something would be useful van effen dropped the magazines into a side pocket i always find that talking beer for me agnelli said and for helmut too i know four beers van effen said vasco if you would be so kind vasco rose and left the booth agnelli said known vasco long van effen considered a proper question two months why had they van effen wondered been asking the same question of vasco idle curiosity agnelli van effen thought was not a man to indulge in idle curiosity your name really is stephan danilov certainly not but its the name i go by in amsterdam but you really are a pole the elder mans voice dry and precise befitted his cast of countenance which could have been that of a moderately successful lawyer or accountant he also spoke in polish for my sins van effen raised an eyebrow vasco of course yes where were you born radom i know it not well a rather provincial town i thought so ive heard youve heard but you lived there four years when youre four years old a provincial town is the centre of the world my father a printer moved to a better job where warsaw aha aha yourself van effen spoke in some irritation you sound as if you know warsaw and are now going to find out if i know it why i cant imagine youre not by any chance a lawyer mr im afraid i dont know your name paderiwski i am a lawyer paderiwski given time i would have thought you could have come up with a better one than that and i was right eh a lawyer i wouldnt care to have you acting for my defence you make a poor interrogator agnelli was smiling but paderiwski was not his lips were pursed he said brusquely you know the tinroofed palace of courseof course where is it dear me what have we here the inquisition ah thank you he took a glass from a tray that a waiter following vasco had just brought into the curtained booth and lifted it your health gentlemen the place youre so curious about mr ah paderiwiski is close by the wista on the comer of the wybrzeze gdanskie and the slaskodabrowski bridge he sipped some more beer unless theyve moved it of course some years since ive been there paderiwski was not amused the palace of culture and science parade square its too big what do you mean too big to have been moved i mean two thousand three hundred rooms are a lot of rooms a monstrosity the wedding cake they call it but then stalin never did have any taste in architecture stalin agnelli said his personal gift to my already longsuffering countrymen so agnelli spoke polish too wheres the ethnographic museum in warsaw its not in warsaw mlociny ten kilometres to the north van effens voice was now as brusque as paderiwiskis had been wheres the nike you dont know whats the nike you dont know any citizen of warsaw knows its the name given to the heroes of warsaw monument whats zamenhofa street famous for an increasingly uncomfortable paderiwski made no reply the ghetto monument i told you youd make a lousy lawyer paderiwski any competent lawyer for the defence or the prosecution always prepares his brief you didnt youre a fraud its my belief that youve never even been in warsaw and that you just spent an hour or so studying a gazetteer or guidebook van effen placed his hands on the table as if preparatory to rising i dont think gentleman that we need detain each other any longer discreet enquiries are one thing offensive interrogation by an incompetent another i see no basis here for mutual trust and quite honestly i need neither a job nor money he rose good day gentlemen agnelli reached out a hand he didnt touch van effen it was just a restraining gesture please sit down mr danilov perhaps helmut has rather overstepped the mark but have you ever met a lawyer who wasnt burdened with a suspicious mistrustful mind helmut or we just happened to choose the wrong suspect helmut in fact has been in warsaw but only as you almost guessed briefly and as a tourist i personally dont doubt you could find your way about warsaw blindfolded paderiwski had the look of a man who wished he were in some other place any place a blunder we apologize thats kind van effen sat down and quaffed some more beer fair enough agnelli smiled almost certainly a doubledyed villain van effen thought but a charming and persuasive one now that youve established a degree of moral ascendancy over us ill reinforce that by admitting that we almost certainly need you more than you need us not to be outdone van effen smiled in turn you must be in a desperate way he lifted and examined his empty glass if youd just poke your head round the corner vasco and make the usual sos of course stephan there was an unmistakable expression of relief in his face he did as asked then settled back in his seat no more interrogation agnelli said ill come straight to the point your friend vasco tells me that you know a little about explosives vasco does me less than justice i know a great deal about explosives he looked at vasco in reproof i wouldnt have thought you would discuss a friend thats me vasco in case youve forgotten with strangers i didnt well i did but i just said it was someone i knew no harm explosives as i say i know defusing bombs i know im also fairly proficient in capping wellhead oil fires but you wouldnt be approaching me in this fashion if that was your problem youd be on the phone to texas where i learnt my trade no oil fires agnelli smiled again but defusing bombs well thats something else where did you learn a dangerous trade like that armyvan effen said briefly he didnt specify which army youve actually defused bombs agnenis respect was genuine quite a number you must be good why youre here i am good im also lucky because no matter how good you are the bomb youre trying to defuse may be your last one peaceful retirement is not the lot of a bomb disposal expert but as i assume you have no more unexploded bombs than you have oil wells then it must be explosives explosives experts in holland are not in short supply you have only to advertise that i should be approached in a clandestine fashion can only mean that you are engaged in activities that are wegal we are have you never been engaged i mean all depends upon who defines what is legal and what is not and how they define it some people hold definitions which are different from mine and wish to discuss the matter with me very tiresome they can be those alleged upholders of justice you know what the british say the law is an ass van effen considered i think i put that rather well youve hardly committed yourself may one ask delicately of course whether this discussion you are avoiding has anything to do with your vacationing in amsterdam you may it has what do you want me to blow up agnelli raised his eyebrows well well you can be blunt almost as blunt as you can be shall we say diplomatic thats an answer an explosives expert is good for only one thing exploding things you wish me to explode something yes or no yes two things banks boats bridges anything of that kind it blow up and guarantee a satisfactory job anything that involves injury far less death to any person i wont have any part of p you wont ever be called upon to do any such thing thats also a guarantee the second thing i dont seek to flatter you when i say that youre an intelligent man mr agnelli highly intelligent i should think such people are usually firstclass organizers to seek the help of a last minute unknown to help you execute some project that may have been in the planning stage for quite some time doesnt smack to me of preparation organization or professionalism if i may say so you may a very valid point in your position i would adopt the same disbelieving or questioning attitude you have to take my word for it that i am a member of a highly organized team but as you must well know the bestlaid plans etc an unfortunate accident i can explain to your satisfaction but not just at this moment will you accept our offer you havent made one yet will you accept an offer of a job in our organization on if you wish a permanent basis on what i think youll find a very satisfactory salary plus commission basis your special responsibility being the demolition of certain structures those structures to be specified at a later date sounds very businesslike and i like the idea of commissions whatever they may be i agree when do i start and what do i start on youll have to bear with me a little mr danilov my brief for this afternoon is only of a limited nature to find out if in principle you are prepared to work with us which im glad to say you seem to be i have to report back you will be contacted very shortly sometime tomorrow im sure you are not the leader of this organization no you surprise me a man like you acting as a lieutenant well this leader i must meet you shall i promise how will you contact me no phones please certainly not you will be our courier vasco my pleasure mr agnelli you know where to reach me any time thank you agnelli stood up and gave his hand to van effen a pleasure mr danilov i look forward to meeting you tomorrow helmut paderiwski didnt offer to shake hands as the door closed behind them sergeant westenbrink said i need another beer lieutenant peter always peter sorry that was pretty close the ice was very thin at times not for a practised liar i rather gather that youve given them the impression that im a desperate and wanted criminal i did mention that there was the odd extradition warrant out for you but i didnt forget to emphasize your generally upright and honest nature when dealing with your fellow criminals of course of course before you get the beer i have a phone call to make well get it anyway van effen went to the bar and said to the man behind it henri a private call if i may henri the proprietor was a tall gaunt man sallow of countenance and lugubrious of expression you in trouble again peter no i hope someone else will be soon van effen went into the office and dialled a number trianon the manager please i dont care if he is in conference call him its lieutenant van effen he hung on for a few moments charles do me a favour book me in as from a fortnight ago enter it in the book will you in the name of stephan danilov and would you notify the receptionist and doorman yes i expect people to be enquiring just tell them many thanks ill explain when i see you he returned to the booth just booked myself stephan danilov that is into an hotel agnelli pointedly did not mention anything about where i might be staying but you can be sure that hell have one of his men on the phone for the next couple of hours if need be trying to locate me in every hotel or pension in the city so hell know where you are or where youre supposed to be vasco sighed it would help if we knew where they were should know soon enough theres been two separate tails on them ever since they left the hunters horn van effen appearance returned to normal asked the girl at the telegraphs reception desk for the subeditor who had taken the fffs first telephone message this turned out to be a fresh faced and very eager young man mr morelis van effen said police yes sir lieutenant van effen isnt it ive been expecting you youll be wanting to hear the tapes maybe i should tell you first that weve just had another message from the fff as they call themselves have you now i suppose i should say the devil you have but im not surprised it was inevitable happy tidings of course hardly the first half of the message was given over to congratulating themselves on the texel job how it had happened precisely as they had predicted and with no loss of life the second half said there would be scenes of considerable activity on the north holland canal two kilometres north of alkrnaar at nine oclock tomorrow morning t hat too was inevitable not the location of course just the threat youve taped that too yes that was well done may i hear them van effen heard them twice over when they were finished he said to morelis youve listened to those of course too often morelis smiled fancied myself as a detective thought maybe you would give me a job but ive come to the conclusion that theres more to this detecting business than meets the eye nothing struck you as odd about any of the tapes they were all made by the same woman but thats no help nothing odd about accents tones no nuances that struck you as unusual no sir but im no judge im slightly hard of hearing nothing serious but enough to blunt my judgement assuming i had any mean anything to you lieutenant the lady is a foreigner what country ive no idea dont mention that around no sir i rather like being a subeditor we are not in moscow young man put those tapes in a bag for me ill let you have them back in a day or two back in his office van effen asked to see the duty sergeant when he arrived van effen said a few hours ago i asked for a couple of men to be put on a fred kiassen and alfred van rees did you know about this and if you did do you know who the two men were i knew sir detective voight and detective tindeman good either of them called in both less than twenty minutes ago tindeman says van rees is at home and seems to have settled in for the evening klassen is still on duty at the airport or at least hes still at the airport so nothing yet sir van effen looked at his watch im leaving now if you get any word from either a positive not negative report call me at the dikker en thijs after nine call me at horne colonel van de graaf came from a very old very aristocratic and very wealthy family and was a great stickler for tradition so it came as no surprise to van effen when he approached their table wearing dinner jacket black tie and red carnation his approach bore all the elements of a royal progress he seemed to greet everyone stopped to speak occasionally and waved graciously at those tables not directly in his path it was said of de graaf that he knew everybody who was anybody in the city of amsterdam he certainly seemed to know everybody in the dikker en thijs four paces away from van effens table he stopped abruptly as if he had been transfixed but in fact it was his eyes that were doing the transfixing that the girl who had risen from the table with van effen to greet de graaf had this momentarily paralysing effect not only on de graaf but on a wide crosssection of the males of amsterdam and beyond was understandable she was of medium height wore a rather more than wellfilled ankle length grey silk gown and no jewellery whatsoever jewellery would have been superfluous and no one would have paid any attention to it anyway what caught and held the attention as it had caught the riveted attention of the momentarily benumbed colonel was the flawless classical perfection of the features a perfection only enhanced if this were possible by a slightly crooked eyetooth which was visible when she smiled which seemed to be most of the time this was no simpering and emptyheaded wouldbe miss universe contender churned out with repetitive monotony by a californianstyle production line the finely chiselled features and delicately formed bone structure served only to emphasize the character and intelligence they served only to highlight she had gleaming auburn hair great hazel eyes and a bewitching smile it had at any rate bewitched the colonel van effen cleared his throat colonel van de graaf may i introduce miss meijer miss anne meijer my pleasure my pleasure de graaf grabbed her outstretched hand in both of his and shook it vigorously my word my boy you are to be congratulated where did you find this entrancing creature theres nothing to it really sir you just go out into the darkened streets of amsterdam stretch out your hands and well there you are yes yes of course naturally he had no idea what he was saying he seemed to become aware that he had been holding and shaking her hand for an unconscionably long time for he eventually and reluctantly released it remarkable quite remarkable he didnt say what he found remarkable and didnt have to you cannot possibly live in this city little my dear escapes the notice of a chief of police and i think it would be impossible for you to be overlooked even in a city of this size rotterdam well thats not your fault peter i have no hesitation in saying that there car be no more stunningly beautiful lady in the city of amsterdam he lowered his voice a few decibels in fact i would come right out and say that she is the most stunningly beautiful in the city but i have a wife and two daughters and these restaurants have ears you must be about the same age as my daughters may i ask how old you are you must excuse the colonel van effen said policemen are much given to asking questions some chiefs of police never stop the girl was smiling at de graaf while van effen was speaking and once again van effen could have been addressing a brick wall twentyseven she said twentyseven exactly the age of my elder daughter and miss anne meijer bears out my contention the younger generation of dutchmen are a poor backward and unenterprising lot he looked at van effen as if he symbolized all that was wrong with the current generation then looked again at the girl odd i know ive never seen you but your voice is vaguely familiar he looked at van effen again and frowned slightly i look forward immensely to having dinner with you but i thought well peter there were one or two confidential business matters that we had to discuss indeed sir but when you suggested we meet at seven oclock you made no exclusions i dont understand the girl said colonel yes my dear am i really such a hussy a harlot harridan and ghastly spectacle or is it because you dont trust me that you want to speak privately with peter de graaf took a pace forward caught the girl by the shoulders removed one hand to stop a passing waiter and said a jonge jenever large immediately colonel de graaf held her shoulders again stared intently into her face he was probably trying to equate or associate the vision before him with the creature he had met in la caracha shook his head muttered something to or about the same nameless deity and sank into the nearest chair van effen was sympathetic it comes as a shock i know sir happened to me the first time a brilliant makeup artist dont you think if its any consolation sir she also fooled me once but no disguise this time just a wash and brushup he looked at her consideringly but well yes rather goodlooking goodlooking hah de graaf took the jonge jenever from the waiters tray and quaffed half the contents at a gulp ravishing at my age systems shouldnt be subjected to such shocks anne annemarie what do i call you whichever anne my dear i said such dreadful things about you it is not possible of course its not i couldnt believe peter when he said you had van effen waved a hand a loose translation shall we say very loose wisely de graaf did not pursue the subject and what in heavens name is a girl like you doing in a job like this i thought it was an honourable profession yes yes of course but what i meant was well what the colonel meansvan effen saidis that you should be an international stage or screen star presiding over a parisian salon or married to an american oil millionaire billionaire if you like or a belted english earl too beautiful thats your trouble isnt that it colonel couldnt have put it better myself dear me anne smiled doesnt say much for your amsterdam girls you mean you only employ ugly girls de graaf smiled for the first time that evening i am not to be drawn the chief of police is famed for his powers of recovery but you you among those dreadful krakers and dressed like a like harlot hussy if you like yes he put his hand on hers this is no place for a girl like you must get you out of it police is no place for you one has to earn a living sir you you need never earn a living that anne is a compliment i like what im doing de graaf didnt seem to have heard her he was gazing at some distant object out in space van effen said to the girl watch him hes at his most cunning when he goes into a trance i am not in a trance de graaf said i coldly what did you say your surname was meijcr you have a family oh yes the usual parents sisters two brothers brothers and sisters share your interest in law and order police you mean no your father again police she smiled as a person smiles when recalling someone of whom they are very fond i couldnt imagine it hes in the building business does he know what kind of business you are in she hesitated well no what do you mean well no he doesnt does he why why she seemed to be on the defensive he likes us to be independent would he approve of what you are doing and that was no answer you gave me would he approve of his darling daughter mingling with the krakers is this what its like to be a suspect sit and to be grilled am i supposed to have done something wrong of course not would he approve the entranced colonel of a few minutes previously could have belonged to another world no you put me in a quandary i dont like you being in this you apparently do your father wouldnt to whom should i listen you or your father the question hardly arises sir you dont know my father child what does that mean i dont understand i know your father very well weve been friends for over thirty years impossible you cant know him youve only just met me and you didnt even know me she was no actress and was visibly upset this is this is a trick of some kind annemarie van effen touched her arm if the colonel says hes a friend of your father then he is come on sir i know when next you write or phone anne if you ever do give my warmest regards to david joseph karlmann meijer her eyes widened she opened her mouth as if to speak closed it again and turned to van effen i think its my turn for a jonge jenever de graaf looked at van effen my old friend david weve gone sailing fishing skiing hunting over the years we were even up exploring the amazon before this young lady here was born owns a huge construction company he also owns one of the biggest cement factories in the netherlands oil refineries tankers an electronics firm and god knows what else one has to cam a living sir he mimicked earn a living cruel cruel landlord throwing the poor orphan out into the snow ah he turned to look at the maitre d at his elbow good evening the young people will choose for me but first another jonge jenever he looked at annemarie must have something to cry into they say gin is best after the orders had been taken and the maitre d and his minions departed van effen said you have a scenario sir and you dont like what you see i dont like it at all two things if anything happens to this young lady well david meijers wrath is fearful to behold and its considerably worse to be the object of it secondly disguise or no disguise annes identity may be discovered it can happen as you know all too well peter a slip of the tongue an unguarded reference some careless action there are too many possibilities what a windfall for a penniless kraker or even worse a professional kidnapper her father would pay five ten million guilders to get her back do you like it peter van effen made to speak then glanced at the waiter who stood by his side lieutenant van effen phone van effen excused himself de graaf said well do you like it not the way you put it but i dont want to seem impertinent sir to disagree with my boss but i think you put it too strongly ive been doing this kind of work for some months in rotterdam and nothing has ever happened to me there and while there may be no krakers down there the criminal element are a great deal tougher than they are here im sorry colonel but i think you exaggerate the dangers im rather good at disguises you as much as said so yourself i have a gun best of course is that no one in amsterdam knows me i know you thats different peter says that you know everyone and you must admit that it was a very remote chance that you knew my father i could have found out easily enough peter knows only my name not who i am not until you spoke about it just now i must say he didnt seem particularly surprised she smiled he could of course have been unconcerned or uninterested youre fishing for compliments my dear she made to protest but he held up his hand in your case indifference is impossible the lieutenant cares very much for people that doesnt mean he goes around showing it all the time its a learned habit i know he didnt know im equally sure julie does ah julie your favourite lady in all amsterdam i now have two favourite ladies in all amsterdam with the usual provisos of course your wife and daughters of course of course dont stall youre very good at stalling you know anne at diverting me from the topic at hand which is you and dont give me those big innocent eyes julie knows she said how did you know that sir because i know julie because shes clever because shes a woman living so close to you shes bound to notice things that others wouldnt clothes jewellery personal possessions things the average working girl wouldnt have even the way you speak fine by me if julie knows shed never tell anyone ill bet shes never even told her brother you like living there very much and julie also very much i think she likes me too i have the honour to sleep in the bedroom that used to be peters i believe he left about six years ago she frowned i asked her why hed left it couldnt have been an argument theyre obviously terribly fond of each other but she wouldnt tell me just said id have to ask peter did you ask him no she shook her head very firmly one doesnt ask the lieutenant personal questions i agree that he does rather give that impression hes quite approachable really no secret about his departure he left to get married marianne loveliest girl in amsterdam even although i do say it about my own niece shes your niece was de graafs voice was sombre even in those days peter was the best most able cop in the city far better than i am but for gods sake dont tell him so he broke up a particularly vicious gang of people who specialized in a nice mixture of blackmail and torture four brothers they were the annecys god knows where they got their name from peter put two of them away for fifteen years the other two just vanished shortly after the conviction of the two brothers someone almost certainly one or both of the two brothers that had not been brought to justice placed in peters weekend canal boat a huge bomb wired up to the ignition switch same technique as was used by the murderers who assassinated lord mountbatten as it happened peter wasnt aboard his boat that weekend but marianne and their two children were dear god the girls hands were clenched how awful how how dreadful and every three months or so since that time he receives a postcard from one of the two surviving annecy brothers never any message just a drawing of a noose and a coffin a reminder that hes living on borrowed time charming isnt it horrible just horrible he must be worried to death i know i would wondering every night when i go to sleep if i could sleep whether i would wake up in the morning i dont think he worries much if he did hed never show it and i know he sleeps very well but thats the reason although he never mentions it why he doesnt return to live with julie he doesnt want her to be around when the bomb comes through his window what a way to five why doesnt he emigrate somewhere live under an assumed name if you ever get to know peter van effen really know him i mean youll wonder why you ever asked that question anne you have an enchanting smile let me see it again she gave a puzzled halfsmile i dont understand hes coming back let me see how good an actress you are and indeed when van effen returned to the table she was smiling a person at ease with the world when she looked up and saw the expression more accurately the total lack of expression on his face she stopped smiling about to ruin our dinner are you peterde graaf shook his head and such a splendid meal weve ordered not quite van effen smiled faintly alright put us off our third bottle of bordeaux or burgundy or whatever perhaps even the second bottle first let me put you briefly in the picture as to what happened earlier today yes sir ill have some wine i feel i could do with a mild restorative ive been offered a job at im sure a far higher salary plus than im ever likely to get in this police force to blow something up what i dont know could be the amsterdamrotterdam bank for all i know maybe a boat bridge barge barracks maybe anything havent been told yet as you know vasco had brought those two characters to the hunters horn this afternoon prosperous and respectable citizens but then no successful criminal ever looks like one we were all very cagey and crafty toingandfroing sparring and giving nothing away for most of the time then they made me this definite offer of a job and i accepted they said they would have to report back to their superiors but would definitely contact me tomorrow and give me details of the job to be done and what my rewards would be for this vasco was to be the courier so we shook hands like gentlemen and parted with expressions of goodwill and mutual trust i had two sets of tails waiting at a discreet distance from the hunters horn ive had a report goodwill and mutual trust annemarie said de graaf waved a hand we tend to use figurative terms in our profession proceed peter ive had news of both sets of tails the first say that they lost agnelli and paderiwski thats what they called themselves good god de graaf said agnelli and paderiwski a famous industrialist and a famous pianist arent they original thats what i thought lost them in a traffic jam they say claimed that they hadnt been sported pure accident the report about the other two makes me wonder to say the least about the other twode graaf said not from about they were found in a darkened alley barely able to call for help barely conscious unable to move and both in agony both men had had both kneecaps smashed a sign used in sicily and certain american cities that some people dont like being followed and that those who were doing the following wont be doing it again for same time to come they wont on those kneecapped no guns iron bars theyre under surgery neither man will he able to walk for months neither will ever be able to walk properly again nice isnt it sir and a new development in our fair city another instance one supposes of the steady advance of american culture crippled annemaries voice was low barely above a whisper crippled for life how can you how can you joke about such things im sorry van effen looked at her saw that some colour had gone from her face and pushed her glass closer to her take some ill join you joking i can assure you i never felt less funny in my life and its not just an american practice sir its become a very popular pastime in northern ireland in the past two or three years so your other tails were almost certainly given the slip and nothing accidental about it de graaf sampled his bordeaux and the distressing news didnt appear to have upset him unduly for he smacked his lips appreciatively excellent our friends seem to have a considerable expertise in both evasive and direct action professionals and gone to ground ah all is not lost the chateaubriand you said you would share this with me my dear she appeared to give a tiny shudder i know its trite silly but i dont think i could eat a thing maybe the moles will come out of their burrows tomorrow van effen said im still hoping that they will keep their promise and make contact with me annemarie stared at him almost blankly you must be mad she said in a low voice she seemed genuinely puzzled either theyll come and give you the same treatment perhaps worse perhaps dispose of you permanently or they wont come at all after they carried out that savage attack on those poor men they could have examined them and found out that they were policemen they must have been carrying something that would identify them as policemen even guns were they carrying guns van effen nodded then theyll know you are a policeman because theyll know youmust have had them followed since they left the hunters horn you like the idea of suicide she reached out and touched de graafs wrist you mustnt let him do it sir hell be killed your concern does you credit it was van effen who answered and he seemed quite unmoved by her plea but quite uncalled for the villains dont necessarily know that i set the tails on their tracks they might not even have noticed them until long after theyd left the hunters horn and would have no reason to connect me with them thats one thing the other thing is the fact that though the colonel is your fathers friend that doesnt give the fathers daughter the right to advise the colonel a fledgling policewoman a chief of police it would be laughable if it werent so presumptuous she looked at win her eyes hurt as if she had been struck then lowered her gaze to the tablecloth de graaf looked at van effen shook his head slightly then took the girls hand your concern does do you credit it does but it doesnt give me much credit in your eyes none look at me she looked at him the hazel eyes at once solemn and apprehensive van effen is absolutely correct the foxes have to be flushed from their covers and this at the moment seems the only way to do it so peter will go i would never order him to go and with my consent good heavens girl do you think i would use him as live bait a lamb to the slaughter a daniel in the lions den a tethered goat for the tiger my word i do have a way with metaphors i guarantee my girl that when and if the meeting does take place both the hunters horn and the surrounding area will be alive with invisible armed men invisible to the ungodly peter will be as safe as a man in a church i know im silly im sorry pay no attention to the colonels comforting words van effen said i shall probably be riddled with bullets police bullets unless its pointed out to them that im in disguise ironic if they shot the wrong man same outfit as before just let them concentrate on the black glove thats me a waiter approached their table sorry lieutenant theres another call for you van effen was back inside two minutes well no surprise surprise the fff again mysterious message no doubt stepping up their demoralizing campaign they say there could be some havoc wreaked along the north holland canal tomorrow at alkmaar at am but they have made no guarantee that there will be all they have promised is that there will be some quite considerable activity de graaf said that was all all i see seems utterly pointless and meaningless what the devil do you think theyre up to now its not pointless thats just the point to make us wonder and worry about just what the devil they are up to now they want to create uncertainty confusion and demoralization and it would seem to me that theyre going the right way about it speaking of the fff sir how was your pleasure trip to texel this afternoon complete waste of time i was accompanied as you more or less predicted by a bunch of old women you dont intend to be at alkmaar at am tomorrow i intend to be in amsterdam at am tomorrow what am i supposed to do lurk around and nab anyone who looks as if he is acting suspiciously such as gloating over the scene of the crime an unpromising course of action youve got friends in the university sir specifically in the linguistics department de graaf said to annemarie im supposed to look startled at this sudden switch and ask why on earth do you ask that he looked at van effen well why on earth do you ask that i listened to the fffs tapes in the tekgraphs office earlier on this evening a womans voice a young woman i would say and not dutch im sure interesting very back to our mysterious foreigners again any educated guesses as to the country of origin of the caller thats the trouble sir i speak the odd language sure but im not what you might call an educated linguist regional accents nuances pronunciation that is quite definitely not my field and you think the university could help its a chance sir as you say no stone unturned the tapes are in my office ill do what i can you may as well get to your feet peter a purposeful waiter comes your way van effen rose met the waiter spoke briefly and moved on when he took his seat again he said the opposition is stirring whatever opposition that might be that was my hotel the trianon message relayed through the office of course de graaf said patientlyand how long have you been staying in the trianon lieutenant you have been evicted from your own apartment the register book says that i have been there for two weeks i arranged that about five oclock this afternoon dear dear falsifying register books is a civil offence ive no time to be arrested at the moment romero agnew or one of his men must have been very busy phoning around and have at last located me as staying at the trianon they have posted a watcher in the shadows in a little old fiat actually i have arranged for another watcher to watch the original well i cant disappoint them i shall turn up there later on tonight you lead an active life de graaf said i assume that you do not intend to spend the night there you assume correctly sir i shall park my car at the back of the hotel where i shall be picked up by a police taxi and deposited at the front door t hen i pass through the hotel exit by the rear entrance and drive home its a nuisance no more and here againde graaf saidcomes your own private and personal nuisance my word you are popular tonight van effen looked sighed rose spoke briefly to the waiter again and disappeared towards the telephone booths the same opposition stirs yet again he said on his return ah a brandy thank you sir that was sergeant westenbrink vasco message again via the office of course agnelli has been in touch with him they would they say very much like to meet me at ii am tomorrow morning same place this can mean one of two things i know what it meansde graaf said either theyre on to us or theyre not on to us it is quite possible that they had no idea that they were being shadowed ever since leaving the hunters horn this afternoon on the other hand its perfectly possible that they did know if they did they can have only one purpose in wanting to meet you to see how much you know what danger your knowledge offers and how best they can eliminate this danger it should i imagine be all very discreet and if they suspect you and suspect that you in turn suspect them theyre being clever for in that case one would have expected them to opt for a neutral rendezvous for if they suspect youre an undercover policeman or working as an agent for the police then they must automatically suspect that the hunters horn is a police hangout but of course to go elsewhere would be to tip their hand that they know de graaf sighed all very devious and complicated designed to spread confusion and doubt on all hands maybe theyve been taking lessons from the fff or vice versa another brandy peter no in that case i suggest we be on our way i expect we shall be having a rather long day tomorrow do you have any particular plan for this young lady tomorrow i shall think up some onerous task by and by as yet no um de graaf pondered you anne are of course seen quite often in the company of sergeant westenbrink she smiled i find it difficult to think of him other than as vasco yes of course we have to talk and it seems the best and also the easiest thing to do it openly quite do you come and go as you like there of course thats the whole point of being us no hours no rules no regulations you do as you like youre as free as the air it would cause no undue comment if you were not to turn up for a day even two days no she hesitated am i supposed to be intelligent and guess what youre getting at sir youre intelligent enough its just that you lack the training and experience to have a nasty devious suspicious mind such as is possessed by lieutenant van effen and i hope you always will annemarie shook her head almost imperceptibly then looked questioningly at van effen who said the colonel is right you know i dont know that is im sure hes right but i dont know what hes right about if youre having fun with me i dont think its very fair we arent having fun with you annemarie teasing or diminishing people is not our idea of having a good time look all this is a matter of connections its at least possible id say a fiftyfifty chance that agnelli and company are on to us in that case vasco is also under suspicion because he introduced them to me and because you are known to associate with vasco you in turn come under suspicion what the colonels suggesting is that you lie low for a day maybe even two depends how things develop i have the feeling irrational perhaps that the development is going to be very rapid indeed its not a pleasant thought for the colonel or myself that you should fall into those peoples hands think of those two detectives the tails who ran out of luck we already know that those people are ruthless that the inflicting of pain is a matter of indifference to them it may even be a downright pleasure how would you care to be taken by them and tortured i am not trying to scare you annemarie im talking about something thats halfway between a possibility and a probability i think ive already told you her voice was very quiet im not particularly brave and then theyd know who it was they had on their hands theyd be over the moon another lovely blackmailing trump in their hands in addition to their still undisclosed trumps apart from your own health youd be putting us in an impossibly difficult situation couldnt have put it better myself de graaf said she smiled faintly im a coward ill do what im told not told my dear not told de graaf said just a suggestion again the faint smile it sounds like a very good suggestion to me where shall i stay with julie of course van effen said an unobtrusive armed guard will be lurking in the vicinity but before you go into purdah as it were theres one thing i want you to do for me i of course i want you to go to vasco in the morning tell him what weve told you and tell him to disappear i know where hell disappear to and ill contact him there when its safe to ill do that she was silent for a moment when you asked me to do something for yon and i said of course well i wish now i hadnt you see what youve done to me peter im a quivering wreck youre not quivering and for a wreck you look in pretty good shape to me you may be jumped on there and then your gallant fellow krakers would look the other way yes we are accustomed to those injustices are we not colonel nothing will happen to you youll be under constant surveillance and by constant i mean sixty seconds every minute the trusty lieutenant van effen suitably disguised not the hunters horn disguise of course and lumbered with his usual arsenal theres a thought for you colonel i think ill carry a third din tomorrow when i meet agnelli and his friend or friends they already know that that you carry two gl ns de graaf said and so their minds will of course be preconditioned against the idea of you carrying a third itll be in your book of course of course its not one mustnt put such thoughts in the minds of the criminal element but yes thats the idea so no problem annemarie i wont be further away than five metres at any time thats nice but youve put all sorts of unpleasant thoughts in my head i could be jumped on in your words anywhere and any time between here and julies house more injustice no worry i will transport you there in the safety and comfort of my own limousine limousine de graaf said comfort my god he bent a solicitous eye on the girl you have i trust not forgotten your air cushion i dont understand sir you will they left the restaurant and walked along the street until they came to the colonels car parked as usual in a no parking area de graaf kissed the girl in what he probably regarded as an avuncular fashion said goodnight and climbed into his gleaming mercedes the back seat of his mercedes colonel de graaf inevitably had a chauffeur annemarie said i understand now what the colonel meant about an air cushion a trifling inconvenience van effen said im having it fixed orders the colonel complains the colonel does like his comforts doesnt he it may not have escaped your attention that he was built for comfort hes very kind isnt he kind and courteous and considerate its no hardship to be all those things when the object of them is as beautiful as you you do have a nice turn of speech lieutenant yes i do rather she was quiet for a moment then said but he is rather a snob isnt he a fearful snob in the interests of discipline i must speak severely you cant expect me to condone far less agree with denigrating remarks about our chief of police that wasnt meant to be denigrating it was just an observation i refuse to get to the stage where i must watch every word i say this is still an open society or is it well well go on say it spoken with spirit or something like that i dont think i will but youre about as wrong with your snobbism as you were about your warmhearted arthur bit arthur our chiefs first name never uses it ive never figured out why regal connotations sure hes kind and thoughtful hes also tough shrewd and ruthless which is why he is what he is and hes no snob snobs pretend to be what they are not his is a very ancient very aristocratic and very wealthy lineage which is why youll never find me contesting a restaurant bill with him he was born with the knowledge that he was different the one per cent of the one per cent never occurs to him to question it hes convinced that he radiates the spirit of democracy tough or not snob or not i like him she spoke as if that settled the matter without specifying what the matter was arthur as you may have observed has a way with the ladies especially when hes offduty which is what he considered himself to be tonight are you never offduty am i always a policewoman never thought about it that way but i will think about it i mean youre too kind she lapsed into silence and remained that way for the rest of the drive only van effen spoke he called up his office and requested an armed guard for his sisters house it was not difficult to understand why de graaf had said that julie van effen was his favourite lady in all amsterdam with hair dark and shining as a ravens wing a delicately moulded face and high rather slavonic cheekbones she was far more than just merely goodlooking but her attraction for de graaf as for a great many others almost certainly lay in her laughing dark eyes and laughing mouth she was almost permanently goodhumoured except when she encountered injustice cruelty meanness selfishness and quite a few other things of which she disapproved when she could become very stormy indeed and seemed to love the whole world with the exception of those who encountered her formidable disapproval she was one of those rare people who radiated happiness a quality that more than tended to conceal the fact that below it all lay a fine intelligence cabinet ministers do not habitually employ dimwitted secretaries and julie was a cabinet ministers secretary private personal confidential and discreet she was also very hospitable and wanted to cook them a meal as soon as they had entered it was easy to believe that this multitalented young lady was also a cordon bleu chef which in fact she was she then offered sandwiches and desisted only when she learned that they had already eaten the dikker en thijs was it well the police always did know how to look after themselves for a working girl its new herring red cabbage and sausage for this particular working girl van effen said its the ministerial canteen a gourmets paradise so im told we cops arent allowed near the place of course julie alas has no willpower well youve only to look julie had in fact as nearly perfect a figure as it was possible to imagine she treated this badinage with a lofty contempt ruffled his hair in the passing and went to the kitchen to prepare some coffee and a cafe schnapps annemarie looked after her departing form turned to van effen and smiled she can wrap you round her little finger any time cant she any time and any dayvan effen said cheerfully and alas she knows it minx is the word for her something i have to show you in case youre in the house alone he led her to a picture on the wall and pushed it to one side to reveal a red button set flush with the wallpaper whats known to the trade as a personal attack button if you think youre in danger suspect it or even sense it you press this button a patrol car will be here within five minutes she tried to make light of it every housewife in amsterdam should have one of those as there are a hundred thousand housewives in amsterdam maybe two for all i know it would come a mite expensive of course she looked at him and didnt or couldnt smile any more ive been with the two of you a few times now and one would have to be blind and deaf not to realize that youre just potty about your kid sister tut tut i can but sigh is it so obvious i hadnt finished you didnt have that installed just because you love her shes in danger isnt she dangerhe caught her by the shoulders so tightly that she winced sorry he eased hi s grip but left his hands where they were now do you know well she is isnt she in danger i mean who told you julie no the colonel yes this evening she looked at him her gaze moving from one eye to the other youre not angry are you no no my dear im not angry just worried im not a healthy person to know julie knows about the danger of course does she know about the postcards he looked at her thoughtfully and didnt change his expression as she put her hands on his shoulders and made as if to shake him in exasperation which was a silly thing to do as van effen was built along very solid lines well does she yes it would be difficult for her not to the postcards come to this address one of the annecy brothers ways of getting to me dear god this this is dreadful how how can she be so so happy she put her head against his shoulder as if she was suddenly tired how can she the old saying i suppose better to laugh than to cry youre not about to cry are you no the old saying doesnt quite apply here she always was a happy child only now she has to work at it julie came in with coffee stopped abruptly and cleared her throat isnt it a little early in the evening she laid the tray down i hope the deafness is a temporary affliction i said she stopped again the expression on her face showing her concern moved swiftly to where they stood put an arm round annemarie and gently turned her head until she could see her face tears full of tears she pulled a lace handkerchief from her sleeve cuff whats this ruffian been up to this ruffian hasnt been up to anything van effen said mildly annemarie knows everything julie marianne the kids you me the annecys the colonel ill be bound youll be bound right julie said i know annemarie its a shock to come all at once its a shock at least it came to me bit by bit come i have the sovereign remedy a double schnapps in your coffee youre very kind if i could be excused she turned and walked quickly from the room well there was a demanding note in julies voice dont you see what youve done me van effen was genuinely perplexed what am i supposed to have done now it was the colonel its not what you have done its what you havent done she put her hands on his shoulders and her voice went soft its what you havent seen i see i mean i dont see van effen was cautious what havent i seen you clown julie shook her head annemarie her heart is in her face in her eyes that girls in love with you what youre not well thats what it is my beloved brilliant dolt of a brother but dont believe me ask her to marry you now a special licence which you can obtain at the drop of a hat and youd be married by midnight van effen looked slightly dazed pretty sure of yourself arent you no im not im absolutely certain but she hardly knows me im aware of that after all youve only met her what twenty thirty forty times she shook her head the feared interrogator the writer of books on psychology the man who can lay bare the innermost secrets of any mind with one piercing glance well a hundred per cent for theory zero for practice youre a fine one to talk specialist in marriage counselling or should i say matchmaking ha six marriage proposals for certain could have been twenty for all i know and you turned them all down there indeed speaks the voice of experience dont try to change the subject she smiled sweetly yes indeed there speaks the voice of experience i didnt love any of them she is deeply in love with you i dont quite understand why i need a schnapps van effen opened a nearby cupboard ive just brought you a cafe schnapps first of al i i need a schnapps then i need a aft schnapps not a psychiatrist why do you think shes so upset shes softhearted thats why you should make a splendid match soft heart soft head she took his head between her hands and studied his eyes carefully the hawkeyed detective lieutenant what you need is a pair of glasses and youve missed your cue havent you half a dozen times at least what cue oh dear that wary hunted look makes you more criminal than cop what cue i wouldnt marry her if she were the last girl in the world should have been your answer to the cue standard reaction i believe she smiled again but of course youre not standard oh shut up a well reasoned answer she sat and took up her coffee mental myopia i believe its incurable oh i dont know im sure youll find the answer van effen was his old self calm assured relaxed and very much back on balance i dont particularly care for cool clinical slightly superior slightly amused doctors but i have to admit youve effectively worked a cure in my case youve cured me of any interest i might ever have had in that young lady or maybe that was what you wanted i dont know she was looking at him with parted lips and uncomprehending eyes i dont need i dont want i should say help advice or sympathy from you and not just because theyre uncalledfor unhelpful unwanted or unsolicited but because im perfectly capable of managing my own life without the assistance of a meddlesome young sister ill go check if the guard is here he went out leaving julie to stare numbly at the door hed closed behind him disconsolate and disbelieving and she was still in the sam e position still gazing sightlessly at the door the same expression of hurt and bafflement on her face when annemarie came into the room annemarie stopped looked in puzzlement at the unhappy face hurried across the room to julies chair dropped to her knees and said whats wrong julie whats wrong julie looked away from the door and slowly turned her head nothing nothings wrong nothings wrong oh god nothing first me then you tears and you look you look so woebegone annemarie hugged her nothing wrong julie dont treat me like an idiot im the idiot ive just made a mistake you i dont believe it mistake what mistakeo the mistake of forgetting that peter is not only my brother hes a policeman and heir apparent to the colonel you didnt know that did you julie sniffled common knowledge de graaf is due to retire this year but hes in no hurry to retire as long as peter is already doing most of his job for him never mind the colonel wheres that ruffian julie tried to smile second time tonight hes been called a ruffian by two different girls ill bet its never happened before hes left gone gone for the night no just to check on the guard julie smiled again a more successful effort this time he may be gifted at reducing people to team but im sure he cares for us hes got a funny way of showing it what did he do to you julie what did he say do nothing of course say i stepped out of line i guess and he brought me back into line thats all you expect me to be satisfied with that no i dont my dear but can we leave it just for the moment please they had finished their coffee by the time van effen had returned he appeared to find nothing amiss or if he did chose not to comment on it guards herehe said armed to the teeth and i have to go now but your coffee another time i am as they say summoned forth julie theres something you must do for me could you must she smiled an order or request what does that matter rarely for him van effen was irritated do what i ask please note the please or ill take annemarie away with me my word such threats and if she chooses to remain here or i ask her to stay rotterdam tomorrow morning expolicewoman you dont disobey orders in the police and remain on the force sorry annemarie that was not directed at you julies not being very bright tonight dont look shocked little sister if you cant see im serious then youve become uncommonly stupid develop diplomatic flu for the next day or two anne marie is in as much danger as you are and i want the two of you here together annemarie ninefifteen he went to the door and opened it looked at the two solemn faces and shook his head exit the gallant lieutenant into the dark and dreadful night he closed the door quietly behind him four the tall thin young man in the dark and dripping raincoat would rarely have called for more than a passing glance or a comment on the fact that he did look rather unprepossessing an impression increased by the black hair plastered to his head by the heavy rain and that he sported an illtrimmed black moustache the moustache in fact had not been trimmed at all he had been in an unusual hurry that morning and had pasted it on ever so slightly askew he was standing almost in the middle of the square when he saw her angling across and coining almost directly towards him annemarie her war paint back in position again looked as miserable and bedraggled as the young man who now stepped out into her path annemarie is it her eyes widened and she looked quickly around despite the near torrential rain there were a fair number of people around and a flower and vegetable openair market only metres away she looked again at the young man who was smiling a rather pleasant smile despite his overall appearance please dont worry miss hardly the place where anyone would think to carry out a kidnapping you must be annemarie there couldnt be two people answering the description i was given im detective rudolph engelhe brought a badge from his pocket and showed it to her i could of course have stolen this lieutenant van effen wants to see you hes in his car why should i believe you why did he send you he knew where i was he could have come to see me what car does he have a black peugeot you would know that wouldnt you yes the young man was patient when youve worked under someone for five years you do know something about him the lieutenant said to me miss meijer is very suspicious mention the amazon her father the colonel and someones lack of courage i have no idea what he meant i do she took his arm im sorry van effen relaxed behind the wheel of his car was this morning sporting a homburg hat and a big black square beard of the type favoured by sephardic jews he looked round as annemarie opened the passenger door and looked in good morning my dear good morning he says what are you doing here sheltering from the rain its coming down in buckets you must have noticed come in come in she sat down and looked at him accusingly five metres you said never more than five metres away sixty seconds in every minute thats what you said where were you your promise to look after me fine promise man proposes god disposes if van effen was remorse stricken he concealed it well besides you were being looked after by proxy dont tell me you didnt see a rather elderly gentleman hanging around slightly stooped grey beard grey coat and a white stick he was looking after you i saw him that creature he couldnt have looked after a kitten whatever that means that creature is young fit a judo expert and a very accurate shot beards she almost muttered beards moustaches thats all they can think of disguises well thank you someone was there but you broke your promise it was politic to do so i was close behind and you were less than a hundred metres from your rendezvous when i caught sight of no other than mr paderiwski following you even more closely than i was mr paderiwski is shrewd observant and doesnt like me which is a nasty combination he might just have recognized me especially when i was in close attendance on you i had taken the precaution of taking two of my detectives with me think nothing of the fact that we obviously care so much about you and i decided discretion was the better part of foolhardiness hence the switch engel said through van effens open window anything further sir no not here dont lose sight of our friend well ive already seen him sir there cant be another bald pepper and salt beard with a squint around julius caesar annemarie said none other i didnt tell rudolph here what his name was he wouldnt have believed me a close but not too close eye on our julius and make sure there are always a few people around id rather lose him than lose you dont forget what happened to your two colleagues yesterday i wont forget sir the expression on his face was testimony enough to that he turned and walked away into the rain mollified van effen started the engine and drove off a bit she smiled a little did you have to tell him i was a coward i did not someone was i said it doesnt matter because i am i dont like riding around in this car for instance it takes time to get seats fixed and whats that got to do please i mean that this car is known to criminals i mean pfui theres a couple of hundred like this in the city she said sweetly theres a couple of hundred with the same licence plates whats that got to do with anything you know the licence number of this car more or less rotterdam three nines we are trained to be observant remember but not observant enough to notice that these were clipon plates not screwed today this car is registered in paris with a big f at the side to prove it i have access to an unlimited number of plates she made a face but said nothing you should be interested in more important things such as the latest antics of the fff yes there were no antics they didnt blow the dyke of the north holland canal they called in to both the papers and the police less than ten minutes ago positively hugging themselves they are said they never promised they would blow the canal which is quite true only that there would be considerable activity in that area at nine oclock this morning there were they reported scenes of very considerable activity which is again quite true all rescue and repair teams were there waiting as were considerable numbers of police and army not to mention air force helicopters they claimed to have taken a good number of aerial photographs of the scenes just for keepsakes you believe that too certainly i have no reason to disbelieve it but aerial photographs how could that be possible it would be all too simple im afraid there would be any amount of helicopters buzzing about there this morning an extra one wouldnt be noticed especially if as is highly likely it was carrying some official markings what was the reason behind this pointless and idiotic exercise it was far from being idiotic and very much to the point just in case we missed the point they spelt it out very clearly they said that in the space of twentyfour hours they had reduced the country most especially the authorities to a state of frustrated helplessness the socalled authorities they had a number of cynical and very unpleasant remarks to make about the government the police the army and those whose duty it was to look after the safety and welfare of dykes locks weirs sluices dams and i forget what else were totally powerless to do anything to stop them ad they had to do they said was to stop at home stick a pin into a map phone the papers sit back and never go within a hundred kilometres but still guarantee that the law the army the repair and rescue teams would be out in full force it was they said both an entertaining and gratifying situation one can readily understand why they feel that way and not a word about their purposes no hint as to what lies behind it all no hint but a suggestion that we might soon know what their demands are going to be they didnt use the word demands but they can have meant nothing else tomorrow they said they were going to flood a really large area of the country and after that they would probably have talks with the government can you imagine the sheer cold arrogance of it all they speak as if they are an independent sovereign state next one supposes theyll be calling for an open debate in the uno he glanced at his watch plenty of time two minutes to remove this outfit no washing or soaking required and five minutes to put on my hunters horn uniform i suggest coffee she put a hand on his arm you really are going there arent you peter of course ive said so somebody has to and as i am the only person whos been in contact with them it has to be me how else do you think the law would ever get anywhere unless its prepared just once in a while to take the initiative i wish you werent going i feel certain something is going to happen something awful you could be hurt even killed or maybe even worse crippled for life you know what they dd to those two men oh peter she was silent for a moment then said if i were your wife id stop you how i dont know she said miserably appeal to your better nature love for me something like for my sake if you care about me please dont go something clever like that she said bitterly well youre not my wife and even if you were id still go im sorry that sounds hard and selfish and cruel but its my job and i have to go he put his hand on her arm youre a very kind girl and i do appreciate your concern kind concern she caught his wrist and gently removed his hand from her arm concern annemarie van effens surprise was genuine what on earths wrong nothing just nothing van effen gazed ahead for some moments sighed and said i dont think ill ever understand women i dont think so either she seemed to hesitate then said i dont much fancy going to a coffeeshop if you wish we wont but why not i dont much care for wearing this face in public where there are decent people around it doesnt matter back there and i dont think you are particularly keen on being seen among the same public with a freak like me i know what lies behind the war paint so it doesnt matter to me he paused maybe i dont know anything about women but i always know when theyre telling fibs im telling fibs of course you are well yes i am cant we have coffee at julies place its only another five minutes sure time i have i know youre very fond of julie but are you also worried about her i think shes worried about me even though she knew you would be there she didnt like the idea of my going back to that place you didnt answer my question youre not perhaps well just a little bit worried about her she remained silent the annecy brothers would you believe ive never even seen either of them i regard them as a fairly distant menace the menace im thinking of is a great deal nearer to home well not menace problem rather this is something new on me a bagatelle whatever it is give me the name of this person or problem and ill attend to it indeed lieutenant something in the tone of her voice caught van effens attention and he gave her a long speculative look and how do you attend to this bagatelle when the bagatelle in question is yourself ah me again i dont suppose theres any point in repeating the old complaining question which is what what the bell am i supposed to have done this time by your standards i suppose absolutely nothing i detect a certain sarcasm or is it irony ive noticed an increasing use of it not becoming annemarie you should do something about it well what have i done reduced a lovely girl to team not once but three times and when i say lovely i dont just mean beautiful i mean the nicest kindest warmest person ive ever met three times but its as i said by your standards a bagatelle julie julie who else would i mean or do you have a whole collection of ladies that you go around reducing to tears whats she crying about whats she i dont know what to say i cant believe youre cruel indifferent but dont you care that shes upset of course i care id care more if i knew why she was upset i wonder youll think it funny for one thing you left last night without a goodnight hug and kiss youve never done that before she says funny its ludicrous my men getting hospitalized a gang of lunatics threatening to inundate our country another gang of lunatics wanting to hire me to blow up the palace or whatever nations toppling and im supposed to be worried about smooches a bagatelle soon fix that of course you will a double ration of affectionate farewells georgie porgy pudding and pie kissed the girls and made them cry shakespeare english nursery rhyme her voice was very curt indeed perhaps a bagatelle what does matter is that she says she hurt two people she loves because she was meddlesome i suppose she means you and me said she thought she was helping but that she was too clever or too stupid for her own good thats her problem a little bit of selfanalysis never did anyone any harm selfanalysis you told her she was interfering and too smart for her own good anybodys good julie told you that of course she didnt shes too loyal misplaced loyalty perhaps julie would never have said that shes too unselfish to think about herself but it sounds exactly like you ill say im sorry very very sorry and of course youll tell her that i told you to no i must say ws a sad thing to be held in such low esteem by two ladies you love the lieutenant is pleased to be flippant she said coldly flippancy never you dont believe me no i dont believe you i care very much about you but as a matter of principle and in the interests of discipline a barrier must remain between the officer class and rankers oh shut up the tone was one of pure exasperation the principle doesnt seem to be standing up very well van effen said gloomily and the barriers flat so much for discipline annemarie give no indication that she had heard a word hed said julie polite but reserved had gone to make coffee annemarie had headed for the bath and van effen spoke to the guard a man called thyssen who assured him that all was quiet and that the man he had relieved had had a similarly uneventful night julie entered the livingroom just as he did she was still quiet and unsmiling julie yes im sorry for what ive hurt my julie you hurt how thats right make it easy for me i know youve been upset most likely still are annemarie told me did she tell you why no but it didnt take my analytical mind the one youre always denigrating very long to figure it out in retrospect i could have been n ore tactful but things on my mind lots of things apart from those things youre upset annemarie is upset because youre upset and im upset because the two of you are upset ive got to go out and see some desperate criminals and i cant afford to be upset i have to be careful crafty cunning calculating watchful and ruthless and i cant be any of those things if im upset and ill only be upset if you insist on remaining upset so youll have me on your conscience for the rest of your life if something happens to me such as being shot in the head thrown off a high building or drowned in a canal are you still upset she came close to him linked her hands behind his neck and put her head on his shoulder of course i am not because of last night but because of what youve just said youre the only brother i have and i suppose i have to love someone she tightened her grip one of those days the gallant lieutenant is going to go out into what the gallant lieutenant calls the dreadful night and the gallant lieutenant is not going to come back this is the morning julie please you know what i mean i feel fey peter i feet something dreadful is going to happen today she tightened her grip even more i do so wish you werent going out id do anything in the world to stop you you know that this is not the first time that ive felt this way i mean its been three or four times and ive been right every time change your appointment peter please darling i know i just know how i wont feel this way tomorrow ill come back julie i love you you love me i know youd be terribly sad if i didnt come back so ill have to come back wont v please peter please julie julie he smoothed her hair you lot certainly do wonders for my morale what do you mean you lot annemaries been at it too feeling fey i mean prophesying death doom and disaster you can imagine how this cheers me up no end tell you what a compromise i promise you i wont be lured astray by any bad men or go anywhere with them from the hunters horn ill listen to what they say then make my plans accordingly basically i think that ill arrange to meet them again at a time and place of my own choosing this being after ive learnt what their plans are for me or their evil intentions so a deal if you promise me one of your cordon bleu lunches finest french wines of course for one oclock ill promise ill be here at one still with her hands linked behind his neck she leaned back and looked at him you will just said so your eyes are funny about to weep salt tears for the gallant lieutenant i was thinking about it she smiled ive changed my mind ill think about the lunch menu instead annemarie came in she was wearing a bathrobe that was much too large for her and a towel wound around her presumably still very wet hair she smiled and said its difficult to move around this house without interrupting private conversations sorry i look such a fright you can frighten me at any time van effen said cheerfully she really isnt too bad looking is she julie shes the most beautiful girl youve ever seen in my profession you dont get to see many girls beautiful or otherwise he looked at julie consideringly youre not too bad yourself but then im used to your face its a tossup and who am i to quibble in or at such company it pleases the lieutenant to be carefree and lighthearted julie annemarie said acidly he was anything but this morning what have you done to him weve been conducting a mutual admiration party van effen said no we havent and i havent been appealing to his better nature either i wouldnt know where to look for that i think maybe were slightly unfair to the poor man both you and it seems have been full of bad omens and predicting all sorts of awful things that are going to happen to him he was just suffering from some gloom and despondency thats all he wasnt the only oneannemarie said your cloud seems to have lifted a bit too youre choking me van effen said ah she unclasped her hands peter says he isnt going to do anything brave today just going to the hunters horn meeting whoever is there make arrangements for another meeting and then leave going to find out what their plans for him are thing is hes going directly there where hell be guarded by heaven knows how many armed detectives and coming directly back again annemarie smiled her relief as obvious as julies that is good the smile slowly varnished flow do you know hell keep his word a police officers word van effen began because hes coming back at one oclock for lunch extra special french wines he knows what im like if anyone is late for my meals far less misses them besides id never cook for him again banned for life no not that ill be back guaranteed annemarie said is he coming for us or for the lunch the lunch of course us he can see any time not or andvan effen said a peaceful hour i may well be called upon to attend to something about two oclock the fff i mean i thought annemarie said that they werent going to do anything until some undisclosed time tomorrow i was about to tell you i was interrupted julie said somebody interrupted you she did she was either being fey like you or getting on to me about something or other what annemarie said how can one remember one instance out of so many however the fff promise to entertain us at two oclock this afternoon same place on the north holland canal north of alkmaar as promised this morning they say the mines have been planted since yesterday that they elected not to fire them and defy us to find them and also the hagestein sluice the what julie said a sluice technically i believe a regulable weir concrete structure to control the flow of water south of utrecht on the lower rhine they may attack one or the other they say or both or neither the old uncertainty principle well time to dress for my appointment he squeezed his sisters shoulders kissed her did the same to an astonished annemarie said someone has to uphold the law and left julie looked at the closed door and shook her head there are times i feel when someone should pass a law against him van effen attired as he had been for his visit the previous afternoon parked his car not the peugeot in a side street three blocks away from the hunters horn and made his way to the back entrance of the restaurant as the hunters horn was situated in a far from salubrious area this door was kept permanently locked van effen had the key he entered passed into the semidarkness of the passageway beyond and had just relocked the door when something hard jabbed with painful force into the small of his back dont move van effen didnt move he said who is it police you have a name raise your hands a torch flicked on behind him jan see if he has a gun hands fumbled at his jacket and he felt his shoulder holstered gun being removed van effen said so my hands are up my gun is gone may i turn round very well van effen turned is that the way sergeant koenis to teach your men to search for weapons he lowered his hands and hitched up his trousers there was an ankle holster each with its lilliput attached to each leg put on the overhead light the light came on the man with the gun said good god lieutenant van effen sorry about that sir just as long as you didnt shoot me full of holes sergeant nothing to be sorry for semidark and with my back to you my trademarks scar and black glove werent visible and of course you werent expecting me to enter this way im just glad to see that you and your men are so on the alert i didnt even recognize your voice cheek padding i must admit it does alter the voice somewhat how many men do you have here sergeant five sir two with machine pistols and in the street outside another five behind firstfloor windows another two machine pistols very gratifying to see that the colonel places so high a value on his lieutenant he turned to the young policeman who field the gun in his hand do you think i could have my property back yes sir sorry sir of course the policeman was highly embarrassed i wont make that mistake again i know you wont go and ask henri if hell come here henris the sadlooking man behind the bar when henri appeared lugubrious as ever he said i hear youve been held at gunpoint peter must have been a rather unusual experience for you my fault i forgot to tell the sergeant that you had your own key never expected you to come that way no harm customers how many three only and yes theyre regulars any more come in when you and your visitors are talking and ill keep them well away no one will be able to hear a word you say except you of course henri almost smiled except me the gentleman who was here said they wouldnt find the microphone even they looked for it he asked me if i could find it and i couldnt not in my own bar he said he thought it was highly unlikely that they would look anyway i think so too switch on the recorder in the office as soon as they come through the door i shall be off now and make a respectable entrance through the front door theyve probably got someone watching van effen was sitting in the booth nearest the door when the three men entered agnelli in the lead van effen stood and shook hands with agnelli who seemed no less genial and friendly than he had on the previous occasion very pleased to meet you again mr danilov agnelli said helmut of course you know paderiwski didnt offer to shake hands and this is my brother leonardo leonardo agnelli did offer to shake hands hc bore no resemblance to his brother he was short squat and had black beetling brows the brows in themselves meant nothing hed just been born that way in his own ugly way he seemed just as harmless as his brother which again of course meant nothing introductions over van effen sat down agnelli and the other two men remained standing agnelli said this is your favourite booth mr danilov van effen looked slightly puzzled i dont have a favourite booth this is well its just the one furthest away from the rest of the customers i thought you might appreciate the privacy we do we do but would you mind if we went to another van effen gave them some more of the same puzzled frown not at ail but i think im entitled to know why stop i have it the concealed microphone a splendid basis for mutual trust he appeared to think briefly might have done the same myself youre an explosives expert agnelli sounded apologetic such people usually always i believe have a considerable knowledge of electronics van effen smiled stood moved out into the aisle and waved a hand toward the empty booth a thousand guilders to the first man to find the concealed microphone which ive just spent hours installing under the fascinated gaze of the proprietor and his customers a thousand guilders for a few seconds work i have a generous nature agnelli laughed in that case i dont think we need bother to move he sat and gestured that the other two should do the same not joining us mr danilov when im talking i of course i think well all have beer van effen ordered sat and said well gentlemen to the point certainly agnelli smiled thats the way i prefer it we have reported to our leader and he seems to approve our choice i had hoped to see him here this morning youll see him tonight at the dam square the royal palace to be precise part of which with your expert assistance we intend to blow up tonight what van effen spilled some of the beer which he had just picked up the royal palace you did say the royal palace i did youre mad youre quite mad van effen spoke with simple conviction we dont think so nor are we joking will you do it ill be damned if i will agnelli smiled his easy smile you have been overcome by a bout of righteousness a lawabiding upholder of justice and the straight and narrow path none of those things i must admit but you must understand that although i operate mainly outside the law and have a past that wouldnt bear rigorous examination in fact any kind of examination im a pretty normal citizen in most ways ive come to like the dutch and although i dont know them from adam ive come to respect even admire their royal family your sentiments do you credit mr danilov believe me i share them but i hardly think those are your real reasons for refusing you said yesterday afternoon that you would not become involved in any operation where there might arise even the danger of risk to limb far less to life is that not so van effen nodded i assure you no such risk will arise tonight then you just want to cause a harmless explosion inside the palace precisely and why in heavens name should you want to cause a harmless explosion inside the palace you are not to concern yourself with that it is as you may well guess a purely psychological gesture how am i to know it will be harmless youll be able to satisfy yourself on this score when you get there the explosion will take place inside an empty cellar there are empty cellars on either side of it all four doors are lockable and we will remove the keys after they have been locked there are also empty cellars above there is absolutely no danger to anyone involved theres danger to us the palace is heavily guarded word has it that the guards are likely to ask questions of an intruder after theyve shot him dead my aversion to people getting killed includes myself please mr danilov we are not simpleminded do i look like a person who would embark upon an operation like this without every detail being meticulously planned in detail beforehand ill grant that you dont then you may rest assured that we will encounter no trouble as an additional assurance both our leader and i will be there with you we have no more ambition to end up in durance vile than you have maybe your records are not so unblemished either unblemished or not it would go hard with anyone caught with explosives within the precincts of the palace very neat van effen sounded sour so now you know i have a record whereas i dont know whether you have or not it hardly matters does it if it does it escapes me at the moment itll probably come to me when its too late whats this bomb like im not sure agnelli smiled van effen had practically committed himself im not an explosives expert such talents as i have lie elsewhere more in the organizing field shall we say i understand that it weighs three or four kilos and is made of some material called amatol what are the cellars made of made of you mean the walls what else could i mean i really couldnt tell you i dont suppose it matters i was just trying to figure the blast effect if the cellars are deep and have those cellars are very deep so and with the palace on top theyll have to support a very considerable weight i dont know how old this particular part of the palace may be i know nothing about the palace but the walls would have to be pretty stoutly built reinforced concrete is unlikely dressed stone i should guess and of a considerable thickness your little firework is hardly likely to dent them au the people in the palace will be aware of is a slight shake if that a tremor that wouldnt raise any eyebrows at the nearest seismographic station wherever that may be as for the sound factor it would be negligible are you sure agnellis tone was unaccustomedly sharp if my assumptions are correct and i see no reason why they shouldnt be then im sure no loud bang they wouldnt hear it in the palace drawingrooms far less out in the dam square how could one ensure that it is heard bring along enough spare amatol let me have a look at the walls and ill tell you tell me is it your intention just to leave the explosive there lock the doors throw away the keys it will have occurred to you of course that there will be duplicates these we have and arrange for the bang after youre clear of the palace agnelli nodded then why on earth do you want me for a simple job like this ive little enough in the way of conscience but id feel downright guilty taking money for a job like this a young teenager in his first year in a physics or chemistry lab could do this all you require is a battery any old alarm clock some household flex a fulminate of mercury detonator a primer and youre off even simpler all you require is a length of slowburning rdx fuse what you dont want is an explosives expert me its a matter mr agnelli of professional pride this is a job for a professional its to be set off by remote radio control a teenager in his second year in a physics or chemistry lab cant you do yourselves for good reasons we want an expert the reasons are not for you you have the technical data for this radiocontrolled device a professional needs an instruction book only an amateur would ask a professional such a stupid question of course i need an instruction book as you call it but its not instructions i require these systems are not difficult if you know how they work problem is there are quite a number of different systems its not instructions i require but data as far as the device and the control are concerned i need to know such things as voltage wattage wavelength radio range type of detonator the nature of the triggering mechanism the type of shielding and a few other odds and ends you have this the data i mean we have i shall bring it along tonight you will not i have no wish to give offence mr agnelli but only a rank amateur would suggest that i start to learn about this device on the spot i want to be so thoroughly familiarized with the data that i can leave them all behind before i go near the place shall want those data at least an hour in advance or no deal i wouldnt insult you by making threats or blackmail i assume that a reasonable man recognizes a reasonable request he does well send it around at say sixthirty this evening fine van effen paused briefly well well we have been making diligent enquiries havent we it really wasnt very difficult we come now to the delicate question of remuneration although i did promise it would be on a generous scale you did mention the possibility of permanent employment i did then lets regard this as a test demonstration you know efficiency reliability professionalism if i measure up lets then discuss payment for future jobs fair and generous so fair in fact that i feel almost diffident about raising the next delicate point i would hare for you to embarrass yourself let me raise it for you this is more than generous my nature you have given me highly secret and very valuable information for which the police would doubtless reward me handsomely van effen knew from agnellis brief frown then renewed smile that he had indeed guessed correctly i shall not be giving this information to the police reasons one i am not a doublecrosser two i dont like the police and they dont like me i dont want to be within a long distance of any policemen three purely selfish and financial i am certain i can make a great deal more money from working for you on several occasions than i can from betraying you once four i do not wish to spend the rest of my life with a hit man or hit men only one step behind agnelli was sniffling very broadly now the fifth is the most compelling reason from what you have just told me you obviously have informers contacts inside the palace who would immediately alert you to the presence of the police as there could and would he only one person who could have betrayed you i could possibly be summarily disposed of although i think you would find it much more elegant to turn me over to the police and suggest that they have a look at extradition requests from poland and the united states i think i would prefer the states i might at least get a semblance of a fair trial there i am not wanted of course under the name of danilov but the description of villains is usually pretty thorough and there cant be many wanted men going round with a facial scar and a ruined left hand like mine you can understand mr agnelli why i shall be giving the police a very wide berth indeed i must say that you and the law dont appear to have a great deal in common thank you mr danilov for having done my delicate task for me that was exactly what i did have in mind i am quite sure that you are going to be a very valuable member of our team i can be trusted you think unquestionably then i am doubly honoured agnelli raised a questioning eyebrow i didnt have to remove the magazines from my guns today agnelli smiled stood shook hands and left with his two companions van effen went to the office listened to the playback of the recording expressed his satisfaction and thanks to henri pocketed the tape and left as had now become his custom van effen parked his car at the rear of the trianon but entered by the front door a nondescript little man seemingly engrossed in a newspaper was seated close by the desk van effen spoke to the man behind it id like a menu please he paid no attention to the seated man thank you he ticked off some items on the menu ill have that that and that and a bottle of burgundy in my room at twelvethirty please after that i dont want to be disturbed so no phone calls please id be glad if you would give me a wakeup call at four oclock van effen took the lift to the first floor walked down the stairs and peered cautiously round the comer the little man had gone he went across to the desk i see youve lost a valued customer charles hardly valued lieutenant he drinks one tiny jonge jenever once every hour or so thats his third time here since last night he is rather obvious isnt he he doesnt seem to think so will you cancel my lunch charles charles smiled already cancelled van effen left the trianon a few minutes later his appearance returned to normal well van effen said were you worried stiff about me of course not julie said you told us there was nothing to worry about liar you too me annemarie said i havent said a word yet you were about to your concern is perfectly understandable a jonge jenever large the very jaws of death i tell you tell us about brave daniel julie said in a moment first of all i must phone the colonel he will be consumed with anxiety about his trusty lieutenant its twelvethirty julie said if i know the colonel his only concern now is what aperitif hes going to have before lunch you do him an injustice and incidentally me he took the drink from his sister may i use your bedroom of course annemarie said i thought theres a phone there ab state secrets not at all come along both of you itll save me from having to repeat myself he sat down on julies bed opened a bedside cupboard and extracted a phone annemarie said thats a curiouslooking instrument scrambler phone any eavesdropper who is locked into your telephone hears only garbled nonsense a device at the recipients end works in reverse and makes the jumble intelligible again much used by secret services and the letter class of spy very popular with criminals too the original connection was to my apartment but i can also call de graaf on it he got through immediately good morning colonel no i have not been attacked kidnapped tortured assassinated or otherwise set upon quite the contrary positively cordial no there was a newcomer romero agnellis brother genial mafiatype quite friendly really rejoicing in the name of leonardo agnelli yes it is rather splendid isnt it and yes weve made some arrangements i am engaged to blow up the royal palace at eight pm no sir i do not jest he covered the mouthpiece and looked at the two startled wideeyed girls i think the colonels drink has gone down the wrong way yes sir amatol triggered by a remotecontrolled radio device details of which i shall be receiving this evening certainly i intend to do it theyre depending on me no its deep in the cellars there will be no loss of life very well he covered the mouthpiece with one hand and gave his empty glass to julie with the other im to keep a respectful silence while he communes with himself before telling me what to do i dont need telling and i almost certainly wont agree with what he suggests blowing up the royal palace she looked at julie who had just brought in the jenever bottle the palace blowing it up hes mad you youre a policeman a policemans lot is a hard one all things to all men yes im listening there was a long pause julie and annemarie studied his face covertly but closely but he gave no indication as to what he was thinking although he did permit himself the occasional thoughtful expression as he sipped some more jenever yes i understand alternatives first you can pull me off altogether and you have the means to ensure that i do this so of course i would have to accept that decision but theres a difference between pulling me off a job and putting me back on to it again should this prove to be the first in a series of bomb outrages and you know better than anyone that those things almost invariably happen in cycles then i should have to refuse to be assigned to the investigation on the grounds that i was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity to investigate this groups activities and you denied me the opportunity certainly sir you could ask for my resignation on the grounds of refusing to obey orders i would refuse to resign youd have to fire me and then of course you would have to explain to your minister that you fired me because you had made a mistake because you had refused to listen to me because you wouldnt give me the chance to stop what may be a new crime wave before it started because you had backed your own judgement against mine and you had been wrong throw as many chestnuts as you like into the fire colonel i refuse to pull them out and i refuse to resign excuse me sir julie had sat beside him on the bedside and had put both hands on his telephone arm as if trying to pull it away stop it peter stop it despite the fact that van effen had prudently covered the mouthpiece her voice was low tense urgent you cant talk to the colonel like that cant you see that youre putting tile poor man in an impossible situation van effen looked at annemarie from her compressed lips and slowly shaking head it was evident that she was of the same opinion as julie van effen looked back at his sister and she visibly recoiled from the expression on his face why dont you hear me out instead of indulging in a repetition of last nights unwarranted interference and blundering into things you know nothing about you think hes in an impossible situation listen to what i say and judge what kind of position im in she slowly removed her hands and just looked at him her expression uncomprehending van effen raised the phone again forgive the interruption colonel julie says that i have no right to talk to you in this fashion and that im putting you in an impossible situation julie alas doesnt know what shes talking about annemarie who is also here agrees with her but she wouldnt know what shes talking about either in fairness to them i must say that judging by the way they are looking at each other they dont think i know what im talking about either you people are only on the periphery im the man in the middle an impossible situation she says consider your alternative i go ahead as planned with agnelli and company you you say will ensure my safety in the first place you are dutybound you claim to notify the royal household using as justification the many threats that have been made against the royal family in recent months you will have the dam square invisibly cordoned off by snipers you will have antiterrorist police squads inside die palace itself it has apparently never occurred to you that those criminals have their moles and informants pretty thick on the ground and that the presence of even one extra policeman will be immediately reported i have been warned that if any such thing happened they would know that there could have been only once source one person through whom this information reached the police and i dont think i know that the palace security is pitiful and that those spies move freely within the gates lift that telephone to the palace to your antiterrorist squads to any other policeman and you might as well reach out for pen and paper and write down and sign my death warrant that was van effen was aware pitching it rather strongly extradition was the worst he had to face even assuming they had penetrated his disguise which was uncertain but now wasnt the moment for such niceties ensure my safety youll ensure my death van effen in a better world by midnight whats one detectivelieutenant less just so long as your pettifogging rules and hidebound regulations are concerned maybe no im sure that julie and annemarie dont like me very much at the moment but i think theyll have the grace to testify at the inquest that i did do my best to save my own miserable skin that of course is the absolute worst scenario and ive no intention of being part of it ive been thinking during our conversation and ive changed my mind about one thing youve offered me two alternatives one leads to being fired the other to the old pine box im not quite in my dotage yet and i think it would behove me to find some form of work where ill be faced with threats of neither dismissal nor extinction if you send one of your boys round to julies place ill let him have my written resignation at the same time ill give him the taperecording i had made in the hunters horn this morning i hope that you and your university friends will be able to make something of it and of the other taperecorded telephone messages sorry about this colonel but you leave me with no option i seem to have run out of alternatives he replaced the telephone in the bedside cupboard and left the room when julie and annemarie rejoined him he was sitting relaxed in an armchair legs crossed and jenever in hand for a man who had just made such a momentous decision he seemed singularly unconcerned julie said may i say something certainly compared to what the colonel said and what he is no doubt thinking at this moment your slings and arrows are as nothing she smiled faintly i havent lost my senses or memory i have no intention of being how did you put it so charmingly last night cool clinical superior and handing out unwanted and unsolicited advice i am sorry for what i said in the bedroom i didnt know you were in so impossible a situation but if i go on to say that i also think youve put the colonel in a fearful fix youll probably say that you appreciate that a lieutenants life i s as nothing compared to the colonels finer feelings well i still say im sorry but annemarie interrupted julie yes i wouldnt bother saying sorry to him again i dont for a moment believe hes in an impossible situation look at him hes getting high blood pressure through trying not to laugh out loud she gave him a considering glance youre not very active i thought you came through here to write out your resignation he frowned looked off into the middle distance then said ive no recollection of saying that thats because you never had any intention of writing out your resignation well well well make a lady detective of you yet youre quite right my dear i did not how could i how could i leave uncle arthur alone to cope with the rising wave of crime in amsterdam he needs me annemarie said to julie if i were to say to him that he is as machiavellian as he is bigheaded do you think he would fire me or just try to reduce me to tears van effen sipped his jenever fortunately i am above such things and you must never confuse machiavelism with diplomacy bigheadedness with intelligence youre right annemarie im sorry i said sorry julie looked at van effen with something less than affection and what are you going to do now just sit waiting waiting for what the phone the colonel the coloneljulie said after what you said to him after what he said to me you mean youre going to have a very long wait annemarie spoke with conviction my dear children or should i say babes in the wood you sadly underestimate the colonel he is infinitely shrewder than either of you he knows very well indeed what the score is hes taking some time to make this call because hes figuring out a way to beat a strategic retreat without loss of dignity peace with honour if you will now there if you like does go a man with a machiavellian cast of mind after forty years battling with the underworld one does develop a certain cast of mind i told the colonel that he had left me with no place to go de graaf being de graaf realised at once what i meant that he had no place to go i julie said seeing youre so clever would you mind theres no need to be unpleasant look at me i am treating you with unfailing courtesy or should i say chivalry i suppose whats the colonel going to say thats on consideration or on reconsideration well hes going to give me carte blanche the pm assignation is on it would be nice to see you wrong for oncejulie said no i didnt really mean that i only hope you are wrong for a time no one spoke the girls kept looking at the telephone on the coffee table by van effens side van effen wasnt looking at anything in particular the phone rang van effen picked it up ah yes i accept that that maybe i did step out of line but was provoked he winced and held the telephone some distance away from his ear yes sir you were provoked too yes i thoroughly agree a very wise decision if i may say so of course you will be kept in the picture sir no they dont trust me yes sir here goodbye he hung up and looked at julie why arent you in the kitchen my girl distinctly smell burning was asked for lunch oh do be quiet what did lie say carte blanche pm julie looked at him her face still for what seemed a long time but could only have been a few seconds then turned and went to the kitchen annemarie made a couple of steps towards him stopped and said peter dont say it ive already got out of one difficult situation dont you and julie put me in an impossible one we wont i promise you know that we cant help what we feel and you cant blame us for that but you could blame us if we did start talking about it so we wont thats sure she smiled now isnt that considerate very do you know annemarie i do believe im beginning to like you like me she gave him a quizzical look so you didnt even like me when you kissed me this morning absentmindedness i suppose or do you just go around kissing policewomen as a matter of routine something to do with their morale no doubt youre the first and no doubt the last we all make mistakes whatever i mean by that cryptic remark who doisnt trust you who doesnt what something you said to the colonel ah my criminal associates we parted at the hunters horn professing mutual trust and faith didnt stop them from staking a man out at the trianon an irritation no problem and after lunch stay here a bit the colonel is going to call me that will be after we hear what if anything the fff have been up to at two oclock the colonel is convinced that they will not blow up the hagestein frogmen have found no traces of any underwater charges in position van effen called his office and asked for the desk sergeant the men on fred klassen and alfred van rees they called in at noon he listened briefly so van rees has lost our man chance or on purpose it doesnt matter i assume you have the licence number all officers on patrol not to approach just locate note this number and call me here lunch was an excellent but hardly festive meal julie and annemarie were determinedly overbright and overcheerful and the harsh edges of strain occasionally showed through if van effen noticed anything amiss he made no comment her brother julie knew rarely missed anything they had coffee in the livingroom shortly after two oclock a young motorcycle policeman came to collect the hunters horn tape julie said i hear that you are awaiting a call from the colonel after that your bed my dear if i may i dont know when i can expect to sleep tonight or even if i will sleep so i think an hour or two might be of some value that hour or two of course would be helped along by the brandy you have unaccountably so far failed to offer me the colonels call came when van effen was halfway through his brandy it was a brief call and onesided van effen said yes several times i see a couple of times then told the colonel goodbye and hung up the fff blew up the north holland dyke at exactly pm extensive flooding but shallow and no lives lost not according to first reports the hagestein weir was not touched as the colonel says he expectedthis the frogmen had located no charges and he is convinced that the fff were unable either to approach the weir or conceal charges hes further convinced that their blasting techniques are primitive and limited only to simple operations like blowing up dykes and canal banks but youre not convinced of this are you julie said im neither convinced nor unconvinced i know no more about it than you do maybe the colonel finds it preferable more comforting to think along those lines maybe the fff want the colonel us the country to think along those lines they have all the hallmarks of being a devious and highly organized bunch that impression too may be deceptive are they a simpleminded group trying to make us think they are devious or a deviousminded group trying to make us think they are simple figure it out for yourselves i cant im going to rest lightly turn on the radio would you the fff have it seems got into the habit of making a public announcement after what they no doubt regard as being one of their master strokes dont bother to wake me to convey their next dire threat in fact dont bother me for anything he had barely dropped off when julie came in and shook him awake he opened his eyes and as was his custom was almost instantly awake he said this is the way you dont disturb me the heavens have fallen in im sorry a letter came for you a letter an exhausted man is torn from his slumbers it came by special delivery she said patiently it has urgent stamped all over it let me see he took the envelope from her glanced briefly at the address and postmark opened the envelope half extracted the contents pushed it back inside again and slid the envelope under the pillow and im disturbed by this one of my fellow officers trying to be witty next time be sure the heavens have fallen in let me see what was inside that letter julie said sharply she sat on the bed laid her hand on his arm and said in a gentle voice please peter van effen made to speak said nothing reached under his pillow retrieved the envelope and gave the contents to julie it was not a letter just a plain postcard blank on one side on the other side was a crude drawing of a coffin and a hangmans noose julie tried to smile well it has been three months since the last one hasnt it so van effen sounded indifferent its been as you say three months and whats happened in that three months nothing and no reason on earth why anything should happen in the next three months if its so unimportant why did you hide it i didnt hide it i put it away in the full view of my little sister whom i didnt want to upset may i see that envelope please she took it looked at it and handed it back all the others had come from other countries this one is postmarked amsterdam that was the first thing you saw and thats why you put it away the annecy brothers are in amsterdam maybe maybe not this postcard could have come from any country to a friend or accomplice in amsterdam who sent it on to this address i dont believe that kid sister or not im all grown up and a big girl now i can think for myself i can feel for myself i know theyre in amsterdam and so im sure do you oh peter its all too much one set of madmen threatening to flood our country another set going to blow up the palace and now this she shook her head everything at once why it is an unusual set of circumstances it is a oh do be quiet do you have no idea what is going on ive no more idea than you have maybe maybe not im not sure i believe you what are we going to do what are you going to do what do you expect me to do patrol the streets of amsterdam until i find some character carrying a coffin over his shoulder and a noose n his hand he put his hand on her arm please excuse momentary irritation theres nothing i can do second thoughts yes i can go back to sleep next time make sure the heavens have fallen youre hopeless she halfsmiled rose shook her head again when she saw that his eyes were already closed and left the room he had barely dropped off for the second time when julie returned sorry again peter the colonel i told him you were asleep but he said it didnt matter if you were dead i was to bring you back to life again and get you to the phone he left me in no doubt that it was very urgent indeed van effen touched the bedside cupboard he could have used the scrambler probably using a public phone van effen went through to the livingroom took the call listened briefly said im leaving now and hung up julie said where to meet a person the colonel says may be a friend i dont know his name van effen put on shoulder holster tie and jacket things as you said julie tend not to occur singly first the dyke nutcases then the palace nutcases then die annecy nutcases now this whatever this may be wheres your friend wouldnt you know hes in the mortuary five the old town of amsterdam may well be unique in the attraction of its treelined winding canals its medieval charm its romance its almost palpable sense of history its nostalgic beauty the city mortuary wasnt like that at all it didnt possess a single attractive feature it had no charm medieval or modern was totally and irredeemably ugly it was clinical functional inhuman and wholly repellent only the dead one would have thought could have tolerated such a place but the whitecoated attendants while not much given to whistling at their work seemed no different from your average office worker factory mechanic or farm labourer this was their job and they did it in the best way they could van effen arrived to find de graaf and a serious young man who was introduced as dr prins waiting for him dr prins was attired in the regulation uniform of white coat and stethoscope it was difficult to imagine what function a stethoscope played in a mortuary possibly to check that incoming admissions were in fact dead on arrival more probably it was just part of the uniform de graaf was in a dark and sombre mood but this was not due to his surroundings for over the long years de graaf had become more than accustomed to mortuaries what he was not accustomed to was having to leave his fish course and a bottle of chablis almost untouched on a restaurant table dr prins led them to a long cavernous tomblike chamber the furnishings of which exclusively in concrete white tiles marble and metal accorded well with the chilled atmosphere an attendant seeing prins approach opened a metal door and pulled out a wheeled rack that ran smoothly on steel runners a shrouded form lay on this dr prins took the top comer of the sheet i have to warn you gentlemen that this is not a sight for weak stomachs my stomach couldnt possibly be in worse condition than it is de graaf said prins looked at him curiously de graaf hadnt seen fit to make mention of the abandoned fish and wine and pulled back the sheet what lay revealed was indeed as the doctor had said not a sight for queasy stomachs dr prins looked at the faces of the two policemen and felt vaguely disappointed not by a flicker of expression did they display whatever emotions they might have felt cause of death doctor de graaf said multiple massive injuries of course cause an autopsy will reveal autopsy van effens voice was as cold as the mortuary itself i do not wish to be personal doctor but how long have you held this post my first week the slight pallor in his face suggested that dr prins was himself having some problems with his internal economy so you wont have seen many cases like this if any this man has been murdered he hasnt fallen off the top of a high building or been run over by a heavy truck in that case the skull or chest wall or pelvis or the femoral bones or tibia would have been crushed or broken they havent hes been battered to death by iron bars his face is unrecognizable kneecaps smashed and forearms broken no doubt when he was trying to defend himself against the iron bars de graaf said to the doctor he was of course wearing clothes when he was brought in anyone been through them identification you mean colonel of course nothing that i know of it doesnt matter van effen said i know who it is i recognize that scar on the shoulder detective rudolph engel he was shadowing a man known as julius caesar you may remember annemarie mentioning this character in la caracha how do you know this because i was the person who told engel to do the shadowing i also warned him that there was more than a degree of danger attached and that he was on no account to be in a position where he would find himself without people around i reminded him what had happened to the two detectives who had trailed agnelli he forgot or disobeyed or was carried away by curiosity or enthusiasm whatever it is it cost him ws life but to murder him in this savage fashion de graaf shook his head even to kill him at all well it does seem an unbelievable instance of overreacting well probably never know the truth sir but if we do well probably find out that he wasnt disposed of just for shadowing but because hed found out something they couldnt let him live to report high stakes colonel high indeed it might help to have a word with this ah julius caesar probably couldnt find him in the first place hell have gone to ground left amsterdam for healthier climes or most likely shaved off his pepperandsalt beard and got himself a wig for his bald pate and a pair of dark glasses to conceal his squint besides even if we did pull him in what have we got to charge him with they thanked dr prins and left as they were passing through the entrance hall a man at the desk called the colonel and handed him a phone the colonel spoke briefly handed back the phone and rejoined van effen not destined to be our afternoon im afraid office just heard from the hospital one of our men there just been fished out of a canal it seems whats he doing in hospital you mean hes not drowned no touch and go it seems wed better have a look identity not established still unconscious no papers no badge but carrying a gun and a pair of handcuffs so they guessed it was a cop in the hospital they were led to a private room on the first floor from which a greyhaired doctor was just emerging he saw de graaf and smiled my old friend you dont waste time i must say one of your men has just had a rather unpleasant experience a very close thing very close but hell be all right in fact he can leave in an hour or two so hes conscious conscious and in a very bad temper name of voight mas voight van effen said thats him little boy saw him floating face down in the water luckily there were a couple of dockworkers close by they fished him out and brought him here couldnt have been in the water more than a minute or so voight was sitting upin bed and looking very disgruntled after the briefest of courteous enquiries as to his health de graaf said how on earth did you come to fall into that canal fall into the canal voight was outraged fall into shh said the doctor youll just do yourself an injury he gently turned voights head the blue and purple bruise behind the right ear promised to develop into something quite spectacular must have run out of crowbars van effen said de graaf frowned and what is that meant to mean our friends are being active again detective voight was keeping an eye on alfred van rees and alfred van rees you know the rijkswaterstaat man locks weirs sluices and what have you unfortunately it would seem that detective voight couldnt watch van rees and his own back at the same time last report voight was that you had lost van rees a patrolman found him again gave me the address i drove down and parked by the canal got out what canal van effen said the croquiskade the croquiskade and van rees you astonish me hardly the most salubrious part of our fair city voight rubbed his neck i didnt find it very salubrious either i saw van rees and another man coming out of this doorway and then they went back in again why i dont know i wasnt in a police car and as far as i know theyve never seen me never suspected i was following them and then well the next thing i knew i was in this bed never even heard a footstep behind me did you get the house number yes thirtyeight van effen picked up a bedside phone told the switchboard it was police and urgent gave them his office number and said to de graaf i dont suppose that anyone will still be at number thirtyeight but we may find something there if that is they didnt see detective voight being fished out of the canal if they did itll be as clean as a whistle question of search warrant sir damn the search warrant de graaf was obviously rather shaken that his old friend van rees could be involved in illegal activities effect an entry by any means van effen was through to his office almost immediately asked for a certain sergeant oudshoorngot him in turn just as quickly gave him the address and instructions and listened for a brief period no sergeant take four men one at the front door one at the back no warrant the colonel says so yes take the damned door off its hinges if you have to or shoot the lock away detain anyone you find inside dont leave there radio report to station and await instructions he hung up sergeant oudshorn seems to relish the prospect they told voight to ca home have dry clothes brought go home and rest and said goodbye in the passageway de graaf said it cant be impossible mans a pillar of society good heavens i even put him up for my club could be a perfectly innocent explanation sir the state of voights neck and his immersion in the canal seems to suggest otherwise remember i suggested in schiphol that perhaps he was a jekyll by day and a hyde by night maybe i got it wrong maybe hes a daylight hyde as they approached the hospital entrance van effen stopped abruptly de graaf stopped also and looked at him curiously one rarely sees an expression of concern on your face peter something amiss i hope not sir somethings been nagging away at the back of my mind but i havent had time to think about it not until now this call you got while you were lunching at least when you were about to have lunch did it come from the station of course sergeant bresser where did he get his information from the hospital i presume bresser said hed tried to find first you then lieutenant valken and failing to find either hed contacted me does it matter this matters young dr prins at the mortuary is neither experienced nor very bright for all he knew or suspected to the contrary engel might have fallen off the top of the havengebouw or been the victim of a street or industrial accident the mortuary does not call in senior police officers unless they know or suspect that the victim did not meet a natural end so the chances are that the call did not come from the hospital bressers a stolid unimaginative man thinking is not his forte was it your idea to call me up at julies and ask me to come along youre beginning to get me worried now too peter although i dont know why your name had been mentioned in the call but whether it was bressers suggestion you come along or mine im not clear damn these lunches moment sir van effen went to the nearest telephone and dialled a number he let it ring for perhaps fifteen seconds then dialled again while de graaf watched him at first in perplexity then in apprehension then with the sick dawning of understanding he was at the front door and holding it open when van effen replaced the phone and came running towards him van effen didnt even bother to knock on julies door which he unlocked with the key hed fished out coming up in the lift the livingroom appeared to be in perfectly normal condition which meant nothing julies bedroom was also as it should have been but her bathroom told a different story thyssen the guard was lying on the floor perfectly conscious and in apparent danger of suffering an apoplectic stroke whether from rage or an effort to free himself from the ropes that bound wrists and ankles it was difficult to say perhaps he had been having difficulty in breathing through his gag they freed him and helped him to his feet for he was unable to stand if the blued hands were anything to go by the circulation of his feet must have been almost completely blocked off too whoever had tied him had worked with a will they helped him through to the livingroom and into an armchair van effen massaged circulation back into hand and feet not a pleasant process if one were to judge by thyssens repeated winces and screwingshut of the eyes while de graaf brought him a glass of brandy he had to hold it to the mans lips as thyssen had yet to recover the use of his hands van der hum de graaf said referring to the brandy a universal specific and in the circumstances despite regulations van effen smiled it wasnt the strained smile of a man deliberately repressing emotion he seemed quite remarkably unaffected by the turn of events the man who makes the regulations can break the regulations it wouldnt conic amiss sir they had barely sipped from their glasses when thyssen recovered enough strength to seize his lift his trembling hand to his mouth and drink half the contents in one gulp he coughed spluttered then spoke for the first time god im sorry lieutenant most damnably sorry your sister and that other nice lady he drained his glass i should be taken out and shot i dont think it will come to that janvan effen said mildly whatever happened is no fault of yours what did happen thyssen was so overcome with anger bitterness and selfreproach that his account was so disjointed and repetitive as to be at times incoherent it appeared that he had been approached by a dutch army major who would ever have harboured suspicions about an army major who had produced a pistol fitted with a most unarmy silencer forced thyssen to produce his key and open the door pushed him inside followed and advised the girls not to move he had been followed into the room almost immediately by three furnitureremoval men at least they were dressed in heavy leather aprons of the type much favoured by their profession what was atypical about them was at they wore hoods and gloves beyond that thyssen could tell them nothing he had been taken into the bathroom and tied gagged and left lying on the floor van effen went into annemaries bedroom the one that had formerly been his took one quick look around and returned theres a pile of annemaries clothes lying on the bed and a wardrobe missing they were tied gagged and carried out in it to anyone watching an obvious case of legitimate furniture removing they must have been keeping tabs on me sir about the time you made the call to me from the restaurant they would have had a furniture van parked nearby and would have moved in as soon as they saw me departing very neat indeed a most uncomfortable trip for the young ladies but i suppose they must have been too terrified out of their wits to worry about discomfort ironic isnt it sir that both of them this morning were full of gloom and woe and foreboding and prophecies of disaster feeling fey was what they called it they were both convinced that the something terrible was going to happen to me unfortunately for them they picked the wrong subject for concern de graaf a second glass of van der hum in his hands paced up and down even forty years in the police had left him without van effens ability to mask his emotions anger and worry fought for dominance in his face what are those devils up to what did they want and who did they want annemarie julie or both julie van effen handed him the postcard he and julie had looked at earlier in the afternoon de graaf took it examined both card and envelope and said when did this arrive just after lunch julie was very upset but i just poohpoohed it laughed the matter off clever van effen brilliant van effen so your friends have returned the annecys back in amsterdam lost no time in making their presence known and got at you in the very best way possible god im sorry peter feel sorry for the girls especially for annemarie it was just her fiendishly bad luck to be here when they came for julie it was that towering genius van effen of course who had insisted that she remain here for her own safety the demands should be arriving quite soon you will not have forgotten sir that the annecys were and doubtless still are specialists in blackmail de graaf shook his head and remained silent its kind of you not to say so sir but you will also not have forgotten that they are specialists in torture which was the real reason i hunted them down we havent been very clever so far de graaf said things are uncommonly confusing kind of you to say we sir you mean me van effen refilled thyssens glass did the same for his own and sank into an armchair after perhaps two minutes de graaf looked at him and said well surely theres something we should be doing shall we start by making enquiries among the flat neighbours the people living opposite to check on the modus operandi of the kidnappers a waste of time colonel we wouldnt find out any more than we already know were dealing with professionals but even professionals can make mistakes i havent seen any so far the colonel was gloomy nor have im assuming that julie was the target van effen reached for the telephone with your permission sir ill find out vasco sergeant westenbrink he was the only one who knew where annemarie lived they whoever they are may have put a tail on him and found out by methods i dont care to think about you think it likely or possible van effen dialled a number possible yes likely no i dont think theres anyone in amsterdam who could follow vasco without his being aware of it by the same token i dont think that there is anyone in the city who could be followed by vasco and be aware of it vasco peter here anyone been taking an interest in you since you left this morning talked to nobody annemarie and my sister julie have been taken away within the past hour and no we have no idea put on your best civilian suit and come round will you van effen hung up and said to de graaf julie it was nobodys been banging vasco with crowbars arid youve asked him to join you us sir hes far too valuable a man to be lying low and doing nothing and with your permission sit id like to try to recruit george your la caracha friend you said yourself he wasnt very good at merging into backgrounds thats for vasco george on the mental side as you saw for yourself is very acute and knows the criminal mind probably better than anyone i know on the physical side hes a splendid insurance policy so progress a very little but progress nonetheless i think its now fairly safe to say that the annecy brothers and the wouldbe blowersup of the royal palace are working in cahoots or how else would the annecys know that rudolph engel who had been following all of the palace gangs intermediaries had been done in and delivered to the morgue the palace gang as you call them could have done the kidnapping the annecys could have told them two things sir what possible motive could agnelli and his friends have in abducting lieutenant van effens sister none the annecys have a very powerful motive the second thing is that it doesnt matter a damn whether the annecys gave agnelli this address or not the point is that they sure as hell know each other and how does this knowledge help us peter at the moment it doesnt and it may even actually put us at a disadvantage theyre not clowns and may well have figured out that we have figured out and exercise extra precautions because of that precautions against what i cant imagine neither can were doing nothing theres nothing as far as i can see that we can do one or two small things perhaps alfred van rees to start with whats van rees got to do with agnelli and the annecys nothing a s far as we know but we would at least be doing something about something i suggest two tails on van rees one to keep an eye on van rees the other to keep an eye on the first tail just consider how lucky mas voight is to be still alive then i suggest we investigate van reess bank statements whatever for this pillar of the rijkswaterstaat may be giving the dyke blowers information that they couldnt get elsewhere selling not giving could be of course that if hes picking up some money that he shouldnt he might have it stashed away in another account under another name but criminals especially people who are not habitual criminals and i assume van rees is not often overlook the obvious cant be done illegal man hasnt even been charged far less convicted of anything theyve got julie and annemarie so what connection do they have with van rees none again as far as we know although i was just thinking of one of the last things julie said to me that how extraordinarily odd it was that the dykebreakers the palace bombers and the annecy brothers should all happen along at the same tim could be a coincidence could be too much of a coincidence or nothing maybe i just hate the whole wide criminal world forget it sir just a suggestion the phone ran van effen picked it up listened said thank you and hung up this should cheer us all up theres going to be a radio broadcast of the fffs latest communiquй in about ten minutes inevitable i suppose your suggestion peter normally i should dismiss it out of hand but your suggestions have an extraordinary habit of turning up something he smiled without any humour maybe you share whats the word this precognition with your sister well put those two tails on van rees my god the very idea of putting tails on van rees and have his liquid assets discreetly investigated i shall probably be arraigned before parliament for this drag you down with me of course he reached for the phone let me handle this after he had arranged matters in his customary imperious fashion and put the phone down van effen said thank you tell me sir do your linguistic friends at the university have all the tapes including the one i brought from the hunters horn de graaf nodded when do you expect them to be ready when theyre ready one supposes things move leisurely in the groves of academe think you could hurry them up sir national emergency something like that i can but try de graaf called a number spoke to someone he called hector then still holding the phone turned to van effen six oclock five fortyfive if possible de graaf spoke briefly hung up and said very precise about our timing arent we person coming round at sixthirty to the trianon to give me the radio data for detonating this bomb in the palace cellars first i heard of it one finds it uncommonly difficult to keep up with your activities one finds it rather droll if i may say so to find a police officer paying the courtesy of punctuality to a criminal yes sir do you know personally i mean any plastic surgeons plastic surgeons what on earth do you want with well i should know better youll have your reasons but plastic surgeons do you think i know everyone in this city to my knowledge sir yes or nearly everyone i could talk to the police surgeon de wit is not a plastic surgeon sir ah i have it my old friend hugh outstanding professor hugh johnson doesnt sound like a dutch surgeon to me i mean hes not dutch is he english trained at east grinstead im told thats the best plastic surgery unit in europe if not the world mans a genius de graaf smiled not as smart as the dutch though not specifically as clever as one dutch lady a native of amsterdam whom he met here on an exchange visit six months after they got married he found himself domiciled in this country still doesnt know how it happened to him the very man de graaf cleared his throat in a delicate fashion if you could give me some slight indication as to what you want certainly in the guise in which i meet agnelli i have scars on my face and hands remind me to tell you what ill look like tonight when we meet at the university otherwise you wont recognize me i want those scars to look even more realistic and more important to be of such a nature that they cant easily be pulled off washed off or scrubbed off ah i see i mean i dont see de graaf pondered briefly dont like this at all you are referring of course to agnelli and his friends and any suspicions they may harbour i thought you were of the opinion that your bona fide status as an internationally wanted criminal was fairly secure i increasingly believe so sir but they dont sound like a lot with whom one can safely take any chances might even find a reason tonight to prove without seeming to of course the genuineness and permanence of those scars de graaf sighed we live in a devious world a very devious world without wishing to give offence peter i must say you seem perfectly at home in it see what i can do damned phone again van effen picked it up listened and said send a man around with them will you wait a minute he turned to de graaf sergeant oudshoorn says number thirtyeight is deserted neighbours say nobody has lived there for years most of the furniture is gone too sergeant oudshoorn hes young enthusiastic i told you hed relish this assignment and we did give him a sort of carte blanche has been investigating some locked cupboards and desk drawers with the aid of crowbars and chisels i suppose i imagine so j also imagine that its extremely doubtful that well ever have any complaints on that score thing is he says hes come across some oddlooking maps charts and plans that he cant make head or tail of probably of no importance whatsoever but were in no position to overlook one chance in a thousand ive asked oudshoorn to have them sent round do you think that en route this messenger might pick up some knowledgeable lad from the city surveyors office who might just be able to enlighten us about those maps chance in a thousand as you say suppose you want me to do the dirty work yes sir he spoke into the phone tell whoever it is thats bringing the papers round to stop by the city surveyors office and pick up someone who will accompany him here the colonel is arranging it while de grad was issuing his instructions over the phone he never made requests van effen turned on the radio and kept the volume low when the colonel hung up the phone he still kept the volume low the cacophonous racket of the latest number one on the hit parade was not to van effens taste but turned it up when the noise stopped the modulated voice of an announcer took over we interrupt this programme with a special news bulletin the fff about whose activities you must have all heard or read in the past fortyeight hours have issued another statement it reads as follows we promised to breach the north holland canal or the hagestein weir or both in the event we chose to breach the canal the reason we did not damage the hagestein weir is that we have never been within fifty kilometres of it in spite of this we have to admit that the turnout of army police airforce helicopters and the experts from the rijkswaterstaat was most impressive it should now not be in doubt that we can cause flooding of a degree according to our choosing wherever and whenever we wish and that we can do this with impunity the possibility of detection does not exist the countrys authorities as we have pointed out before and have demonstrated again are quite powerless we are sure that the people of the netherlands do not wish this state of affairs to continue neither quite frankly do we we have certain terms that we wish to be met and would like to discuss those with a responsible member of the government we suggest that an arrangement for such a meeting time this evening location immaterial be broadcast over tv and radio at pm this evening no negotiator below the level of cabinet minister will be considered we suggest that our negotiator should not be apprehended held as hostage or subjected to any degree of restraint should any of the authorities be so misguided as to do this we would warn them that mines are already in position to the north and south of lelystad precisely how far north and south we choose in this instance not to say the mines in this instance are very much larger than on previous occasions and the repair of the breaches will be a matter of days if not weeks if our negotiator does not return to us by a certain hour to be agreed then large portions of oostlijkflevoland will be inundated no warning will be given as to the time of those breaches they will be some time during the night we think it almost superfluous to point out that the responsibility for the safety of the oostlijkflevoland and its inhabitants ties exclusively with the government we do not ask for a great deal just to speak with a government representative should the government ignore our small request and refuse to appoint a negotiator we shall go ahead and flood the polder after that when next we make a similar request accompanied by a similar promise we think the government may deem it more prudent to be a degree rather more cooperative we are sure that the citizens of the netherlands would agree that for the government motivated solely by affronted pride and stiffnecked outrage to put this large area and those who live there at such risk would be intolerable and unforgivable the time to cooperate is now not when incalculable and avoidable damage has been done the mines are in position that is the message in its entirety the government has requested us not ordered requested not to pass comment on or discuss this outrageous demand until they have decided what course of action to adopt it wishes to reassure the people of this country that the government is confident that it has the resources at its command to meet this or any other threat van effen switched off the set god save us from politicians the government as is its wont is talking through a hole in its collective hat its been caught offbalance hasnt had time to think one charitably assumes it can think and can do no better than trot out old boring meaningless platitudes confident they say confident of what gods sake they cant possibly be confident of anything far less of themselves trust us they say id sooner trust the inmates of a lunatic asylum treasonable talk lieutenant van effen treasonable talk i could have you incarcerated for this de graaf sighed trouble is id have to incarcerate myself along with you as i agree with every word you say if the government honestly believes that the people will take their meaningless assertions at face value then theyre in an even worse case than i thought which i may add i didnt think was possible they are in an impossible situation do you think it even remotely possible that they dont recognize this theyll recognize it all right just as soon as they begin to think in terms of political survival if they bury their heads in the sand theyll be turfed out of power within a week an acute concern about preserving the status quo their status quo can work wonders they have already blundered by having the commentator say that they have been requested not ordered to discuss the affair they have been ordered not requested otherwise the commentator the newsreader would not have used the term outrageous demand theres nothing outrageous in their demand its the demands that will be made when the meeting takes place as of course it will do that will almost certainly be outrageous any discussion about this matter can only be speculative the colonel said heavily so its not worth the speculation we have other and more urgent matters to attend to theres a matter i should be attending to at this moment van effen said i have an appointment at the trianon well a kind of appointment theres a fellow there who will be expecting me but doesnt know that im expecting him one of agnellis stakeouts hes expecting to see me in my full criminal regalia hes under the impression that ive been a sleep all afternoon which might have been no bad thing and i mustnt disappoint him the phone rang de graaf answered it and handed it to van effen yes yes lieutenant van effen ill wait why should i he held the phone some inches from his ear some clown advising me to avoid damage to my eardrums and to he broke off as a highpitched scream a feminine scream not of fear but of agony came from the earpiece van effen jammed the phone against his ear listened for a few seconds then hung up de graaf said what in gods name was that julie at least thats what the man said well his words were your sister is a bit slow in cooperating well call again when she does torture the colonel said his voice was steady but his eyes were mad torturing my julie van effen smiled faintly mine too remember possibly the annecy brothers speciality but it was just a shade too crude too pat too theatrical god peter shes your sister yes sir ill remind the brothers of that when i meet them trace the call man trace the call no point sir i have good ears i could just detect the faint overlay hiss of a recorder that could have come from anywhere and its what makes me think its a phoney puttogether job then why the devil was the call made two reasons perhaps although i can only guess at the first i dont think they thought that i would even suspect that the call was not what it purported to be that i would be so upset over my sisters kidnapping that would take anything in its connection at face value second thing of course is that theyre not after julie theyre after me this at least to their highly suspect way of psychological reasoning is part of the softeningup process de graaf sat in silence rose poured himself another van der hum returned to his seat thought some more then said i hardly like to bring up this point lieutenant but has it occurred to you that next time or maybe the time after next the annecys may decide to abandon the psychological approach and say surrender to us lieutenant van effen or your sister will cbe and well see to it that she dies very very slowly would you do it do what give yourself up to them of course my appointment at the trianon is overdue sir if there is any message for me would you call me there stephan danilov if you remember how long do you intend to re here sir until i see those maps or charts or whatever that sergeant oudshoorn found and until i can get lieutenant valken here to take over ill put him in the picture as lr as i can you have all the facts sir one would hope sode graaf said rather enigmatically when van effen had gone thyssen said curiously i know its not my place to speak sir but would the lieutenant really do that do what give himself up you heard the lieutenant but but that would be suicide thyssen seemed almost agitated that would be the end of him it would be the end of someone and thats a fact de graaf didnt seem overly concerned van effen returned via the rear entrance to his room in the trianon called the desk and asked for charles charles van effen has our friend returned good he will i know be in a position to hear every word you say kindly say the following into the phone certainly mr danilov coffee immediately and not to be disturbed afterwards expecting a visitor at sixthirty let me know when hes gone some thirty seconds later charles called to inform him that the lobby was now empty van effen had just completed his metamorphosis into stephan danilov when the phone rang it was de graaf who was still at julies flat he said he had something of interest to show van effen and could he van effen step round ten minutes van effen said when van effen returned to the flat he found thyssen gone and his place taken by lieutenant valken valken was a short stout rubicund character easygoing and a trencherman of some note which may have accounted for the fact that although he was several years older than van effen he was his junior in the service a fact that worried valken not at all they were good friends valken was at that moment surveying van effen and speaking to the colonel a reversal to type wouldnt you say sir cross between a con man and a white slaver with just a soupcion of a mississippi riverboat gambler thrown in definitely criminal anyway de graaf looked at van effen and winced wouldnt trust him within a kilometre of either of my daughters i dont even trust the sound of his voice he indicated the pile of papers on the table before him like to sift through all of those peter or shall i just call attention to the ones that interest me just the ones that interest you sir god that voice fine top five van effen examined each in turn they showed plans of what were clearly different levels of the same building the number of compartments in each plan left no doubt that it was a very large building indeed van effen looked up and said and wheres van rees well damn your eyes de graaf was aggrieved how the hell did you know those were the plans of the royal palace didnt you no i didnt de graaf scowled which he did very rarely and with difficulty not until that young architect or whatever from the city surveyors office told me you do rob an old man of his pleasures peter de graaf regarded himself as merely approaching the prime of his life i didnt know just guessed as i shall be inside that building within three hours you can understand that my thoughts turn to it from time to time van rees my old and trusted friend de graaf understandably sounded very bitter indeed put him up for my club by god should have listened to you earlier my boy much earlier and we should have expedited the examination of his bank account no bank account gone gone and so one supposes has van rees four million guilders de graaf said four million bank manager thought it a highly unusual step to take but well one does not question the motives and the integrity of a pillar of the community blackballed de graaf said gloomily inevitable there are other clubs sir schiphol i assume is still not open for operations you assume wrongly the gloom remained in de graafs face heard tenfifteen minutes ago first plane out a klm for paris took off about twenty minutes ago van rees clutching his millions relaxing in the first class yes and no grounds for extradition no charges against him in fact no hard evidence against him that well get the evidence i dont doubt then ill go and get him when all this is over i mean your illegal penchants are well known lieutenant yes sir meantime i suggest that my penchants your blackballing and the fact that van rees is at the present moment probably entering french air space are not quite of primary importance what does matter is that van rees who has by this time passed over to the dykebreakers all theyll ever want to know about sluices weirs and locks so that they wont even miss him now was also tied in with the wouldbe palace bombers and we are as convinced as can be that the annecy brothers are in league with the bombers it was julie who first expressed the possibility of this idea how too much of a coincidence can be too much of a coincidence although i must say with all due modesty and not with hindsight that this possibility had occurred to me before your modesty does you credit lieutenant thank you sir well what were faced with now is the probability i would put it as high as certainty that we are faced not with three different organizations but only with one that should make things much simpler for us and easier to cope with of course of course de graaf gave van effen the kind of look that stops a long way short of being admiring how how van effen pondered i dont know heaven help amsterdam de graaf muttered sir de graaf was saved from enlarging on his brief statement by a knock on the door valken opened it to admit a tall lean gentleman with greying hair rimless glasses and a faintly aristocratic air de graaf rose to his feet and greeted him warmly hugh my good friend so kind of you to come and to come so quickly at great inconvenience to yourself i have no doubt not at all my dear chief not at all the patients of a plastic surgeon do not expire upon the spot if not attended to immediately with a sixmonth waiting list one can squeeze in the odd patient here and there de graaf made the introductions professor johnson lieutenant van effen lieutenant valken ah lieutenant van effen the colonel has explained your requirements to me rather unusual requirements i may say even in our attimes somewhat bizarre profession we tend to be called upon to remove scars not inflict them however he looked at the scar on van effens face produced a magnifying glass and peered more closely not bad not bad at all you have quite an artistic bent my dear fellow wouldnt deceive me not when youve spent all your life studying thousands of different scars of every conceivable variety but a layman is not a plastic surgeon and i doubt very much whether any layman would question the authenticity of that scar let me see the dreadful wound concealed by that glove on your left hand he did some peering by jove even better you are to be congratulated very convenient to have it on your left hand isnt it but a trifle suspicious to the nasty criminal mind perhaps you are of course righthanded van effen smiled you can tell just by looking at me i can tell that lefthanded persons dont carry barely concealed pistols under their left armpit too late for a transfer now sir im already identified as being a lefthandglove wearer yes well i see your scars more than pass muster the trouble i suppose is that you suspect that those scars might be subjected to some kind of test such as with a scrubbing brush or even a hot soapy sponge a hot soapy sponge is all that is needed normally you understand the perfect nonremovable scar would take some weeks to achieve i gather however that time is not on your side ah colonel is that van der hum i see it is indeed the colonel poured a glass thank you we dont generally advertise the fact but members of our profession well before an operation you understand operation said van effen a trifle johnson said soothingly he took some brandy then opened a small metal case to reveal a gleaming array of surgical instruments most of them of a very delicate nature a series of subcutaneous injections with a variety of inert dyes there will be no weals no puffiness i promise you there will also be no local anaesthetic takes better that way he looked very closely at the facial scar must have the position size and colour as before you understand your left hand is unimportant nobody i assume has seen that scar i can give you a much more satisfyingly horrific scar than you have now now if i could have some hot water sponge soap twentyfive minutes later and johnson was through not my proudest achievement but it will serve at least no one can puff or scrub those scars off have a look lieutenant van effen went to a mirror looked nodded and came back first class sir a dead ringer for the one i had painted on he surveyed his apparently horribly mangled left hand with melancholy admiration ive really been through it after such a marvellous job sir it seems ungrateful to ask but how permanent are those scars likely to be not permanent at all those dyes are of a completely different chemical composition from tattoo pigments absorption time varies two to three weeks i shouldnt worry lieutenant theyre really quite becoming de graaf and van effen met professor hector van dam professor bernard span and professor thomas spanraft in the livingroom of van dams house they didnt look at all like professors or more accurately what professors are supposed to look like they looked more like a combination of prosperous businessmen and solid dutch burghers all curiously alike all overweight all cheerful and all with slightly flushed cheeks which might have come from the overheated room or the large bottle of wine which circulated freely among them van dam spoke well gentlemen we think we have the answers you seek not too difficult really we have in this country linguistic specialists both occidental and oriental especially oriental we have had vast experience of dealing with asiatic languages over the centuries as you will find anywhere in europe professor spanraft has come up specially from rotterdam no oriental knowledge in this case i may start perhaps with my own small contribution he looked at van effen this gentleman you met in some cafe with the unusual name of helmut paderiwski he is not dutch and he is most certainly not polish he is specifically and unquestionably southern irish even more specifically he is a dubliner my qualifications for making so confident an assertion a year as visiting scholar and lecturer at trinity dublin bernard professor span made an apologetic gesture with his hands my contribution even smaller than hectors was pathetically easy i am told that the other two gentlemen the lieutenant met in the same cafe with the splendid if slightly unlikely names of romero and leonardo agnelli are darkhaired darkeyed and of a rather mediterranean cast of countenance gentlemen of such appearance are not exclusively confined to an area south of the alps they are even to be found as you must know in our own predominantly fairhaired and faircomplexioned society the agnellis are two such you are quite certain of that sir van effen said i know italy well and lieutenant van effen professor van dam was shocked if my colleague professor span held up a placatory hand no no hector the lieutenants query was a legitimate one i gather that the enquiries in which i he and the colonel are engaged are of a most serious nature he smiled a deprecatory smile as a mere academic of course anyway lieutenant rest assured that those gentlemen pre as dutch as you or i my life on it and at a guess an educated guess mark you from utrecht you are amazed perhaps by my perspicacity please do not be my qualifications impeccable im a dutchman from utrecht your turn thomas spanraft smiled my qualifications are strikingly similar to hectors this lady who makes all those mysterious phone calls young beyond a doubt educated perhaps even highly so northern ireland specifically belfast my qualifications too have been a visiting scholar and lecturer queens belfast he smiled good heavens i may even have taught the young lady if you did de graaf said heavily you didnt teach her the right things de graaf turned to van effen who was driving a volkswagen that evening as it was not impossible that he might be called upon to drive one or more of agnellis group that evening it had been deemed more prudent not to use the peugeot where the presence of a police radio might have been inadvertently discovered car papers and insurance were of course made out in the name of stephan danilov what do you make of this his connection peter i have no idea sir we know of course that petty criminals have in the past sold russian and other eastern bloc weapons to the irish republican army but these as i say were petty criminals operating on a relatively petty scale this i feel is something much bigger the ira never had any organization worth speaking of in this country the fff definitely have where can i contact you later on this evening sir i wish you hadnt mentioned that de graaf said gloomily earlier i had hoped to spend it in the bosom of my family but now if the government does decide to send an emissary to parley with the fff good heavens peter we completely forgot to listen in to the six oclock news the broadcast rather that was to state when and where the government would hold this parley weve only to lift a phone its of no significance true this emissary i mentioned who do you think is the logical choice the minister of justice no other my lord and master whom you have frequently actionably and accurately described as an old woman old women like to have their hands held who do you think would best play the part of nursemaid youd make an admirable choice in fact im happy to say that you would be the inevitable choice dont forget to take an umbrella big enough for both of you rain had begun to fall and fall so heavily that the volkswagens wipers failed adequately to cope with it you should consider yourself privileged sir to have a ringside seat at what may be at least a minor turning point in history id rather have my own armchair by my own fireside de graaf reduced visibility even more by drawing heavily on his cheroot but whatever seat im in tonight itll be a damned sight safer and more comfortable than the one youll be in not that i would suppose for a moment that they have armchairs in the palace cellars de graff apparently concentrating on increasing the blue fug inside the car lapsed briefly into silence then said i dont like it peter i dont like it at all too many ifs buts and question marks i have to admit that im not all that madly keen on it myself but weve agreed its our only way in and theres another thing i dont like too much and makes me more than glad that your friend gave those scars a degree of permanence i mean they may have reservations about me that i didnt suspect before what makes you suspect now a rather disquieting remark that one of those gentlemen let drop a few minutes ago professor span it was he said he came from utrecht he is firmly of the opinion that the agnelli brothers come from the same place so it may have escaped your memory sir but vasco sergeant westenbrink also comes from utrecht damn id de graaf said softly the implications had struck him immediately oh damn it all indeed cops and criminals generally have a working knowledge of each other two things may help though vasco spent much of his time in utrecht working under cover and hes been in disguise sort of since he took up residence in krakerdom imponderables sir imponderables your continued existence would seem to me to be another imponderable de graaf said heavily there is no call yes sir i know over and above the call of duty lets just say in for a penny in for a pound or if you like a calculated risk by my calculations the odds are on me he pulled up outside de graafs house i am glad that im not a betting man he peered at his watch sixseventeen if i want to reach you in the next hour or so you will of course be in your room in the trianon briefly only sir for about forty minutes from say six fortyfive onwards ill be in la caracha the devil you will la caracha i thought someone was delivering some data or whatever it is in the trianon at six thirty and that you were going to study that i dont have to look at it i know how to operate radio controlled detonations when i explained to them at length the difficulties involved in radio detonation that was for their benefit and my benefit their benefit to convince them that i really was what i purported to be a whizzkid in explosives my benefit to find out how much they really knew about the subject which appears to be singularly little work that one out sir why so highly organised a group is anything but organized in what would appear to be a very if not the most vital department thats one of the reasons why i said that by my calculations the odds are on me i think they may really need me and be prepared to lean over just so slightly backwards to give me the benefit of the doubt but the real reason for whatever optimism i have lies in la caracha you may remember i asked vasco to meet me in julies flat i changed my mind about that i think that the further he and i in any capacity of danilov keep away from the flat the better so ive arranged to meet him in la caracha i also took the liberty of phoning george and asking him if he would be interested in giving me a little assistance he said he would be more than pleased i did not i repeat not sir coopt him in your name i thought there were some things youd rather not know about officially that is i see you have a point i sometimes wonder peter how many things i dont know about officially and unofficially but now is not the time for brooding i mean you havent the time and how do you propose to have those two help guarantee your continued existence they will i hope be keeping an eye on me a close eye vasco as i think ive mentioned has no equal as a shadower and george well he has other virtues so ive noticed may heaven help us all agnellis messenger arrived punctually at sixthirty less than two minutes after van effen had arrived back in his room at the trianon a man van effen reflected ideally suited for his task a small drab unremarkable nonentity of a man who could have been first cousin of the other nonentity who consumed so remarkably few jonge jenevers in the close vicinity of the reception desk in the lobby he handed over a yellow envelope said that someone would be around to pick him up at seven fortyfive and left less than twenty seconds after his arrival no sergeant westenbrink said he was seated with van effen and george in a small private room in la caracha i dont know the annecys the two that you didnt put in prison that is do they know you im sure they dont i never came into contact with them they left for amsterdam about three years ago ah id forgotten either of you bear this broadcast that was supposed to be made to the fff it was made george said minister of justices house pm guarantees of immunity i assume the government believed in the threat to turn the oostlijkflevoland into a new sea well doesnt concern us at the moment you are sure you want to come in on this george george seemed to reflect could be difficult even dangerous there might even be violence he frowned then brightened but one does get so tired of serving rodekool met rolpens so if youll be kind enough to have your car outside the trianon or shall i say in the discreet vicinity by seventy forty might leave in my volkswagen might be in the car of whoever comes to pick me up i dont for a moment think youll lose us but in any case you know well be heading in the general direction of the royal palace george said does our chief of police know about us our plans he knows about you two and that youll be keeping a very careful watch i hope over me therest no it would never do for us to go around breaking the law of course not george said at precisely seven fortyfive no other than romero agnelli himself came to collect van effen from the trianon six as far as one could tell romero agnelli was in high good humour but then as far as one could tell romero agnelli was always in high good humour even the torrential rainfall drumming on the roof of the car had no effect on his spirits the car was agnellis a large and van effen had been glad to note fairly conspicuous green volvo dreadful night agnelli said quite dreadful and worse still to come im sure bad time of the year this always a bad time gales spring tides north wind must listen in to the eight oclock forecast agnelli van effen thought was uncommonly interested in the weather conditions busy day mr danilov if you call sleeping being busy yes then ive had a busy day late in bed last night late this morning actually and i didnt know what hour youd keep me up to tonight you have not mr agnelli been too free with information about your plans would you have been in my situation dont worry we wont keep you late that data i sent round it proved useful everything i required van effen pulled out the yellow envelope from under his coat returned with thanks i dont want to be found with that in my possession wheres the radio in the boot in perfect condition i assure you i dont doubt it nevertheless i shall want to see it i trust the amatol primers and the rest are not in the boot agnelli looked at him in amusement theyre not why im thinking of the detonator usually made of some fulminating powder commonly a mercury derivative delicate doesnt like being jounced around and i dont like being around when its jounced around theyre in a room weve hired off the kalvetstraat would it be presumptuous of me to ask why the radio isnt with the explosives not at all i want to trigger off the device in the palace from the dam square itself perhaps you wonder why wonder or not im not going to ask the less i know the better all round im a great believer in the needtoknow principle so normally am i he switched on the car radio eight oclock forecast the forecast which came through almost immediately was not encouraging wind force seven north veering northnortheast increasing heavy rains temperature dropping then followed some technical jargon about stationary depressions and a confident if gloomy assertion that the weather would continue to deteriorate for the next fortyeight hours sounds bad agnelli said his expression did not appear to reflect inner concern lots of people especially the middleaged and older with longer memories wont be feeling any too happy especially with the recent comments about the decayed state of the dykes same conditions as caused those dreadful floods back in the fifties and the dykes are in no better condition now than they were then putting it a bit strongly isnt it mr agnelli think of the huge stormsurge barriers theyve built in the delta area in the southwest and what guarantee have we that the north sea is going to be considerate enough to launch its attack against the delta area little point in locking your front door if the back door is failing off its hinges agnelli parked his car in the voorburgwal reached into the back seat and produced two large umbrellas not that these are going to be much help in this downpour just wait a few seconds until i get the radio out of the boot just over a minute later they were standing outside a door to which agnelli had his own key beyond lay an illlit and dingy passageway its floor covered with cracked linoleum agnelli furled his umbrella and gave a coded knock on the first door to the right three taps then one then three the door was opened by the man calling himself helmut paderiwski who made an unsuccessful effort to restrain a scowl when he recognized the person accompanying agnelli who appeared not to notice it helmut you have metagnelli said and led the way into the room unlike the corridor it was brightly lit and was large and furnished in surprising comfort leonardo agnelli gave van effen a nod and a smile leonardo apart there were four other people in the room all young all pleasant looking and very respectable two men and two girls all looking like refugees from some university honours graduate course the type that would have more than passed muster in any parisian grand salon they were also of the type that in the past decade had not only been members of but had organized and controlled so many politically motivated criminal groups in germany and italy they were considerably more formidable than your commonorgarden criminal who was concerned primarily with the accumulation of as much wealth as possible in the shortest time possible but who would rapidly abandon all thought of illgotten gains if personal danger threatened fanatically dedicated people who would stop at nothing to achieve their own cherished utopias no matter how bizarre sick and undesirable those utopias might appear to the vast majority of their fellow men and women they could of course have been genuine salon intellectuals who sought no more of life than the opportunity to discuss proust and stendhal hegelian and kantian philosophies but seekers after the higher truths did not commonly assemble in such clandestine fashion especially not in the close vicinity of sixteenkilo blocks of amatol explosive which van effen had at once observed neatly stacked in a corner agnelli indicated the two young men joop and joachim they have other names of course but are not using them at the moment joop and joachim oddly alike in that both were tall slightly stooped and wore hornrimmed glasses bowed slightly smiled but refrained from reciprocal comment when van effen said he was delighted to meet them agnelli turned to a sweetsmiling darkhaired girl and this is maria who has also for the moment forgotten her surname my my van effen said imagine forgetting a name like agnelli agnelli smiled i didnt think you would be the man to miss much mr danilov yes my sister and this is kathleen kathleen petite and slender had blue eyes dark hair and a slightly humorous slightly wry expression which in no way detracted from the fact that she was very pretty indeed kathleen van effen said but thats an irish name and if i dont give offence youre every mans concept of what an irish colleen should look like you know the one in the song ill take you home again kathleen she made a mock curtsy you choose to flatter me kind sir no offence my mother is irish im quite proud of it in my own celtic way professor spanrafts putative exstudent van effen knew and beyond doubt the girl who had spoken over the telephone to the subeditor morelis and others it was promised that i would meet your leader tonight van effen said he is not here he asked me to convey his apologies agnelli said an urgent appointment that he couldnt break if one were in any way courteous van effen reflected one did not break appointments with ministers of justice those are all your group no agnelli waved a hand those are all that are with us tonight pity i wont be able to further my acquaintance with them van effen said they may be with us but i wont be with them he turned towards the door i trust they enjoy their trip to the cellars im sorry mr agnelli goodnight wait a minute wait a minute agnelli no longer smiling was totally taken aback his face registering his lack of comprehension a minute not a second not in this company van effen looked around the other equally startled and puzzled occupants of the room his eyes and mouth dismissive and more than slightly contemptuous if you imagined that i was going to move into hostile territory and no matter how good your inside information may be the possibility of danger is always there carrying explosives and with this bunch of amateur rubberneckers traipsing at my heels you have to be out of your mind he reached for the doorhandle get yourself another demolition expert preferably from a lunatic asylum is that what it is agnelli smiled in relief my dear fellow those people are not coming with us do you think i am from a lunatic asylum only you leonardo and myself then what are all those people doing here and dont tell me its none of my business it is i value my freedom above all things and my freedom is endangered when unnecessary risks are taken dont you know that danger lies in numbers dont you think its stupid to have your people holed up so near a place where you intend to carry out an illegal act dont you ever operate on the needtoknow principle this is not our base mr danilov one night only agnelli was slightly on the defensive slightly uncomfortable those people are here simply as observers observing what the effects of the explosion effects the walls of jericho come tumbling down therell be nothing to observe psychological effects reactions guide to our future plans effects on whom the crowds thronging the dam square van effen looked at him incredulously that rains torrential there wont be a single living soul in the square tonight he looked slowly round the unsmiling faces sundayschool kids on a sundayschool picnic cheap thrills or the feeling that theyre not making a contribution not really participating unless theyre on the spot god help us let me see all the gear you have enough moral ascendancy van effen thought was enough certainly agnelli tried not too successfully to hide the relief in his face joop yes mr agnelli joop opened a cupboard and brought out some boxes which he set on the carpet and proceeded to open primer detonators battery the trigger mechanism the setting on this here is activated by joop yes are you detonating this device no of course not why not because im not an expert oh i see sorry discomfited joop withdrew van effen looked at agnelli you have the key for the radio box yes of course he handed it over please excuse leonardo and myself for a moment both men left by a side door van effen unlocked the metal lid of the radio container and studied the controls on top of the radio he turned the power on touched a knob here pulled a switch there calibrated the gauges on a couple of dials and adjusted two wavelength bands no one watching and everyone was watching could doubt he or she was in the presence of an expert he then studied the timing dial on the triggering mechanism produced pad and pencil made a few rapid calculations then straightened obviously satisfied nothing to it really is there kathleen was smiling agreed cant imagine why im here he stooped locked the lid of the radio container and thrust the key into an inside pocket you do trust people dont you kathleen said no especially kids but if you remove temptation from the reach of kids then they cant possibly fall into it can they i have no wish to be blown up in the cellars of the palace he turned as agnelli and his brother reentered the room both were dressed as policemen romero agnelli as an inspector his brother as a sergeant van effen surveyedthem you make an excellent inspector mr agnelli really most becoming your brother looks the part too except for one thing hes really at least five inches too short for the police force short legs only agnelli said comfortably hes as tall as anyone when hes seated behind the wheel of a police car you surprise me about the police car i mean you have ah come into possession of one not exactly we have shall we say a car that looks exactly like a police car not too difficult he looked at his watch a police car is expected at the palace in about twenty minutes expected but of course we have friends and we have made arrangements joop be so kind as to pack the equipment will you he indicated two grey metallic cases that stood nearby so you just drive up and walk inside van effen said we believe in keeping things simple of course of course no reason required naturally you just walk in yes he indicated the two metal cases joop was loading with equipment with those again of course you declare the contents electronic detecting equipment for locating hidden explosives i didnt know there was any such thing i dont believe there is however in this silicon chip computerized and electromagnetic age people believe anything the explosives were looking for have we believe been secreted in the basements somewhere underworld tip so we go to the basements to look you have your nerve van effen said not really calculated risk and we calculate that the risk is not very high people dont normally publicize in advance the fact that they intend to do something which is the precise opposite of what they intend to do and with those uniforms the police car and the impressive set of credentials we have we dont expect to experience too much trouble weve even got a set of papers for you thats fine papers papers dont matter a damn to me nor does the fact that you havent gone to the trouble to find me a uniform what no uniform youre a civilian expert the papers say so let me finish you two may and very probably will get off with your minimal disguises but how am i going to disguise my scarred face and the fact that i have a crippled hand my description will probably be in every paper in the country tomorrow agnelli looked closely at the scar on van effens face if youll pardon the cruel remark that really is a beauty joachim this to one of the two young men what do you think joachim mr danilov is an art school student and also a makeup designer for theatrical groups he requires quite a large case to carry all his stock in trade as you can imagine in an organization such as ours we find our friends specialized gifts invaluable do you have anything against beards mr danilovjoachim said not as long as they dont make me look worse than i already am i have several in a suitably auburn shade in your case im afraid it would have to be a beard of rather a luxuriant style i know the one ill apply some paste just so long as i can get it off again fortyeight hours and it will fall offjoachim left the room about that black glove mr danilov agnelli said im afraid there is nothing they can do with that how can you be sure how can i be sure if youd a hand like mine dont you think id have tried anything everything to camouflage it van effen let just the right note of bitterness creep into his voice nevertheless perhaps i might see agnellis voice was gently insistent i promise you i wont say good god above or swoon or anything of the kind van effen being ostentatious without appearing to be turned his back on the rest of the company and peeled off the black glove he held his hand up to within a foot of agnellis face agnellis normally mobile face became still he said i promised you i wouldnt say good god or anything of the kind but well ive never seen anything like it before how in heavens name did this happen van effen smiled legitimately believe it or not someone made a mistake when we were trying to cap an oil fire in saudi arabia one trusts he paid for the mistake there and then he was incinerated i see in which case one might almost imagine youve been lucky agnelli took van effens wrist and toached the scars with his fingernails that must hurt not the slightest skins paralysed stick a row of needles into it or slice it with a scalpel wouldnt feel a thing it would be unfortunate van effen thought if agnelli took him at his word its unimportant all that matters is that i can still oppose finger and thumb joachim came back and agnelli said do you mind if joachim looks at this if hes the sensitive artistic type i should imagine hed be better off looking elsewhere joachim looked and failed to hide the revulsion in his face thats thats awful i couldnt i mean how can you bear to go about like that i dont have much option its the only left hand ive got joachim said youd better put your glove back on theres nothing i nothing anyone can do about that time to go agnelli said helmut well meet you and the others down in the dam in about half an hour perhaps forty minutes dont forget the radio the radio van effen said youre going to operate the radio in this monsoon we have a minibus wheres the key to the radio in my pocket van effen said i thought it might be safer there im sure youre right they left taking the metal cases with them agnelli stopped at a door close to the entrance opened it went inside he reappeared leading a dobermann pinscher which had about it the homicidal appearance shared by many members of its breed it was reassuringly muzzled is that animal as fierce as it looks van effen asked ive had the good fortune never to find out however hes not here for the purposes of either defence or attack dobermann pinschers can be trained to smell out explosives use them at airports fact i know its a fact has this dog been so trained quite frankly i have no idea for ail i know his olfactory nerves may be completely paralysed im beginning to believe that you might even get off with this van effen said they made the best time they could through the drenching rain and were back at the spot where they had parked the volvo in the voorburgwal van effen had his hand on the door when he realised that it was not in fact the car in which they had arrived it was unmistakably a police car van effen got into the back seat beside agnelli and said you leave your own car here and come back and find a police car in its place you know now do believe that you are going to get off with it after all you do have your organization organization is all said agnelli everything went off as agnelli had confidently expected they were expected at the palace and their credentials received only the most cursory inspection they and the car were so obviously official that a more detailed examination could only have seemed superfluous besides it was raining very heavily indeed and the guards were very anxious indeed to get back to the shelter just as soon as they could agnelli led them to a doorway which was so completely shrouded in darkness that he had to use a pencil torch to locate the keyhole of a door at keyhole for which as he had promised he had the key he also had a succession of keys which he used two flights of stairs down to open a succession of cellars he knew the location of every door every light switch you lived here van effen asked ive been here a couple of times one has to be fairly meticulous about these things he led the way through a completely empty cellar into another equally bare cellar and said this is the place not too difficult was it i find it hard to believe van effen said they do have security systems here excellent ones im told but security is a relative term there is no security net that cant be breached look at buckingham palace for instance one of the tightest security shields in the world but as has been proved several times in the past year or so any semiintelligent person and indeed as has also been proved those of a considerably lower iq can go in and out whenever they feel so inclined well mr daniov its yours alinutes only open this far door for me if you have the key agnelli had the key van effen produced a tape and proceeded to measure the thickness of the walls he said how come all those cellars are so empty they werent a few days ago they were pretty well filled with old furniture archives things that you expect to collect in a royal palace over the years not that we were concerned with the wellbeing of those antiquities most of which were just ancient rubbish anyway it was no part of our plan to bum the palace down van effen nodded said nothing went out accompanied by agnelli and climbed a flight of steps to work out the thickness of the ceiling he returned to the cellar made a few calculations on a piece of paper then said well use the lot those walls are stouter than i would have expected but the resulting bang should still be quite satisfactory always a pleasure to watch an expert at work agnelli said no more than it is to watch a journeyman bricklayer at work he does his five years apprenticeship ive done mine theres a difference i suggest between dropping a brick and dropping a detonator a skilled tradesman never drops anything van effen busied himself for not more than two minutes then said i think i recall you saying that you did have the duplicate keys for the cellars weve just passed through i did and i have so no one else can get near this place agnelli shook his head so finished their departure was no more eventful than their arrival had been less than ten minutes after van effen had inserted the detonator into the primer they parked their car just behind a dimly lit minibus as they stepped out a figure emerged from the shadows he came up to agnelli all well sir no problem john goodnight sir the man got into the police car and drove off more organization van effen said formidable the five people they had left in the room close by the voorburgwal were all seated in the minibus which being a fourteen seater was considerably larger than its name suggested van effen and agnelli sat in the wide seat in the back van effen said may one ask how long you expect to wait here of course agnelli had become more than his usual smiling self in the past few minutes he was now positively jovial he had shown no signs of strain inside the palace but strain there must inevitably have been not quite sure myself to be honest a few minutes perhaps certainly no more than twenty but first one must beware lurking and suspicious policemen leonardo catch he threw something to his brother then stood up himself and shrugged his way into a long grey raincoat then he sat reached below the seat pulled out a machine which looked like and was a radio transceiver flicked a switch which made a red light glow then brought up a headband with one earphone which he draped over his knee he reached down again and brought up a microphone the lead of which was presumably attached to the transceiver sorry i have to keep you waitinghe said almost apologetically but i in turn have to wait a call more organization van effen said quite admirable but there is one area in which your organization falls down inevitably agnelli smiled in what respect no heating in this vehicle an oversight maria its by the radio agnelli reached under the seat and not without some effort brought up a large wicker basket which he placed on the seat between van effen and himself he opened the lid to reveal a rather splendidly appointed picnic basket what you would have expected mr danilov a picnic basket for the sundayschool picnickers if we cannot have external warmth at least we can provide some of the internal variety the contents of the basket tended to bear out his claim apart from two rows of gleaming glasses and packets of sandwiches neatly wrapped in cellophane it held a very promising variety of bottles we thought we might have something to celebrate this evening he said again almost apologetically and i do think we have a schnapps perhaps mr danilov van effen said i unreservedly withdraw my remarks about your organization agnelli hadnt even had time to begin to pour the schnapps when the transceiver buzzer rang he clamped on the headpiece and acknowledged the call then listened in silence for almost a minute then he said yes they are foolish they have no place to go so a little persuasion to tip the balance call me back in one minute he took off the headpiece well whos the volunteer to press the button there were no volunteers well then i suggest you mr danilov youre the man who prepared the charges so of course well all blame you if the explosion turns out to be a damp squib or alternatively the palace falls down so perhaps its only fitting that you press the button also that way the rest of us will all feel blameless while you he wasnt given time to complete his sentence van effen stabbed the button and less than two seconds later deep and muffled like a distant underwater explosion but very unmistakable for all that to anyone with normal hearing the sound must have been audible up to a kilometre away the reverberation from the detonating amatol rolled across the square van effen took the bottle from agnellis unresisting hand agnelli not smiling and with lips parted seemed to be seeing something very far away and poured himself a schnapps seems ill just have to congratulate myself a nice loud bang but the royal walls still stand as guaranteed my health that was splendidagnelli said warmly he was back on his own usual smiling balance again perfectly splendid mr danilov and no damage after all that noise unbelievable perhaps a little royal wine spilt on the royal tablecloth van effen made a dismissive gesture i dont want to seem unduly modest not in my nature really but that was next to nothing next time if there is a next time something a little more demanding perhaps therell be a next time that i promise and a little more exacting that i also promise he paused to sip some schnapps as the others obviously excited and elated turned to congratulate van effen then held up a hand for silence as the buzzer rang again ah you heard it also did you very very satisfactory mr danilov is a man of his word he was silent for almost a minute then said yes i agree id been thinking along those lines myself most fortuitous most thank you ten oclock then he replaced headpiece and microphone then leaned back in his seat well now time to relax you relax van effen said not me if youre not moving on i am he made to get up and a puzzled agnelli caught his arm what is wrong theres nothing wrong with me its just as ive told you that ive got a very acute sense of selfpreservation as soon as the police come to their senses if they ever lost them theyre a pretty efficient bunch hereabouts theyre going to start questioning everyone within eyesight of the palace i should imagine no im certain that a minibus with eight odd characters such as us parked in a rainstorm in the dam would be a prime target for questioning he shrugged off agnellis hand and rose ive an acute aversion to being questioned by the police a criminal and we are criminals has to be some kind of retarded lunatic to remain in the vicinity of his crime sit down youre right of course foolish of me one should never let ones guard down helmut paderiwski who was obviously in full agreement with van effen drove off at once back in the room they had so recently vacated agnelli sank into an armchair thank you ladies thank you schnapps would be fine now perhaps mr danilov we can relax safer than where we were but relax for me no still too close instinct plain cowardice i just dont know anyway i have an appointment tonight ninethirty agnelli smiled you were pretty sure that you were going to keep that appointment i never had any reason to doubt it no thats not quite accurate i never had reason to doubt that the arranging of the explosion was a simple matter i had ample reason to question your ability to get us in and out undetected but then i had no reason beforehand to be aware of your rather remarkable organizational ability ill have no doubts about you again nor we of you not after tonights performance i had mentioned the possibility of finding a permanent niche with us thats no longer a possibility its a guarantee if youre still of the same mind of course im of the same mind tonight you had a free demonstration now i would appreciate some steady employment the point i was about to raise i think you arc now entitled to be taken into our confidence van effen looked at him in silence took a thoughtful sip of his schnapps and smiled not i feel certain your full confidence you are not about to tell me your ultimate aims you are not going to tell me how you came together youre not going to tell me how you are financed or by whom you are not going to tell me where you stay although if were to work together in however limited a capacity youll have to give me some intermediate contact phone number youre not even going to tell me why in what would appear to be an otherwise highly organized setup you require my services at such a late date agnelli was thoughtful thats a lot of things you seem to be certain that were not going to tell you how come van effen let a little impatience show because that is precisely the way i would behave myself the needtoknow principle im sure i dont have to remind you of that again what i do believe is that you are about to let me into your very limited confidence about your immediate operational plans no abnormal prescience on my part you have to if that is to say im to be of any use to you correct on all counts tell me mr danilov are you in a position to acquire explosives good god is that so extraordinary a question to ask of an explosives expert my astonishment was not at the fact that you ask me im surprised that well that such an organized group should embark upon what i take to be an ambitious project without the essentials to hand we have some of what you call the essentials we may not have enough are you in a position to help directly no indirectly perhaps i would have to make enquiries discreet of course van effen sighed please dont be so naive if it were possible to obtain explosives without official permission in the netherlands you would already have done so sorry silly remark but we have to protect ourselves your contact would not of course obtain supplies if he could in a legitimate fashion im not being indiscreet in saying that to the best of my knowledge my contact has never been involved in any legitimate dealings in his life he would regard it as an affront to his professional code he is also incidentally the only man in the country who knows more than i do about explosives sounds like a person whose acquaintance it might be useful to make agnelli studied his glass then looked at van effen not by any chance your friend vasco the person who introduced us at the hunters horn good lord no van effen creased his brow and compressed his lips vasco is hardly what you might call my friend mr agnelli i got him out of bad trouble once and have employed him occasionally on some nonetoodemanding errands but we are not soul mates im quite certain that vasco knows nothing about explosives has no access to them and would find it difficult to obtain a childs cap pistol in a toy shop agnelli turned to his brother and shrugged had we known that leonardo you wouldnt have spent so much time looking for him this afternoon vasco frequently disappears van effen said has a girlfriend in utrecht i believe you are seriously trying to tell me that you were also seriously thinking of engaging vascos services not exactly but he comes in the front door and i go out the back and thats that van effen said hes unstable unpredictable and highly dangerous whether he means to be or not i dont quite understand what you mean by that and i dont quite understand you you mean youve never even bothered to check on him his background we didnt check yours you didnt have to van effen said bleakly not with all those extradition wanants hanging around agnelli smiled that was this morning and this morning has been forgotten you obviously know something about vasco that we dont obviously hes bad poison hes the classic example of gamekeeper turned poacher hes treacherous and a man full of hate he hates the law and the society that law protects or is supposed to protect hes that most dangerous of criminals an excop gone wrong a policeman agnellis surprise van effen thought was splendidly done police ex no public accusation of wrongdoing far less a trial dismissed without explanation although doubtless there would have been an explanation made to vasco just try making some discreet enquiries at the utrecht police station about a certain exsergeant westenbrink and see what kind of dusty answers you get my friend george is a different kettle of fish entirely a firm believer in honour among thieves an honest criminal if such a contradiction in terms exists this george is your explosives friend van effen nodded he has a second name no do you think hed work for me george never works for anyone he might be prepared to work with someone another thing george never works through anyone not even through me hes a very careful man his police record is clean and he wants to keep it that way he talks to principals only and then it must be face to face thats the way i like it do you think you could get him to talk to me who knows i could ask him not here though why not because id advise him against it he knows i wouldnt do that without reason where can i contact you ill contact you at the trianon i wont make any comments about how touching your trust in me is tomorrow morning tonight ten oclock you are in a hurry no point i suppose in asking you the compelling nature of this deadline you so obviously have to meet besides i told you i have a ninethirty appointment ten oclock agnelli rose you will of course try to see your friend immediately ill put a car at your disposal please mr agnelli dont be so naive seven thats an esfahan rug youre standing on colonel de graaf said very rare very expensive ive got to drip on to something van effen said reasonably he was standing before the fire in the colonels luxuriously furnished library steam gently rising from his saturated clothing not for me a doortodoor chauffeurdriven limousine i have to cope with taxis that go home to roost when the first drop of rain falls and with people who seemed anxious to know where i was going it didnt seem clever to let them know that i was going to the house of the chief of police your friend agnelli doesnt trust you difficult to say oh sure it was agnelli who had me followed couldnt have been anyone else but im not sure that hes suspicious of me i think that on principle he just doesnt trust anyone difficult character to read youd probably like him seems friendly and likeable enough you really have to make an effort to associate him with anything like blackmail and torture and even then you find it difficult to convince yourself which means nothing i assume you had a comfortable evening sir that you didnt have to cope with the elements or the thought that you might be shot in the back at any moment de graaf made a dismissive gesture which could have meant either that such considerations were irrelevant trifles or that they could not possibly apply to him in the first place an interesting meeting but only to a limited extent im afraid bernhard wasnt in a particularly receptive or cooperative frame of mind bernhard was bernhard dessens the minister of justice a dithering old woman scared to accept responsibility unwilling to commit himself and looking to pass the buck elsewhere exactly i couldnt have put ive told you before peter thats no way to talk about cabinet ministers there were two of them names riordan and samuelson one person calling himself riordan could have been in disguise the other had made no attempt at any such thing which can only mean that hes pretty confident about something or other riordan had long black hair shoulderlength in fact i thought that ludicrous style had gone out of fashion ten years ago was deeply tanned wore a dutch bargee cap and sunglasses anything so obvious has to be a disguise van effen thought for a moment he wasnt by any chance very tall and preternaturally thin de graaf nodded i thought that would occur to you at once the fellow who commandeered that canal boat from who was it at schiphol dekker dekker this must be the man dekker described and damned if i dont agree with your bizarre suggestion that this fellow riordan or whatever is an albino dark glasses heavy tan to hide an alabaster complexion black hair to hide white other fellow samuelson had white hair thick and very wavy white moustache and white goatee beard no albino though blue eyes all that white hair would normally bespeak advanced years but his face was almost completely unlined but then he was very plump which may account for the youthful skin looked like a cross between an idealized concept of a us senator and some bloated plutocrat oil billionaire or something like that maybe hes got a better makeup resin than riordan its possible both men spoke in english from which i assumed that samuelson couldnt speak dutch both made a point of stating that they were irishamericans and i have no doubt they were i dont have to be hector or one of his professorial friends to know that the northeast or new york accent was very strong riordan did nearly all the talking he asked no he demanded that we contact the british government more exactly he demanded we act as intermediaries between the fff and whitehall on the basis that whitehall would be much more likely to negotiate with another government than with an unknown group such as they were when bernhard asked what on earth they could possibly want to discuss with whitehall they said they wanted to have a dialogue about northern ireland but refused to elaborate further until the dutch government agreed to cooperate de graaf sighed whereupon alas our minister of justice seething and fulminating while at the same time knowing damn well that they had him over a barrel climbed on to his high horse and said it was inconceivable unthinkable that a sovereign nation should negotiate on behalf of a band of terrorists he carried on for about five minutes in this vein but ill spare you all the parliamentary rhetoric he ended up by saying that he personally would die first riordan said that he very much doubted that dessens would go to such extraordinary lengths and further said that he was convinced that fourteen million dutchmen would take a diametrically opposite point of view then he became rather unpleasantly personal and threatening he said it didnt make the slightest damn difference to anything if he dessens committed suicide on the spot for the oostlijkflevoland dyke in the vicinity of lelystad would go at midnight if the government didnt agree to talk terms by ten oclock tonight he then produced a paper with a list of places which he said were in immediate danger of going at any moment he didnt say whether or not mines had already been placed in those areas the usual uncertainty technique among the places he listed there were so many that i forget half of them were leeuwarden the noordoost polder in the vicinity of urk the amstclmeer the wieringermeer putten the polder south of petten schouwen duiveland and walcheren did we remember what happened to walcheren during the war both the eastern and western scheldt estuaries were on their list he said did we remember what happened there in february while noord and sud holland offered a positive embarrassment of riches thats only a representative sample riordan then started to make very sinister remarks about the weather had we noticed how high the level of the north sea had risen how the strengthening wind had gone to the north and that the spring tides were at hand while the levels of the rhine waal maas and scheldt were near an alltime low so reminiscent of february didnt dessens think he then demanded that they talked to a minister or ministers with the power and courage to make decisions and not a snivelling timeserver bent only on preserving his own miserable political career which was i thought a bit hard on bernhard riordan then said that to display their displeasure at this wholly unnecessary hiatus in negotiations they would detonate one of several devices they had placed in public buildings in the capital here the two of them had a whispered conference and then riordan announced that they had chosen the royal palace and defied anyone to find the explosives before they went off no lives he said were at risk in this explosion which would occur within five minutes of their departure he added almost as an afterthought that any attempt to restrain them hinder their departure or have them followed would inevitably mean that the oostlijkflevoland dyke would go not at midnight but at nine oclock this evening on this happy note they left the palace explosion as you may know duly occurred so i believe it seemed the wrong moment to tell de graaf that it was he van effen who had pressed the button he shivered and moved to a less damp patch on the esfahan i think im getting pneumonia theres brandy de graaf waved a hand at once indicative of preoccupation and irritation that one should be unaware of the universal specifics against pneumococci schnapps scotch he broke off as a knock came on the library door and a uniformed policeman admitted george and vasco who were if anything even more saturated than van effen had been two more advanced cases i suppose george said i beg your pardon colonel pneumonia help yourselves i must say i wasnt expecting you gentlemen the lieutenant said i know it just slipped his memory i have a lot on my mind van effen said well we had a good look at them when they left the house to go to that small bus also had a good look at them in the dam square recognize them anywhere george paused reflectively seemed a very harmless bunch to me ever seen or seen pictures of the youthful assassins that made up the baadermeinhof gang all they lacked were harps and haloes when i said well that wasnt what i meant ah that yes well george seemed slightly embarrassed when you left the house we saw you go but didnt approach you as youd asked us not to in case you were being followed you know you were followed yes we waited across the street for ten minutes then crossed to the lighted window the rain talk about standing under niagara falls he waited for sympathetic comment and when none came went on waited another ten minutes we could hear music and conversation ill bet you could so then overcome by the rain impatience or suspicion you moved in light still on longplaying cassette on a recorder birds flown by the back door hardly original so we still dont know where theyre holed up not your fault agnellis obsessed by security still could have done better vasco said next time the phone bell shrilled and de graaf picked it up listened for some time said wait a minute sit and cupped the mouthpiece predictable i suppose dessens seems the cabinet is a bit shaken about the palace explosion and are convinced that the oostlijkflevoland dyke will go up at midnight so theyre going to parley they want me along and suggested i i pm id like you to be there i i pm eleventhirty possible sir i have a couple of appointments de graaf talked some more then hung up you do seem to have a very crowded appointment book lieutenant i cant recall your mentioning any of this to me i havent had a chance to i have to be at the trianon at ten oclock to take a call from agnelli hes a bit short of explosives and ive promised to supply him with some explosives of course naturally de graaf hardly spilled a drop as he poured himself a brandy having already blown up the palace it was an exaggeration but a pardonable one in the circumstances one could not expect you to rest on such trifling laurels and where do you intend to find this explosive im sure you wont be wanting more than a few hundred kilos of tnt or whatever ii is me havent the time havent the authority either but i thought perhaps sir if you would care to use your influence me the chief of police to supply illegallycomeby explosives to a group of terrorists de graaf considered i suppose you would expect me to deliver it personally good heavens no thats where george comes in sorry george havent had the chance to explain this or anything had a long talk this evening with agnelli about you and vasco im afraid vasco that ive blackened your character beyond all hopes of redemption youre a crooked cop bent as a horseshoe untrustworthy unpredictable and only a couple of steps removed from a psychiatric ward agnelli was just that little bit too casual when asking questions about you im certain he knows you are or were a cop he comes from utrecht too not that that should be any bar to his employing you after weve made certain delicate alterations to your appearance and history in the nottoodistant future george youre an arms dealer heaven knows there are enough of those around but youre something special the kingpin mr big a leopard tank a sam missile even a motor torpedo boat george is your man and being mr big means youre important you talk only to principals no intermediaries not even me face to face or no deal i talk to this agnelli george smiled widely you want me on the inside i have a feeling that i could do with a little help sooner rather than later ive no right to ask you of course theres annelise and your kids things might get a little difficult a little difficult de graaf could put a nicely sarcastic edge to his voice when he had a mind to difficult i dont say its crazy because nothings crazy if theres a chance but i dont like it at all its based on the assumption that theyre not on to you and thats an unjustifiable assumption sure theyve gone along with you so far and you with them but thats only because so far its suited you both but if they are on to you and they decide a time has come when youre of no further use to them then when the time comes to discard you it may be in a pretty permanent fashion have you we right to ask that of george ive just done that the phone rang again and de graaf picked it up ah lieutenant valken yes yes de graaf s face became very still as he listened never mind if youve never heard it before wait till i get a piece of paper and pen de graaf wrote down a few words told valken goodbye and hung up he reached for his glass van effen said julie annemarie yes how do you know valken your face brandy bad bad enough phone call from the brothers they say the girls are as well as can be expected which can mean anything or nothing they also say theyve sent a telegram of condolences to rotterdam hed picked up the piece of paper hed scribbled on to david joseph karlmann meijer van effen sipped his brandy and said nothing george and vasco exchanged glances of incomprehension at length george said and who might he be i forgot de graaf said you dont know of course annes annemaries father yes george said i mean no i dont understand colonel what about annemarie de graaf stared incredulously at van effen you mean you havent told them i dont believe i have good god de graaf shook his head the needtoknow principle i suppose one of those days peter youre going to forget to remind yourself of something and that will be the end of you de graaf looked from george to vasco annemarie and julie lieutenant van effens sister have been kidnapped the annecy brothers the annecy brothers george was silent for a moment those murderous fiends you put two of them away for fifteen years correction lieutenant van effen put them away and the two that escaped have been threatening to get him ever since theyve gone one better theyve got julie i know julie well and whats the significance of this message to annemaries father the significance lies in her father you will find it hard to believe george but the father of that fearful frump who used to frequent la caracha is one of the wealthiest men in the netherlands maybe the wealthiest and a very powerful man he has the ear of the government hes in a position rather similar to dassault the plane maker in france there are some areas in which they dont move without consulting him at first or at least listening to what he says he has power and wealth and a daughter and now they have the daughter and may well turn his power and wealth to their own advantage anne meijer is any criminals dream hostage come true van effen put down his glass and looked at his watch its time george god in heaven i dont believe it you look at your damned watch and say its time to go doesnt it occur to you to wonder how in the hell they got that information about david meijer some sort of persuasion i suppose persuasion torture they tortured the poor girl what poor girl are you all right lieutenant annemarie of course the shake of van effens head was very positive no not annemarie the annecy brothers or at least the two we put away never tortured without a reason however twisted that reason might be the reason was either revenge or to get information why should they revenge themselves on annemarie what has she ever done to anyone and information what information could they possibly get from her they dont know who she is who her father is didnt rather as far as they are concerned shes only a friend of julies and they took her along for no reason other than the fact that she happened to be there if they tortured anybody and i suspect it was only a threat of torture to get information about me it would have been julie my guess is that annemarie volunteered that information about herself as a sop to the annecys to turn their minds to the thought of unlimited ransom money maybe she even mentioned her fathers influence with the government although people like the annecys would almost certainly have been aware of that anyway anything to distract attention from julie annemaries no fool if she were i wouldnt have brought her up from rotterdam she knows that the annecys of this world are above all pragmatists and that anything that would further their plans would be of a great deal more interest to them than hurting me by proxy coldblooded fish de graaf muttered pardon sir you could be right or you could be wrong damage both ways if youre right the annecys hands have been greatly strengthened and david meijers pocket almost certainly lightened or will be in the very near future if youre wrong youre putting your head in that charming hangmans noose that the annecy brothers put on their postcards if youre wrong shed have talked of many things principally that stephan danilov is peter van effen i cant take the chance that youre not wrong my orders are that you are not to go through with this george said normally colonel i wouldnt dream of not complying with your wishes but these arent normal circumstances by refusing your request im not stepping outside the law nor am i making the point that im no longer a policeman im just going my own way de graaf nodded i cant stop you but i can you can force him to go his own way toogeorge said by resigning youd never forgive yourself colonel de graaf scowled refilled his glass sank into an armchair and gazed into the fire van effen nodded to vasco and the three men left the room van effen and george returned to the trianon to find that the usual watchdog was not in his usual place but there was another and if possible even more insignificant character seated some distance from the desk and sipping beer instead of jonge jenever van effen had no doubt that this was a replacement from the same stable the manager called to them as they passed the desk this message has just come for you mr danilov he handed van effen a slip of paper which read may i see you in your room two minutes yes of course thank you van effen folded the paper into his pocket and led george to the lift the promised two minutes later the manager arrived in van effens room he closed the door behind him looked doubtfully at george and seemed to hesitate no problem van effen said my friend here is on the side of the angels george charles the manager charles george george is police ah a word of warning lieutenant i wouldnt use the back entrance tonight somebody a stranger to anyone round here has taken up more or less permanent residence by the back door hes in an old daf and you will have noticed that your old lookerafter in the lobby has been replaced by an even more obvious one theres another man who has just started a meal in the diningroom hes seated conveniently by the door so that he can see anyone who crosses the lobby he knows the new shadow no words exchanged just a brief look and an even briefer nod no risk in that they must have thought they have no reason to suspect my interest in them thats why i waited two minutes to see if either of them made a move no disappointment our diningroom friend was at the public phone almost before the lift doors closed behind you i waited until he finished his call to whatever person he was reporting your arrival i was watching them from the mirror as the diner left the booth brief nod again no words when you go bankrupt charles apply to me any time ill watch the bogeymen the manager left so george said we can expect that phone call any minute now the man in the restaurant has tipped off agnelli that stephan danilov has returned accompanied by george the explosives expert and illegal arms supplier one wonders what lions den or nest of cobras theyve chosen for the rendezvous i dont wonder there are no lions or cobras in room which is where we are charles tells us that agnelli it can only be agnelli has two other faithful but not very bright henchmen lurking around the place why surely it only required one stakeout the one in the lobby to advise him of our arrival the other two are guards parts of his insurance policy dont forget agnelli has no reason to think that we know of their presence there may even be others that charles knows nothing about this is the last place that we would think would be chosen as a meeting point or so agnelli must imagine and so we wouldnt think of arranging a reception committee here and when he does call you can be sure that he will announce that he will be here in a matter of minutes so that we cant have the time to arrange one van effen was right on both points agnelli called in person ta say that they would meet at the trianon and that he and his friends would be there in under five minutes hes bringing friends plural van effen said after he had hung up i dont think romero agnelli trusts anyone from the cordial guileless expression agnelli wore on his arrival one could see that van effen was wrong here patently was a man one could trust anywhere agnelli had brought three men along with him his brother leonardo looking if that were possible an even more genial member of the mafioso than he had done the last time and two others whom van effen had never seen before one of them a burly slightly florid pleasantfeatured character of indeterminate age somewhere between forty and fifty van effen would have guessed but it was difficult to be sure was introduced as liam obrien from his accent no less than from his name he had to be irish the other a handsome young man dark and slightly swarthy was introduced as heinrich daniken he could have been of any nationality agnelli did not see fit to disclose what the function of either man was introductions over refreshments proffered and accepted agnelli said to george do i call you george or do you have another name just george he smiled im an anonymous person agnelli surveyed the vast bulk before him you george are the least anonymouslooking person ive ever seen dont you find it rather a drawback in your profession whatever that may be of course drawback its a positive advantage im a peaceloving who abhors violence but when youre as big as i am no one ever offers it to you george van effen thought admiringly was as consummate and convincing a liar as hed ever known and of course everybody or nearly everybody i think particularly of those who are sworn to uphold the law think that everyone who is as big fat cheerful and harmless as i am must be able to get by very well without being able to think its a kind of law of nature well im no einstein but im not yet ready to be locked away inin institution for the retarded but we havent met here to discuss personalities mr agnelli have we five questions what do you want how much or how many when where price the slipping of agnellis goodhumoured smile was so momentary that only the most alert or observant would have noticed it and even then it could have been as much imagined as seen you do get to the point rather quickly dont you george no time for the little business niceties i see well thats the way i prefer it myself like you i have no time for beating about the bush like you i regard myself as a business man he produced a paper from an inside pocket heres my shopping list fairly comprehensive is it not george studied it briefly fairly well within my limited capacities i should think most of the items are straightforward especially the explosives the groundtoground wireguided missiles these will be antitank missiles although you dont say so and the sam groundtoair missiles are also easily come by as are the plastic mines grenades and smokebombs he paused sipped some brandy and frowned something here i dont quite understand dont even like im not talking about the fact that you seem to be preparing to wage a united war even although only a defensive one thats none of my business he handed the list over to van effen comment van effen studied it for no longer a time than it had taken george then returned the list specifications exactly george not smiling looked at the four men in turn then concentrated his gaze on agnelli this is a lethal enough list as it is but it could be dangerous in other ways even suicidal if it got into the hands of whoever prepared this list agnelli wasnt smiling either he looked more than slightly uncomfortable im afraid i dont understand then id better enlighten you specifications as my friend stephan has said explosives no specifications missiles ditto and that applies to both types what kind of primers what kind of detonators fuses you dont even say whether wire or chemical how slowburning or fastacting no explosives expert ever composed this list some amateur did some bungling incompetent who agnelli studied his glass for some time then said im the incompetent but i did get some bungling help from my three associates here god help us all van effen said youre not fit to be let loose with a box of kiddies fireworks i have to ask you not for the first time where the hell are your experts agnelli smiled ruefully and spread out his hands ill be perfectly frank with you romero agnelli van effen realized was about to lie in his teeth we are temporarily embarrassed the two men on whom we rely have been called away for other duties and wont be back for a couple of days but we thought well you gentlemen are both explosives experts and thats no problem george said we know what to get and can give you simple instructions on how to use them without blowing your silly heads off the missiles are a different matter only a trained man can fire one of those how long does that take a week ten days george was vastly exaggerating van effen knew but the four mens patent ignorance of all things military was so extensive that it was very likely a safe exaggeration and dont ask us were no military men were no more skilled in those matters than you are agnelli was silent for some time then said abruptly do you know of anyone who is skilled in such matters i mean do you mean what i think you mean yes i do the way george said i do in a tone just one degree short of impatience made it clear that it was quite inevitable that he should know who george gave him a look of pity he hasnt got a name you must call him something the lieutenant why because he is a lieutenant cashiered of course certainly not a cashiered lieutenant is no good to me i thought you would appreciate that a person like myself can only operate at second or third hand a middleman if you like or two ah i see your supplier mr agnelli you cant possibly be so naive as to expect me to answer so naive a question ill see what can be done where do you want this stuff delivered that depends on how soon you can deliver it by noon tomorrow good heavens agnelli looked incredulous then smiled it looks as if ive come to the right shop how will it be delivered by army truck of course of course agnelli looked slightly dazed this makes things a bit difficult i thought it would be at least the day after tomorrow could i call up tomorrow to finalize time and place and could you hold up delivery for at least a few hours that can be arranged george looked at van effen mr agnelli can call here to am say van effen nodded and george smiled at agnelli cant say yet but somewhere between ten and twelve thousand dollars we offer the best discount rates in europe dollars guilders or deutschmarks more of course if our ah services are required agnelli stood up and smiled his old relaxed and genial self again of course the price i must say doesnt seem too exorbitant one thing van effen said pleasantly you are aware arent you mr agnelli that if i moved to another hotel and registered there under another name that the chances of your ever finding either of us again would be remote remote they wouldnt exist agnelli was frowning why ever should you mention such a thing well a state of mutual trust does exist between us doesnt it naturally the puzzlement still there well if it does call off the watchdogs in the lobby in the diningroom and outside my watchdogs from the expression on agnellis face one could see that far from being baffled he was stalling for time if you dont well throw them into the canal suitably trussed of course and then move on agnelli looked at him his face for once expressionless you do play for keeps dont you i really believe you would he smiled and put out his hand shame very well watchdogs retired shame but they really werent up to it when they had gone van effen said to george you really should have taken up a life of crime too late now anyway youd have given colonel de graaf apoplexy years ago ill bet annelise has no idea quite how splendid a liar you are you have agnelli hooked outfoxed outgunned and demoralized not to say dependent at least lets hope so will you talk to vasco later this evening and tell him that youve got an offer of employment for him in the capacity of an army lieutenant after of course hes made suitable alterations to his appearance we mustnt forget that agnelli has had the opportunity of studying vasco at close range therell be no problem george handed over agnellis shopping list id give a great deal to see the colonels face when he sees what hes got to go shopping for in the morning youll be seeing him i take it in an hour or so has it occurred to you that agnelli might very well be there along with riordan and this fellow samuelson its an intriguing thought and yes it has occurred well well what well what he asks we know that agnelli is annecy were ninetynine per cent certain dont forget that i never saw either of the two annecy brothers that we didnt manage to catch and put away the fact that you dont know him doesnt mean he doesnt know you of course he does he must have seen your picture in the papers many times during the period of the arrest and trial how do you think hes going to react when he sees before him not only the dreaded lieutenant van effen but the dreaded lieutenant whose sister hes got tucked away in some dungeon the sister who for all you know he spends his leisure time with testing out the latest model in thumbscrews should be interesting colonel de graaf was rightgeorge muttered you belong a hundred fathoms down just a coldblooded fish your ten cents will help to kill a british soldier its a bargain at the price the best bargain youll ever get thats what the collectors say when they go around rattling their damn tin cans in the irish bars in the united states especially in the irish bars in the northeast states especially in new york most especially of all in the borough of queens where the irish are thickest on the ground ten cents thats all they ask just ten cents and of course they rattle their cans whenever they hold irish nights irish dances irish raffles irish whatever you like if youve never heard that there are charitable organizations charitable they call themselves which collect for arms then you live in another century or with your head in the sands they claim that the millions of dollars that theyve collected over the years have gone to support the widows and orphans of the ira members foully shiin by the murderous british support widows and orphans the founder of one such evil organization once made the mistake of telling the truth when he said the more british soldiers that are sent back from ulster in their coffins the better jack lynch a former irish premier has gone on record as saying that the money is intended for one purpose only to make widows and orphans british widows and orphans riordan an abnormally tall abnormally thin man blackhaired deeply tanned and dressed in a nearanklelength black raincoat which served only to heighten the looming angularity of the man was literally shaking with rage as he stood facing his audience his fists ivoryknuckled on the table before him his sincerity and outrage were unquestionable his intensity almost terrifying god knows its bad enough that the contributions to these infamous organizations should come from honest godfearing intensely religious catholics who are duped into thinking they are contributing to a worthy cause instead of some damnable crewwho make murder incorporated look like innocent children playing in a kindergarten the money goes directly to dedicated ira operatives some of it is used to buy guns at blackmarket sales in new york itself auctions usually held in razed areas or empty car parks always by night nearly always in the bronx queens or brooklyn guns gentlemen are rather easily come by in the fair city of new york in the depth of his bitterness riordan almost spat the words out the rest of the money is used by other operatives who openly travel to the southern and midwestern states where gun permits do not exist wherever the guns come from they all end up in the new york area from where they are shipped out almost always from new jersey or brooklyn with the warm encouragement and complicity of the stevedore unions and the upright us customs many of whom are first or second generation irish and feel bloodbrothers to the murderous ira as the customs service is controlled by the us treasury department it is logical to suppose that those dealers in death operate with the cognisance if not the connivance of the us government the irish influence in congress is as well known as it is remarkably powerful a moment mr riordan if you would the interruption came from aaron wieringa the minister of defence a big florid blueeyed and very calm man a man immensely respected throughout the country and one who would very likely have become premier quite some years ago if he had not been cursed with the unfortunate and crippling handicap for a politician of total incorruptibility one appreciates one can hardly fail to appreciate that you are a very angry man we are not i assure you nineteenthcentury ostriches and i think it would be true to say that there is not a man in this room who does not understand that your fury is totally justifiable i would not go so far as to concur in your condemnation of washington and congress but that in the current and particular circumstances is by the by your opinion as distinct from your recital of verifiable facts is not of immediate concern what is of immediate concern is why your wrath has seen fit to focus itself on our unfortunate country in general and the city of amsterdam in particular i cannot at the moment even begin to fathom the reason for it although i am certain we will not be left in ignorance for long but nothing you have said so far begins to justify your attempt to blackmail us into acting as intermediary between you and the british government i appreciate that you may have and very probably do have very powerful reasons for wanting all british troops to withdraw from northern ireland but how you can possibly imagine that we have the ability to persuade britain to accede to your preposterous demands quite passes my understanding no conceivable reason exists why they should so accede a totally conceivable reason exists human tskrian motives tarian motives on your part and on theirs our respective governments would be reluctant to see the netherlands flooded and countless thousands maybe hundreds of thousands drowned in those floods before even considering such matters an answer to my question please why us is it that because of our particular geographical situation we are peculiarly susceptible to threats of genocide you have been chosen because amsterdam is the linchpin in the whole lethal gunrunning operation it is the gunrunning centre of northern europe and has been for years just as it has been the heroin centre of northern europe this knowledge is in the public domain and the continued existence of those two evil practices can only bespeak a deep level of corruption in both government and lawenforcement levels an indignant looking mr wieringa made to interrupt but riordan imperiously gestured him to silence there are it is true other towns engaged in gunrunning notably antwerp but compared to amsterdam antwerp operates in a minor league this time mr wieringa speaking in almost a shout which was unknown for him would not be gainsaid you mean you would find it impossible to flood belgium riordan carried on as if he had heard nothing not all the guns passing through amsterdam go to eire of course some go to the raf others go to the rafv it was almost inevitably bernhard dessens the justice minister who rarely if ever contributed anything of significance to any discussion you suggest that the british air force is supplied be quiet you idiot riordan it seemed could descend below the rhetorical level he usually set for himself i refer to the red army faction the inheritors of the bloody mantle of the baadermeinhof gangsters of the early seventies some go to the siciliancontrolled mafiatype criminal organizations that are springing up all over western germany but the bulk goes to eire do you know what its like in northern ireland mr minister nobody bothered to follow his line of vision to know that he was addressing the minister of defence and not the minister of justice can you imagine the hellish conditions that exist there the hideous tortures practised by both the ira and uvf the homicidal insanity that has ruled there for fourteen years a country ruled by fear that is tearing it to pieces northern ireland will never be governed by representatives of the two communities protestant and catholic working together because they are far too bitterly divided by religion and to a lesser extent race there are one and a half million people living together in a small area but in spite of their divisions ninetynine point nine per cent on either side have never harmed anyone or ever wished to that ninetynine point nine per cent on either side are united in only one thing in abhorring terrorism and in their desire to live only in peace it is a desire that as matters stand can never be realized conventional politicians with all the faults and frailties of their kind are still those who observe the conventions in ulster conventional politicians are an extinct breed moderation has ceased to exist demagogues and gunmen rule the country is ruled by a handful of crazed murderers riordan paused for the first time probably as much for breath as anything else but no one seemed inclined to take advantage of the hiatus but murderers even crazed murderers must have their murder weapons must they not riordan said and so the murder weapons are shipped from amsterdam usually but not always inside furniture the weapons are sealed in containers of course and if the amsterdam customs are unaware of this they must be the worst the blindest or the most corrupt and avaricious in europe nine times out of ten the ships unload in dublin how they the containers i mean get past the dublin customs i dont profess to know but i dont think theres any question of collusion if there were the customs wouldnt have turned up a million dollars worth of illegally imported arms destined for the ira four years ago but most of the guns do get through from dublin the arms containers variously labelled but popularly as household goods are trucked to a warehouse in county monaghan and from there to a horticultural nursery in county louth dont ask me how i know but it would be rather difficult not to know the people thereabouts know but dont talk from there the weapons are taken to northern ireland not smuggled over the border in the middle of the night by daredevil ira members but brought in during daylight hours in cars driven by women mostly young surrounded by laughing kids all very innocuous its a long long way from where a machinepistol is purchased in a midwestern state until its in the hands of some maniacal killer crouched in the shadows of some back street in belfast or londonderry a long way but in that long way the vital stage the focal point the nodal point the venturi in the funnel is amsterdam and so we have come to amsterdam riordan sat down the breaking of the ensuing silence was far from immediate there were altogether eight men in dessens luxurious lounge three men had accompanied riordan to the minister of justices house samuelson whom de graaf had described to van effen obrien who had come to the trianon and agnelli the man who george had forecast would be there samuelson and obrien probably thought there was nothing they could profitably add to what riordan had said and agnelli had probably yet to recover his full powers of speech when he had entered the room and seen van effen appearance returned to normal sitting there his eyes had momentarily widened his lips momentarily parted and a slight but noticeable amount of colour had left his checks and not momentarily either almost certainly van effen was the only person who had noticed the fleeting seachange that had overcome agnelli but then probably van effen had been the only person who had been looking for it there were also four men on the other side of the negotiating table the two ministers de graaf and van effen and they had nothing to say either and this for two excellent reasons there was nothing they could immediately say that would be in any way helpful and all had to admit to themselves that riordan had expressed his viewpoint with a certain degree of logical persuasion however unreasonable threatening and preposterous his accompanying demands might have been it was aaron wieringa glancing in turn at each of his three companions who broke the silence before i speak gentlemen have any of you any comment to make van effen said i have lieutenant mr riordan has been surprisingly reticent about one thing he hasnt said why he wants all british influence removed from northern ireland if we are to negotiate on his behalf i think we should have the right to know something of his motivation his intentions it may be that his intentions are so awful so appalling that we would risk any disasterto our country sooner than comply with his wishes we have of course no reason to believe that mr riordan ww tell us the truth the point is well takenwieringa said well mr riordan theres no point in swearing that it tell the truth because any liar would say the same riordan had again risen to his menacing height he seemed to find talking easier that way i have talked about the ninetynine point nine per cent of good and decent people in that wartorn country who are utterly dominated by the point one per cent of those maniacal killers our sole objective is to eliminate this point one per cent and enable the people of ulster to resolve their own future in an atmosphere of calm and peace and quiet and hope eliminationwieringa said cautiously what precisely do you mean by that we will exterminate the evil bastards on both sides we will excise the cancer is that blunt enough for you riordan sat down it sounds like a high purpose van effen said he made no attempt to disguise the contemptuous disbelief in his voice noble and humane let them resolve their own future hardly ties in does it with your earlier statement that northern ireland will never be governed by representatives of the two communities has it not occurred to you that if the most conceivably rabid ira leader were sitting in that chair he would talk exactly as you are talking now in order to achieve the same end as you are seeking to get the british out of northern ireland at all costs what assurance do we have that you are not in fact that rabid ira leader you have none this time riordan had riot risen from his chair and his voice was remarkably calm i can do no more if you cannot see that i detest the ira and all its manifestations you must be blind i am so appalled at the suggestion that i cannot easily find words to counter it there was another and even longer silence then wieringa said i believe one calls this an impasse impasse as you say riordan said he was still seated the time for rhetoric had apparently passed but surely there are certain salient factors that should resolve the impasse oostlijk flevoland for instance leeuwarden the noordoost polder wieringermeer putten petten schouwen walchcren and others and i did mention that we have the royal palace mined the palace wieringa said he didnt seem particularly overcome tonights little demonstration was just that a little demonstration just to prove how pathetically easy it is to circumvent your alleged security precautions save your breath riordan wieringas voice was curt no mr this time the time for threats is past only moral considerations remain fiftyfifty van effen said wieringa looked at him for some moments then nodded my way of thinking too thank you lieutenant it is difficult to decide to drown ones country on the basis of a gamble he looked at riordan i am empowered to make decisions i will call the british ambassador he will call the foreign office in london we shall make a radio announcement worded in a suitably cautious fashion you understand those three things i can promise the outcome of the negotiations of course are not for me to predict or influence that is understood that is understood thank you minister there was no hint of triumph not even satisfaction in riordans voice he stood your integrity is a byword throughout europe i am content goodnight gentlemen no one wished him goodnight in return after the departure of riordan and his associates there was silence in the room until wieringa had put through his telephone call when he had replaced the receiver he sipped delicately from brandy glass smiled and said comments gentlemenhe was a remarkably calm its outrageous disgraceful and dastardly dessens said loudly and predictably now that the need for action and decisionmaking was over he was all fire and fury the good name the honour of the netherlands lies in the dust better perhaps than that its citizens should lie under the floodwaterswicrinp said colonel you had to consider the balance of probabilities de graaf said your decision sir was not only the correct one it was the inevitable one thank you colonel lieutenant what can i usefully add sir quite frankly i dont know but according to the colonel and it is i must say a most handsome admission on his part you are closer to those villains than anyone else in amsterdam he smiled i do not of course use the word closer in a pejorative sense thank you sir id hoped not youre not really very forthcoming are you lieutenant a certain uncharacteristic diffidence sir i may be the senior detectivelieutenant in the city but im pretty junior in this exalted company what do you want me to be forthcoming about sir wieringa regarded the roof and said almost inconsequentially i had to make a pretty important decision there he dropped his gaze and looked at van effen did you believe riordan van effen picked up his glass and considered it without drinking from it he was obviously marshalling his thoughts then he said four points minister there are two things i believe about riordan one point im not sure whether to believe or disbelieve and a fourth where i definitely disbelieve ah hence your cryptic remark fiftyfifty i suppose first i believe he is definitely not ira you do lieutenant in that case am i not entitled to ask why you pushed him confirmation but i was sure before that speech of his that impassioned and violent denunciation of the ira and all its methods youd have to be an exceptional actor to get that amount of hatred into your voice but youd have to be an impossibly good one to have a pulse beat like a triphammer in your throat i missed that wieringa said he looked at de graaf and dessens either of you gentlemen he broke off at their mute headshakes secondly continued van effen i believe that riordan is not the leader the driving force the man in charge why do i believe that i cant give a shred of evidence of proof but hes too fiery too unbalanced too unpredictable to be a general you wouldnt fight under him van effen wieringa was halfsmiling half curious no sir theres someone else im certain its not agnelli i would take long odds its not obrien hes got sergeantmajor written all over him im not saying its samuelson hes an enigma a mystery but his presence is totally unexplained and when any presence is as inexplicable as that then a very big explanation would seem to be called for where im uncertain whether to believe his story or not is about northern ireland riordan said his only aim was to eliminate the monsters his voice did carry what might have been regarded as the authentic ring of sincerity and as ive said i dont believe hes all that good an actor van effen sighed briefly shook his head and sipped his brandy i know this is all rather confusing gentlemen let me put it this way i believe that he believes what he says but i dont believe that what he believes is necessarily true its one of the reasons why im convinced hes not the kingpin two things he was caught outright in a flat contradiction yet appeared to be unaware that any such contradiction existed then he seems to be unaware that there could be three sets of fanatics around the extremist protestants the extremist catholics and the mediators thats them the mediators could be the most irresponsibly dangerous of all to achieve the final solution the mediators are prepared to drown a million one could imagine what the final solution would be like in ulster no let me rephrase that i cant imagine that the same thought was in my mind wieringa spoke very slowly the very same although not so clearly formulated in my mind i mean he smiled well that should be enough for a day but you did mention that there was something you didnt believe yes sir i dont believe his threats his immediate threats that is his longrange threats are a different matter but the ones he mentioned here tonight and the ones outlined to colonel de graaf earlier this evening i do not believe with the exception of the threat to helystad in oostlijkfllevoland the rest i believe to be bluff especially the threat to destroy the palace if you say that lieutenantwieringa said im damned if i dont believe you why do you say that because i dont believe they have any mines laid inside the palace they were concerned that the explosion inside the palace tonight would be heard over a considerable area to convince you that they had indeed the ability to carry out their promise wieringa regarded him with a puzzled expression you sound fairly sure about this lieutenant no sir im certain how can you be so sure i have inside information wieringa looked at him in a speculative fashion but said nothing not so dessens he had been totally out of his depth all evening but now he thought he was on secure and known footing and that it was time to assert himself what were the sources of your information lieutenant thats confidential confidential whether the source of dessens immediate anger was due to the reply or the fact that van effen had omitted the mandatory minister or sir was difficult to say he probably didnt know himself confidential im trying to be discreet sir thats all i dont want to divulge my sources because it may cause acute and unnecessary embarrassment surely you can understand that its so commonplace in the police world that its hardly worth the mentioning why dont you just take my word for it understand it commonplace take your word dessens mottling complexion was rapidly assuming the hue of a turkey wattle you arrogant you arrogant you he made a visible effort to ward off the onset of apoplexy i would remind you lieutenant he put a heavy accent on the word lieutenant that i am the minister of justice he put a very heavy accent on that too whereas you are only a junior officer in the force which i personally thats unfair sir de graafs voice was impersonal next to me van effen is the senior police officer in the city of keep out of this de graaf dessens tried to let ice creep into his voice but his temperature control had slipped van effen you heard me i heard you van effen said then added sir almost as an afterthought i know what im talking about because im the person who placed that charge in the cellars of the royal palace what what dessens complexion would now have made any turkeycock look to his laurels good god i cant believe it he was halfway out of his chair my cars deceive me they dont sir i was also the person who pressed the button that detonated the explosives dessens said nothing not immediately the shocked horror of this threat to the safety of the royal family this dreadful majesty held him in thrall van effen returned to his brandy and made no attempt to keep his opinion of the minister of justice out of his face arrest this man de graaf dessens shouted this moment on what charges sir on what charges have you gone mad as well as as well as treason man treason yes sir this raises problems problems your duty man your duty problems sir im the citys chief of police all other policemen in amsterdam are junior to me every century of de graafs aristocratic lineage was showing nobody in amsterdam has the authority to arrest me dessens stared at him his anger gradually changing to bewilderment he shook his head and said nothing what i mean is sir that if lieutenant van effen is to be locked up on a treason charge then youd have to lock me up too because im as much a traitor as he is de graaf considered more i would say i am after all his superior moreover i personally authorized and approved every action the lieutenant has undertaken inconsequentially it seemed but probably to give dessens time to readjust de graaf turned to van effen and said you forgot to tell me that you personally had detonated those explosives van effen shrugged apologetic shoulders you know how it is sir i know de graaf said heavily you have so much on your mind you seem to have told me that before why have you stepped outside the law colonel there was no reproof in wieringas voice only a question wieringa had remained remarkably unperturbed we did not step outside the law sir we are doing and have done everything in our power to uphold the law we lieutenant van effen have gained the entree and a highly dangerous entree it is into the ranks of the fff i think it is more than dangerous its close to suicidal but lieutenant van effen has persuaded me and i most reluctantly agree with him that its our last best hope our only hope dessens looked at the two policemen dazedly but his mind was beginning to function again at least after a fashion how is this possible van effens face must be known to every criminal in amsterdam he had forgotten how junior van effen had been only moments ago it is but not the van effen you see before you all appearance voice and personality have changed to such a remarkable extent that id wager my pension that neither of you would recognize stephan danilov which is the pseudonym he has temporarily and conveniently adopted he might have wagered something else van effen reflected de graaf was so wealthy that his pension was a matter of total indifference to him whether the fff have uncritically accepted stephan danilov at his face value we have no means of knowing it seems incredible to me that so far they appear to have done if they have not done or will not do so the city of amsterdam will be requiring a new senior detectivelieutenant they will also be requiring a new police chief which the lieutenant will probably regard as a trifling matter because i shall have to resign the netherlands of course will be looking for a new minister of justice because you mr dessens are also a party to this only mr wieringa can look forward to a safe tenure dessens looked stricken i havent said that im a party to anything wieringa took him gently by the arm bernhard if you would a word in your ear they walked away to a distant comer of the lounge which was fortunately as large as it was luxurious and began to converse in low terms wieringa appeared to be doing most of the conversing van effen said what weighty matters do you think our revered cabinet ministers are discussing de graaf forgot to reproach van effen for his unseemly and unconstitutional levity no prizes for guessing that mr wieringa is explaining to mr dessens the principle of hobsons choice if dessens doesnt go along the netherlands is still going to be looking for a new minister of justice if dessens hadnt forced you to divulge your confidential information he wouldnt have found himself in the impossible situation he does now hoisted to coin a phrase on his own petard de graaf seemed to find it a moderately entertaining thought he settled himself comfortably in his chair sighed and reached out for the brandy bottle well thank heaven everythings over for the day van effen considerately let de graaf pour himself some brandy and sip it before producing agnellis shopping list not quite complete im afraid sir theres this little item de graaf read through the list his face stunned then read through it again his lips were moving but at first no sound came he had just got around to muttering this blue item this little item when wieringa and dessens returned wieringa looked his normal imperturbable self dessens like a christian who had just been given his first preview of the lions in the roman arena wierinva said what little item colonel this de graaf handed him the paper put his elbow on the arm of his chair and his hand to his forehead as if to hide hi s eyes from some unspeakable sight high explosives wieringa read out primers detonators grenades groundtoground missiles groundtoair missiles he looked at van effen consideringly but with no signs of consternation on his face what is this a shopping list i was going to ask the colonel to get it for me desserts who had adopted precisely the same attitude as de graaf made a slight moaning sound as you are the minister of defence the colonel would have had to approach you anyway id also like to borrow an army truck if i may with a little luck i may ever be able to return it wieringa looked at him looked at the paper in his hand then back at van effen again balanced against this shopping list as you call it the loan of the odd army vehicle seems an eminently reasonable request all this i can obtain without any great difficulty i have heard a considerable amount about you van effen and i have learnt a great deal more tonight i would hesitate to question your judgement he thought for a moment i think i would question my own first so i dont question yours no doubt its just idle curiosity on my part but it would be nice to know why you require those items the fff seem to be short of explosives and offensive weapons so i have promised to supply them with some of course wieringa said of course the defence minister appeared to be virtually unshockable certainly nothing showed in his eyes nothing was to be seen in the eyes of de graaf or dessens either but that didnt mean that they were shockproof their shading hands still cut their eyes off from the dreadful realities of the harsh world outside they also seem to be short of explosive experts so i volunteered my services you know something about explosives de graaf reluctantly uncovered his eyes he knows a great deal about explosives hes also a bomb disposal expert i wish he said bitterly that this was something simple like defusing a ticking kilo bomb yes sir van effen was addressing de graaf now ive also recruited george and vasco george as another person versed in the way of explosives and vasco as a trained missile launcher you will understand that i did not have time to consult you on those matters you cant think of everything de graaf said dully he discovered to his apparent astonishment that his brandy glass was empty and set about rectifying this nothing illegal about recruiting those two men mr wieringa theyre police sergeants and they werent recruited they volunteered they know the dangers theres nothing to be done about the explosives sir but if you could have an amourer deactivate the missiles id be very grateful de graaf lowered his glass so would i so would l not much in the way of life had come back into his voice wieringa said i suppose im just being idly curious again but why are you and your two friends taking these appalling risks calculated risks sir i hope the reason is simple the colonel has said that we have gained an entree into the fff thats not quite accurate we have been accepted or appear to have been accepted on the fringes were just on the outer strand of the spiders web we dont know where the spider is but if we deliver the requested items well find out theyre not likely to leave missiles and missile launchers in a safe deposit box in the central station impeccable logic van effen impeccable logic except of course for one tiny little flaw sir the spider may gobble you up the scheme is mad quite mad which is the only reason it might just succeed id be intrigued to know where and when you arranged this about an hour and a half ago over a drink with agnelli for the first time wicringas monolithic calm cracked over a drink with agnelli agnelli agnelli one of those men who have just left i was stephan danilov then well cant think of anything else so with your permission ill be on my way the weather forecast should be interesting tonight latest reports say flood level danger inside the next fortyeight hours might even exceed that of february that will be the time for our friends and it doesnt leave a great deal of time for negotiations with the british government you will remember that i said i didnt believe in riordans shortrange threats im convinced that the longrange threat the massive flooding of the country has been arranged and is totally real one small point colonel riordans allegations against the integrity of our customs theyre ludicrous i know that you know that the world doesnt im convinced that the transfers are taking place in the lisselmeer waddenzee or the open see its a navy job god knows weve got a bad enough name already as a gunrunning entrepot i wonder what it will be like when all this is over van effen smiled still its not a job that can be handled by a junior police officer only the ministries of defence and justice can cope goodnight gentlemen moment peter moment it was de graaf and his distress was apparent surely theres something we can do to help yes sir there is do nothing absolutely nothing any attempt to help us will probably help us into our graves those are clever and desperate men so please please dont try anything clever and desperate yourselves dont have the truck followed not in any way no matter how clever you think you are nothing no helicopters no blind barrelorganist nothing and nothing so futile and puerile as fitting a concealed location transmitter bug to the truck unless theyre mentally retarded its the first thing theyd look for nothing do nothing we take your point wieringa said drily nothing his tone changed but from what youve just said lloyds of london wouldnt insure you for a ninetynine per cent premium but you go for the last time why you heard what mr dessens said the good name and honour of the netherlands in the dust and you with its citizens full fathom five we cant have that can we your sister what about my sister the colonel told me tonight god only knows how you carry on as you do i couldnt kidnapped shes part of it i would not care to be the unfortunate man who abducted her when you meet up with him ive already met up with this unfortunate man what for the second time wieringas selfcontrol deserted him but he recovered quickly when tonight where here agnelli agnelli i should have shot him full of holes theres a law against it im a policeman im supposed to uphold the law sworn to it in fact he left wieringa said i begin to believe some of the stories about van effen the notsonice ones god arthur thats his sister no blood in his veins none ice yes sir lets hope agnelli has not hurt julie what do you mean then hes a dead man sure sure van effens sworn to uphold the law but only in front of witnesses wieringa stared at him then nodded slowly and reached for his glass eight at noon on that february day the streets of amsterdam were dark as dusk at noon on that same day the streets were as deserted as those of any longdead city the cloud cover driven by that icy northern wind must have been black and heavy and thousands of feet in depth but it could not be seen the torrential slanting rain that bounced kneehigh off those same deserted streets limited visibility in any direction including vertically to only a few yards it was not a noontide for the welladvised to venture out of doors van effen george and vasco were among the very few who seemed to be singularly illadvised they stood in the porch way of the trianon hotel sheltering from the monsoonlike rain behind the side glass panels van effen was subjecting vasco to a critical examination not bad vasco not at all bad even if i hadnt known it was you i dont think i would have recognized you im quite certain i would have brushed by you in the street and not given you a second look but dont forget that romero agnelli had the opportunity of studying you very closely over the table at the hunters horn on the other hand the clothes you wore on that occasion were so outlandish that he probably didnt spend much time examining your face it will serve vasco had indeed undergone a considerable metamorphosis the long blond locks that had straggled haphazardly over his shoulder had been nearly even severely trimmed and parted with millimetric precision just to the centre left his hair was also black as were his eyebrows and newlyacquired and immaculately shaped moustache all of which went very well with his shadowed thinneddown cheeks and heavy tan all dyes were guaranteed waterproof he was the maidens conceptualized dream of what every young army officer should look like shirt tie suit and belted trenchcoat were correspondingly immaculate they could use him in those army advertisements george said you know your country needs you george himself was still george for him disguise was impossible and the voice van effen said im not worried about agnelli hes hardly heard you say more than a few words its annemarie i dont know whether shes a good actress with her emotions under control or not but i rather suspect not it would rather spoil things if she flung her arms round your neck and cried my saviour i have a very bad cold vasco said hoarsely my throat is like sandpaper his voice reverted to normal and he said morosely whose throat wouldnt be in this damned weather anyway ill be the strong silent type i shall speak as little as possible and george saidshall lurk discreetly in the background until one of you have advised the ladies if the ladies arc indeed there of my presence but make it fast well make it as fast as we can george van effen said we appreciate its a bit difficult for you to lurk discreetly anywhere for any length of time and i have no doubt whatsoever the ladies will be there he tapped the newspaper under his arm whats the point in holding a couple of trumps if you dont have them in your hand the fffs latest announcement had been very simple direct and to the point they had now with them they said crude words like abducted and kidnapped had been studiously avoided two young ladies one of them the daughter of the nations leading industrialist the other the sister of a senior police officer in amsterdam they had then proceeded to name names condolences the fff had said had been sent to both parents and brother together with assurances that they were being well cared for and expressing the pious hope that they would continue to remain in good health i do look forward to meeting those card players george said wistfully crafty bunch of devils arent they i wonder what american university or it could be irish offers a combined course in terrorism and psychology theyre not exactly mentally retardedvan effen said but then we never thought they were another push up the back for the arm of the government and another push into an even more impossible situation just ending their message with those prayerful good wishes no threats no hints of reprisals or what might happen to the girls no possibility of torture or even death nothing the old uncertainty principle in full operation again what we are left to wonder do they have in mind thats left to us and of course its only human nature to come up with the worst possible scenario bad enough to have the country threatened with inundation but for the tenderhearted and romantic and even among the socalled stolid dutch there are an uncommon number of those around the thought of what dreadful terrors may lie in store for two beautiful and innocent young damsels could be a great deal worse well theres one consolationvasco said he was practising his in extremis voice again im sure thats the last threat about your sisters wellbeing that youll be getting lieutenant stephan van effen said stephan i know but i wont apologize this time vascos voice was back to normal once i clap eyes on that lot theres not the slightest chance ill forget my mistakevan effen said im the person whos doing the forgetting about your undercover years i agree with you therell be no more threats to julie by the same token i dont even think theyll bother to try to extract any money from david meijer apart from the fact that they appear to have unlimited funds of their own david meijer is much more important to them as david meijer the man who however unofficially has very much the ear of the government and is in a position to influence them to swing whatever decision may be under consideration not that i think that the government has any decision under consideration i think that matter has been effectively taken out of their hands now the ball in the american phrase is now very much in the court of the british i wouldnt very much like to be in the position of the british either george said they face a position that if its possible is even worse than the one our government had to face are they going to be dictated to even by proxy by a bunch of what are essentially no more than terrorists no matter what lofty motives they may ascribe to themselves what will happen in northern ireland if they did pull out would there be strife and murder even massacre that might cost more than any lives that could or would be lost in the netherlands and of course we can have no idea of how many lives that might be hundreds or hundreds of thousands or do they just dig in refuse to move and sit back and let the hollanders drown and make themselves the lepers of the world ostracised perhaps for generations to come by all nations and although this is a wicked old world there must be still quite a few left who still subscribe to some ideals of decency and humanity i do wish youd shut up george rarely for him van effen sounded almost irritable you put the damn thing all too clearly in a nutshell its a tossup between what value is put on the lives of x number of citizens in ulster against number of citizens in the netherlands van effen smiled without much mirth its difficult to solve an equation when you dont even have a clue as to what the factors are imponderables imponderables the physicists who ramble on about the indeterminates and uncertainties in quantum mechanics should have this one dumped on their laps me id rather spin a coin heads or tails george said what way do you think the coin would land have absolutely no idea because of course no one eve knows which face the coin is going to show but theres one factor that is at least faintly determinate even although that is wildly uncertain and that is human nature so at a wild guess just as wild as guessing at the toss i would say that the british would give in george was silent for a few moments one massive hand caressing his chin then said the british havent got much of a reputation for giving in feed any of them enough beer or scotch or whatever and like as not someone will end up by telling you that no unspeakable foreigner has ever set foot on their sacred soil for a thousand years which is true and its the only country in the world that can claim that true true but not applicable or at least of importance here this is not a case of churchill declaiming that we will fight in the streets hills beaches or wherever and that we will never surrender thats for martial warfare and in martial warfare the parameters and issues are clearcut this is psychological warfare where the distinctions are blurred out of sight are the british any good at psychological warfare im not sure they are come to that im not sure that any country is too many indefinables i dont think anyway that its a factor of either martial or psychological warfare if theres any factor thats going to count its the factor of human nature this is how it might just possibly happen the british will bluff and bluster rant and rave you have to admit that they yield first place to none when it comes to that throw their arms in the general direction of a mindless heaven appeal for common justice and claim theyre as pure and white and innocent as the driven snow which at this moment of time and conveniently forgetting their notso distant bloody history they have some justification in claiming to be what they will ask have we done to precipitate this intolerable situation and why should they luckless lambs being led to the slaughter etc be forced to find an impossible solution to an impossible problem which is none of their making all quite true of course why they will cry is no one in the world lifting a finger to help us specifically those idle spineless cowardly incompetent etc dutch who cant bear to separate themselves from their cheese and tulips and gin even for the few moments it would take to eradicate this monster in their midst nobody of course is going to pay a blind bit of attention to what they are saying and when i say they i dont mean the british people as a whole i mean whitehall their government and heres where the first real bit of human nature comes in the british have always prided themselves on their compassion fairmindedness tolerance and undying sympathy for the underdog never mind what a few hundred million exsubjects of the british empire would have to say on that subject and their kindness to dogs cats and whatever else takes their passing fancy that they may be happily existing in a world of sheer illusion is irrelevant what is relevant for them is that what other people may regard as sheer hypocrisy is for them received truth it is an immutable fact of life british life that is so that if we poor dutch even as much as got our feet wet their moral outrage would be fearful to behold their indignation would be unbounded ditto their consternation the principles of all they think they hold dear destroyed their finer sensible ties trampled in the mud the times letter department would be swamped in an unprecedented deluge of mail all of it demanding that the criminals responsible for this atrocity should be held to account x number of heads on x number of chargers john the baptist raised to the nth and now the second real bit of human nature whitehall is acutely aware who the john the baptists would be the government any government come to that may regard themselves as statesmen or cabinet ministers but deep down in their cowering hearts they know full well that they are only jumped up politicians strutting their brief hour upon the stage politicians they are and politicians in those fearful hearts they will always remain and in their little egoistic political minds they are concerned with rare exceptions our minister of defence is one only with security of tenure the trappings of office and the exercise of power their egos are their existence and if you destroy their egos you destroy their existence or at least consign them to the political wilderness for many years to come there would be a landslide defeat for them at the next election or much more likely they would be turfed out of office very promptly for your average cabinet minister such a possibility is too appalling for contemplation so we wont get our feet wet motivated not by their own miserable fear cowardice greed and love of power but by the overriding dictates of common humanity whitehall will gallantly bow its head to the terrorists there was a considerable silence interrupted only by the hissing and drumming of rain on the window panes and streets and the constant rumbling of distant thunder then george said you never did have a very high opinion of politicians did you peter im in the sort of job where i have the unfortunate privilege of coming into contact with far too many of them george shook his head thats as may be but thats a very very cynical outlook to adopt peter we live in a very very cynical world george indeed indeed there was a pause and this time george nodded his head but sadly i have to agree with you on both counts about the world and about the politicians nobody had anything more to say until a van drew up before the hotel entrance it was in fact the minibus that had been used in the dam square the previous evening romero agnelli who was driving wound down the window and slid back the door behind him jump in you can tell me where to go jump out van effen said we want to talk to you you want to whats wrong for gods sake we just want to talk you can talk inside the bus we may not be going anywhere in that bus you havent got the weve got everything are we going to stand here all day shouting at each other through the rain agnelli slid the door forward opened his own and got out followed by leonardo daniken and obrien they hastily mounted the steps into the shelter of the porch what the hell do you think youre doing agnelli said the suave veneer had cracked a little and what the hell and who the hell do you think youre talking to van effen said were not your employees were your partners or we thought we were you think you agnelli cut himself off frowned smiled and hauled his urbanity back into place if we must talk and it seems we must wouldnt it be a little more pleasant inside certainly this by the way is the lieutenant van effen made the introductions which vasco hoarsely acknowledged apologizing profusely for the state of his throat agnelli it was clear had no idea who he was even going as far as to say that vasco couldnt possibly be anything else than an army officer inside seated in a remote corner of the lounge van effen unfolded his newspaper and laid it on the table before agnelli i suppose you can see those headlines um well yes as a matter of fact i can he could hardly have failed to for the banner headline was the biggest the newspaper could produce it read quite simply fff blackmails two nations which was followed by a number of only slightly smaller headlines which were concerned primarily with the perfidy of the fff the heroic resolution of the dutch government the dauntless defiance of the british government and one or two other lies yes well we rather thought you might have read something like thisagnelli said and we did think you might have been a little troubled but only a little i mean i personally can see no reason for concern or that anything has radically altered you knew what the reasons for your employment sorry engagement were and you knew what we were doing so what has changed so much overnight this much has changed george said the scope of the thing the escalation of the plan the sheer enormity of the matter im a dutchman mr agnelli the lieutenant is a dutchman stephan danilov may not be dutch born but hes a damn sight more dutch than he is anything else and were not going to stand by and see our country drowned and country mr agnelli means people it is certain that none of us three operates inside the law it is equally certain that none of us would ever again operate outside the law if we thought that our actions would bring harm to any person alive quite apart from that were out of our depth we are not smalltime criminals but we do not act at an international level what do you people want with northern ireland why do you want the british out why do you blackmail our government or the british why do you threaten to drown thousands of us why threaten to blow up the royal palace or havent you read the papers are you all mad we are not mad agnelli sounded almost weary its you who are mad if you believe all that you read in the papers the papers have just printed in this instance what your government has told them to say in a state of national emergency and the government do regard this as such they have the power to do so and the government have told them what we told them to say they have followed our instructions precisely we have no intention of hurting a single living soul northern ireland is still a far cry from blackmailing the dutch government for a little ready cashvan effen said this we thought had been your original intention and one with which wed have gone along quite willingly we have no reason to love the government he stared off into the far distance i have no reason to like quite a number of governments on the basis of what you have told me agnelli said i can quite understand that he smiled produced his ebony cigaretteholder fitted a turkish cigarette and lit it with his goldinlaid onyx lighter all of which demonstrated that he was at ease in charge and back on balance again assuming that is that he had ever been off it in the first place cash is the basis gentlemen and only cash precisely how it is the basis i am not yet permitted to divulge but you have my assurance that it is the sole and only motivation and you also have my assurance which you can take or leave as you choose that we have no intention of bringing harm to anyone and quite honestly in saying so we are not so moved perhaps by humanitarian considerations as you are organized crime on a large scale is big business and we run our affairs on a businesslike basis emotion is nothing calculation all killing not only pays no dividends it is counterproductive a robber is pursued by the law but only within reasonable limits but he who kills in the process of robbery is relentlessly pursued no no gentlemen we are in the business of conducting a purely psychological warfare george reached across the table and touched another headline kidnapping young ladies is another form of psychological warfare but of course one of the most effective of all psychological forms of blackmail it touches the strings of ones heart you understand you are a coldblooded bastardgeorge said genially when george was at his most genial he was at his most menacing and the slight compression of agnellis lips showed that he realized that he was in the presence of menace i wonder how you would like it if your wife sister or daughter were held with a gun at their heads or a knife at their throats and dont throw up your hands in horror blackmailers never hold hostages without accompanying threats of what will happen if their blackmailing ends are not achieved as often as not such threats are carried out what would it be in this case turning them over to some of the less uninhibited among your employees for a few hours innocent pleasure torture or the ultimate we are as we have repeatedly told you not men of violence but if any harm were to come in any way to those young ladies totally harmless and innocent as we believe them to be we would be capable of actions that you would regard as being acts of unimaginable violence i do wish you would believe me mr agnelli agnelli believed him all right the atmosphere in the trianons lounge was acceptably cool but a sheen of sweat had suddenly appeared on agnellis forehead george said why for instance did you kidnap this anne meijer is it because her father runs a minor kingdom of his own and may be presumed to have a powerful voice in government agnelli nodded silently and this lie twisted the paper to have a glance at it this julie van effen shes only a policemans sister there are thousands of policemen in the netherlands theres only one van effen agnelli spoke with a considerable depth of feeling we know theres a nationwide hunt up for us but we also know whos leading it van effen if we have his sister and we do we may clip his wings a bit you dont sound as if you care for this man very much agnelli said nothing the look in his eyes said it for him and you still ask me to believe that you wouldnt subject those girls to some subtle or not so subtle forms of persuasion to achieve your ends i dont really care whether you believe me or not once again agnelli was beginning to sound more than a little tired i believe you are quite capable of doing what you say you would do if you found out we are deceiving you i have no doubt that you are heavily armed i suggest you come along and see and believe for yourselves that includes seeing our hostages this afternoon if you dont like what you see you can leave or take any other measures you think appropriate theres nothing else i can say and i cant speak fairer than that george said stephan well go along mr agnellis explanations may be a bit thin but if we are to believe in the essence of what he saysand i have no reason to think that we shouldnt then i think we all may have a great deal to lose if we are raising objections to a state of affairs that do not exist it wouldnt be very bright of us to cut off our own noses as mr agnelli says lets go and see for ourselves thank you gentlemen agnelli didnt mop his brow perhaps because he wasnt the browmopping kind but almost certainly because he would not have regarded it as a very politic thing to do i was by no means convinced that you would come to see it my way you are exceptionally difficult negotiators if i may say so but i am glad you have done moderation reasonableness courtesy agnelli could generously afford all of those now that he had had as he thought his own way now wheres the truck nearby garage garage is it safe i own it george said goodness sake do you think this is the first time of course silly question we have one or two questions van effen said were committed now and weve no more wish to take chances than you have i dont for a moment suppose well know where this place is until we get there have you a place of concealment for this truck yes how many people are going out there apart from yourselves the three of us mr riordan whom you havent met but have read about joop and joachim why please my turn for questions you travel in the minibus well no wed hoped there would be plenty of room in the truck no indeed van effen thought they wanted to keep the closest possible eye on the three of them and the precious contents of the truck how many cars carsagnelli looked faintly surprised no cars why why van effen looked at the ceiling then at george then back at agnelli why tell me mr agnelli have you ever transported stolen government property before this will be a new experience for me i want two cars one to follow the truck at two or three hundred metres the other to follow the first car at a similar distance ah well now i appreciate this you do not wish to be followed i have a rooted objection to being followed one chance in a million we do not take that chance good good joop and joachim ill phone now last question we forgot to discuss this do we return to the city tonight no you should have told us we do require a toothbrush or two however we guessed right and packed some gear three minutes in the lobby back in his room van effen said george ive said it before and say it again your career has been a wasted one ruined and misplaced that was splendid quite splendid george made a mockmodest gesture of depreciation it was nothing how to establish a moral ascendancy in one easy lesson theyre going to go out of their way not to step on our toes and did you gather the impression george that they need us more than we need them or at least that they think so yes intriguing very second they know that theyre not going to be followed it was our suggestion so that makes us trustworthy anyone can see that it will also we trust make them relax their vigilance we trust third a n thanks to you it is certain that agnelli has no idea whatsoever who i am agnelli is sadly in need of a course of instruction from you hes a poor dissembler and overreacts too easily it is not possible that knowing who i was he could have sat at the same table without giving himself away lastly it seems fairly certain that well be safe until or unless they find out who we are or until we are no longer of any use to them when they have achieved whatever it is they want to achieve that is but i think the latter unlikely i could understand them wanting to dispose of us if we were to betray their identity but their identity is already well known the names of those in dessens house last night will probably be in every major newspaper in europe this morning or by nightfall and the tv and radio i asked mr wieringa to make specially sure about that and didnt you love all this talk about limiting themselves solely to pure psychology and being interested only in cash returns you believed him of course you cant always trust a man like mr agnelli agnelli obrien and daniken were waiting in the lounge when the two men descended van effen said fixed yes but one thing we overlooked or i overlooked i said id call them back i didnt know whether to ask them to come here or not well let them know when we move out in the truck why not call them from here van effen looked at him as if in faint surprise do you ever make two consecutive calls from the same phone do i agnelli shook his head and to think that i thought i was the most suspicious most securityconscious person around do we move now the heating in dutch army trucks is rather substandard i suggest a schnapps we have time we have very well until the lieutenant comes i assume he doesnt join us we join him thats why i suggested a schnapps takes him a little time i see rather i dont hes not going to join hes leaving by the fire escape the lieutenant has a penchant for unorthodox exits also hes bashful about calling attention to himself unorthodox bashful i understand now standing by what appeared to be a freshly painted army truck in an otherwise empty brightly lit small garage agnelli surveyed the rather impressive figure of vasco who was now attired in what was obviously a brand new dutch army captains uniform yes i understand the desk staff in the trianon would have found the change rather intriguing but i thought um the lieutenant was a lieutenant old habits die hard you dont change a mans name just because he changes his suit promoted last month services to queen and country services to ah i see agnelli it was clear didnt see at all and whats this bright orange dagger flash on the radiator manoeuvres do not approach you dont miss much and thats a fact agnelli said may i look inside naturally i wouldnt like you to think that youd bought a pig in a poke this mr danilov is the most unlikely looking pig in a poke that ive ever seen agnelli had inspected the neatly stacked and in the case of the missiles and launchers highly gleaming contents of the truck and was now actually rubbing his hands together magnificent quite magnificent by heavens mr danilov when george here is given a shopping list i must say that he delivers i wouldnt have believed it george made a dismissive gesture a little assistance from the lieutenant here next time something a little room difficult splendid splendid agnelli looked towards the front of the truck and at the heavily sidecurtained bench seat behind the front seats that too i see mr danilov that you share my passion for privacy not i senior dutch army officers on manoeuvres no matter mr riordan i am sure will be delighted when you meet him you will understand why he is a man of a rather striking appearance and rather difficult to conceal which is a pity as he does like his privacy agnelli was silent for a moment then cleared his throat and said in view of all this and the very very stringent security precautions you have taken mr danilov i do feel a bit in fact very diffident about asking but well do you mind if mr obrien here carried out a closer inspection van effen smiled ive often wondered what mr obriens function might be but this well im slightly puzzled if mr obrien knows more about explosives and arms than we three do then he must be europes leading expert and our services would seem to be superfluous explosives mr danilov obrien was an easy smiler and had a pleasant light baritone voice a natural for the rendering of when irish eyes explosives terrify me im an electronics man mr obrien is being modest agnelli said hes an electronics expert and one of the very best in the business security alarms installation or deactivating ah burglar alarms photoelectric rays pressure pads things like that always wanted to meet one of those itll be a pleasure to watch one at work little enough scope i would have thought for an electronics man around an army truck wait a minute van effen paused briefly then smiled by all means go ahead mr obrien ill take long odds against you finding one though finding what mr danilov one of those dinky little location transmitters agnelli and obrien exchanged glances agnelli said dinky little i mean how on earth because i removed one this morning rather the lieutenant did it for me agnelli as van effen had said would never stand in line for an oscar he was perplexed apprehensive and suspicious all at the same time but why should one i mean how did you suspect dont distress yourself van effen smiled perfectly simple explanation you see but this is an army truck precisely far from uncommon on army trucks use them on their silly war games especially at night when theres no lights permitted and strict radio silence only way they can locate each other the lieutenant knew where they were usually concealed and found and detached this one vasco opened a map compartment by the drivers seat removed a tiny metallic object and handed it to van effen who passed it over to obrien thats it all right obrien said he looked doubtfully at agnelli in that case romero no no van effen said go ahead and search be happier if you do damn truck could be littered with them for all i know speaking personally i wouldnt know where to start looking agnelli trying with his usual lack of success to conceal his relief nodded to obrien van effen and george left the truck and wandered idly around talking in a desultory fashion agnelli they could see was displaying a keen interest in obrien at work but none in them in a far corner van effen said must be an interesting profession being a professional dismantler of alarm systems very useful too if you want to get at the private art collection of some billionaire or other or into a secret army base or bank vaults its also useful if you want to blow up a dyke or a canal bank no i didnt think so either although it was only just after i pm when they left the garage it could well have been nighttime for the amount of light left in the sky and although it seemed impossible that the amount of rain could have increased it undoubtedly had the truck was equipped with twospecd wipers but might almost as well have been equipped with none at all and the wind blew even more strongly from the north apart from the occasional triple tram the streets were deserted one might almost have thought that the efforts and intention of the fff were wasted holland it appeared was about to drown under the weight of its own rainfall agnelli had made his phone call from the garage shortly after leaving it at a word from agnelli vasco who was driving pulled up outside an undistinguished cafe off the utrechtsestraat two cars were parked there both small both renaults agnelli got out and spoke hurriedly to the invisible drivers of the cars he had need to hurry he had no umbrella and his gabardine raincoat offered no protection at all to the pitiless rain joachim and joop he said on his return they are following us to a restaurant just this side of amstelveen even the fff must eat agnelli was probably back to his smiling again but it was impossible to say the inside of the truck was almost totally dark if they can follow us van effen said in this weather i can see that my precautions were superfluous i thought we were to meet your brother and mr riordan i must say i shall be most interested to meet your mr riordan if the newspaper accounts are anything to go by he must be a most extraordinary character he ignored georges heavy nudge in the ribs hes all that theyve elected to remain in the cats i dont suppose they fancied getting wet well meet up in de groene lanteerne riordan was indeed an extraordinary character for some extraordinary reason known only to himself he had elected to dress himself in a sweeping neckbuttoned blackandwhite shepherds tartan cloak with matching deerstalker of the type much favoured by highland lairds and sherlock holmes as the cloak ended six inches above his knees and hence made him took even more incongruously tall and skeletal than ever he couldnt possibly have been trying to make himself as inconspicuous as possible he had greeted everyone civilly enough when he wasnt declaiming against the ira he was it seemed a normally grave and courteous man raised his eyes at the sight of vascos uniform ready accepted its explanation and thereafter remained silent not from any wish to disassociate himself from those at the table but because he was carrying a large very intricate and expensivelooking radio and had a pair of earphones clamped to his head he was listening agnelli explained to weather forecasts and dutch and international news broadcasts agnelli didnt have to explain why lunch over riordan elected to continue the journey in the truck earphones still in place he ensconced himself in the righthand corner of the rear bench seat and seemed to approve of the heavy side curtain which he pushed as far forward as possible vasco drove south during the dark afternoon making the best speed possible which because of the near zero visibility was no speed at all van effen was particularly impressed by the carefuly polite attention vasco paid to agnellis wouldbe meticulous instruction as how to drive through utrecht as vasco had beer born bred lived all his life and been a police driver in utrecht it said much for vascos heroic patience that he three times followed directions that he must have known to be wrong about midafternoon riordan unhooked his earphones progress gentlemen progress the dutch foreign minister and defence minister thats that excellent mr wieringa of theirs arrived in london this afternoon and are meeting with their counterparts a communiquй is expected it shows that we are being taken seriously van effen said after those scare headlines those banner headlines in the papers today and all the emergency news flashes on tv and radio did you seriously expect not to be taken seriously no but gratifying none the less gratifying riordan reaffixed his earphones and leaned back into his corner the expression on his face was an odd mixture of the expectant and the beatific a man with a mission riordan wasnt going to miss out on anything some twenty minutes later the truck pulled off to the right on to a broad and a couple of kilometres further on left on to a still more minor road it stopped at a building which appeared to be fronted by a brightlylit porch journeys end agnelli said our headquarters well one of them and our overnight stop i think youll be quite comfortable here a windmill van effen said you seem surprised agnelli said hardly uncommon in these parts disused but still functional which is also not unusual large extensions and quite modernized it has the additional attraction of being a long way from anywhere if you look to this side youll see the place of concealment i promised for the truck disused barn and that other barnlike structure beside it state secret helicopter agnelli laughed in the darkness end of state secret obvious i suppose since we told people that we had taken aerial photographs of those rather stirring scenes north of alkmaar on the noord holland canal so youre now the happy owner of both army and airforce property no not air force indistinguishable though a lick of paint here a lick of paint there some carefully selected registration numbers but its unimportant lets go inside and see what we can find in the way of old dutch cheer and hospitality now that he had as he thought completed his mission with a hundred per cent degree of success he was positively radiating a genial cordiality it could well van effen thought represent his true nature nature had not designed him for the cut and thrust riposte and parry that he had been through that afternoon not for megeorge said im a businessman and a businessman always likes to if youre referring to payment george i can assure you payment im not referring to payment george sounded pained im referring to standard business practices lieutenant is there an overhead light thank you george produced a sheaf of papers from an inside pocket and handed them to agnelli inventory of goods you have to sign the receipt but not until i have checked the conditions of all the items you will understand that i had no time to do so this morning and see how they survived the transport standard business ethics no one seemed to find it peculiar that george should use the word ethics in connection with stolen goods but some of that hospitality wouldnt come amiss beer for me of course agnelli said then added delicately would you be requiring any help not really but it is customary for a purchaser or purchasers agent to be present i would suggest mr obrien electronics experts are accustomed to small fiddly things and detonators are small fiddly things a carelessly dropped detonator mr agnelli and there wouldnt be a great deal left of your windmill there wouldnt be a great deal left of the people inside it either agnelli nodded his satisfaction and led the way to the porch that had been added to the windmill a tall shockhaired and unshaven youth whose most notable facial characteristic was the negligible clearance between eyebrows and hairline moved to bar their entrance a machinepistol was held loosely in his right hand one side willi agnellis voice was sharp its me i can see that willi scowled it was the kind of face that wasnt built for much else and stared truculently at van effen whos he hospitalityvan effen said our genial host no doubt god help us is this the kind of hired help you have around here willi took a threatening step forward lifting his gun as he did so then subsided gently to the ground clutching his midriff as he did so the blow he had received there had been no friendly tap van effen took his gun removed the magazine and dropped the gun on top of the wheezing willi van effen stared at agnelli his expression a nice mix of consternation and disbelief frankly im appalled i dont like this one little bit is this i mean is he typical you have retarded morons like this on your team people who are going to hold no people who are holding nations to ransom having having words fail me have you never heard of the weakest link in the chain my own sentiments exactlyriordan said gravely you will remember romero that i expressed my reservations about this fellow even as a guard the only possible function he could serve his limitations have been cruelly exposed i agree mr riordan i agree it would have been untrue to say that agnelli was discomfited but his ebullience was in temporary abeyance willi is a disappointment he shall have to go i willi had now slipped over on to his side he was conscious enough propped on one shaky elbow and grimacing with pain van effen looked over his all but prone form to the opened doorway beyond his sister was there annemarie by her side samuelson just behind them the expression on both girls faces were markedly similar slightly wideeyed slightly shocked totally uncomprehending van effen let his eyes rest on them for a brief moment then looked indifferently away have to go mr agnelli have to go if he goes i go cant you see that youre stuck with him want it or not stuck with him either above ground or below let him go and the first thing hell do is talk his head off to the first policeman he meets no drastic methods preferably but his silence must be assured i hope the rest of your praetorian guard is a cut above this character the rest of the praetorian guard as you call them are more than a cut above this unfortunate samuelson rubicund smiling and looking even more prosperous than the previous evening had gently pushed the girls apart and stepped out on to the stoop he smelt of some very expensive aftershave lotion rubbing his chin with an immaculately manicured hand he peered down at willi then looked up at van effen you do have a direct way with you my friend at the same time one must admit that you come to some remarkably quick conclusions in a commendably short time i must confess that i have occasionally felt tempted to do just what you have done but well explosive violence of that kind is not my forte ah yes i saw it all very economical very he extended a hand samuelson danilov judging from both his bearing and his speech van effen was in no doubt that he was in the presence of the man who mattered his speech samuelson had said so few words the previous evening that his country of origin had remained uncertain de graaf had thought him irishamerican de graaf van effen thought had been wrong this man was englishamerican perhaps even an englishman who had spent just long enough in the united states to pick up a slight american overtone van effen gestured to the fallen man sorry about this mr samuelson one does not usually treat a hosts staff in so summary a fashion on the other hand you must admit that its not the average guest who finds himself confronted with a submachine gun a welltaken point mr danilov like agnelli samuelson seemed much given to warm and friendly smiles a breach of hospitality it will be the last as you yourself have personally assured all is well romero perfect mr samuelson everything there everything in order exactly as mr danilov guaranteed splendid mr danilov does have a certain aura of competence about him come in come in wretched evening absolutely wretched that thought van effen made him english for sure and good evening to you captain i understood you were a lieutenant a very very recent captain vasco said hoarsely sorry about this throat dear me dear me samuelson sounded genuinely concerned a hot toddy and at once samuelson did not seem to find it at all amiss that a regular army captain should be in their company but a man with so smoothly unlined a face could take many things in his stride without registering reactions of any kind let me introduce our two charming guests miss meijer miss van effen van effen bowed briefly those are the two who figured so prominently in the headlines this morning their photographs didnt do them justice agnelli said mr danilov and his friends were rather concerned about their wellbeing mr samuelson ah yes compatriots of course no need no need as you can see both in excellent health there were five other people in the room all men two were earnest looking intellectual looking youths cast in the mould of joachim and joop the other three were older bigger and a great deal tougher looking although that didnt mean that they were in any way more dangerous apart from the fact that they lacked sunglasses they looked uncommonly like the secret service men who guard an american president there was nothing criminal in their appearances samuelson didnt see fit to introduce them as a result indeed of some signal that van effen had not seen they all quietly left the room well now van effen looked at samuelson agnelli and riordan in turn i dont know which of you i should address it doesnt matter we have delivered the material one of our number is at present checking the explosives and armaments to see that they are in the best possible working order we understood that some call might be made on our services our expertise if one might put it that way if you dont require us theres no point in our remaining we have no wish to impose ourselves on anybody samuelson smiled you would rather go van effen smiled in turn i think you are perfectly well aware that we would rather stay im as curious as the next man besides it would be most interesting to know what is going to happen without having to wait to read about it in the newspapers stay you shall samuelson said we will probably have need of your expertise we do in fact have plans for you but first perhaps a soupcion of borreltje pm and pm i understand is the prescribed hour leonardo this to agnellis brother who had just entered with daniken be so kind as to have some hot water brought from the kitchen this van effen felt certain made samuelson the man who called the tune and some honey we must do something about this fearful cold the captain has come join me a log fire burnt in an open hearth built into the window less back wall adjoining this was a circular oaken bar small but quite splendidly stocked samuelson moved behind this as riordan said you will of course excuse me of course james of course samuelson said van effen felt faintly surprised riordan didnt look like a man who had a first name riordan nodded to the company and mounted a circular stairway van effen said mr riordan doesnt approve of our heathenish practice of having a borreltie at this hour mr riordan doesnt disapprove he doesnt drink himself nor does he smoke but he doesnt disapprove i may as well tell you for you will find out anyway and i dont wish to cause anybody any embarrassment that mr riordan regularly goes upstairs at this hour for prayer and meditation he does this several times a day and one cannot but respect a man with such deeplyheld beliefs he is very devout and is in fact an ordained minister of the church you surprise me van effen said he thought briefly no on second thoughts you dont surprise me it seems very much in character for such a devout character i must say the reverend has certainly let loose a storm of cats in the dovecotes of europe today you must not think ill of riordan nor underestimate him samuelson spoke very seriously he is an evangelist a missionary fired by a burning zeal he is genuinely appalled by what is happening in northern ireland and believes that if blood must be spilled to bring peace to that troubled land then thats how it will be in his own words hes prepared to use the devils tools to fight the devil and you support him in all of this naturally why else should i be here it would have been interesting van effen thought to know just why else he should be there but it seemed hardly the time and place to raise the question he hoisted himself on a bar stool and looked around the two girls were in whispered consultation agnelli and daniken had already occupied the two stools at the further end of the bar vasco who had been wandering round looking at the paintings and brass and copper work on the walls made his unconcerned way over to the bar and sat down beside daniken whom he began to engage in hoarse conversation mr samuelson it was julie i think ill go to my room i have a bit of a headache van effen remained casually still drumming his fingers idly on the bartop a man perfectly at ease with himself he was in fact very far indeed from being at ease with himself the last thing that he wanted was that either of the girls should go to their rooms samuelson who had been stooping down behind the bar came to his unwitting rescue my dear julie if he werent so certain that he knew what samuelson would say next van effen could have hit him not to be thought of here we have a fine tio pepe guaranteed cure for any headache would you deprive me of your company they would obviously have cheerfully done just that but just as obviously deemed it prudent to do as he told prisoners tend to do what their gaolers tell them and came and perched reluctantly by the bar julie close to her brother she glanced at him briefly a glance which told him quite clearly what she thought of violent characters who spoke offhandedly about sticking undesirable characters under the ground then looked away almost at once she looked back again fortunately not too quickly something had just touched her right thigh she looked at him frowning slightly then glanced downwards almost at once she turned away and made some confidential remark to annemarie just as samuelsons head cleared the bar again magnificent van effen thought she was magnificent the best in amsterdam wouldnt be good enough for his sister after this she accepted her sherry from samuelson with a correctly pleasant if somewhat forced smile delicately sipped her drink placed it on the bartop opened her handbag on her lap and brought out cigarettes and lighter she was magnificent van effen thought she lit the cigarette returned the cigarette case but not the lighter to her bag and while still talking quietly to annemarie while watching without seeming to the men at the bar dropped her hand till it touched van effens a moment later the lighter and the folded note the top of which had been protruding between the fore and middle fingers of van effens was safely inside her closed bag he could have hugged and kissed her and made a mental note to do so at the first available opportunity in the meantime he did the next best thing he downed his borreltie in one gulp he had never much cared for it but this one tasted as nectar must have done to the gods samuelson ever the attentive host hurried across to replenish his glass and van effen thanked him courteously the second borreltie went the same way as the first julie locked the bedroom door behind her opened her bag and brought out the note which she began to unfold annemarie looked at her curiously what have you got there and why are your hands shaking julie a billetdoux that i have just got from a lovelorn suitor in the bar wouldnt your hands shake if youd just got a billetdoux from a lovelorn suitor in the bar she smoothed out the note so that they could both read it together it had been meticulously typed so obviously it was not a scribbled note put together at the last moment sony about the appearance and the thick accent it said but you will understand that i cant very well go around in my ordinary clothes and using my ordinary voice the dashing young army captain is vasco you will understand why he has developed this sore throat annemarie might just have been a little startled to hear his normal voice agnelli would have been very startled george is with us couldnt bring him in athirst because george cant be disguised couldnt have you hugging him with feminine shrieks of delight you dont know us and you dont want to know us stay away from us but dont make it too obvious distant remote and extending to us as much courtesy as you would to any other common criminals dont try to do anything clever dont try to do anything the men probably are not dangerous but watch the girls theyre shrewd and have nasty devious feminine minds destroy this note immediately i love you both and signed julie said with his own unmistakable signature her hands still werent too steady you said he would come annemarie said tier voice was like julies hands yes i did didnt i didnt expect him quite so soon though what are we going to do cry with relief certainly not annemarie sniffed he might have spared us the bits about feminine shrieks of delight and shrewd and nasty devious feminine minds she watched as julie ignited the note over a washbasin and flushed the ashes away so what do we do now celebrate in the bar where else and ignore them totally totally nine the barn that served as a garage was cold and draughty and leaking and couldnt have served as a barn for many years the air was heavy with the unsavoury smell of musty hay although there was no trace of hay to be seen but it was clean and well fit enough to show that the army trucks freshly painted bodywork had vanished under a thick encrustation of mud george and obrien were bent over what appeared to be some kind of checklist when van effen entered george looked over obriens shoulder and lifted an interrogative eyebrow van effen gave a brief nod in return then said about through finished george said all present and correct i think think obrien said check recheck and crosscheck never saw a man so meticulous about anything julie and annemarie had taken what seemed like an unconscionably long time before making their departure but i did learn a little about explosives and a lot about drinking beer they switched off the lights padlocked the doors george pointedly pocketing the key while making some remark to the effect that signed receipts came first and entered the mill julie and annemarie were seated at a table by the fire each with a small glass before her a sure indication van effen knew that they had read the note he had left with them he noted approvingly that both girls regarded their entry with an open curiosity it would have been an odd person indeed who would have registered indifference when encountering georges vast bulk for the first time across the fireplace and seated at another table samuelson was just replacing the handset of a rather splendidlooking radio transceiver when obtaining new equipment the fff obviously didnt patronise secondhand markets all well samuelson said all well obrien said just about managed to stop george testing the detonators with his teeth thats quite an arsenal you have there mr samuelson sign here please george laid three copies of the inventory on the table before samuelson who signed them thus confirming that he was indeed the man in charge smiled and handed them back to george who solemnly handed over the garage padlock key a pleasure to do business with you george how would you like fee to be paid not time for the fee yet george said the inventory is only a promise wait for the guarantee lets see if the damn things work samuelson smiled again i thought businessmen always demanded cash on delivery not this businessman if of course you decide not to use them then ill present the bill you understand that i cant very well return them to the ordnance store or if you decide to dispense with our services still a pleasure george im quite certain well be requiring both your goods and your services weli gentlemen well be hearing a rather he broke off looked at van effen patted the radio and said you know what this is dont you a transceiver rca the best i believe if youd a mind to you could reach the moon with thar it can reach amsterdam which is all i want helmut helmut paderiwski whom you have met i believe yes i rather wondered where helmut was our voice in the capital he has just arranged for our latest message to be made known he glanced at the wall clock exactly eight minutes tv and radio weve decided not to bother about newspapers any more i am not being smug when i say that we can now get instant coverage whenever we wish it i think youll all i find it a rather interesting message messages rather dont you think we should give them ah advance notice romero mix danilov here has said that he likes to know whats going on before he reads or hears about it if it is your wish of course agnelli was his usual smiling self but i would rather they saw it on tv i think it would be interesting to see what the reaction of the average dutch citizen would be well wait its unimportant although id hardly call those three average dutch citizens ah our provision party has returned the two girls van effen had met the previous evening in the room off the voorburgwal entered each carrying a shopping basket they were followed by a young man who was having some difficulty in coping with a huge hamper he was carrying welcome back samuelson said benignly a successful expedition i see ah introductions mr danilov of course youve met this is george this is the captain who for some obscure reason is called the lieutenant maria kathleen you look puzzled mr danilov thats a lot of food true true but a lot of mouths to feed its a fair way to utrecht utrecht my dear fellow we shop at the local village store delighted to have our trade ah the factor of anonymity he laughed romero if you would be so kind romero led van effen to the front door opened it and gestured at the foot of the steps stood a dark blue van emblazoned on its side in golden lettering was the legend golden gate film productions ingenious van effen said it is rather not a famous enough name to attract national attention but were certainly well enough known locally been here for almost a month now we have a camera crew almost continuously on the move around the area an isolated spot this and it brings a touch of colour into their otherwise drab lives no trouble at all in recruiting house and kitchen staff we are generous employers and very well thought of locally youd be even better thought of if they knew that this is probably the only area in the netherlands thats immune from flooding meres that theres that agnelli seemed quite pleased with the idea war film i need hardly say hence the helicopter had to get official permission of course but that was a mere formality id wondered how youd managed that you do have your nerve that i must say just had a thought this newly acquired truck change of paint and it can move around in complete freedom war film army truck follows no yes this is your brainchld of course yes but why of coursef you do have a certain talent for devious organization the tv announcer soberly suited and tied and ominously grave in expression looked as if he were about to pronounce a funeral oration we have just received what is called an interim communiquй from london it says that the talks about the dutch crisis are continuing and that a further communiquй can be expected within the hour it was expected that some further statements would be received from this terrorist organization calling itself the fff those have arrived some fifteen minutes ago they are not so much statements as threats of the very gravest nature the first of those states that they the fff expect to hear by midnight that a definite and affirmative answer that is an answer agreeing to the fffs demands will be announced before am tomorrow if they do not hear such confirmation by midnight the oostlijkflevoland dyke will be blown at five minutes past midnight the citizens of lelystad are advised to begin to take precautionary measures now if they fail to do this the fff now disclaim all responsibility for their fate the second statement makes the announcement that the fff have in their possession a number of nuclear explosive devices which they will not hesitate to use if the need arises to achieve their ends the fff hastens to assure the people of the netherlands that those nuclear devices are not of the calibre of hydrogen or atomic weapons they are tactical battlefield devices intended for delivery by plane rocket or shellfire all are of american manufacture some still on the secret list all have been obtained from nato bases in germany they have the serial numbers of those devices they are clearly stamped on each one and the us forces in germany can confirm that those devices are in fact missing if that is they are prepared to give this confirmation there was a pause while the newscaster broke off to accept and glance at a sheet of paper that had just been handed him by a studio colleague judging from the stricken expression on the colleagues face he had already read the message van effen looked around the room no newscaster he felt certain had ever had so rapt an audience the faces of george and the lieutenant were expressionless but that was only because in certain circumstances such as those they hadnt much use for expressions but their eyes were very still julie and annemarie looked shocked kathleen and maria were smiling but their smiles were halfhearted and more than tinged by apprehension no question they had known what was coming but they still didnt like hearing it agnelli obrien and daniken looked thoughtful but not particularly gratified but the normally genial samuelson was revelling in every moment of it true he was still smiling but there was no warmth in his smile there never can be in the smile of a hungry crocodile that has just spotted his unwary lunch we have here the announcer said a further message from the fff they say they are prepared to release those numbers at any time but they feel a practical demonstration to prove their possession of those nuclear devices would be much more convincing accordingly they intend to explode one of those devices in the lisselmeer in the early afternoon of tomorrow the power of the charge will be in the range of one kiloton that is to say the equivalent of one thousand tons of tnt this is expected to cause a certain disturbance of the water but the probable height of the accompanying tidal wave tsunami is the term for it is not precisely known it is hoped that the inhabitants of the coastal settlements of the lisselmeer will not be too inconvenienced inconvenienced the newscaster almost spluttered the word which was obviously not in the script or the repetition of it he recovered himself the demonstration has been delayed until the afternoon in order to allow british cabinet ministers plenty of time to fly across and join their dutch colleagues in watching this demonstration the precise time and place will be announced later the device they add is already in position finally they demand some money this money they say will be returned it is not blackmail money or ransom money merely a temporary loan to cover operating expenses details of the methods of payment will be announced later this evening this is to give the parties concerned time to arrange for the transfer the demand is for one hundred million guilders from the government twenty million from mr david joseph karl mann meijer the rotterdam industrialist the newscaster laid down his paper viewers will not need reminding that mr meijers daughter anne is being held hostage by the terrorists samuelson touched a switch before him and the screen went blank i wish samuelson said in a complaining voice that he wouldnt call us terrorists philanthropists is the word i rather liked that touch about operating expenses anne my dear do sit down youre overexcited annemarie who was clearly and very understandably overexcited was on her feet face pale lips compressed her hands unclenching and clenching into ivoryknuckled fists you monster she whispered you utterly evil monster you think so my dearhe looked round the room smiling van effen was one of those who smiled back at him there were witnesses not at all philanthropist equitable redistribution of excess wealth besides its not even that as you heard merely a temporary loan dont tell me that the wealthiest man in the netherlands cant afford that money i know all about your father you murderer she said softly her hands were hanging straight by her sides now and they were still you murderer the tears were rolling down her cheeks and now julie was on her feet her arm around the girls shoulders you know all about my father you know then that he has had two major heart attacks this year you know that he came out of hospital only four days ago after his last heart attack youve killed him her voice like her shoulders was shaking youve killed him samuelson had stopped smiling he frowned and said i did not know this before god i didnt without apparently even pausing to think ha reached out for the handset of his rca and pressed a button he must have received art acknowledgement almost immediately for he started talking into the mouthpiece rapidly and urgently nearly issuing instructions in a language that no one there knew but which george from a few odd words recognized as being yiddish he replaced the handset rose walked around behind the bar poured himself a brandy not a small one and drank the contents in two or three gulps this performance was watched with some astonishment but no comment was made van effen rose in turn walked round to the bar in turn and poured brandy two large brandies he carried these round to anne and julie waited until they had both sipped from them and resumed his seat fine lot you are when it comes to ladies in distress he looked at agnelli that was a nice line in threats you think they were meaningless threats mr danilov agnelli didnt seem at all reluctant to speak like others in the room he probably found it embarrassing not to look at samuelson who was on his second brandy and paying attention to nobody i assure you they wet all genuinely intended and will be carried out so much for your word agnelli i dont understand youd have to have a damned short memory riot to only a few hours ago you promised us that no harm would come to any dutch people you warn all the lelystad people to take the necessary precautions against the breaching of the dykes good god man its pitch black outside and coming down in torrents they wont be able to see to take precautions they dont have to see flood level wont be more than half a metre weve checked and checked the area plenty of second floor rooms and attics although they could remain on the ground floor if they didnt mind getting their feet wet and plenty of boats weve checked that also the message was primarily for intimidation surely you can see that thats as maybe wheres old elastic conscience elastic what elastic who riordan the praying priest the godfearing reverend why wasnt he here watching agnelli smiled faintly he regards tv as the work of satan could be right for all i know as you saw hes practically married to his earphones there was a simultaneous radio broadcast you do really have those nuclear devices i find it frankly incredible i can show them to you well that answers that so this man of peace and goodwill is prepared to play around with lethal explosives you heard what mr samuelson said to you a short time ago agnelli looked quickly at the bar samuelson still looking at nothing and nobody but with something peculiarly tense in his stance appeared to be on yet another brandy mr riordans prepared to use the devils tools to fight the devil too late in the day to talk about pious hypocritical platitudes i suppose how did you get them those nuclear devices you heard nato west germany specifically us bases i heard that i didnt ask where i asked how van effen looked away for a moment then back at agnelli i know the raf the red army faction yes i would have told you but since youve guessed it or know yes jesus the holy father upstairs must really have the original twisted doubledyed infinitestretch elastic conscience the raf and only last night according to the papers correct me if im wrong he was telling wieringa the defence minister that the raf were the inheritors of the bloody mantle of the baadermeinhof gangsters of the early seventies the fact that his own hands are stained a bright red doesnt appear to worry the reverend at all god i should have thought of this right away its only a couple of weeks since there was this successful breakin at a us army ammunition depot outside hanover the raf claimed responsibility and their claim was generally accepted the raf is rather good at this and the americans rather poor at guarding their installations no mention of nuclear devices it would have been in character for the raf to have made specific mention of this one supposes that they did but that the us army or the army through the government put a stop order on this antinuclear sentiment is high enough already in germany without the added knowledge that theres a bunch of woollyheaded harebrained young terrorists on the loose with nuclear weapons in their suitcases no prizes for your guesses mr danilov had to be that way and it was your information of course comes from the same source as the nuclear devices where else joachim and joop and the two other babyfaced choirboys who were here when we arrived this afternoon who else the leisuretime terrorists as the west germans call them nights and weekends only since the egregious christian klar was captured along with two lady friends mohnhaupt and schultz i think they were called and charged with the murders of diverse politicians prosecutors bankers and industrialists the raf have pulled in their horns and are reported to have moved into neighbouring countries i suppose holland was the natural the inevitable first choice should be like a second home to them van effen thought briefly then smiled on the one hand the raf on the other your blackmailing demands on the dutch government dont you find it rather a splendid thought mr agnelli that the dutch government are going to pay the raf for nuclear devices to be used against the dutch people agnelli didnt have the opportunity to say whether he did or not for the callup buzzer on the rca rang at that moment he lifted the handset spoke an acknowledgement then said mr samuelson for you samuelson came and took the handset listened said thank you helmut thank you very muchhung up and looked at his watch four minutes im going to my room romero but will be down for dinner so will mr riordan therell be a news flash on tv in four minutes please dont miss it on his way to the stairs he stopped by annemaries table i am sorry miss meijer no my dear no anne i did not know when the news flash came interrupting some appropriately lugubrious offering from handel by the concertgebouw it was very much what van effen expected the now notorious terrorist group the fff the newscaster read have announced that for reasons they do not wish to discuss the demand for twenty million guilders from mr david meijer has been withdrawn effective as from now miss anne meijer will be released and returned to her father as soon as is conveniently possible the sum now asked from the government has been correspondingly increased to a hundred and twenty million guilders apart from a slow shake of the head which could have meant anything but probably indicated a total lack of understanding annemarie did not react at all julie smiled in delight and hugged her george clapped a hand on van effens knee and said well now my friend what do you think of that splendid van effen said quite splendid bit unfair on policemens sisters though they should have let her go as well i must admit van effen said that it does make it a bit more difficult to kill him should that unfortunate need arise if of course our friend samuelson was moved solely by humanitarian principles one must not misjudge the man perhaps he recalled the days when he used to say his prayers at his mothers knees and his heart was touched equally well he may be an even more calculating villain than weve given him credit for i cant see how you can possibly say that vasco said they were pacing to and fro on the front porch it was bitterly cold now and the wind of gale force dimensions they had a certain degree of privacy out there it had been impossible to conduct a private conversation inside but only a certain degree there was a loft over the garage approached as was the custom in that area by an external stairway earlier on they had seen one man go up those stairs and another come down almost certainly a change of watchman who would have taken position behind the loft window there were probably others similarly stationed in the other barn and in the windmill itself whether the purpose was to keep insiders from going out or outsiders from coming in it was impossible to say all that could be said was that it was done with great discretion civilian staff were employed in the windmill and even the hint of the maintenance of a guard almost certainly an armed guard would have done much to destroy the credibility of the golden gate film productions i not only say that he may be an exceedingly cunning villain van effen said i believe it sure it was moving touching heartrending even a fundamentally decent man overwhelmed by his own decency you noticed the terms of the communiquй miss anne meijer will be released as soon as conveniently possible for conveniently possible read inconveniently im possible people will know that the poor man is trying desperately to return annemarie to the bosom of her family but finds it impossible to do without jeopardizing his own plans and safety but he has made the offer mr david meijer who has not i assume accumulated his millions or billions or whatever without having some faint glimmer of intelligence somewhere will know exactly what the score is and that his daughter is as much a pawn as ever and that he can still be counted on to do the right thing as far as samuelson is concerned about bringing his influence to bear on whatever the governments decision may be the government whose decision matters of course is the british one he cant influence that but he can influence the dutch government to influence the british one which is just about as useful from samuelsons viewpoint and think what would have happened had david meijer died while his daughter was still in the fffs custody unlikely but thats not the point people range from the softheaded to the incurably romantic the diedofabroken heart syndrome has always had a powerful following sure people do die of a broken heart but its over the months and the years and not overnight no matter if he had died the public reaction to samuelson and the fff would have been one of total revulsion and rejection attitudes would harden resistance stiffen and the average man in the street would say the hell with this cold ruthless murderous monster never give in to him never let him do his worst and see if we care that i should imagine is the last thing that samuelson and company want going back to that communiquй notice the noble dignified and selfless fashion in which he refused to give the reasons for his decisions i didnt know that david meijer had a heart condition but for all i know it may be common knowledge if its not ill take long odds that it soon will be helmut paderiwski whom samuelson calls our voice in amsterdam will make good and sure of at and that his voice will be heard radio and newspapers will be anonymously and discreetly told that david meijer has a severe heart condition the truth of that can soon be established and hints dropped that his gallant hostage daughter had been pleading for his life for the newspapers its a natural a humanangle story to tug at the very heart strings suitably dressed up in the usual sickening journalese this will be manna to samuelson a big plus an image that puts him in line for tabloid canonization no matter what hes done or is threatening to do popular sympathy is going to swing behind him and make it all the easier for his demands to be granted the whole world loves a reformed rogue a bandit with a heart of gold a toast to the robin hood of amsterdam this i do believe george said among the other accomplishments that you dont know i have is a smattering of yiddish not much not even a working knowledge but a smattering i wondered what senseless instructions he was trying to give in yiddish to this fellow paderiwski in amsterdam i dont wonder any more it makes sense lastly of course theres the dutch reverence for the guilder what praise people will say can be too high for a man who spurns twenty million guilders the fact that he doesnt have it and probably wouldnt have got it anyway is quite irrelevant at the sight of a teardrop in the comer of the eye of a lovely maiden the twenty million admittedly is added to the governments bill but who ever cared about robbing a government you still think vasco that samuelson was motivated only by humanitarian considerations when you put it that way i have to admit that i dont he has to be what you say a crafty conniving villain well its all very well you having convinced me its an unfortunate fact that fourteen million other dutchmen didnt hear you im convinced that theyre going to stay convinced to the contrary not all of them give some of them time and theyll work it out the great majority wont and thats what the frightening thing is about samuelson it took me quite a time to figure out the angles here and im in the heart of this whole messy business samuelsons got a computer mind he did it all on his feet within seconds and it would seem automatically although of course it wasnt automatic at all mans brilliant and hes highly dangerous it would behove us to have a very long spoon when were supping with samuelson back to the devil again is that itgeorge said hes the key nothing else fits the lock hes the one who says that riordan is prepared to use the devils tools to fight the devil i wonder if riordan uses a long spoon to sup with samuelson it must cost thousands of dollars a day to run this operation maybe tens of thousands agnelli hasnt got that kind of money and i doubt whether riordan ever earned a penny in his life samuelson beyond doubt the paymaster pity were in no position to check with interpol wouldnt do usany good even if we were if hes as clever as i think he is interpol will never have heard of him interpol simply has no idea as to who the worlds outstanding criminals are thats why theyre outstanding may not even have a criminal past at all i say criminal past as distinct from criminal record hell have no record and perhaps as i say no past he may even be what uncle arthur suggested he was a bloated plutocrat a man who has made his immense fortune in oil or shipping or something of the kind then we would have heard of him we may or may not have heard of him under another name of course may not even be a photograph of him in existence some of the worlds wealthiest men are never photographed george said if hes as wealthy as we think he may be why is he trying to extract more from other sources show im convinced that samuelson neither wants nor needs money but for all i know he may have persuaded his partners that his funds are drying up and hes now making a show about money to divert attention from the fact that money is of no value to him and that his interests lie elsewhere agnelli makes no secret of the fact that hes very interested in money and this may be samuelsons way of keeping him happy he has a large staff to keep happy and theyll be keenly interested in seeing samuelson displaying a keen interest in money he seems to need us for what precise purpose we dont yet know we may well be here on only a contingency basis but we need money too and riordan above all has to be kept happy for riordan above all needs unholy money to achieve his holy purposes unholy money for unholy purposes george said split mind dichotomy there must be something in this irish american connection we know there are men who are willing to trade heroin for bags of gold to help a socalled worthy cause purblindness that the word something like that in medical terms tunnels as opposed to peripheral vision we have to accept that its an illness and try to treat it as best we can how do we go about treating this ailment the good doctor has something on his mind despite his vast bulk george shivered in the bitter wind a prescription a nostrum too late for medicine surgery i wouldnt even know which end of a scalpel to hold you dont have to in the best medical parlance surgery at this moment is contraindicated george cleared his throat delicately which is no easy thing to do in a galeforce wind you have suddenly developed a newfound regard for the wellbeing of murderous villains criminals who are prepared to drown god knows how many thousands of our fellow countrymen no such seachange george i know they have their quota of hard men and psychopathic nutcases around here but do you seriously doubt for a moment that we could kill riordan samuelson and agnelli and get the girls away unharmed i know we could i take back my ludicrous suggestion about your tender heart tungsten steel more like vascos expression didnt exactly register shock but it did hold a certain amount of apprehension and disbelief youre a policeman sir sworn to uphold the law i mean give them a fair trial and hang them in the morning im my own court of law and id shoot them down like wild dogs if i thought it would solve anything but it wouldnt two reasons one psychological one practical the psychological curiosity nosiness if you like i am not convinced that those three are ordinary criminals i am not convinced that romero agnelli is the murderous ruthless killer we think he is he bears no resemblance to his two brothers i put behind bars who were grade a vicious sadists the fact that he hasnt laid a finger on either julie or annemarie helps bear that out or riordan hes no psychopath loony as a nut or nutty as a loon and a demagogue of some note but only an occasional demagogue but being loony doesnt necessarily mean that youre certifiable there are quite a number of people tidied up institutionalized as they say in lunatic asylums who are convinced that they are the only sane people around and that there exist great numbers of people those responsible for wars hunger diseases genocide heroin pushers and those who talk glibly of nuclear annihilation not to mention a few other trivial matters who should be where they are and whos to say theyre not right and then theres the factor of demagoguery dema what vasco said people who are supposed to go in for ranting and raving a word that has fallen into disuse a word associated with the likes of hitler mussolini and a few dozen nationalistic leaders in the world today there are good demagogues and bad ones originally it meant people who were opposed to established rules of law usually bad rules christ if you eke could have been called a demagogue riordan i admit is no member of the holy trinity but i believe him to be a sincere and honest demagogue however misguided i do not believe him to be evil samuelson is the nigger in the woodpile if one can use such racist language in these days hes the real enigma you know that hes english both men shook their heads he is a wealthy man obviously a very wealthy man sure rich men are normally under a compulsion to become even richer but theres a limit even to that and i believe samuelson has reached that limit as sane and stable a man as you could ever hope to meet beneath that bonhomie and geniality i think hes an obsessed man a driven man i would like to know what drives him what do you think of kathleen both men stared at him then george said wait a minute he disappeared inside the mill and reappeared shortly afterwards with three very large glasses of brandy in his hands if we are to continue this discussion in verkhoyansk temperatures what do you mean kathleen what i said how does she strike you we hardly know her george said a lovely child of course there you go again you and your middleaged propensities vasco i agree with george ive never seen he broke off she seems kind and gentle and an accomplished actress a casehardened spy vasco said nothing the feminine equivalent of the smiler with the knife under the cloak novasco was vehement no indeed when she was watching that tv announcement tonight you werent you were watching her not that i blame you shes as watchable as anyone in the netherlands but thats not why you were watching her apropos of nothing vasco i think youd make an excellent inspector under of course the watchful eye of george whom i hope to persuade to leave his illchosen role of restaurateur me george stared at him as if either or both of them had taken leave of their senses you youre wasted keep la caracha of course annelise is the best cook in amsterdam and you could always hire a couple of thugs preferably exconvicts to take over your distasteful duties as bouncer but thats by the by what did her eyes tell you vasco her eyes vasco was momentarily confused kathleens you were watching her eyes not her face how did you know a combination of craftiness cunning deviousness and experience practice is all fear distress something like that distinctly unhappy edgy odd thing was she was looking like that before the announcement was made she knew what was coming or thought or was convinced she knew what was coming and didnt like it one little bit another driven person van effen said if were talking about drivers and driven people george said you could also include maria agnelli a great liplicker is our maria weve all met people who lick their lips when theyre in a state of sadistic anticipation but when youre in a state your lips dont tremble hers did nervous apprehension revulsion if you like i missed that van effen said well weve each of us got only one pair of eyesgeorge said reasonably but you only had to have half an eye to see that samuelson enjoyed every moment of the broadcast so what do we have three driven people one of those driven people samuelson is also the driver going hellbent one could say round a series of hairpin bends down a pretty precipitous mountain slope the other two are driven terrified of going over a precipice at the next hairpin vasco said in a complaining voice youre going too fast for me you make those two girls sound relatively harmless maybe even nice joachim joop and those two other babyfaces in the mill here baadermeinhof raf or whatever you call them they are dot nice they wouldnt agree van effen said they arc the new messiahs dedicated to the creation of a nobler and better world its merey because of the blind folly of this misguided world that assassination and the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons have become their stockintrade and those two girls are their associates and allies vasco said he sounded very bitter indeed or do you dip your band into this witches brew of murder mayhem blackmail terrorism and theft and bring them out pure as the driven snow a little dusting of soot perhaps camouflage a little coercion here a little blackmail there misguided love misguided loyalty a warped code of honour a false sentimentality a judicious mixture of truth and lies conned i believe is the word youre after george said but they werent conning anyone when they kidnapped julie of course they were sure they hoped to discourage me but that was only the ostensible reason romero agnelli would never have thought that up on his own and as for hurting my sister ive already given it as my opinion that he would be reluctant to tread on a beetle the orders came from his brothers giuseppe and orlando that delightful duo i put away all those years ago but theyre in prison van effen sighed vasco vasco some of the most powerful and vicious gangs in the world are controlled by bosses temporarily confined to maximumsecurity blocks in prisons palermo cagliari ajaccio marseilles half a dozen cities in the united states even london and amsterdam and naples theres where the criminal overlords overlords still with powers of life or death hang out in their prison cells its romeros brothers who have the orders for the sending of those menacing postcards to me who ordered julies kidnapping but theyre not after julie i dont believe theyre even after me convicted criminals oddly enough dont usually harbour grudges against the cops who caught them their resentment is reserved for the judges who sentenced them italy is a classic example of this if theyre not after you or julie george said slowly then my towering intellect tells me theyre after something else and to think that samuelson had the staggering effrontery to say that riordan was prepared to use the devils tools to fight the devil and i said that one would require a very long spoon to sup with the devil speaking about the devil vasco said and with all due respect of course what the devil are you two talking about the devil george said or devils part of the flooding or nonflooding of the country and it may even be a precondition will be that romeros murderous brothers be released from prison or heaven help us be given a free pardon there was a brief hiatus while george returned inside the mill to get some more antipneumonia specific when he returned van effen said well so much for theory i dlink weve got everything right except samuelsons ultimate motivation were not even wrong about that we just dont know now practicalities that shouldnt take too long our options are limited and besides its too damned cold we have agreed that now is not the time to dispose of the three boss villains here there are other and nontheoretical reasons samuelson may not be the cinc although im convinced he is there may be others he has to have someone in the vicinity of the lisselmeer to trigger off that damned nuclear device of theirs they also told us unwisely that this is only a stopover hq the other will be their main one and almost certainly the one from which they intend to make their final strike we have to find it so for the moment we have to go along with them im more than prepared for the fact that theyll breach the dykes north and south of lelystad and flood the east and south flevoland areas shortly after midnight because im equally certain that the british are going to temporize and not throw in the towel before the first bell rings with any luck there should be no loss of life human life that is i wouldnt care to guess what is going to happen to the livestock this nuclear device to be detonated in the ijsselmeer tomorrow afternoon presents a more serious threat my guess is that it would be in the markerwaard and i wouldnt much care to be in the vicinity of marken or volendam when it went off nasty things tidal waves especially when the height is unpredictable things might even be unpleasant in hoorn or amsterdam itself although i doubt it after all this is meant primarily as a demonstration for the british cabinet or whatever the big bang will come later considering the steadily worsening conditions that should be at the next high tide afterwards or the one after that in daylight anyway vasco said why daylight you think they have this helicopter just to make a nonexistent film they want it to take them some place a landbased vehicle cant reach an island perhaps though that seems unlikely the point is that its very difficult to land a helicopter in gale force winds although highlytrained airsea rescue pilots do it regularly but to try it in a gale in total darkness and driving rain in zero visibility that is is foolhardy to the point of suicide especially if you happen to have as part of your cargo some potentially unstable nuclear devices so daylight we might be here for a couple of days yet george said my guess is that well be off first light in the morning theyll want to establish themselves in their hq near the scene of action those groundtoground and groundtoair missiles they have been deactivated george nodded how are you when it comes to deactivating tactical nuclear devices ive never even seen a tactical nuclear device if i could examine one or see a blueprint well yes perhaps otherwise no i know i wouldnt feel a thing but i still dont much fancy being vaporized well well have a look at them later on tonight theyre somewhere on the premises we dont even have to look you heard what agnelli said i can show them to you now wont that make them suspicious george said that we didnt ask to see them right away theyll be thinking we have been having a conference and have dreamed up some devilish scheme let them think what they like and be as suspicious as they like were as safe as men in a church we my friends are indispensable george and vasco looked at each other then at van effen but said nothing were also not very bright joop joachim or some of their psychopathic red army faction pals stole those nuclear devices from the us nato arms dump near metnitz on the night of february rd something else happened on that same night february rd george said of course we really are not very bright that was the night the de dooms ammunition dump was blown out of existence samuelsons explosive experts trying to replenish their supplies an enormous crater no replenishments and of course no experts no wonder the fff were so desperate for our supplies and services were probably the only people around who could set off a squib lloyds of london would approve of this vasco said a marvellous insurance policy to be sure but has the thought occurred to you that joop or one of his lunatic associates may know how to trigger those nuclear devices the thought has occurred van effen said so well just have to attend to the lunatics or the devices wont we or both but before we start attending to anything i suggest we go inside have a wash and brush up find out how thoroughly they have examined our luggage listen to the next riveting communication from the dutch or british governments or the fff then join our genial hosts for dinner one would imagine that a of samuelsons resources could run to a cordon bleu chef romero agnelli greeted them genially on their entrance and at once pressed jonge jenevers on them you must be needing this after your long stay outside i mean its pretty cold tonight not for us van effen said were freshair fanatics thought that applied only to the english anyway i trust you enjoyed your stroll if you call pacing up and down your veranda a stroll then yes we did van effen knew that agnelli was perfectly well aware that they had not once left the veranda and of course the opportunity for a private conversation agnelli was still smiling well yes pondering our probable future about which we know precious little after all you and your friends are hardly very communicative we dont know what were here for what services we are expected to perform where were going even when were going that last i can tell you eight oclock tomorrow morning as for the rest well you and i are great believers in the needtoknow principle true true but theres one thing that we do need to know where do we sleep tonight on the floor dear me no mind you this is no amstel but we do have accommodation of sorts come ill show you ive already had your baggage brought up he led the way up the curving staircase and along to a door at the end of a passageway the room beyond was of moderate size with three single beds agnelli indicated a door at the far end of the room bathroom no marble bath no gold taps but serviceable enough he looked at his watch dinner in twenty minutes he left still smiling van effen and george sat on their beds engaged in desultory conversation while vasco looked around in this particular kind of lookingaround vasco was a specialist very meticulous very thorough after a few minutes he said clear no bugs george hoisted his mediumsized suitcase on to his knees it was one of those fancy cases with combination locks four figures by each of the two keyholes eight in all george peered at it closely combinations as set van effen said as set but not untouched very tiny scratches this case is brand new never been used before normally i wouldnt be seen dead with this juniorexecutive status symbol but annelise gave it to me for my birthday and it would have been more than my lifes worth to have left home without it its been opened and closed and in very short order too i dont know of a safebreaker in the netherlands who could have done this anyone who knows his job can open a conventional safe pair of good ears or a doctors stethoscope can hear the tumblers click no tumblers in this type of lock van effen said ill bet obrien could open the vaults of the amsterdamrotterdam bank with a bent hairpin i wouldnt doubt it george adjusted the combination figures and opened the case a very neat character everything exactly where it was except of course where its naturally settled in the process of being carried yours vasco vasco unlocked his case untouched spare smith wesson magazines still there naturally van effen opened his own case it hadnt even been locked lifted out a rather battered toilet bag and took from it a burgundycoloured aerosol can with a chrome top the side of the can bore the legend yves saint laurent pour homme mousse raser the aerosol in fact contained no shaving foam well george said nobodys been touching or sniffing the contents of that lot obviously van effen replaced the aerosol if they had theyd still be here horizontal on the carpet i doubt if they even opened my toilet bag if there was anything worth finding they must have reckoned it would have been in georges thiefproof case he took a small tablet of soap from his toilet bag and handed it to vasco you know what to do with this hygiene is all vasco went into the bathroom while van effen and george crossed to the window opposite the beds and opened it as far as they could judge in the darkness they were about fifteen feet above the cobbled courtyard below a courtyard shrouded in almost total darkness very satisfactory george dont you think very only snag is that youll have to make a pretty long detour to keep in the darkness in order to reach the back of the barn and have you thought of antipersonnel landmines you know the nasty kind that jump three feet in the air before exploding george this place is run and staffed entirely by local villagers if say a laundrymaid was just kind of accidentally blown in half true point taken but if you were to run into a patrolling member of the fff anybody out on patrol on a night like this has to be a head case gale driving rain bitter cold thunder and lightning due any time but im not going to run into anyone someone might run into me velvet gloves vascos taking his time isnt he they moved to the bathroom door tried to open it and found it locked van effen rattled the door handle put out your light vasco said they did as he asked vasco opened the door of the bathroom which was in total darkness sorry about that gentlemen but i didnt want the watcher in the shadows to know that he was been watched by another watcher in the shadows not mind you that our fellow watcher is very much in the shadows the bathroom window was in fact directly opposite the door in the loft of the barn that held the army truck on the ground floor the man standing in the doorway was making no great effort to conceal his presence and the courtyard light projecting from the mill veranda was quite strong doesnt seem to me to be guarding against anything very much van effen said unenthusiastic dont blame him must seem like a pretty useless exercise on a night like this and a pretty freezing exercise too george said he generates his own heat vasco said wait they didnt have to wait long after less than two minutes the guard reached behind him lifted a bottle to his lips and took what appeared to be a very considerable swig from it no mineral water thats for sure van effen said lets get inside they closed the bathroom door behind them and switched on the bedroom light vasco handed van effen a small metallic object sheathed in polythene van effen dropped it in his pocket ive stuck the two pieces of soap together and left them in hot water vasco said should be mushed together again pretty soon i have an idea just after i got into the bathroom i saw a man crossing the courtyard towards the barn thats when i switched off the light he disappeared round the back of the barn you know where the outside stairs are and then joined the man who was then standing at the loft door changing of the guard so to speak that was exactly at seven oclock it occurred to me that it might be very convenient if the condition of my throat has deteriorated so badly that i will be unable to join you for dinner it might be very convenient if we found out how regularly they changed guards it wouldindeed van effen said an excellent suggestion vasco should have thought of it myself promotion guaranteed if that is we survive this lot im sure samuelson will be most distressed probably insist on sending you another toddy make sure its a large one if you please im feeling very weak mr danilov george as van effen and george descended the stairs into the livingroom samuelson advanced to greet them beaming as if they were longlost friends just in time for the next tv broadcast then dinner but wheres our dashing young lieutenant our young lieutenant isnt feeling at all dashing throats worse flu i think samuelson clucked his tongue and shook his head damn flus everywhere these days this awful weather most important that hes reasonably fit tomorrow herta this to a flaxen haired young girl who was setting the table for the evening meal a toddy a strong one take it up to the lieutenants room dear me dear me ah agnelli had just turned up the volume of the tv set and a rock band which had been playing mercifully in apparent mime faded from the screen to be replaced by the accustomed announcer looking if possible even more lugubrious and funereal than he had on the previous occasion with reference to the threats being made against our country by the unidentified group calling themselves the fff the ministry of defence has just issued a statement the british government and ours are in constant contact but no announcement as to the results of those negotiations can yet be made pending the outcome of discussions between whitehall and stormont stormont is the parliament or governing body of northern ireland which is of course next to ourselves the country most closely concerned with the outcome of those negotiations whitehall it must be said finds itself in a most difficult and peculiar position ulster northern ireland that is although an integral part of great britain retains a certain degree of autonomy as far as decisions relating to its own future is concerned when further news comes to hand the country will be immediately informed the fff have informed us that they will issue a further communiquй after this broadcast this will be transmitted to you at pm in the circumstances the latest report from the meteorological office is relevant the wind due north is force nine and strengthening torrential rain is sweeping over most of scandinavia and is heaviest of all over the netherlands the north sea is expected to reach its highest level for at least the past quarter century inside the next fortyeight hours the announcers image faded and agnelli switched off the set dear me dear me samuelson said things do look very unpromising or very promising all depends upon ones point of view he gestured towards the bar romero see to it that our friends are not neglected excuse me ladies and gentlemen shall be back shortly he disappeared up the stairs while the agnelli brothers busied themselves behind the bar van effen wandered aimlessly around the room apparently admiring the paintings and the bronze and copper artefacts that decorated the walls van effen paid particular but very brief attention to the telephone the telephone number had been carefully and thoroughly inked out which neither surprised nor disturbed him he was reasonably certain that he could later that night have given that number to the police hq in the marnixstraat in amsterdam which would have enabled them to pinpoint the exact whereabouts of the windmill but that would not have suited his purpose the answer to the machinations of the fff lay elsewhere samuelson presumably and for reasons best known to himself had gone upstairs to use another telephone to deliver the text of the next fff communiquй dinner that night was a rather odd affair not that there was anything odd about the food obviously there wasnt a cordon bleu chef within miles the dutch taken by and large are not gourmets your standard dutch cook or housewife consider it a matter of personal pride and honour and an insult to their guests if they can see any part of the plate under the mound of food that covers it the food was palatable enough but michelin would not have come there a second time what was odd was the contrasting behaviour of the diners samuelson romero agnelli van effen and george were in an expansive genial and talkative mood daniken made an occasional contribution but was clearly no conversationalist the rev riordan apart from delivering a lengthy and in the circumstances extremely hypocritical blessing before the meal remained grave and thoughtful and totally silent throughout the meal riordan van effen reflected if not quite deranged or demented was totally detached from reality and possessed of an incredible naivety leonardo was equally silent he too was thinking but only of his stomach for a man of his diminutive stature he was an awesome trencherman they spoke only when spoken to smiled but seldom and for the most part were remote and withdrawn to the point of being dispirited at one point van effen said to romero agnelli and wheres our friend obrien tonight hes not down with the flu i trust obriens as fit as a fiddle hes elsewhere van effen said ah samuelson smiled you really are a singularly incurious person mr danilov would it help any if i knew where he was or what he was doing no romero has spoken to me several times about your needtoknow philosophy it is one with which i am in entire agreement he glanced at his watch romero it lacks one minute to eight oclock it was the same newscaster he looked as if he had just heard that his entire family had been wiped out in an air crash we have here the latest communiquй from the fff he didnt sound at all like a news reader he intoned the words like a minister delivering a funeral oration it is very brief and reads as follows we place no credence in the ministry of defences statement we think the dutch and british governments are either stalling or dont believe in our threats or both we do not intend to stall we do intend to make them believe our threats the dykes north and south of lelystad will be breached a few minutes after midnight the nuclear device in the lisselmeer will be detonated at pm tomorrow we beg you to believe that these two incidents will be regarded as the merest trifles compared to the disaster that will engulf the netherlands within twentyfour hours of the detonation of the nuclear device that is the end of their communiquй we have also had a further statement from the ministry of defence they say that they have no comment to make on this latest communiquй on the basis that there is no way that they can predict the irrational workings of the minds of terrorists samuelson clicked his tongue and shook his head sadly they say they are prepared to believe that the terrorists are insane enough to carry out their insane threats more cluckings and shakings from samuelson and can do no more than warn all local authorities to carry out all possible means of protection netherlands experts and british nuclear scientists have agreed on the probable results of such a nuclear explosion it is assumed that this will take place in the markerwaard if this device is located in or near the centre of the markerwaard the tsunami the tidal wave reaching the shores should be of minor proportions averaging between sixty and seventy centimetres should it be placed close inshore the wave could be several times as high and the local results could be disastrous the nation will be immediately informed of any further developments agnelli switched off the set samuelson halfsmiling looked at van effen and said do i detect just a trace of a half frown mr danilov van effen made no reply romero has told me that you are prepared to react in an extremely violent form to any threat to the lives of your fellow citizens or rather to the citizens of your adopted country romero is of the opinion that you and your two friends are highly dangerous men i concur you are i believe heavily armed van effen opened his jacket to demonstrate that he wasnt carrying his shoulderholstered smith and wesson then turned to agnelli who was sitting next to him crossed his knees and pulled up his right trouser leg to show that he wasnt carrying his lilliput either i do not consider guns as being an essential part of dressing for dinner do you think i would be so mad as to start a gunfight in the company of four beautiful young ladies any ladies come to that no my mistake the nuclear device is in the markerwaard but is located precisely in its centre do you believe me if i had your unpleasantly suspicious mind i would say that id wait until five past two tomorrow afternoon to find out as it happens i believe you now mr samuelson you know that i do not normally probe into anyones affairs but i must confess to being just a little concerned about those nuclear devices my two friends and i are acknowledged explosives experts but we know nothing about nuclear devices we wouldnt recognize one if we saw it far less know how to arm it activate it or deactivate it but we do know they are nasty jiggly and unpredictable things i do know you have some on the premises although i dont know how many what i do know is that i have a healthy regard for my own skin i assume youre transporting them elsewhere they can be of no use to you here i have no wish to be aboard whatever form of transportation is taking those devices from here to wherever elsewhere may be samuelson smiled mr daniken here shares your sentiments exactly what has mr daniken got to do with it air daniken is our helicopter pilot he doesnt want to carry those things i didnt refuse to mr samuelsondaniken said i said i was fi highly reluctant because of the great risk involved i agree with mr danilov i dont know how unstable or temperamental those damn things are flying conditions are atrocious just on the limit with an updraught or wind shear we can go up or down a hundred feet in two seconds we could make a heavy landing a crash landing or heaven help us just crash you and mr danilov can relax should have mentioned it before but we made our minds up just before dinner no helicopter we have decided to use the army truck with which mr danilov and his friends have so thoughtfully provided us those devices are quite small and can easily be concealed in what looks like a couple of extra longrange petrol tanks well have three men dressed in uniforms ylvisaker as a fullscale lieutenantcolonel and the rest where did you get the uniforms van effen said i told you samuelson said patiently were making a war film the rest of us go by helicopter must be some helicopter a war film i said a gunship the end of the vietnam war caught the us air force on the hop and they had overproduced going for a song elderly but fully serviceable stripped of armament of course but we ordered dummies i suggest we move to more comfortable chairs for our brandies liqueurs or whatever van effen said if i may be excused id like to have a look at the lieutenant give him my sympathies samuelson said i suggest he might appreciate another toddy thank you im sure he would if hes not asleep that is vasco was not asleep he was comfortably seated in a small armchair that he had brought into the bathroom using the pencil beam of the variably hooded torch which was an indispensable item of his travelling equipment van effen handed vasco the glass compliments of mr samuelson very civil of him well its eighttwenty now and the same character is still on watch judging from his performance with that bottle he must be half sloshed by this time like me as you can see hes found an armchair im surprised he hasnt dropped off by this time anyway ill keep watch until they change guard the toddy will help sustain me through the long watches of the night van effen gave him a brief resume of the ministry of defences statement and the fffs reply promised that he and george would be back by nine oclock and left he returned to the livingroom to find that the group seated in armchairs had been considerably depleted the lieutenant seems to have benefited from that first toddy he doesnt sound quite so hoarse very drowsy but not too drowsy to attack the second toddy his thanks and dear me dear me the lovely young ladies have departed shame but im not surprised they were hardly what you might call gay and vivacious at the table tonight they said they were tired samuelson said julie van effen knew had not been tired she was a notoriously poor air traveller and the thought of travelling in a helicopter shed never been in one in her life must have been a nightmare whatever have they done to make them tired nothing theyre just nervous and apprehensive just like george and myself samuelson surveyed him dispassionately i doubt whether you and your big friend have ever been nervous and apprehensive in your lives theres always a first time and wheres the holy father you know the reverend doesnt drink but its not that every night before he goes to sleep he spends an hour in meditation and prayer van effen said sombrely lets hope he includes in his prayers the souls of the victims of his nuclear toys the silence that followed of which van effen seemed to be quite unaware was to say the least embarrassing it was romero in a clear attempt to break the silence who said hastily speaking of those nuclear toys as you call them i told you earlier i could show them to you as an explosives expert i thought you might be interested not l van effen waved an indifferent hand same old principles needtoknow and would it help any if i saw them he was aware of georges momentary slight frown but knew that no one else had seen it van effen paused as if something had just occurred to him then said someone has to be able to trigger off those nuclear devices dont tell me its joop and his psychopathic pals it is indeed as you say in your disparaging fashion joop and his psychopathic friends the words held a rebuke but the tone didnt it required no telepathy to realize that samuelson shared van effens opinion of the red army faction when they got hold of those devices in metnitz they also obtained copies of the operating instructions one would have been useless without the other remind me not to be within five kilometres of joop and company when they arm either of those devices a palmreader once told me i had a long lifeline but she could have been wrong how is this device in the markerwaard to be detonated preset timing device and the two other devices by radio control god help us all make that ten kilometres you dont trust them i wouldnt trust joop and his friends with a firework they are fanatics and fanatics have unstable minds unstable hands also probably no i dont trust them neither i suspect do you you still wouldnt like to see those devices i presume youre not lunatic enough to keep those in the mill theyre a kilometre away in a secure underground cellar ive no intention of going out in that monsoon and though you might not be lunatic i think youre guilty of a grave error of judgement to detonate any device by radio doesnt call for the mind of an einstein but it can be tricky and a job for experts joop and his band of trusty experts have never detonated a charge in their lives and how would you know that thats being simpleminded why did you have to call me in for the palace job true true would your scruples or your objections to monsoons prevent you from having a look at the operating instructions we have them in this room van effen looked at him then looked away the tv was on showing a weirdly dressed quartet who were presumably singing but perhaps fortunately in silence the volume control had been turned off samuelson and his friends were presumably expecting another newscast van effen looked back at samuelson scruples what you have in mind of course is that we should do your work your dirty work for you instead of those deranged amateurs do you know what would happen if those explosions resulted in the deaths of any citizens yes you would ensure that i joined the departed i wouldnt like that at all lets see the plans romero agnelli removed a couple of papers and handed one each to van effen and george george was the first to speak and that only after a few seconds this isnt a halfkilo device its only for the equivalent of fifty tons of tnt samuelson came very close to smirking the equivalent of ten tons would have suited me equally well but its useful to exaggerate the terror potential dont you think george didnt say what he thought after less than a minute he looked up and spoke again only moderately complicated and very precise two snags the first is that joop speaks fractured english and people who have difficulty in speaking only the simplest form of a language usually are pretty hopeless when it comes to reading or writing it the second snag is the jargon jargon technical terms van effen said they might as well be in sanskrit as far as joop is concerned well van effen handed his paper back to agnelli well have to think and talk about it samuelson tried not altogether successfully to smother the smile of a man who knows he has won his point for the next minute or two they remained sipping their branches in comparative and apparently companionable silence when the singers if such they were slowly faded from the screen to be replaced by the now familiar figure of the tragedystricken newscaster the government have just announced that they have just received two more demands from the fff the first of those concerned the demand for a hundred and twenty million guilders and how it is to be transferred the government does not say whether it will accede to the request and refuses to discuss the nature of the transfer the second demand is for the release of two prisoners who were imprisoned several years ago for crimes of extreme violence the government refuses to disclose the names of the prisoners we would remind viewers that we shall be on the air again at midnight to find out whether the fff have in fact breached the flevoland dykes agnelli switched off the set satisfactory samuelson said he was actually rubbing his hands together eminently satisfactory seems like a pretty silly and stupid broadcast to me van effen said not at all samuelson was positively beaming the nation now knows that the government has received details of our demands and as they have not outright rejected them it probably means that they are going to accede to them it also shows how weak the government is and in how strong a position we are thats not what i mean theyve been stupid they didnt have to make that announcement at all oh yes they did they were told that if they didnt we would radio the communiquй to warsaw who would be just too delighted to rebroadcast it to western europe you have a transmitter that can reach as far as warsaw we havent got a transmitter period nor do we know anyone in warsaw the threat was enough your government samuelson said with considerable satisfaction is now reduced to such a state of fear and trepidation that they believe anything we say besides they would look pretty silly wouldnt they if the announcement came through poland van effen refused the offer of a second brandy he had every reason to keep a clear mind for the next hour or two and said goodnight samuelson looked at him in some surprise but youll be coming down to see the midnight broadcast i dont think so i dont doubt your ability to carry out your threat im going too george said but i shall be back down just going to see how the lieutenant is incidentally mr samuelson if i may another toddy for the young lieutenant certainly my friend certainly he may have a bit of a head in the morning george said but he should be halfway towards recovery in the morning vasco was in fact in excellent health and showing no signs of an incipient headache still the same lad i should imagine the changeover will be at nine some guard spends most of the time with his chin on his chest then jerks awake lets hope his relief is of the same cast of mind me im going to have a snooze if hes still there at say ninetwenty give me a shake if hes relieved at nine shake me at ten how do you operate the radio on that army truck and whats its ranget unlimited well a hundred two hundred kilometres im not sure operation is simple just lift the receiver and press the red button the transmitter is preset to the nearest army command base which is always manned i particularly dont want to talk to the army i want to talk to marnixstraat easy standard tuning dial standard wavebands and a switch beside the button for illumination that picks out the wavelengths very easily indeed van effen nodded stretched out on a bed and closed his eyes george woke van effen at to pm new sentry took over at nine hardly seems an improvement on the other one except that is from your point of view hes middleaged fat wears two overcoats is sitting in the armchair with a rug over his knees and youll be pleased to hear also has a bottle in his hand sounds like my kind of man van effen rose and changed his trousers for a pair of denims vasco said whats that your battle uniform whats samuelson going to say if he sees me in sodden trousers or even dry trousers that are so wrinkled that it will look as if id fallen into a river ah well youre going to get wet enough thats for sure rains heavier than ever there are times when we can hardly see the lad in the loft doorway suits me fine that barn wasnt built yesterday and old floorboards in old lofts tend to creak with ram like this drumming on the roof he wont be able to hear a thing besides judging from georges general description the sentry is probably half deaf anyway he strapped on his smith and wesson shrugged into his jacket and put the aerosol can in one pocket and the hooded torch in the other velvet gloves george said vasco said whats that silenced pistol and a knockout gas canister thats what he calls velvet gloves van effen dug into an inside pocket brought out a small leather wallet unzipped it took out the metallic contents examined them then returned them to the wallet and pocket skeleton keys and picklocksgeorge said approvingly no selfrespecting detective should be without them vasco said what happens if you dont come back sir i shall be back its five past ten now i should be back by tenthirty if im not back by eleven go downstairs say nothing no doom laden speeches no warnings that their end is nigh kill samuelson cripple the agnelli brothers and daniken and if riordan is there him also remove all weapons of course and one of you keep an eye on them and make sure that nobody tries to stagger out of the room and summon help while the other gets the girls as your guns are silenced there should be no interruptions then get the hell out of it if anyone gets in your way you know what to do i see vasco looked and sounded more than slightly shocked and how do we get the hell out of it van effen touched the pocket where he had replaced his wallet of skeleton keys and picklocks what do you think those are for ah the army truck indeed as soon as you get under way call up the army or the cops give them the approximate location of this place we know its somewhere between leerdam and gorinchen and leave the rest to them vasco said they might try to escape by helicopter you have the alternative of shooting daniken in both shoulders or taking him with you im virtually certain that none of this will happen i dont want it to happen and thats not primarily because by the time it happens ill probably be dead it would be a confession of failure and i dont like being associated with failure it would be a most unsatisfactory conclusion in fact it would be no conclusion at all samuelson has another headquarters and as we have agreed other associates obrien has almost certainly departed this evening to associate with those other associates even although i doubt it some of those associates may i repeat may be in a position to carry out his plans to a successful conclusion he opened the window back at tenthirty he slid down the two knotted sheets and vanished into the shadows george and vasco went into the darkened bathroom vasco said he is a coldblooded bastard isnt he george said um but hes a killer i know he has killed and would do so again but hes very selective is our peter nobody who has ever departed this world and at his hands has ever been mourned by society four minutes later vasco caught george by the arm see they saw the sentry had just taken a long swig from his bottle laid it on the floor beside him clasped his hands over his rug and appeared to relapse into some kind of yogalike contemplation the shadow that had loomed behind him resolved itself into the unmistakable form of van effen whose right hand curved round and held the aerosol can an inch or two from thesentrys face for a period of not more than two seconds he then pocketed the aerosol hooked his hands under the mans knees and eased him forward several inches to ensure that he wouldnt topple sideways from his armchair picked up a bottle from the floor poured some of the contents over the sentrys face emptied the remainder of the contents over the front of his clothes wrapped the fingers of the unconscious mans right hand round the bottle thrust hand and bottle partly under the rug tightened the rug to ensure that hand and bottle would remain where they were then vanished into the gloom well now vasco said theres one character who isnt going to report himself for dereliction of duty because of dropping off into a drunken slumber our peter doesnt do things by halves lets see now a twosecond burst he should come to in about half an hour peter explained those things to me once wont he know he has been drugged thats the beauty of it leaves no trace that apart what would you think if you woke up with your clothes reeking of schnapps or whatever and your hand clasped round an empty bottle the stairs broad and very creaking and just behind where the sentry slept led directly to the floor of the barn now converted into a temporary garage torch in hand van effen descended quickly loosed the bolts on the retaining half of the entrance door and turned his attention to the army truck the exterior was as it had been except that the number plates had been changed he then wriggled under the truck scraped clear an area on the underside of the chassis just forward of the rear axle and attached to it the magnetic clamp of the metallic device which vasco had removed from the bar of soap thirty seconds later he was in the drivers seat and through to the marnixstraat put me through to colonel de graaf please who is speaking never mind whos speaking the colonel hes at home he is not hes there ten seconds or youre an expoliceman tomorrow in just ten seconds the colonel was on the phone you were a bit harsh on that poor lad his voice held a complaining note hes either a fool an incompetent or was improperly instructed he was told to keep open an anonymous line van effen spoke in polish which the colonel understood as well as he did dutch police changed their wavelengths at infrequent intervals and had done so again only that day as in every major city in the world villains occasionally picked up police wavelengths but the probabilities against a villain who understood polish picking up a changed wavelength were astronomical please switch on your recorder i dont know how much time i have and i dont want to repeat myself proceed i shall spell names backwards we are south of this is a name utrecht and between two other names leerdam and gorinchen you have that i have that do not attempt to locate and do not attempt to attack the principals are elsewhere it was an outright lie but the colonel was not to know that and it would achieve only the deaths of five people who dont deserve to die you know the people i mean i know we have here the army truck you know which one it has changed the identification plates i will give you the new numbers backwards van effen did so it will be carrying the nuclear devices you know about what i have attached a magnetic transmitter bug to this vehicle have an unmarked police car in the vicinity as from say am it is to track this truck at a safe distance this police car will also be in radio contact with two or three army commando trucks lying to the west i am becoming increasingly convinced that this truck will be heading towards the scheldt area there will be three people in that truck all dressed in dutch army uniforms including a bogus lieutenantcolonel called ylvisaker who may even call himself by that name i want that truck seized along with its occupants and the seizure to be kept in complete secrecy if you release that news then the responsibility for the flooding of the country will lie in your hands de graafs voice took on an even more complaining note you dont have to threaten me my boy i apologize i am under intense pressure and have to make my points in as impressive a way as i can one other thing have tv and radio announce or just say if you like that they are to be of good heart and that you are closing in on the rotterdam and scheldt areas the reason to be given is that you want every citizen thereabouts to be on continuous alert and report anything abnormal to the police this is purely psychological and i dont believe our friends are very good at psychology but please please apart from taking this truck in complete secrecy no other attempts at interference understood i have someone with me who would like a word with you and who speaks polish even better than you and i do spell his name backwards de graaf did so and wieringas voice came on the phone congratulations my boy those may be a bit premature minister i cant for instance stop the breaching of the flevoland dykes or the detonation of the markewaard device a further thought has occurred to me you might have the media include in their broadcasts about the rotterdam area that whitehall and stormont have arrived at an agreement to begin active and immediate negotiations the two parliaments might not like it im a dutchman instruct them to like it some obscure psychological motive again i suppose very well i agree frankly my boy how do you rate our chances better than evens minister they trust us they have to trust us he explained briefly about the de dooms ammunition dump and the rafs inability to handle radiocontrolled devices apart from that im not only sure but know that they dont distrust or suspect us they are basically naive complacent over confident and sure of themselves they lack the devious minds of honest detectives i have to move sir ill call again as soon as whenever possible in the marnixstraat the minister of defence said you agree with van effens assessment colonel if thats what he thinks then thats what i think why isnt that young man well young compared to us not chief of police somewhere hell be the chief here in the not too distant future in the meantime i need him dont we all wieringa sighed dont we all van effen climbed up to the loft patted the sentry lightly on the cheek got no reaction and left three minutes later he was inside the bedroom vasco looked pointedly at his watch ten thirtythree vasco said accusingly sorry i was detained anyway thats a fine way to welcome back a man who may just have escaped the jaws of death there was trouble no clockwork you didnt unpick the garage lock george said also accusingly another warm welcome where are the congratulations for a mission successfully accomplished would you have picked that lock if at the window next to our bathroom you had seen the reverend riordan who seems to meditate on his feet and pray with his eyes open gazing out pensively over the courtyard instead i unbolted the garage doors from the inside i hope you remembered to rebolt them george sorry what detained you wieringa the defence minister he was in the marnixstraat with colonel de graaf if you refrain from asking questions ill tell you word for word how our conversations went he did so and at the end george said satisfactory you fixed the bug of course so why did you go to all this devious trouble of getting hold of the operating instructions for the devices have you ever known of a cop or soldier for that matter who never made a mistake george pondered briefly then said present company excepted no true we may yet need that information ylvisaker and his friends might just miss the roadblocks but you didnt tell them that we were going by helicopter j did not for the same reason that i didnt take up samuelsons unspoken offer to tell us where we are going if i had done his immediate reaction our defence ministers that is would be to have called his counterpart in whitehall to send over a nimrod the british bomber that is a virtual airborne radar station and which could have tracked us from here to wherever were going without our knowing a thing about it he smiled you wear what shall we say george a rather peculiar express ion the same thought had occurred to yourself it had george looked thoroughly chagrined i thought it rather a good idea myself i dont i have no doubt that the royal air force would have been delighted to comply and i have equally no doubt that within a very short time of our arriving at our destination we would have a visit from our paratroopers and commandos who dont tend to beat about the bush very much i dont much care for that idea three reasons i dont want a firefight a blood bath killing or capturing killing more likely samuelson and his friends would not be the final solution there may be in fact i feel certain there will be dont ask my why i dont know enough of his men left to carry out the ultimate threat thirdly i dont much care for the idea of the young ladies being hurt or worse i wouldnt much like to gun down wound i mean not kill a countryman who was threatening the fife of one of the girls vasco said julie and annemarie all four george said mildly the other two are criminals they associate with criminals different matter entirely anyway if the government were to commit this crass folly we would be in a position to expose them and dictate our own terms wieringa and the colonel would back us up and theyre the only two people who matter however this is all academic its not going to happen moment gentlemen these denims are rather damp when hed changed he said our absent friend obrien is missing in more than one way hes also the missing key id give a great deal to know where he is at this moment he wont have gone to their other hangout for his expertise in debugging and defusing alarm systems wouldnt be called for there one could speculate endlessly as to where he has gone to exercise his skills but that would be a waste of time im neglecting my duties vasco said if i may be excused george would you come and switch the light on again he turned off the light went into the bathroom and closed the door no sooner had george turned the light on than vasco tapped on the door george switched the light off again and the bathroom door opened this may interest you vasco said the sentrys head was nodding intermittent and at irregular intervals after a few seconds of this he held it in an upright position then shook it from side to side after a few more seconds of this it was too dark to see what his expression was registering but it was very probably one of confusion and apprehension brought up his right hand from under his rug looked at the bottle still clutched in it upended it and apparently established the fact that it was empty placed it on the floor and pushed himself back in his seat hes going to drop off again vasco said not him van effen said hes making a major decision the sentry made his major decision he lifted his rug to one side pushed himself groggily to his feet and took a few staggering steps that brought him perilously close to the loft doorway vasco said hes drunk again not him hes seen his bottle is empty and assumes because of that and the fact that he reeks of schnapps that he ought to be drunk and acts accordingly autosuggestion i believe they call it it could have been a bit awkward if his relief found that he couldnt wake him enough in the bedroom van effen said i think we should go downstairs in a few moments including you vasco if you feel strong enough im a captain in the dutch army im brave george said you told samuelson you wouldnt be down my mind changes along with the circumstances it was freezingly cold out there i require brandy more importantly i want to see their reaction to the news that the hunt for the fff is now being concentrated in the rotterdamscheldt area even more important is that i want those missiles explosives and other nasties transferred from the truck to the helicopter whygeorge said the roads between here and the rotterdamscheldt area will be alive with patrols tomorrow morning police and army but mainly i suspect army my personal conviction is that ylvisaker will be intercepted i want those missiles because the fff want them mounted for some offensive or defensive purposes and that should give them from our point of view owing to the fact that the missiles are totally useless a splendid sense of false security you should have been a lawyer a politician a wall street broker or a criminal specializing in fraud george said such devious minds dont belong on the ranks of the police forces hark at whos talking i have also the hunch that the explosives grenades and other sundries may prove to be more useful to us than to them just a hunch vasco what do you know about the regulations concerning the transport of missiles absolutely nothing then lets invent some ill wager sir that i can invent better regulations than you can gentlemen gentlemen samuelsons crocodile smile would have shamed an archangel delighted to see you i thought you werent coming down mr danilov i just couldnt sleep van effen said with a transparent honesty that would have shamed the same archangel as a dutchman even an adopted one i just couldnt well you understand well you know flevoland of course of course i understand and the captain sorry lieutenant delighted to see you my boy i take it you are feeling better my voice is not but i aint vasco said hoarsely thanks to your kindness mr samuelson the universal specific i suggest another he looked at van effen and george brandies gentlemen large ones you are very kindvan effen said he waited while samuelson gave instructions to leonardo you know that i am a normally incurious person but two things take my attention the ladies have returned i was given to understand that they were still in a state of nervous exhaustion as far as i can understand they still are your second question van effen smiled my second question may give the answer to my first implied question i see your tv is on again i have by now come to understand that this means that you are expecting a further communiquй or statement or whatever in the near future you understand correctly it was samuelsons turn to smile the usual avuncular one both questions answered you will excuse me a moment gentlemen i must tell the reverend that it is earphones time leonardo brought them their drinks van effen thanked him and led the other two out on to the terrace no one raised an eyebrow apart from the fact that they had already established reputations as eccentric freshair fiends ii they wished to have a private conversation they had already had a long time to have held it upstairs van effen closed the door and said well what do we make of that the four young ladies who appear to have recovered from their nervous exhaustion theyre talking among each other not animatedly not very cordially but theyre talking and i dont for a moment believe theyve come down to watch this next broadcast george sipped his brandy thoughtfully somebody wants to talk to us van effen nodded julie could be annemarie but my hunch is julie he looked across at the loft door where the sentry was now pacing to and fro perfectly steady on his feet and looking every inch a man devoted to his job when we get back inside which will be in a very few seconds its like an icebox out here i want you to wait a few discreet minutes then wander aimlessly around playing the role of a genial middleaged lothario just act your natural self that is and see if you cant have a word with julie just a few words and dont let her talk more than a few words with you if necessary just say the word helicopter shell know what i mean ill try to get next to her and no one can hear a word on a helicopter i dont want to go near her myself if samuelson has got a leary eye for anyone its for me a bagatelle george said they reentered the livingroom both van effen and vasco giving exaggerated shudders george was too big and well covered for that sort of thing romero agnelli smiled back so soon gentlemen fresh air is one thing van effen said the polar icecap another he looked up at the flickering but silent tv set mr samuelson not down yet hes hardly had time to get upstairs and back has he agnelli said reasonably your glasses gentlemen at the bar van effen said its a wild night outside and getting wilder do you seriously think its safe to fly tomorrow do you fly as a passenger a lot i have had a pilots licence never been in a helicopter in my life i have a licence for a helicopter total solo flying time about three hours in weather like this you wouldnt get me within a hundred miles of the pilots seat in a helicopter danikens had thousands of hours superb pilot well thats a relief van effen was aware that george and vasco had drifted away his eyes made no attempt to follow them nice to think we might get there wherever there is if daniken wasnt sure he wouldnt take off they continued an amicable discussion along those lines for two or three minutes until samuelson reappeared to all appearances his usual urbane and goodhumoured self any moment now ladies and gentlemen i think we should take our seats it was the same lugubrious announcer and he seemed to have aged considerably since his last appearance we have two announcements to make both concerning the fff the first is that london and stormont the northern ireland parliament have arrived at an agreement to begin active and immediate negotiations with our government such negotiations have in fact already begun samuelson beamed the second is that the government advises all citizens of the netherlands to be of good heart the ministry of defence suspects although it has no reason to believe that the fff will be switching its scene of operations from the lisselmeer where the dyke breaches and the explosion of this nuclear device are promised to take place tomorrow this is because the fff have established a practice of not striking twice in the same area the balance of opinion is that they will concentrate on the southwest most likely in the rotterdamscheldt the reason given for this announcement is that the government wants every citizen in that area repeat evey because it affects every citizen to be on continuous alert and report anything in the slightest way abnormal to the nearest police or army post it is appreciated that this statement will also be picked up by the fff but the government regards this as the lesser of two evils compared to whatever use it may be to the fff samuelson was no longer beaming van effen forehead furrowed and lips pursed looked at george then without altering his expression at samuelson and said i dont think i like this very much i dont like it at all his expression was almost a mirror image of van effens and the fingers of both hands were drumming on the arms of his chair after a few seconds he turned to van effen and said and what do you make of this development it was significant van effen thought that samuelson should have asked him first it didnt speak too highly for his confidence in his associates van effen waited about twenty seconds before he replied he already had the answers to most possible questions but samuelson wouldnt have been too impressed by an immediate answer i think theyre bluffing or at least counter or double bluffing they may believe that you intend to strike next in some other spot entirely and that this is intended to put you off your guard and relax while they close in on where they fondly imagine you are or they may not be bluffing and this may be intended to restrict your movements either way theyre not very bright but then the minister of justice the minister of defence and the chief of police of amsterdam are hardly renowned for their outstanding intelligence george coughed softly into his hand but retained an impassive expression samuelson looked doubtful dont forget ive met wieringa he didnt strike me as a fool hes not a fool hes honest straightforward and the most popular man in government but lacks the devious intelligence to rise to the very top plots and counterplots are not for him another thing if the authorities knew where we were dont you think wed have had a visit from a battalion of paratroopers or commandos or both quite some time ago ah the thought seemed to cheer samuelson up and still another thing im told you have another operations centre somewhere why dont you call them and see if theyve suffered any harassment an excellent idea samuelson nodded to romero agnelli who dialled a number spoke briefly and hung up nothing he said again excellent samuelson said so were in the clear no were not van effen shook his head in a discouragingly defiant fashion lieutenant is there any chance that it may have been discovered that the truck and weapons are missing from the armoury from which we took them the truckvasco said hoarsely possible but unlikely the weapons no the regular inventory isnt due for another two weeks van effen said mr samuelson its not really for me to say but shouldnt we change the identification numbers on that truck samuelson also smirked already done well done but theres more to it than that vasco spoke huskily and unhappily the authorities as mr danilov says may be operating in this area mention was made of both police and army posts that means there may be police and army road blocks police road blocks present no danger army ones do they know the missiles in transport which is in itself an extremely rare occurrence always travel in convoy if you want to get them to their destination theyll have to travel by helicopter not in my helicopter they wont daniken said firmly mr daniken i believe you to be an expert helicopter pilot vascos voice being in the assumed condition it was it was difficult for him to speak coldly but his eyes were cold enough the cobbler should stick to his last im an expert on missiles a missile cannot be armed until its in flight its obvious that youve never been in military helicopters what do you think the russian gunships use in afghanistan peashooters daniken remained silent i also think the other weapons and explosives should be removed otherwise youre more than liable to be asked what armoury youve taken them from and to what armoury or army unit youre taking them mobile army controls tend to be very curious very alert and very persistent especially when they know theres a national emergency alert out daniken looked unhappy but the detonators the detonators george said comfortably will be in their velvet sockets wrapped in cotton wool in a leadsheathed steel box and resting on my lap he let a note of irritation creep into his voice do you think i want to have myself blown up far less your damned helicopter i shouldnt imagine so it was samuelson who spoke what do you think romero i dont have to think mr samuelson neither do i totally agreed gentlemen excellent precautions we shall drive the truck down to the helicopter tonight and transfer the missiles and the rest of it after the staff have retired which may be rather late especially as they too will be watching their tv sets at midnight not that it matters that much they are well accustomed to the mysterious goingson of film companies he paused i wonder if one of you three gentlemen would care to supervise the transfer of those materials i will george said immediately no coward like a big coward he looked at daniken it looks like being a rather bumpy flight tomorrow as this is an exmilitary helicopter i assume you have clamps lashings and other devices to secure things that have to be secured we have daniken said he still looked distinctly unhappy seems to be all van effen said mr samuelson id like another snooze before this midnight broadcast not that im convinced that well see anything even if there am ships or helicopters around with searchlights visibility in this driving rain will be zero george lieutenant me too george said any more of this brandy and ill be dropping those detonators all over the place vasco was already on his feet without as much as a glance at the four girls they left and made their way up the stairs in the corridor above van effen said admiringly you really are a couple of fearful liars have a word with julie george certainly not george spoke in a lofty tone we professionals operate on a higher level he produced a folded bit of paper from his pocket and replaced it splendid vasco we approach our bedroom door has anything occurred to you visitors once inside van effen carried on a brief conversation about the weather the best way of securing the missiles and other weapons aboard the helicopter and their conviction that the truck should have no trouble in getting through to its destination while vasco carried out his usual meticulous inspection after a few minutes he returned from the bathroom and put his fingers to his lips well me for bedvan effen said any gallant volunteers to keep the midnight watch no need for anyone to keep a watch vasco said i have a travelling alarm seconds later all three were within the bathroom which had both the mirror and overhead lights on van effen and george had gone in first from darkened bedroom to darkened bathroom followed immediately by vasco who left the now lit bedroom door slightly ajar and turned on the light as he entered he then switched on the overhead shower in the bath one doesnt have to be a genius to know that obrien is elsewhere vasco said he could never have been responsible for the crude device thats attached to the underside of my bed the one device that cant be deactivated without a listener knowing is inside a shower head the listener can hear it being unscrewed and even if there were other bugs in here which there arent no one can hear a thing over the sound of a shower odd but a fact youre just like our big friend here van effen said you should have joined the criminal ranks years ago youd have made a fortune well the fff should now have a taperecording reassuring them that theres no way they can fad lets have a look at that note george george did so and van effen read it out something goes on which neither annemarie nor i understand but which may be of use to you we have become quite friendly with our two lady criminal kidnappers and if they are criminals so are annemarie and hardened criminals dont go around looking as if the day of judgement is at hand and trying all the time not to have tears in their eyes they do van effen broke off and looked thoughtfully at george anyone see julie slip this note to you no vasco was perturbed what if julie im sorry sir your sister you must remember i dont know her has told them about us rubbish george said as you said you dont know her peters faith in her intelligence judgement and intuition is total as is mine in fact george added confidentially shes a lot cleverer than he is that was quite uncalled forvan effen said coldly kathleen is quite definitely the one who is under the most pressure she is definitely afraid of samuelson or something that samuelson might do maria is under less pressure but doesnt seem to like what her brother romero is up to but she seems to like him and i have to admit that he has been very kind and courteous to us since they took us away i think that in their own way they are as much prisoners as we are i think kathleen and mafia are here under a form of coercion just as anne and i are hem under coercion but a different kind of coercion coercion vasco said thats the word you used on the veranda remember i remember were here annemarie and i simply because we were abducted they are here im sure because they have been misled tied to because appeals have been made to their love or loyalty or some misguided sense of honour or all three i think that they especially kathleen have been lured here under totally false misapprehensions jesus christ for once georges massive calm had deserted him ive heard of rare cases of telepathy between twins but shes only your young sister thats what you said almost word for word nothing to do with telepathy great minds tend to think alike still question her intelligence judgement and intuition vasco vasco shook his head very slowly several times and said nothing van effen looked at george hah and you still think shes cleverer than i am george stroked his chin and said nothing van effen read on and his face became very still maybe you were right at that george listen to this last paragraph i know why maria is here despite her disapproval of what romero is up to there is a genuine bond of affection between them as for kathleen i have mentioned that she is afraid of samuelson and whatever he has in mind i have also mentioned misguided love and loyalty i am convinced that she is samuelsons daughter there was a considerable silence then george said i take back what i said about her being smarter than you shes smarter than the three of us put together she has to be right theres no other explanation van effen set fire to the note and flushed the ashes away then they turned off the shower and left vasco shook van effen by the shoulder its time mr danilov van effen opened his eyes and as always was instantly awake i didnt hear the am bell turned it off ive been awake for some time george only samuelson the agnelli brothers and daniken were in the livingroom when the three men arrived just in time gentlemen just in time samuelson said even though normally cheerful he seemed to be in uncommonly good humour that midnight a condition that could possibly have been accounted for by the bottle of brandy and glass by his side but which was almost certainly due to an anticipatory euphoria ten minutes and were all back in bed not me george said im staying here your loading supervisor remember when do we begin the transfer of course of course half an hour say leonardo we are neglecting our guests while leonardo proceeded to remedy the neglect van effen looked at samuelson he bore no resemblance to kathleen but that meant nothing she probably took after her irish mother van effen didnt doubt his sisters conviction the same announcer whose depth of depression seemed to be matched only by his remarkable stamina appeared on screen just after midnight it is with regret that we have to announce that we will be unable to show live the threatened breaches of the flevoland dykes when and if they occur it is impossible for our tv cameras to operate in conditions of total darkness and torrential rain we are however in constant radiotelephone touch with a number of observers and will inform you at once as soon as any positive news is at hand his image faded from the screen pity samuelson said he seemed in no way disappointed it would have been a stirring spectacle still we shouldnt have long to wait they had very little time to wait less than a minute elapsed before the announcer reappeared replacing a phone on his desk the oosthjkflevoland and zuidslijkflevoland dykes were breached simultaneously some ninety seconds ago both breaches appear to be fairly massive but the appalling weather conditions make it impossible to gauge their extent or the severity of the flooding the authorities say they must wait until the first light of dawn before the scope of the disaster can be accurately assessed we shall however be on the air every hour on the hour to give you what fresh details are available he paused to look at a sheet of paper that had just been handed to him a phone call has just been received from the fff the message reads markerwaard pm today eleven two men were to play particularly important parts in the morning hours of that day one of those was sergeant druckmann who was accompanied by two other officers all three were in plain clothes their unmarked police car was mudcovered and slightly battered it carried an unusual amount of electronic equipment two separate sets of radio transceivers and a radar tracking device so much in fact that unusually it was located on the floor just in front of the righthand rear seat the operator sat on the lefthand rear seat with a largescale road imp on his knees the equipment was for the moment covered by a carelessly thrown rug the car had been in position since sixthirty that morning in a side road just north of gorinchen two other unmarked police cars similarly equipped were within a few miles of them but it was druckmanns car that was to matter that morning the other man to matter was one gropious dressed in the uniform of a corporal in the dutch army and sitting beside a private at the wheel of a small dutch army troop carrier two other soldiers sat in the rear nobody would have used a photograph of gropious on a recruitment poster for the dutch army his uniform was shabby and rather wrinkled and his long blond locks fell every which way under a hat that was more than slightly askew the dutch for some reason best known to themselves permit their soldiers to grow their hair to a length that would have had any british soldier confined to barracks for a fortnight but the blond locks were not his own the uniform like the wig was a fake gropious was undeniably a soldier but no corporal lieutenantcolonel gropious of the dutch army commandos was a particularly tough specimen of a particularly tough and elite corps the am broadcast that morning the first breakfasttime broadcast in dutch tv history had been at once gloomy and slightly reassuring hundreds of square miles of the flevolands had been inundated but to no great depth as far as was known no lives had been lost the loss in livestock could not be estimated until later in the day hundreds of engineers were already pouring even more hundreds of tons of boulders and quicksetting concrete between hastily erected and it was admitted inadequately secured vertical steel plates at best it was also admitted this could do no more than slightly reduce the effects of the next high tide and operations would have to cease at least three hours before that in the livingroom of the windmill where some dozen people were having breakfast samuelson was in high good humour exactly as predicted ladies and gentlemen exactly as predicted he looked in turn at van effen george and vasco i keep my word do i not gentlemen maximum psychological impact yet not a life lost things are going our wayhe paused and listened to the thunderous drumming of the rain on the veranda gradually lost his expression of good humour drummed his fingers on the table looked at daniken and said what do you think i dont like it much daniken said he rose and walked out to the veranda closing the door behind him he was back inside ten seconds the winds about the same he said that is gale force i could fly in that but the rain is the heaviest ive ever seen even worse than the onset of the monsoon in india visibility is zero i cant fly in that and keep our flight plan as it is you mean you wont by samuelson said you refuse to fly samuelson didnt seem unduly perturbed not even if you ordered me i will not be the person who will be responsible for the end of all you wish for i am the pilot and refuse to be responsible for the deaths of twentytwo people which i will be if we stick to our flight plans mass suicide is not for me van effen cleared his throat delicately i am normally as you know the most incurious of persons but i dont like this talk of mass suicide not least because it involves me is the need to leave on time a matter of complete urgency not really it was romero agnelli who answered mr samuelson does the honour of leaving all the organization to me and exceptionally good you are at it too thank you agnelli smiled almost apologetically im just a stickler for timetables i dont think you need to worry too much about timetables van effen said i know this country you people dont im sure george and the lieutenant will confirm that downpours of this extraordinary order rarely last more than an hour or so never as long as two as i am in this unusually questioning mood whats all this about flight paths or flight plans or whatever no reason why you shouldnt know samuelson said he was obviously relieved by van effens statement and was in an expansive mood daniken has radiofiled a flight plan to valkenburg near maastricht and this has been accepted we are today filming a scene in hilly countryside and the only hilly countryside in the netherlands is in the province of limburg where valkenburg lies romero has even had the foresight to book us hotel accommodation there where of course you have no intention of going van effen nodded his head twice neat very neat you take off for limburg which lies in a roughly southsoutheasterly direction then mr daniken descends and alters course the netherlands is a very flat country so one has to fly very low to keep beneath the radar screen as a pilot myself i know that altimeters are notoriously inaccurate at very low altitudes it wouldnt do us a great deal of good if a sudden down draught were to bring us into contact with a block of highrise flats or even one of those massive tv antennas which are such a feature of this country mr daniken has to see where he is going and i have to say that i am in one hundred per cent agreement with mr daniken mr danilov has put it even better than i could daniken said i am in one hundred per cent agreement with him and i agree with you both samuelson said leonardo be so kind as to tell ylvisaker to delay his departure with the truck until further notice i do not wish him to arrive at our destination before we do ylvisaker resplendent in his lieutenantcolonels uniform and his two companions dressed in the uniforms of a sergeant and private of the dutch army departed at am the wind had not eased but the rain as van effen had predicted had lessened to no more than a heavy drizzle at am cornelius the policeman in the rear of sergeant druckmanns car said they are moving out sergeant druckmann picked up his microphone sergeant druckmann here target zero has just moved out will a b c d e please acknowledge the five army patrol vehicles acknowledged in alphabetical order druckmann said two minutes three at the most and we should be able to know what route target zero is taking after that we shall report at minute intervals at am twentytwo people filed aboard the giant helicopter all except the four girls van effen and george were dressed in dutch army uniforms samuelson said goodbye to four umbrellacarrying staff who had come to see them off assuring them that they would be back the following evening all the soldiers with the one exception were armed with machinepistols the exception willi the feckless guard was burdened only by a pair of handcuffs at am daniken lifted off and headed towards the southsoutheast also at am sergeant druckmann reported tracking target zero at two kilometres target zero is now one kilometre north of gorinchen from there the three main exit routes are east south and west two minutes and we should be able to let you know which direction he is heading van effen turned to romero agnelli who was sitting beside him cupped his hand to his ear and said two things intrigue me agnelli smiled and lifted his eyebrows i was led to believe that the armament on this gunship had been dismantled and replaced by dummies those guns arc for real the armament was dismantled and replaced by dummies then we replaced the dummies these things arent hard to come by if you know where to look what was the other thing why isnt daniken climbing were still under a hundred metres look to your left and youll see why van effen looked less than fifty metres away another much smaller helicopter was flying alongside them even as van effen looked the pilot slid back his window and waved an arm van effen looked forward daniken was waving in return the pilot of the small helicopter closed his window and began to climb daniken gently eased the gunship around until it was heading due south neat van effen said very very neat in weather like this there will be precious little private flying in the country today the odd bored air controller might just amuse himself by tracking this helicopter to valkenburg that helicopter of course is heading for valkenburg agnelli nodded your idea of course agnelli smiled and made a deprecating motion with his hand target zero is heading west on the sliedrecht road druckmann report which patrol is in the vicinity patrol a ah colonel gropious sir yes i am seeing a road block one kilometre east of sliedrecht close up until you have them visually but not too close i understand sir target zero is travelling at a very leisurely pace perhaps circumspect is the word im looking for just below fifty kilometres i estimate they should be with you in just under twenty minutes thank you sergeant ylvisaker leaned back luxuriously in his seat and lit a cigar this he said with a sigh is the life thank god were not aboard that damned helicopter that damned helicopter was bumping and lurching its way in a generally westbysouth direction generally because daniken was at pains to avoid towns villages or settlements of any size it was van effen thought a totally superfluous precaution there was no earthly reason why say a lone farmer should report the passage of an unidentified and probably unidentifiable helicopter helicopters were ten a penny in the netherlands van effen looked around the gunship most of the passengers looked distinctly unhappy and their complexions offered an interesting variety of shades of colour annemarie and julie who were sitting together had adopted remarkably similar attitudes clenched fists and eyes screwed tightly shut van effen himself was untroubled daniken was a superb pilot he cupped his hand to agnellis ear how much further about fifteen minutes reasonable accommodation agnelli smiled its a nice little place judging by the standards of samuelsons taste the nice little place van effen thought was probably about the size of the royal palace in the dam square the blue and yellow sign read road check ahead please stop at the red light ylvisakers driver slowed and said what do we do now ylvisaker took a leisurely puff at his cigar drive on my man gropiouss driver lowered his binoculars target zero for sure sir he raised his binoculars again and the given number fk gropiouss vehicle was in the lefthand lane facing oncoming traffic on the righthand side and slightly behind them was another troop carrier two soldiers both holding umbrellas were leaning against their vehicle both were smoking cigarettes would you look at that sloppy bunch ylvisaker said umbrellas cigarettes ill bet theres not an officer nearer than rotterdam and these mind you are the gallant troops sworn to defend nato to the death as they came to a halt at the red light gropious and his two men all three trailing machinepistols in their left hands approached the stolen army truck gropious going to the front of the truck and his two men to the rear ylvisaker opened his door whats all this then corporal colonel an embarrassed gropious perceptibly stiffening executed as military a salute as could be expected from a slovenly corporal colonel if i had known ylvisaker smiled tolerantly what is it corporal orders sir we are under instructions to stop and examine all vehicles army trucks included which may be carrying illegally obtained weapons we were given the registration number of one particular army truck this is not the one ylvisaker displayed some mild interest are you searching for anything in particular missiles sir groundtoground and groundtoair missiles i must admit sir that i dont even know what they look like except that theyre copper coloured and over two metres long duty is duty corporal i see you have two men at the rear instruct them to open up and search just you know for the records gropious gave the instructions the rear doors were opened and no missiles were found my apologies colonel gropious said he hesitated then produced a notebook and pencil my instructions are to make a note of the identification of every person passing through this checkpoint ylvisaker reached inside his uniform jacket gropious said no no sir in your case no papers are necessary just your name colonel ylvisaker colonel ylvisaker rather laboriously gropious wrote down the name in his notebook how ironic he thought that such a confrontation should occur between a lieutenantcolonel posing as a fake corporal and a civilian and criminal posing as a lieutenantcolonel he put his notebook away and lifted his machinepistol at the same instant as his two soldiers at the rear of the truck movegropious said and youre dead no sooner had gropious and his men brought ylvisaker and his two men out on to the roadside than sergeant druckmanns car drew up behind them druckmann and his men got out druckmann carrying a considerable number of metal objects in his hand druckmann looked at the scruffy corporal with the straggling blond locks and said hesitantly colonel gropious it is indeed gropious removed his hat took off his wig and threw it beyond the roadside those damn things itch druckmann said congratulations sir gropious who without his wig now looked remarkably like a lieutenantcolonel shook his hand warmly and the very same to you sergeant your name please all i know is that all the police cars were manned by sergeants druckmann colonel an excellent piece of work sergeant druckmann most professional and what may i enquire is all that ironmongery youre carrying handcuffs and leg irons sir i understand that those are not standard army issue splendid kindly have one of your men attach them at once he turned to one of his soldiers instruct all patrols to return to base i suggest sergeant druckmann that you instruct one of your men to do the same for the police cars emphasising of course the need for complete secrecy at once colonel but there is no need to emphasize secrecy all of us myself included have been threatened by colonel de graaf with the equivalent of devils island ah our redoubtable chief of police in amsterdam yes sir whose prisoners are those yours or ours they are now the property of the nation we will drive to my base call up mr wieringa the defence minister and colonel de graaf and see what is to be done with them meantime lets have a look at ylvisakers truck well his stolen truck inside the truck druckmann said i really know very little about whats going on those three men are fff they are indeed and they face three charges the first is impersonating army officers the second is being in possession of a stolen army vehicle gropious opened the lids of the two fake longrange petrol tanks to reveal the squat cylindrical shapes of two bronzecoloured metal objects the third of course is to have them explain how come they are transporting a couple of nuclear bombs along the roads of our fair countryside the lids were lowered and they stepped outside druckmann said may i smoke in the colonels presence the colonel is about to do the same after a few moments druckmann said well all right i volunteer gropious smiled to drive this truck to base im a fearful coward colonel i shall take great care i have a great deal of time for fearful cowards sergeant by the time we get there we shall have two us experts from germany standing by to deactivate those damned things i shall lead the way red lights flashing and all that sort of thing you will follow close behind and your police car will follow close behind you you have this consolation sergeant druckmann if youre vaporized were all vaporized the time was am at precisely am daniken touched down outside another isolated windmillcumfarmhouse considerably larger than the one they had so recently left two men and two women umbrellas in hand came hurrying out to meet them it was clear that samuelson and his friends judging from the smiles on the faces of the four were not only known and welcome but also expected with the power shut off the interior of the gunship was almost deathly quiet van effen said to agnelli well yes you do have a certain gift for organization agnelli smiled and said nothing the livingroom of the windmill which had a similar veranda outside was considerably larger and even more luxurious than the one they had left behind there were ten people in the room samuelson and the agnelli brothers van effen and his friends and the four girls daniken van effen guessed was presumably parking and concealing his helicopter in a nearby barn riordan had gone upstairs no doubt to indulge in another bout of meditation and prayer samuelson relaxed in an armchair before a crackling wood fire sighed like a man well content with himself clockwork my friends just clockwork the penultimate stage successfully completed i know its still relatively early in the morning but then we shall be having an early lunch something in the nature of a soupfon of jonge jenever i think an early lunch van effen said we are moving on just after two oclock samuelson gestured towards a tv set after weve seen what happens in the markerwaard i see van effen made it abundantly clear that he didnt see at all well wherever he shrugged how many of those establishment do you own in the netherlands none the owners of this house for instance are presently basking in the sunshine of the bahamas the golden gate pays well this as you are aware is the dead season for farming a local farmer also well rewarded looks after the cattle and sheep there are no problems do you know where you are mr danilov i havent the faintest idea long experience had taught van effen to he with total conviction he knew exactly where he was after so short a flight still somewhere in holland does it matter you are a singularly incurious person we are in the vicinity of middelharnis you know of it middelharnis van effen frowned then said over flakkee samuelson smiled nodded and said nothing van effen set down the glass that leonardo had just given him his face was stonily bleak and his eyes very cold the haringvliet he whispered youre after the haringvliet he had been well aware of this for some quite considerable time the haringvliet dam was variously referred to as the valve or the sluice gate of holland it blocked the entry to the haringvliet estuary and many waterways beyond in the late spring and early summer when the snows in the alps germany and france meltedit diverted the waters from the swollen rhine waal and maas rivers past rotterdam and into the new waterway which joined the north sea at europort simply by keeping its massive hydraulically operated electrically powered gates closed it could also when the level of the river water rose too high and the level of the north sea was considerably lower release water directly into the north sea simply by opening as many of its gates as was deemed necessary at this time of the year however with the river water shrunk to its lowest level its main task was to keep out the north sea except at the very latest of neap tides the flooding the damage and the deaths that would inevitably result from the destruction of the sluice gate of holland were incalculable yes mr danilov samuelson must have been convinced that his life was in danger but he remained outwardly calm i am as you say after the haringvliet van effen nodded just once briefly hence the nuclear weapons i hope to god they detonate en route and blast ylvisaker and his friends into outer space a most uncharitable wish to say the least samuelson sipped his drink if he was perturbed he hid the fact uncommonly well i see you are wearing your smith and wesson mr danilov i have no doubt your friends are similarly armed romero leonardo and i carry no arms its a point of principle with us if you choose to shoot me theres nothing i can do about it but wouldnt you consider it rather unfair to shoot a man merely because youre labouring under a vast misapprehension samuelson seemed to be positively enjoying himself go on the nuclear devices are most definitely not intended for use on the haringvliet dam and this for three reasons firstly i dont relish the prospect of vaporizing myself secondly i want the sluice gates to remain intact and in perfect working order thirdly i intend to take over the dam van effen sipped his drink in silence for a few moments as if to take time out for thinking not only had he known that the haringvliet was samuelsons target hed been equally convinced that samuelson had had no intention of destroying it how very ambitious and how do you intend to set about this takeover its already half done about forty hours ago a skilled electrician carried out a very delicate and ail but undetectable job of sabotaging three turbogenerators the devil he did he was an employee naturally and dutch yes twenty thousand dollars ive always found has a most profound influence on even the most patriotic of souls besides he had no idea what we had in mind he of course was given the opportunity to trace the source of those faults and when he failed they called in experts from rotterdam those four are currently lodged m a cellar beneath us they are being well fed and cared for as you can see for yourself any time you wish that will not be necessary and then of course you sent in your own four experts yes alas all four have criminal records and have served prism sentences but they have the saving virtue that they are probably the four best safecrackers in the country they also have a considerable knowledge of electrics such men could not have been easy to come by van effen said he paused then said wrong they could have been easily come by he looked at romero agnelli your brothers in prison of course they must have the names and track records of every outstanding by their standards criminal in the country they are very able men samuelson said but better at safecracking than electrics their purpose being of course van effen said to locate and deactivate all the alarm systems in the dam pressure pads rays panic buttons and whatever also to discover the location of both onduty and offduty guards not to deactivate not yet might not even be necessary agnelli said the rest yes there were one or two points about which they were uncertain so they asked permission to bring in the best turbogenerator experts in the country van effen nodded and of course they got the best expert in a totally different field obrien very clever i must admit samuelson waved a hand all romeros work he would have made an excellent divisional officer has obrien returned by the way leonardo left the room and returned with an obrien who was totally unlike his real self owing to the fact that he had acquired a beard and a moustache sorry about this obrien said wincing more than slightly he tore off both moustache and beard as im going aboard with you i thought the sudden transformation of a civil engineer into a dutch army sergeantmajor might have caused some eyebrow raising samuelson said how is everything ready to go obrien said one pointgeorge said how are we to recognize those four ah colleagues you have on the dam we dont want to point guns at the wrong people a good pointagnelli said all four are dressed in very light blue overalls and carrying only tools in their toolbags the odd pistol a few gas grenades useful things like that id like some of those van effen said gas grenades i mean in a small satchel or suitcase like mr samuelson im averse to unnecessary violence and the people on the dam are after all my adopted countrymen if its necessary to restrain any of them id much rather do it with a whiff of gas rather than a bullet my sentiments exactly samuelson said you shall have them one further point van effen said how are you going to account for the presence of two civilians in an army group aha samuelson smiled broadly civilians but not just ordinary civilians you are two senior members of the amsterdam police specialist antiterrorist squad that should fit the bill rather nicely dont you think thats nice van effen said i always wanted to be a policeman how do you propose to gain entrance to the dam mr samuelson nothing simpler we land on the roadway on the dam first of course we send a radio message to the dam to the effect that there is a suspicion nothing more that the fff may be thinking of making an attack on the dam either from the sea or from the river side and that patrol boats will be approaching from the river side and a destroyer from the sea side we of course shall be there first its only a few minutes flying time from here they will be ordered to maintain complete radio silence no transmissions no receptions me simplicity of true genius van effen said you have your nerve the young ladies of course remain behind most certainly not i wouldnt have kathleen and maria miss this splendid denouement for all the world the rear of the helicopter will be screened off and the four ladies will remain in hiding until we have taken over it has occurred to you that the other two girls might scream for help or attempt to overpower kathleen and maria they find it difficult to scream for anything when theyre gagged and difficult to attack anyone when their hands are tied behind their backs as an additional precaution joop will be with them joop is very useful with a gun you think of everything van effen said he hoped joop wasnt too useful for then joop would have to die samuelson rose went to a desk and brought out two sheets of paper these are the ground and elevation plans of the haringviiet dam leonardo go and bring the others here i want every man to know exactly what to do to know exactly where every guard will be on duty where the offduty guards and workers are and where each man on duty may reasonably be expected to be there will be no slipups daniken returned just as leonardo left in seconds only leonardo returned bringing with him joop joachim and the two nameless raf youths that had been at the other windmill four older men in their thirties and forties whom van effen had not seen before and two of the guards he had seen before the last six looked very tough very competent they all crowded round the table followed by van effen vasco george samuelson romero agnelli daniken and obrien only two men were missing willi who was locked up in a cellar somewhere and riordan who was presumably above such mundane and secular matters although it was samuelson who had called the meeting it was romero agnelli who conducted the meeting his organizational abilities were indeed quite remarkable he pointed out to each man exactly where he was to go and what was expected of him he also insisted that they coordinate their watches so that each an should know exactly what time he should be at any given place this took about five minutes he then started it all over again when he started a third time van effen accompanied by george and vasco headed resolutely towards the bar samuelson smiling came after them and moved behind the bar you get easily bored mr danilov i dont have to be told the same thing twice far less three you have a point maybe i am overdoing it a bit he looked at his watch i find this a bit worrisome i should have thought the truck would have been hem by this time ylvisaker struck me as being a pretty competent character van effen said engine trouble heavy traffic burst tyre anything anyway you can soon find out youve said you have a radio transmitter here the lieutenant is an expert operator and of course he knows the frequency of the truck would you lieutenant thank you samuelson pointed across the room there vasco seated himself at the transceiver adjusted his headphones and started transmuting after two minutes he took off the headphones and returned to the bar nothing mr samuelson cant raise him samuelson pursed his lips youre sure sure im sure vasco spoke with just a faint trace of irritation i know what im doing if you dont believe me let daniken try he knows what hes doing too no no im sorry lieutenant worried you know two things may have happened vasco said he may have had an accident thats the more serious and less likely happening whats more probable is that the onoff switch is in the off position samuelsons brow cleared slightly but only slightly if hes late why doesnt he call us does he know how to operate the radio samuelsons brow cleared even more quite honestly i dont know he looked up as an aproned maid approached him sorry sir she said i thought you might like to know that there is to be a government broadcast in two minutes less thank you thank you samuelson hurried round the bar gestured to agnelli to end the lecture and switched on the tv set within half a minute the announcer appeared on the screen a much younger one than previously but one who had clearly been trained in the same morticians school the government have three announcements to make the first is that the british government and stormont have agreed to withdraw all british troops to barracks as the troops arc scattered all over northern ireland this is expected to take several hours but the process is already under way although no statement to this effect has been made this is taken to be indicative of londons intentions samuelson beamed in satisfaction at that moment ylvisaker was the last thing in his mind the second is that the british foreign minister defence minister the chief of the imperial general staff and the first sea lord are en route to amsterdam in a vc to witness the detonation of this nuclear device in the markerwaard at pm the third is that the government have offered an amnesty to the two as yet unnamed prisoners whose release has been demanded by the fff we will of course be back on screen at pm well van effen said it looks like wholesale surrender matters are certainly proceeding quite satisfactorily samuelson said modestly we will each take a minimum of luggage with us this can be concealed in the rear of the helicopter soldiers on active duty do not carry suitcases around with them lunch will be at twelvethirty so we have about two and a half hours to wait till then i do not think it would be a good idea to indulge in any more jonge jenevers so i suggest we rest although we are not returning tonight we have quarters prepared for you to which you will be shown tell me lieutenant do you intend to have a snooze no then perhaps you would be kind enough to come down say every twenty minutes and try to contact ylvisaker if you think its worth trying certainly ill go upstairs have a wash pack what little equipment i have to pack and be down in twenty minutes after that i might as well stay down vasco smiled no furtive trips to the bar i promise you the room to which van effen and his companions were shown was almost a duplicate of the one they had left in the other windmill vasco carried out his usual meticulous search and pronounced the room clear van effen said samuelson is rather concerned about the nonarrival of ylvisaker and his friends who i think we may take it are at present being detained at her majestys pleasure more importantly samuelson seems to think that its all over bar the shouting the possibility of failure doesnt now exist for him thats a very dangerous state of mind to be in dangerous for him i mean george said and what do you think hell do when he gets to the dam take it over i cant see that giving him any trouble then hell tell the government that he has done just that coming so soon after the nuclear explosion in the markerwaard it should have a devastating effect on the government who will all too clearly appreciate the implications and realize that the fff has the nation by the throat and then vasco said they blow a few bits of concrete off the dam just to show they mean business nothing like that van effen said nothing so crude the explosives are agnellis idea apart from being a firstclass organizer agnelli is a very prudent fellow i believe that the explosives are for backup purposes only just in case something should go wrong what i do believe is that obrien knows as much about the controls of the hydraulic gates as the man who designed them they just open the sluices and if the authorities cut off the power from the mainland if you can call it that vasco said then perhaps the explosives there have to be standby generators obrien will have checked on that as far as the safety of the country is concerned the sluice gates of the haringvliet are the most vital installations in the country imagine the sluice gates being open at low tide and a major power failure occurs they simply cannot afford to rely on a single source of power for the moment however and much more importantly samuelson and agnelli have been kind enough to provide us with a detailed outline of their plans george rubbed his hands and now we make our own plans now we make our own plans some forty minutes after vasco had gone down to the living room he was joined by samuelson vasco sitting on the radio chair and idly leafing through a magazine looked up at his entrance any luck lieutenant none ive called four times every ten minutes not twenty as you asked nothing good god good god unmindful of his own admonitions samuelson went behind the bar and brought back two jonge jenevers ylvisaker is wildly overdue what on earth can have happened to him ive been thinking mr samuelson he hasnt blown himself to pieces or the news would be all over the country by now lets assume hes had an accident or had a breakdown lets further assume he doesnt know how to operate the radio what would you have done sir gone to the nearest phone and informed us its difficult to move far in any direction in this country without coming across a house with a phone or a public call box exactly does ylvisaker know the telephone number of this place samuelson stared at him then said ylvisaker has never been here wait he hurried from the room and returned within a minute his face grim the consensus of opinion is that ylvisaker does not know this number but you know the precise route he was taking of course two men a fast car bound to intercept thank you lieutenant im glad to see that there are some minds still working around these parts shall i keep on trying mr samuelson its a faint chance isnt it vasco shrugged very faint but nothing else for me to do thank you samuelson brought him another jonge jenever another trifle like this is not going to hurt a mind as clear as yours that is kind i think ill have it on the veranda if i may it is a bit overheated in here of course of course samuelson hurried from the room the car was a tancoloured bmw with antwerp number plates vasco watched the car and its two occupants disappear round a comer finished his drink in a thoughtful manner then returned inside he went to the radio switched waveband and wavelength and said softly in flemish record he spoke for no more than twelve seconds then switched back to the previous waveband and length he tried again for ylvisaker and was answered by the some silence he refreshed his drink at the bar resumed his radio chair glanced through a magazine and again called the missing truck with the same lack of response he tried twice more in the next twenty minutes with the same lack of response he was still trying to make contact when samuelson returned he looked at vasco went behind the bar and returned with two more drinks breaking my own rules i know but youve earned it and i feel the need for it nothing dead i know mr danilov makes a point of being incurious about everything but im a serving army officer just how important are those nuclear devices to you almost entirely psychological if necessary i would have used them to blow off both the northern and southern approaches to the haringvliet dam whatever for no senior military commander in the netherlands would dream of attacking the haringvliet dam bombers never fighter planes never not only is your gunship more than a match for any fighter not only do you have groundtoair missiles you will have a large number of hostages whose lives they would never imperil destroyer torpedo boats ground toground missiles are heatseeking theyre lethal not bombers what would happen if they breached the haringvliet darn of course well no point in trying any longer perhaps we should both have a brief rest before lunch vasco gave van effen and george a brief resume of what had happened van effen said so youve convinced samuelson of his total invulnerability and ensured that we will have two fewer hard men to cope with abroad the dam whom did you notify rotterdam police i think george that we may make a policeman of him yet well another hour or so before lunch snooze for me vasco said four jonge jenevers in succession are too much for my delicate constitution what did you say dutch hospitality you know what its like lunch was more than adequate but less than convivial samuelson tried to maintain a cheerful facade but he was deeply worried about the fate of his nuclear devices and his worry was palpable with the result that the last half hour of the meal was consumed in almost total silence over coffee samuelson said to van effen do you think it possible that ylvisaker and his men could have been seized by the authorities army or police i unlikely i dont see how they could have been your is total even if they had been the question is would ylvisaker his men have talked about the haringvliet dam no until we got here today only riordan agnelli daniken and obrien were privy to the plans samuelson smiled faintly your famous needtoknow maxim mr danilov one does not want to sound cynical or callous but what the hell are you worrying about then as you can see the tv announcer said the weather is as atrocious as ever with correspondingly poor visibility such as one would expect as dusk approaches the rain is extremely heavy and the wind between force eight and nine has backed to the northwest we have four cameras in position one near hoorn and one near volendam on the west side of the markerwaard and one on the opposite shore near helystad this one im afraid is virtually useless in spite of its lens hood the rain is driving straight into the lens we have a fourth camera in a helicopter and we understand they are having a very rough time indeed the time is our first shots will be taken from the helicopter a whitecapped stormtossed sea appeared on the screen detail was blurred and shifting because the helicopter was being it was clear severely buffeted about hence making it impossible to maintain a steady camera direction another voice took over from the studio announcer helicopter camera here i can assure you that my friend in the studio was not exaggerating the conditions are abominable and i have to confess that the only person who is not sick is most fortunately the pilot we are flying at seven hundred metres give or take fifty metres every time this damn machine is going up or down which we hope is a safe height if the nuclear explosion and its accompanying water spout should occur which god forbid directly beneath us it is now precisely pm and his voice rose almost by an octave there goes there it goes me and my big mouth it is directly beneath us the camera lens had been extended to maximum zoom the surface of the markerwaard boiled whitely and erupted a great column of water climbing vertically skywards toward s the helicopters camera would you look at that the excited voice went on would you just look at that it seemed rather a superfluous question as unquestionably almost every eye in the netherlands was looking at nothing else and the air is full of spray our pilot is moving as quickly as possible to the northwest we want to get out of this area as quickly as possible we are making poor time in this northwest gale but he is clearly hoping that that same gale will blow the spout and spray away from us so do van effen looked at samuelson he appeared to have gone into some kind of trance the only sign of movement came from his hands his fingers were interlocked but his thumbs were revolving slowly around each other the studio announcer appeared i am afraid the helicopters lenses are clouded by that spray we regret that none of the other three cameras are in visual contact the detonation appears to have occurred almost exactly in the centre of the markerwaard the helicopter commentators voice came again sorry about that what with the spray and rain we are at the moment quite blind we are still moving steadily northwest wait a minute wait a minute we have eyes again the spout was collapsing on itself the camera zoom half retracted was only momentarily on the spout then began panning the surrounding area a circle of water could be seen moving steadily outwards from the centre that the commentator said must be the expected tidal wave doesnt look much like a wave to me but then from this altitude it is impossible to gauge the height of the water the picture faded to be replaced by the studio announcer we are trying to wait wait we have volkendam a camera at full zoom showed a swell of water little more than a ripple it seemed rapidly approaching the shoreline a commentator said i agree with my colleague in the helicopter this is hardly my idea of a tidal wave however i understand those tsunami tend to increase in height as the water shallows we shall see there wasnt in fact much to sec with the wave less than a hundred metres from land the commentator estimated its height as just under a metre which was pretty much in accordance with the scientists predictions samuelson gestured for the set to be switched off a few wet feet no more he said and not a life lost an impressive performance wouldnt you say mr danilov most impressive true probably not a life had been lost not that day but the years to come might well record a different story the radioactive fallout would have fallen or would be falling over the already floodbeleaguered flevolands but it hardly seemed an appropriate moment to point this out to samuelson samuelson said romero radio the message to the haringvliet dam emphasize the need for absolute radio silence where the devil are those two who went in search of ylvisaker and his friendsnobody knew where the devil they were five good men lost to me five its annoying mr samuelson vasco said and worrisome but it can have no effect on the outcome we have seventeen men with the element of total surprise in our favour i could guarantee to take the haringvliet with only four men samualson smiled thats a comfort we leave in twenty minutes they left in twenty minutes all the soldiers were armed all carried either rucksacks or satchels neither van effen nor george were armed at least not visibly but they too carried satchels both crammed with gas grenades in addition van effen had taken the precaution of taking his yves saint laurent aerosol as they climbed aboard the gunship van effen said to samuelson gas not guns gas not guns twelve the gunship touched down on the haringvliet darn roadway at pm romero agnelli dressed as a major and in nominal command of the party was the first down the steps a fairhaired youngish man with hornrims detached himself from a small group of observers hurried forward to greet agnelli and shook him warmly by the hand damned glad to see you major damned glad have you seen what those devils have just done in the markerwaard that we have agnelli said sombrely that we have how seriously do you take this threat to the haringvliet well agnelli said reasonably theres no threat now quite frankly i dont take it seriously at all but as soldiers ours is not to reason why quite frankly again the country is in a state of near panic and ninetynine per cent of all intelligence reports and agitated phone calls we receive turn out to be groundless this i say may be the hundredth although as i say i dont believe it he took the mans arm and led him a few steps from the helicopter as soldiers followed down the steps and others opened the loading doors may i have your name sir borodin max borodin manager what on earth are those things they are unloading missiles and their launching platforms well have one facing the north sea the other the river groundtoground missiles and groundtoair missiles heatseeking lethal agnelli did not add that they could be swivelled on their platforms to cover both road approaches to the haringvliet dam totally superfluous precaution the fff are a mad lot but not mad enough to launch a frontal attack on the haringvliet dam we expect a destroyer and patrol boats to be standing by shortly again quite unnecessary unnecessary or not youve taken a great load off my mind who are those two rather portly and harmlesslooking civilians portly they may be harmless they are not senior police officers from amsterdam very much specialists in a very specialist antiterrorist squad theyll be wanting to look for any weak spots in your defences pure formality but they insist we shall leave two soldiers by the missiles to keep watch inspector danilov thats the less portly one also insists that my men accompany us he wants understandably that they should familiarise themselves with the general layout of the interior of the dam twenty minutes it was and a very surprising twenty minutes it turned out to be for mr borodin not least when four blueoveralled mechanics produced kalashnikov machine guns which had been assembled from their tool bags it was a completely painless physically that is but not mentally for many of those concerned and bloodless operation borodin his staff and his guards had simply no chance they all finished up in one of the many giant cellars in which the darn abounded agnelli was about to turn the key in the lock when van effen stopped him no rope tie them come come mr agnelli youre the man who never overlooks anything ive overlooked something youve overlooked the fact that obrien may not be the only man in the world who can pick any lock in the world agnelli nodded of course rope rope was fetched enough to secure a hundred men when borodin and his men had been bound hand and foot samuelson looking every inch the successful roman general back from gaul and making his ritual entry of triumph into the city of rome led them all up to the control room van effen and his two friends lingered some way behind while van effen opened a small tin and brought out six sodden balls of cottonwool these they stuffed into their nostrils vasco winced what the hell is this sulphuric acid youll get used to it van effen said and what was this rigmarole about people being able to pick locks its a million to one against there being another obrien down there were going to need rope lots of it theres a couple of hundred yards of it down there vasco looked at george the man thinks of everything he shook his head agnelli is not the only one who overlooks things they entered the control room it was wide and very spacious with serried ranks of control panels lining the righthand wall and paralleling tables obrien was in the vicinity of them but not examining them van effen knew he didnt have to ah samuelson said the very man lieutenant i want to talk to wieringa the minister of defence vasco showed no surprise merely thought for a few seconds the defence minister will be out at volkendam i imagine doesnt matter where he is no problem wherever he is office car or plane hes never more than an arms length from a telephone it call the war office and theyll patch him in how long will it take a minute less a minute in the netherlands vasco said with a trace of loftiness the army has overriding priority in less than the specified time he handed the phone to samuelson who took it his eyes the eyes of a man whose dreams have come true or a madman whose dreams have come true mr wieringa this is the leader of the fff the fighters for freedom i trust you appreciated our little demonstration in the markerwaard this afternoon i have some more rather unwelcome news for you we have taken over the haringvliet dam i repeat we are in complete control of the haringvljet there ensued quite a lengthy pause at least on samuelsons part before he continued i am glad mr wieringa that you appreciate the significance of this any attempt to retake the haringvliet by force or by stealth will have disastrous effects on holland i mht also add that we have mined the dykes at hollandsch diep and the volkeral we have observers there any attempts to send divers to investigate will compel us to radiodetonate those mines at pm we will be giving a slight demonstration of what awaits your country if our demands are not met immediately by opening a few sluice gates for a few minutes you might find it instructive to have a helicopter around to take a few pictures so that the people of the netherlands may understand what lies in store for them i do hope you speed up negotiations with the british government that was quite a performance mr samuelson van effen said you really do have those two dykes mined samuelson laughed of course not why should that pusillanimous lot now take our every word for gospel van effen and his two friends drifted unobtrusively into the space between the table and wall controls and opened their satchels while samuelson and his men talked excitedly and congratulated themselves in the space of just over two seconds ten gas grenades fairly evenly spaced around the room exploded the effects were spectacular within a few seconds everyone was staggering about and most were unconscious before they crumpled to the floor van effen snatched a key from agnellis pocket and the three men hastily left the room closing the door behind them their noses were protected but they could hold their breath for only so long five minutes and well be able to go back in therevan effen said theyll be asleep for half an hour at least he handed vasco the key the ropes cut borodin free and tell him to do the same for the others explain vasco entered the cellar and cut an astonished borodin free then handed him the knife cut the others free were police officers genuine ones the one with the scarred face is lieutenant van effen of the amsterdam police van effen borodin was understandably dazed ive seen his picture mats not him i know his face use your head so does nearly every criminal in holland but the fff are having a short nap vasco gathered up the spare ropes and left at a run van effen approached the man on the seaside missile site mr samuelson wants you quickly control room ill keep watch the man was just disappearing from sight when van effen crossed to the other man on the river missile site his hand round the burgundy yves saintlaurent aerosol with the special fragrance he lowered the man to the roadway and headed for the helicopter the man from the first missile site that van effen had visited stopped when he saw george who waved him on encouragingly as the man passed george chopped him on the back of the neck for george it was just a little chop but the man had he retained consciousness would probably have regarded it in a different light george lowered him gently to the floor van effen pulled back the curtain and said ah there you are joop keeping a good watch i see joops good watch lasted for all of another two seconds before he slumped to the floor van effen produced his smith and wesson waved it in the general direction of kathleen and maria and sliced annemaries and julies bonds free he raised both girls to their feet helped them free their gags and gun still in hand put his arms round their shoulders my beloved sister and my dear dear annemarie the eyes of kathleen and maria were as round as the proverbial saucers you took your time about it didnt you julie said there were tears in her eyes gratitude was ever thus van effen sighed there were problems its over annemarie whispered its all over all over i love you ill have you repeat that when you are in a more normal state of mind the two seated girls were still staring at them kathleen said your brother her voice was husky her voice disbelieving my brother julie said peter van effen senior detective lieutenant of the amsterdam police force its a nasty shock i will admit van effen said there may be an even nastier one awaiting you there are those whom you might like to see or who might like to see you when they wake up that is all of the fff were still sound asleep bound hand and foot or in the process of being so bound not bad not bad van effen said and what else have you been doing with your time would you listen to him vasco said he tightened with unmistakable enthusiasm the last knot on the rope binding samuelsons legs to start with half the police cars and vans in rotterdam and dordrecht should be on the dam inside fifteen minutes i thought that up all by myself a promising officer as i said van effen turned to kathleen who was staring at her father her face ashen with shock and fear why kathleen instead of replying she reached inside her handbag and brought out a small pearlhanded gun youre not going to take mr samuelson you didnt know he was my father yes kathleen i did you did her voice faltered how did you know julie told me julie stepped between the gun and van effen youll have to shoot me first wont you kathleen im not being brave because i know you could never do it vasco moved quietly forward removed the gun from the suddenly nerveless hand and replaced it in her handbag van effen said again why kathleen i suppose it will all come out wont it she was crying openly now vasco put an arm around her trembling shoulders and instead of resisting she seemed to lean against him my father is english he was a lieutenantcolonel in the guards not under that name his father was an earl who left him a fortune his sons my brothers went to sandhurst both were killed in northern ireland one a lieutenant the other a second lieutenant my mother was killed by a renegade offshoot of the ira hes never been the same man since i guessed as much he may be tried in this country or be extradited by the british van effen sounded as tired as he undoubtedly felt in either case diminished responsibility will apply you mean hes mad she whispered im no doctor some kind of temporary derangement i should imagine tell me maria had either romero or leonardo anything to do with the murder of my wife and children no no no i swear it they wouldnt hurt a fly my two other brothers in prison i know they arranged it they are hateful evil men i will testify to that in court i promise that could mean another five or ten years to their sentence i hope they remain there till they die no charges will be brought against you and kathleen accessories are one thing accessories under duress another vasco be so kind as to release that young lady and put a call through to uncle arthur tell him all george take those four ladies out for a restorative theres bound to be a suitable supply in their mess or canteen or whatever if not the helicopter is not exactly bereft beware of suicide attempts julie said i dont think that anyone is going to commit suicide your feminine intuition i suppose well i agree and george you could bring something back here i feel very weak george smiled and ushered the four girls from the control room vasco was two minutes on the telephone then turned to van effen his hand over the mouthpiece i believe uncle arthur would like a word with you may i ah join the ladies by all means van effen picked up the phone as he heard the first sound of screaming police sirens colonel de graaf s congratulations were fulsome in the extreme so were those of vieringa who eventually handed him back to de graaf van effen said i am colonel de graaf becoming tired of being the handmaiden who does all the dirty washing for you i want a new job increased salary or both you shall have both my boy an increased salary is inevitably what goes with my job he coughed six months say a year the end
