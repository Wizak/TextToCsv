 five go off to camp enid blyton contents holiday time up on the moors annes volcano spooktrains back at camp again day at the farm mr andrews comes home a lazy evening night visitor hunt for a spooktrain mostly about jock george loses her temper a thrilling plan jock comes to camp george has an adventure in the tunnel again an amazing find a way of escape what an adventure holiday time two jolly fine tents four groundsheets four sleepingbags i say what about timmy isnt he going to have a sleepingbag too said dick with a grin the other three children laughed and timmy the dog thumped his tail hard on the ground look at him said george hes laughing too hes got his mouth stretched wide open they all looked at timmy he really did look as if a wide grin stretched his hairy mouth from side to side hes a darling said anne hugging him best dog in the world arent you timmy woof said timmy agreeing he gave anne a wet lick on her nose the four children julian tall and strong for his age dick george and anne were busy planning a camping holiday george was a girl not a boy but she would never answer to her real name georgina with her freckled face and short curly hair she really did look more like a boy than a girl its absolutely wizard being allowed to go on a camping holiday all by ourselves said dick i never thought our parents would allow it after the terrific adventure we had last summer when we went off in caravans well we shant be quite all by ourselves said anne dont forget weve got mr luffy to keep an eye on us hell be camping quite near pooh old luffy said dick with a laugh he wont know if were there or not so long as he can study his precious moorland insects he wont bother about us well if it hadnt been that he was going to camp too we wouldnt have been allowed to go said anne i heard daddy say so mr luffy was a master at the boys school an elderly dreamy fellow with a passion for studying all kinds of insectlife anne avoided him when he carried about boxes of insect specimens because sometimes they escaped and came crawling out the boys liked him and thought him fun but the idea of mr luffy keeping an eye on them struck them as very comical its more likely well have to keep an eye on him said julian hes the sort of chap whose tent will always be falling down on top of him or hell run out of water or sit down on his bag of eggs old luffy seems to live in the world of insects not in our world seems to live in the world of insects not in our world well he can go and live in the world of insects if he likes so long as he doesnt interfere with us said george who hated interfering people this sounds as if it will be a super holiday living in tents on the high moors away from everybody doing exactly what we like when we like and how we like woof said timmy thumping his tail again that means hes going to do as he likes too said anne youre going to chase hundreds of rabbits arent you timmy and bark madly at anyone who dares to come within two miles of us now be quiet a minute anne said dick picking up his list again we really must check down our list and find out if weve got every single thing we want where did i get to oh four sleepingbags yes and you wanted to know if timmy was to have one said anne with a giggle of course he wont said george hell sleep where he always does wont you timmy on my feet couldnt we get him just a small sleepingbag asked anne hed look sweet with his head poking out of the top timmy hates looking sweet said george go on dick ill tie my hanky round annes mouth if she interrupts again dick went on down his list it was a very interesting one things like cookingstoves canvas buckets enamel plates and drinkingcups were on it and each item seemed to need a lot of discussion the four children enjoyed themselves very much you know its almost as much fun planning a holiday like this as having it said dick well i shouldnt think weve forgotten a thing have we no weve probably thought of too much said julian well old luffy says hell take all our things on the trailer behind his car so well be all right i shouldnt like to carry them ourselves oh i wish next week would come said anne why is it that the time seems so long when youre waiting for something nice to happen and so short when something nice is happening yes it seems the wrong way round doesnt it said dick with a grin anyone got the map id like to take another squint at the spot where were going julian produced a map from his pocket he opened it and the four children sprawled round it the map showed a vast and lonely stretch of moorland with very few houses indeed just a few small farms thats all said julian pointing to one or two they cant get much of a living out of such poor land though see thats about the place where were going just there and on the opposite slope is a small farm where we shall get milk eggs and butter when we need them luffys been there before he says its a rather small farm but jolly useful to campers these moors are awfully high arent they said george i guess theyll be freezing cold in the winter they are said julian and they may be jolly windy and cold in the summer too so luffy says wed better take sweaters and things he says in the winter they are covered with snow for months the sheep have to be dug out when they get lost dicks finger followed a small winding road that made its way over the wild stretch of moorland thats the road we go he said and i suppose we strike off here look where a carttrack is shown that would go to the farm we shall have to carry our stuff from wherever luffy parks his car and take it to our campingplace not too near luffy i hope said george oh no hes agreed to keep an eye on us but hell forget all about us once hes settled down in his own tent said julian he will really two chaps i know once went out in his car with him for a days run and he came back without them in the evening hed forgotten he had them with him and had left them wandering somewhere miles and miles away good old luffy said dick thats the sort of fellow we want he wont come springing up to ask if weve cleaned our teeth or if weve got our warm jerseys on the others laughed and timmy stretched his doggy mouth into a grin again his tongue hung out happily it was good to have all four of his friends with him again and to hear them planning a holiday timmy went to school with george and anne in term time and he missed the two boys very much but he belonged to george and would not dream of leaving her it was a good thing that georges school allowed pets or george would certainly not have gone julian folded up the map again i hope all the things weve ordered will come in good time he said weve got about six days to wait id better keep on reminding luffy that were going with him or hes quite likely to start without us it was difficult to have to wait so long now that everything was planned parcels came from various stores and were eagerly opened the sleepingbags were fine super said anne smashing said george crawling into hers look i can lace it up at the neck and its got a hood thing to come right over my head golly its warm i shant mind the coldest night if im sleeping in this i vote we sleep in them tonight what in our bedrooms said anne yes why not just to get used to them said george who felt that a sleepingbag was a hundred times better than an ordinary bed so that night all four slept on the floor of their bedrooms in their sleepingbags and voted them very comfortable and as warm as toast the only thing is timmy kept wanting to come right inside mine said george and honestly there isnt enough room besides hed be cooked well he seemed to spend half the night on my tummy grumbled julian i shall jolly well keep the bedroom door shut if timmys going to spend the night flopping on everyones bag in turn i dont mind the flopping so much as the frightful habit hes got of turning himself round and round and round before he flops down complained dick he did that on me last night silly habit of his he cant help it said george at once its a habit that wild dogs had centuries and centuries ago they slept in reeds and rushes and they got into the way of turning themselves round and round in them to trample them down and make themselves a good sleepingplace and our dogs go on turning themselves round now before they go to sleep even though there arent any rushes to trample down well i wish timmy would forget his doggy ancestors were wild dogs with rushy beds and just remember hes a nice tame dog with a basket of his own said dick you should see my tummy today its all printed over with his footmarks fibber said anne you do exaggerate dick oh i do wish tuesday would come im tired of waiting itll come all right said julian and so it did of course it dawned bright and sunny with a sky that was a deep blue flecked with tiny white clouds goodweather clouds said julian pleased now lets hope old luffy has remembered its today were starting off hes due here at ten oclock were taking sandwiches for the whole party mother thought wed better in case luffy forgot his if hes remembered them it wont matter because were sure to be able to eat them ourselves and theres always timmy to finish things up timmy was as excited as the four children he always knew when something nice was going to happen his tail was on the wag the whole time his tongue hung out and he panted as if he had been running a race he kept getting under everyones feet but nobody minded mr luffy arrived half an hour late just when everyone was beginning to feel he had forgotten to come he was at the wheel of his big old car beaming all the children knew him quite well because he lived not far away and often came to play bridge with their father and mother hallo hallo he cried all ready i see good for you pile the things on the trailer will you mine are there too but theres plenty of room ive got sandwiches for everyone by the way my wife said id better bring plenty well have a fine feast today then said dick helping julian to carry out the foldedup tents and sleepingbags while the girls followed with the smaller things soon everything was on the trailer and julian made them safe with ropes they said goodbye to the watching grownups and climbed excitedly into the car mr luffy started up his engine and put the lever into first gear with a frightful noise goodbye called all the grownups and julians mother added a last word dont get into any awful adventure this time of course they wont called back mr luffy cheerfully ill see to that there are no adventures to be found on a wild and deserted moor goodbye off they went waving madly and shouting goodbye all the way down the road goodbye goodbyeeeeee hurrah were off at last the car raced down the road the trailer bumping madly after it the holiday had begun up on the moors mr luffy was not a good driver he went too fast especially round the corners and many times julian looked behind at the trailer in alarm afraid that everything would suddenly leap off it at some sharp bend he saw the bundle of sleepingbags jump high into the air but fortunately they remained on the trailer he touched mr luffy on the shoulder sir could you go a bit slower please the trailer will be empty by the time we arrive if the luggage leaps about on it much more my word i forgot we had a trailer said mr luffy slowing down at once remind me if i go over thirtyfive miles an hour will you last time i took the trailer with me i arrived with only half the goods on it i dont want that to happen again julian certainly hoped it wouldnt he kept a sharp eye on the speedometer and when it veered towards forty he tapped mr luffy on the arm mr luffy looked supremely happy he didnt like term time but he loved holidays term time interfered with the study of his beloved insectworld now he was off with four nice children he liked for a holiday on a moorland he knew was alive with bees beetles butterflies and every other kind of insect he wanted he looked forward to teaching the four children quite a lot they would have been horrified if they guessed this but they didnt he was an oddlooking fellow he had very untidy shaggy eyebrows over kind and gentle brown eyes that always reminded dick of a monkeys he had a rather large nose which looked fiercer than it was because unexpectedly it had quite a forest of hairs growing out of the nostrils he had an untidy moustache and a round chin with a surprising dimple in the middle of it his ears always fascinated anne they were large and turned rather forward and mr luffy could waggle the right one if he wanted to to his great sorrow he had never been able to waggle the left one his hair was thick and untidy and his clothes always looked loose comfortable and rather too big for him the children liked him they couldnt help it he was so odd and gentle and untidy and forgetful and yet sometimes unexpectedly fierce julian had often told them the story of tom killin the bully mr luffy had once found tom bullying a small new boy in the cloakroom dragging him round and round it by his belt with a roar like an angry bullr mr luffy had pounced on the big bully got him by the belt lifted him up and stuck him firmly on a peg in the cloakroom there you stay till you get someone to lift you down mr luffy had thundered can get hold of a belt too as you can see and then he had stalked out of the cloakroom with the small terrified boy beside him leaving the bully hung up high on the peg quite unable to free himself and there he had to stay because not one of the boys who came pouring in from a game of football would lift him down and if the peg hadnt given way under his weight hed be stuck up there still julian had said with a grin good old luffy youd never think he could be fierce like that would you anne loved that story mr luffy became quite a hero to her after that she was pleased to sit next to him in the car and chatter about all kinds of things the other three were squashed at the back with timmy on their feet george firmly prevented him from climbing up on her knee because it was so hot so he contented himself with trying to stand up with his paws on the windowledge and his nose over the side they stopped about half past twelve for lunch mr luffy had indeed provided sandwiches for everyone and remarkably fine ones they were too made the evening before by mrs luffy cucumber dipped in vinegar ham and lettuce egg sardine oooh mr luffy your sandwiches are much nicer than ours said anne beginning on two together one cucumber and the other ham and lettuce they were all very hungry timmy had a bit from everyone usually the last bite and watched each sandwich eagerly till his turn came mr luffy didnt seem to understand that timmy had to have the last bite of any sandwich so timmy simply took it out of his hand much to his surprise a clever dog he said and patted him knows what he wants and takes it very clever that pleased george of course she thought that timmy was the cleverest dog in the world and indeed it did seem like it at times he understood every word she said to him every pat every stroke every gesture he would be much much better at keeping an eye on the four children and guarding them than forgetful mr luffy they drank ginger beer and then ate some ripe plums timmy wouldnt have any plums but he licked up some spilt ginger beer then he snuffed up a few odd crumbs and went to drink at a little stream nearby the party set off again in the car anne fell asleep dick gave an enormous yawn and fell asleep too george wasnt sleepy nor was timmy but julian was he didnt dare to take his eye off the speedometer though because mr luffy seemed to be very much inclined to speed along too fast again after his good lunch we wont stop for tea till we get there said mr luffy suddenly and dick woke up with a jump at the sound of his booming voice we should be there about half past five look you can see the moorland in the distance now all ablaze with heather everybody looked ahead except anne who was still fast asleep rising up to the left for miles upon miles was the heathercovered moorland a lovely sight to see it looked wild and lonely and beautiful blazing with heather and shading off into a purpleblue in the distance we take this road to the left and then were on the moors said mr luffy swinging violently to the left and making the luggage in the trailer jump high again here we go the car climbed the high moorland road steadily it passed one or two small houses and in the distance the children could see little farms in clearings sheep dotted the moorland and some of them stood staring at the car as it drove by weve got about twenty miles to go i should think said mr luffy jamming on his brakes suddenly to avoid two large sheep in the middle of the road i wish these creatures wouldnt choose the centre of the road to gossip in hi get on there let me pass timmy yelped and tried to get out of the car the sheep hurriedly decided to move and the car went on anne was thoroughly awake by now having been almost jerked out of her seat by the sudden stop what a shame to wake you said mr luffy gazing down at her kindly and almost running into a ditch by the side of the road were nearly there anne they climbed steadily and the wind grew a little cold all around the children the moors stretched for mile upon mile neverending little streams sometimes splashed right down to the roadway and ran beside it we can drink the water in these streams said mr luffy crystal clear and cold as ice theres one quite near where were going to camp that was good news julian thought of the big canvas buckets they had brought he didnt particularly want to carry those for miles if there was a stream near their camping place it would be easy to get the buckets filled with washingwater the road forked into two to the right was a good road leading on and on to the left it became not much more than a carttrack thats the one we take said mr luffy and the car jerked and jolted over it he was forced to go slowly and the children had time to see every little thing they passed i shall leave the car here said mr luffy bringing it to a standstill beside a great rock that stood up bare and grey out of the moor it will be sheltered from the worst winds and rain i thought wed camp over yonder there was a little slope just there backed by some enormous gorse bushes thick heather grew everywhere julian nodded it was a good place for camp ing those thick gorse bushes would provide fine shelter from the winds right sir he said shall we have tea first or unpack now tea first said mr luffy ive brought a very good little stove for boiling and cooking things better than a wood fire that makes kettles and saucepans so black weve got a stove too said anne she scrambled out of the car and looked all round its lovely here all heather and wind and sun is that the farm over there the one we shall go to for eggs and things she pointed to a tiny farmhouse on the hill opposite it stood in a small clearing in a field behind it were three or four cows and a horse a small orchard stood at the side and a vegetable garden lay in front it seemed odd to see such a trim little place in the midst of the moorland thats ollys farm said mr luffy its changed hands i believe since i was here three years ago i hope the new people are nice now did we leave something to eat for our tea they had because anne had wisely put away a good many sandwiches and bits of cake for teatime they sat in the heather with bees humming all round them and munched solidly for fifteen minutes timmy waited patiently for his bits watching the bees that hummed round him there were thousands of them and now i suppose wed better put up our tents said julian come on dick lets unpack the trailer mr luffy we dont intend to camp on top of you sir because you wont want four noisy children too near where would you like your tent put mr luffy was about to say that he would like to have the four children and timmy quite close when it suddenly occurred to him that perhaps they might not want him too near they might want to make a noise or play silly games and if he were near it would stop them enjoying themselves in their own way so he made up his mind not to be too close til pitch my tent down there where that old gorse bush is he said and if youd like to put yours up here where theres a halfcircle of gorse bushes keeping off the wind youd be well sheltered and we shant interfere with one another at all right sir said julian and he and dick began to tackle the tents it was fun timmy got under everyones feet as usual and ran off with an important rope but nobody minded by the time that dusk came creeping up the heathercovered moorland all three tents were up the groundsheets were put down and the sleepingbags unrolled on them two in each of the childrens tents and one in mr luffys im going to turn in said mr luffy my eyes are almost shut good night all of you sleep well he disappeared into the dusk anne yawned widely and that set the others off too come on lets turn in too said julian well have a bar of chocolate each and a few biscuits we can eat those in our sleepingbags good night girls wont it be grand to wake up tomorrow morning he and dick disappeared into their tent the girls crawled into theirs with timmy they undressed and got into their warm soft sleepingbags this is super said george pushing timmy to one side i never felt so cosy in my life dont do that timmy dont you know the difference between my feet and my middle thats better good night said anne sleepily look george you can see the stars shining through the opening of the tent dont they look enormous but george didnt care whether they were enormous or not she was fast asleep tired out with the days run timmy cocked one ear when he heard annes voice and gave a little grunt that was his way of saying good night then he put his head down and slept our first night of camping thought anne happily i shant go to sleep i shall lie awake and look at the stars and smell that heathery smell but she didnt in half a second she was sound asleep too annes volcano julian awoke first in the morning he heard a strange and lonely sound floating overhead coorlie coorlie he sat up and wondered where he was and who was calling of course he was in his tent with dick they were camping on the moors and that wild cry overhead came from a curlew the bird of the moorlands he yawned and lay down again it was early in the morning the sun put its warm fingers in at his tent opening and he felt the warmth on his sleepingbag he felt lazy and snug and contented he also felt hungry which was a nuisance he glanced at his watch half past six he really was too warm and comfortable to get up yet he put out his hand to see if there was any chocolate left from the night before and found a little piece he put it into his mouth and lay there contentedly listening to more curlews and watching the sun climb a little higher he fell asleep again and was awakened by timmy busily licking his face he sat up with a start the girls were peering in at his tent grinning they were fully dressed already wake up lazy said anne we sent timmy in to get you up its half past seven weve been up for ages its a simply heavenly morning said george going to be a frightfully hot day do get up were going to find the stream and wash in it it seems silly to lug heavy buckets of water to and fro for washing if the streams nearby dick awoke too he and julian decided to go and take a bathe in the stream they wandered out into the sunny morning feeling very happy and very hungry the girls were just coming back from the stream its over there said anne pointing timmy go with them and show them its a lovely little brown stream awfully cold and its got ferns along its banks weve left the bucket there bring it back full will you what do you want us to do that for if youve already washed asked dick we want water for washingup the dishes said anne i suddenly remembered wed need water for that i say do you think we ought to wake up mr luffy theres no sign of him yet no let him sleep said julian hes probably tired out with driving the car so slowly we can easily save him some breakfast what are we going to have weve unpacked some bacon rashers and tomatoes said anne who loved cooking how do you light the stove julian george knows said julian i say did we pack a fryingpan yes i packed it myself said anne do go and bathe if youre going to breakfast will be ready before you are timmy gravely trotted off with the boys and showed them the stream julian and dick at once lay down in the clear brown bed and kicked wildly timmy leapt in too and there were yells and shrieks well i should think weve woken up old luffy now said dick rubbing himself down with a rough towel how lovely and cold that was the trouble is its made me feel twice as hungry doesnt that frying bacon smell good said julian sniffing the air they walked back to the girls there was still no sign of mr luffy he must indeed sleep very soundly they sat down in the heather and began their breakfast anne had fried big rounds of bread in the fat and the boys told her she was the best cook in the world she was very pleased i shall look after the food side for you she said but george muist help with the preparing of the meals and washingup see george george didnt see she hated doing all the things that anne loved to do such as making beds and washingup she looked sulky look at old george why bother about the washingup when theres timmy only too pleased to use his tongue to wash every plate said dick everyone laughed even george all right she said til help of course only lets use as few plates as possible then there wont be much washingup is there any more fried bread anne no but there are some biscuits in that tin said anne i say boys whos going to go to the farm each day for milk and things i expect they can let us have bread too and fruit oh one or other of us will go said dick anne hadnt you better fry something for old luffy now ill go and wake him half the day will be gone if he doesnt get up now til go and make a noise like an earwig outside his tent said julian getting up he might not wake with all our yells and shouts but hed certainly wake at the call of a friendly earwig he went down to the tent he cleared his throat and called politely are you awake yet sir there was no answer julian called again then puzzled he went to the tent opening the flap was closed he pulled it aside and looked in the tent was empty there was nobody there at all whats up ju called dick hes not here said julian where can he be there was silence for a panicstricken moment anne thought one of their strange adventures was beginning then dick called out again is his bugtin gone you know the tin box with straps that he takes with him when he goes insecthunting and what about his clothes julian inspected the inside of the tent again okay he called much to everyones relief his clothes are gone and so has his bugtin he must have slipped out early before we were awake i bet hes forgotten all about us and breakfast and everything that would be just like him said dick well were not his keepers he can do as he likes if he doesnt want breakfast he neednt have any hell come back when hes finished his hunting i suppose anne can you get on with the doings if dick and i go to the farmhouse and see what food theyve got asked julian the times getting on and if were going for a walk or anything today we dont want to start too late right said anne you go too george i can manage everything nicely now that the boys have brought me a bucketful of water take timmy he wants a walk george was only too pleased to get out of the washingup she and the boys with timmy trotting in front set off to the farmhouse anne got on with her jobs humming softly to herself in the sunshine she soon finished them and then looked to see if the others were coming back there was no sign of them or of mr luffy either til go for a walk on my own thought anne til follow that little stream uphill and see where it begins that would be fun i cant possibly lose my way if i keep by the water she set off in the sunshine and came to the little brown stream that gurgled down the hill she scrambled through the heather beside it following its course uphill she liked all the little green ferns and the cushions of velvety moss that edged it she tasted the water it was cold and sweet and clean feeling very happy all by herself anne walked on and on she came at last to a big mound of a hilltop the little stream began there halfway up the mound it came gurgling out of the heathery hillside edged with moss and made its chattering way far down the hill so thats where you begin is it said anne she flung herself down on the heather hot with her climb it was nice there with the sun on her face and the sound of the trickling water nearby she lay listening to the humming bees and the water and then she heard another sound she took no notice of it at all at first then she sat up frightened the noise is underground deep deep underground it rumbles and roars oh what is going to happen is there going to be an earthquake the rumbling seemed to come nearer and nearer anne didnt even dare to get up and run she sat there and trembled then there came an unearthly shriek and not far off a most astonishing thing happened a great cloud of white smoke came right out of the ground and hung in the air before the wind blew it away anne was simply horrified it was so sudden so very unexpected on this quiet hillside the rumbling noise went on for a while and then gradually faded away anne leapt to her feet in a panic she fled down the hill screaming loudly its a volcano help help ive been sitting on a volcano its going to burst its sending out smoke help help its a volcano she tore down the hillside caught her foot on a tuft of heather and went rolling over and over sobbing she came to rest at last and then heard an anxious voice calling whos that whats the matter it was mr luffys voice anne screamed to him in relief mr luffy come and save me theres a volcano here there was such terror in her voice that mr luffy came racing to her at once he sat down beside the trembling girl and put his arm round her whatevers the matter he said whats frightened you anne told him again up there do you see thats a volcano mr luffy it trembled and rumbled and then it shot up clouds of smoke oh quick before it sends out red hot cinders now now said mr luffy and to annes surprise and relief he actually laughed do you mean to tell me you dont know what that was no i dont said anne well said mr luffy under this big moor run two or three long tunnels to take trains from one valley to another didnt you know they make the rumbling noise you heard and the sudden smoke you saw was the smoke sent up by a train below there are big ventholes here and there in the moor for the smoke to escape from oh good gracious me said anne going rather red i didnt even know there were trains under here what an extraordinary thing i really did think i was sitting on a volcano mr luffy you wont tell the others will you they would laugh at me dreadfully i wont say a word said mr luffy and now i think well go back have you had breakfast im terribly hungry i went out early after a rather rare butterfly i saw flying by my tent weve had breakfast ages ago said anne but if you like to come back with me now ill cook you some bacon mr luffy and some tomatoes and fried bread aha it sounds good said mr luffy now not a word about volcanoes thats our secret and off they went to the tents where the others were wondering what in the world had become of anne little did they know she had been sitting on a volcano spooktrains the boys and george were full of talk about the farm its a nice little place said julian sitting down while anne began to cook breakfast for mr luffy pretty farmhouse nice little dairy wellkept sheds and even a grand piano in the drawingroom gracious you wouldnt think theyd make enough money to buy a thing like that would you said anne turning over the bacon in the pan the farmers got a fine car went on julian brand new must have cost him a pretty penny his boy showed it to us and he showed us some jolly good new farm machinery too very interesting said mr luffy i wonder how they make their money farming that bit of land the last people were hardworking folk but they certainly couldnt have afforded a new car or a grand piano and you should have seen the lorries theyve got said dick beauties old army ones i should think the boy said his fathers going to use them for carting things from the farm to the market what things said mr luffy looking across at the little farmhouse i shouldnt have thought they needed an army of lorries for that an old farm wagon would carry all their produce well thats what he told us said dick everything certainly looked very prosperous i must say he must be a jolly good farmer we got eggs and butter and fruit and even some bacon said george the boys mother didnt seem worried about how much we had and she hardly charged us anything we didnt see the farmer mr luffy was now eating his breakfast he was certainly very hungry he brushed away the flies that hung round his head and when one settled on his right ear he waggled it violently the fly flew off in surprise oh do that again begged anne how do you do it do you think if i practised hard for weeks i could make my ear move no i dont think so said mr luffy finishing his breakfast well ive got some writing to do now what are you going to do go for a walk we might as well take a picnic lunch and go off somewhere said julian how about it yes said dick can you pack us dinner and tea anne well help what about hardboiled eggs it wasnt long before they had a picnic meal packed in greaseproof paper you wont get lost will you said mr luffy oh no sir said julian with a laugh ive got a compass anyway and a jolly good bump of locality too i usually know the way to go well see you this evening when we get back you wont get lost mr luffy will you asked anne looking worried dont be cheeky anne said dick rather horrified at annes question but she really meant it mr luffy was so absentminded that she could quite well picture him wandering off and not being able to find his way back he smiled at her no he said i know my way about here all righti know every stream and path and ervolcano anne giggled the others stared at mr luffy wondering what in the world he meant but neither he nor anne told them they said goodbye and set off its heavenly walking today said anne shall we follow a path if we find one or not might as well said julian itll be a bit tiring scrambling through heather all the day so when they did unexpectedly come across a path they followed it its just a shepherds path i expect said dick i bet its a lonely job looking after sheep up on these desolate heathery hills they went on for some way enjoying the stretches of bright heather the lizards that darted quickly away from their feet and the hosts of butterflies of all kinds that hovered and fluttered anne loved the little blue ones best and made up her mind to ask mr luffy what all their names were they had their lunch on a hilltop overlooking a vast stretch of heather with greywhite blobs in it here and there the sheep that wandered everywhere and in the very middle of the meal anne heard the same rumbling she had heard before and then not far off out spouted some white smoke from the ground george went quite pale timmy leapt to his feet growling and barking his tail down the boys roared with laughter its all right anne and george its only the trains underground here we knew they ran under the moors and we thought wed see what you did when you first heard them rumbling and saw the smoke im not a bit frightened said anne and the boys looked at her astonished it was george who was the scared one usually it was quite the other way round george got back her colour and laughed she called timmy its all right tim come here you know what trains are dont you the children discussed the trains it really did seem strange to think of trains in those hollowedout tunnels down below the moors the people in them reading their newspapers and talking down in tunnels where the sun never shone at all come on said julian at last lets go on well walk to the top of the next slope and then i think we ought to turn back they found a little path that julian said must be a rabbitpath because it was so narrow and set off chattering and laughing they climbed through the heather to the top of the next slope and at the top they got quite a surprise down in the valley below was a silent and deserted stretch of railway lines they appeared out of the black hole of a tunnelmouth ran for about half a mile and then ended in what seemed to be a kind of railway yard look at that said julian old derelict lines not used any more i should think i suppose that tunnels out of date too lets go down and have a squint said dick come on weve got plenty of time and we can easily go back a shorter way they set off down the hill to the lines they arrived some way from the tunnelmouth and followed the lines to the deserted railway yard there seemed to be nobody about at all look said dick there are some old wagons on that set of lines over there they look as if they havent been used for a hundred years lets give them a shove and set them going oh no said anne afraid but the two boys and george who had always longed to play about with real railway trucks ran over to where three or four stood on the lines dick and julian shoved hard at one it moved it ran a little way and crashed into the buffers of another it made a terrific noise in the silent yard a door flew open in a tiny hut at the side of the yard and a terrifying figure came out it was a onelegged man with a wooden peg for his other leg two great arms that might quite well belong to a gorilla and a face as red as a tomato except where grey whiskers grew he opened his mouth and the children expected a loud and angry yell instead out came a husky hoarse whisper what you doing aint it bad enough to hear spooktrains arunning at night without hearing them in the daytime too the four children stared at him they thought he must be quite mad he came nearer to them and his wooden leg tiptapped oddly he swung his great arms loosely he peered at the children as if he could hardly see them ive broken me glasses he said and to their astonishment and dismay two tears ran down his cheeks poor old woodenleg sam hes broken his glasses nobody cares about woodenleg sam now nobody at all there didnt seem anything to say to all this anne felt sorry for the funny old man but she kept well behind julian sam peered at them again havent you got tongues in your heads am i seeing things again or are you there were here and were real said julian we happened to see this old railway yard and we came down to have a look at it who are you i told you im woodenleg sam said the old man impatiently the watchman see though what there is to watch here beats me do they think im going to watch for these spooktrains well im not not me sam woodenleg ive seen many strange things in my life yes and been scared by them too and im not watching for any more spooktrains the children listened curiously what spooktrains asked julian woodenleg sam came closer he looked all round as if he thought there might be someone listening and then spoke in a hoarser whisper than usual spooktrains i tell you trains that come out of that tunnel at night all by themselves and go back all by themselves nobody in them one night theyll come for old sam woodenlegbut see im smart i am i lock myself into my hut and get under the bed and i blow my candle out so those spooktrains dont know im there anne shivered she pulled at julians hand julian lets go i dont like it it sounds all peculiar and horrid what does he mean the old man seemed suddenly to change his mood he picked up a large cinder and threw it at dick hitting him on the head you clear out im watchman here and what did they tell me they told me to chase away anyone that came clear out i tell you in terror anne fled away timmy growled and would have leapt at the strange old watchman but george had her hand on his collar dick rubbed his head where the cinder had hit him were going he said soothingly to sam it was plain that the old fellow was a bit funny in the head we didnt mean to trespass you look after your spooktrains we wont interfere with you the boys and george turned away and caught up with anne what did he mean she asked scared what are spooktrains trains that arent real does he really see them at night he just imagines them said julian i expect being there all alone in that deserted old railway yard has made him think strange things dont worry anne there are no such things as spooktrains but he spoke as if there were said anne he really did id hate to see a spooktrain wouldnt you ju no id love to see one said julian and he turned to dick wouldnt you dick shall we come one night and watch just to see back at camp again the children and timmy left the deserted railway yard behind them and climbed up the heathery slope to find their way back to their campingplace the boys could not stop talking about woodenleg sam and the strange things he said its a funny business altogether said julian i wonder why that yard isnt used any more and where that tunnel leads to and if trains ever do run there i expect theres quite an ordinary explanation said dick its just that woodenleg sam made it all seem so weird if there had been a proper watchman we shouldnt have thought there was anything strange about it at all perhaps the boy at the farm would know said julian well ask him tomorrow im afraid there arent any spooktrains really but gosh id love to go and watch for one if there were any i wish you wouldnt talk like that said anne unhappily you know it makes me feel as if you want another adventure and i dont well there wont be any adventure so dont worry said dick comfortingly and anyway if there was an adventure you could always go and hold old luffys hand he wouldnt see an adventure if it was right under his nose youd be quite safe with him look whos that up there said george seeing timmy prick up his ears and then hearing him give a little growl shepherd or something i should think said julian he shouted out cheerfully good afternoon nice day its been the old man on the path just above them nodded his head he was either a shepherd or farm labourer of some sort he waited for them to come up have you seen any of my sheep down along there he asked them theyve got red crosses on them no there arent any down there said julian but there are some further along the hill weve been down to the railway yard and wed have seen any sheep on the slope below dont you go down there said the old shepherd his faded blue eyes looking into julians thats a bad place that is well weve been hearing about spooktrains said julian with a laugh is that what you mean ay therere trains that nobody knows of running out of that tunnel said the shepherd manys the time ive heard them when ive been up here at night with my sheep that tunnel hasnt been used for thirty years but the trains they still come out of it just as they used to how do you know have you seen them asked julian a cold shiver creeping down his spine quite suddenly no ive only heard them said the old man choo choo they go and they jangle and clank but they dont whistle any more old woodenleg sam reckons theyre spooktrains with nobody to drive them and nobody to tend them dont you go down to that place its bad and scary julian caught sight of annes scared face he laughed loudly what a tale i dont believe in spooktrains and neither do you shepherd dick have you got the tea in your bag lets find a nice place and have some sandwiches and cake will you join us shepherd no thank you kindly said the old man moving off til be after my sheep always wandering they are and they keep me wandering too good day sir and dont go down to that bad place julian found a good spot out of sight of that bad place and they all sat down all a lot of nonsense said julian who wanted anne to feel happier again we can easily ask the farmers boy about it tomorrow i expect its all a silly tale made up by that old onelegged fellow and passed on to the shepherd i expect so said dick you noticed that the shepherd had never actually seen the trains julian only heard them well sound travels far at night and i expect what he heard was simply the rumblings of the trains that go underground here theres one going somewhere now i can feel the ground trembling they all could it was a peculiar feeling the rumbling stopped at last and they sat and ate their tea watching timmy scraping at a rabbithole and trying his hardest to get down it he covered them with sandy soil as he burrowed and nothing would stop him he seemed to have gone completely deaf look here if we dont get timmy out of that hole now hell be gone down so far that well have to drag him out by his tail said julian getting up timmy timmy the rabbits miles away come on out it took both george and julian to get him out he was most indignant he looked at them as if to say well what spoilsports almost got him and you drag me out he shook himself and bits of grit and sand flew out of his hair he took a step towards the hole again but george caught hold of his tail no timmy home now hes looking for a spooktrain said dick and that made everyone laugh even anne they set off back to the campingplace pleasantly tired with timmy following rather sulkily at their heels when they at last got back they saw mr luffy sitting waiting for them the blue smoke from his pipe curled up into the air hallo hallo he said and his brown eyes looked up at them from under his shaggy eyebrows i was beginning to wonder if youd got lost still i suppose that dog of yours would always bring you back timmy wagged his tail politely woof he agreed and went to drink out of the bucket of water anne stopped him just in time no timmy youre not to drink out of our washingup water theres yours in the dish over there timmy went to his dish and lapped he thought anne was very fussy anne asked mr luffy if he would like any supper were not having a proper supper she said we had tea so late but ill cook you something if you like mr luffy very kind of you but ive had an enormous tea said mr luffy ive brought up a fruit cake for you from my own larder shall we share it for supper and ive got a bottle of lime juice too which will taste grand with some of the stream water the boys went off to get some fresh stream water for drinking anne got out some plates and cut slices of the cake well said mr luffy had a nice walk yes said anne except that we met a strange onelegged man who told us he saw spooktrains mr luffy laughed well well he must be a cousin of a little girl i know who thought she was sitting on a volcano anne giggled youre not to tease me no honestly mr luffy this old man was a watchman at a sort of old railway yard not used now and he said when the spooktrains came he blew out his light and got under his bed so that they shouldnt get him poor old fellow said mr luffy i hope he didnt frighten you he did a bit said anne and he threw a cinder at dick and hit him on the head tomorrow were going to the farm to ask the boy there if hes heard of the spooktrains too we met an old shepherd who said hed heard them but not seen them well well it all sounds most interesting said mr luffy but these exciting stories usually have a very tame explanation you know now would you like to see what i found today a very rare and interesting little beetle he opened a small square tin and showed a shiny beetle to anne it had green feelers and a red fiery spot near its tailend it was a lovely little thing now thats much more exciting to me than half a dozen spooktrains he told anne spooktrains wont keep me awake at night but thinking of this little beetlefellow here certainly will i dont very much like beetles said anne but this one certainly is pretty do you really like hunting about all day for insects and watching them mr luffy yes very much said mr luffy ah here come the boys with the water now well hand the cake round shall we wheres george oh there she is changing her shoes george had a blister and she had been putting a strip of plaster on her heel she came up when the boys arrived and the cake was handed round they sat in a circle munching while the sun gradually went down in a blaze of red nice day tomorrow again said julian what shall we do well have to go to the farm first said dick the farmers wife said shed let us have some more bread if we turned up in the morning and we could do with more eggs if we can get them we took eight hardboiled ones with us today and weve only one or two left and whos eaten all the tomatoes id like to know all of you said anne at once youre perfect pigs over the tomatoes im afraid im one of the pigs apologised mr luffy i think you fried me six for my breakfast anne thats all right said anne you didnt have as many as the others even so we can easily get some more it was pleasant sitting there eating and talking and drinking lime juice and stream water they were all tired and it was nice to think of the cosy sleepingbags timmy lifted his head and gave a vast yawn showing an enormous amount of teeth timmy i could see right down to your tail then said george do shut your mouth up youve made us all yawn so he had even mr luffy was yawning he got up well im going to turn in he said good night well make plans tomorrow morning ill bring up some breakfast for you if you like ive got some tins of sardines oh thanks said anne and theres some of this cake left i hope you wont think thats too funny a breakfast mr luffy sardines and fruit cake not a bit it sounds a most sensible meal came mr luffys voice from down the hillside good night the children sat there a few minutes longer the sun went right out of sight the wind grew a little chilly timmy yawned enormously again come on said julian time we turned in thank goodness timmy didnt come into our tent and walk all over me last night good night girls its going to be a heavenly night but as i shall be asleep in about two shakes of a ducks tail i shant see much of it the girls went into their tent they were soon in their sleepingbags just before they went to sleep anne felt the slight shivering of the earth that meant a train was running underground somewhere she could hear no rumbling sound she fell asleep thinking ofit the boys were not asleep they too had felt the trembling of the earth beneath them and it had reminded them of the old railway yard funny about those spooktrains dick said julian sleepily wonder if there is anything in it no how could there be said dick all the same well go to the farm tomorrow and have a chat with that boy he lives on the moors and he ought to know the truth the real truth is that woodenleg sam is potty and imagines all he says and the old shepherd is ready to believe in anything strange said julian i expect youre right said dick oh my goodness whats that a dark shape stood looking in at the tentflap it gave a little whine oh its you timmy would you mind not coming and pretending youre a spooktrain or something said dick and if you dare to put so much as half a paw on my middle ill scare you down the hill with a roar like a maneating tiger go away timmy put a paw on julian julian yelled out to george george call this dog of yours will you hes just about to turn himself round twenty times on my middle and curl himself up for the night there was no answer from george timmy feeling that he was not wanted disappeared he went back to george and curled himself up on her feet he put his nose down on his paws and slept spooky timmy murmured julian rearranging himself timmy spooky no i mean oh dear what do i mean shut up said dick what with you and timmy messing about i cant get to sleep but he could and he did almost before he had finished speaking silence fell on the little camp and nobody noticed when the next train rumbled underground not even timmy day at the farm the next day the children were up very early as early as mr luffy and they all had breakfast together mr luffy had a map of the moorlands and he studied it carefully after breakfast i think ill go off for the whole day he said to julian who was sitting beside him see that little valley marked here crowleg vale well i have heard that there are some of the rarest beetles in britain to be found there i think ill take my gear and go along what are you four going to do five said george at once youve forgotten timmy so i have i beg his pardon said mr luffy solemnly well what are you going to do well go over to the farm and get more food said julian and ask that farmboy if hes heard the tale of the spooktrains and perhaps look round the farm and get to know the animals there i always like a farm right said mr luffy beginning to light his pipe dont worry about me if im not back till dusk when im bughunting i lose count of the time youre sure you wont get lost said anne anxiously she didnt really feel that mr luffy could take proper care of himself oh yes my right ear always warns me if im losing my way said mr luffy it waggles hard he waggled it at anne and she laughed wish youd tell me how you do that she said im sure you know you cant think how thrilled the girls at school would be if i learnt that trick theyd think it was super mr luffy grinned and got up well so long he said im off before anne makes me give her a lesson in earwaggles he went off down the slope to his own tent george and anne washedup while the boys tightened some tent ropes that had come loose and generally tidied up i suppose its quite all right leaving everything unguarded like this said anne anxiously well we did yesterday said dick and whos likely to come and take anything up here in this wild and lonely spot id like to know you dont imagine a spooktrain will come along and bundle everything into its luggagevan do you anne anne giggled dont be silly i just wondered if we ought to leave timmy on guard thats all leave timmy said george amazed you dont really think id leave timmy behind every time we go off anywhere anne dont be an idiot no i didnt really think you would said anne well i suppose nobody will come along here throw over that teacloth george if youve finished with it soon the teacloths were hanging over the gorse bushes to dry in the sun everything was put away neatly in the tents mr luffy had called a loud goodbye and gone now the five were ready to go off to the farm anne took a basket and gave one to julian too to bring back the food said she are you ready to go now they set off over the heather their knees brushing through the honeyed flowers and sending scores of busy bees into the air it was a lovely day again and the children felt free and happy they came to the trim little farm men were at work in the fields but julian did not think they were very industrious he looked about for the farmboy the boy came out of a shed and whistled to them hallo you come for some more eggs ive collected quite a lot for you he stared at anne you didnt come yesterday whats your name anne said anne whats yours jock said the boy with a grin he was rather a nice boy anne thought with strawcoloured hair blue eyes and rather a red face which looked very goodtempered wheres your mother said julian can we get some bread and other things from her today we ate an awful lot of our food yesterday and we want to stock up our larder again shes busy just now in the dairy said jock are you in a hurry come and see my pups they all walked off with him to a shed in there right at the end was a big box lined with straw a collie dog lay there with five lovely little puppies she growled at timmy fiercely and he backed hurriedly out of the shed he had met fierce motherdogs before and he didnt like them the four children exclaimed over the fat little puppies and anne took one out very gently it cuddled into her arms and made funny little whining noises wish it was mine said anne i should call it cuddle what a frightful name for a dog said george scornfully just the kind of silly name you would think of anne let me hold it are they all yours jock yes said jock proudly the mothers mine you see her names biddy biddy pricked up her ears at her name and looked up at jock out of bright alert eyes he fondled her silky head ive had her for four years he said when we were at owl farm old farmer burrows gave her to me when she was eight weeks old oh were you at another farm before this one then asked anne have you always lived on a farm arent you lucky ive only lived on two said jock owl farm and this one mum and i had to leave owl farm when dad died and we went to live in a town for a year i hated that i was glad when we came here but i thought your father was here said dick puzzled thats my stepfather said jock hes no farmer though he looked round and lowered his voice he doesnt know much about farming its my mother that tells the men what to do still he gives her plenty of money to do everything well and weve got fine machinery and wagons and things like to see the dairy its slap uptodate and mum loves working in it jock took the four children to the shining spotless dairy his mother was at work there with a girl she nodded and smiled at the children good morning hungry again ill pack you up plenty of food when ive finished in the dairy would you like to stay and have dinner with my jock hes lonely enough here in the holidays with no other boy to keep him company oh yes do lets cried anne in delight td like that can we ju yes thank you very much mrs er mrs said julian tm mrs andrews said jocks mother but jock is jock robins hes the son of my first husband a farmer well stay to dinner all of you and ill see if i can give you a meal that will keep you going for the rest of the day this sounded good the four children felt thrilled and timmy wagged his tail hard he liked mrs andrews come on saidjqck joyfully til take you all round the farm into every corner its not very big but were going to make it the best little farm on the moorlands my stepfather doesnt seem to take much interest in the work of the farm but hesjolly generous when it comes to handing out money to mum to buy everything she wants it certainly seemed to the children that the machinery on the farm was absolutely uptodate they examined the combine they went into the little cowshed and admired the clean stone floor with white brick walls they climbed into the redpainted wagons and they wished they could try the two motortractors that stood side by side in a barn youve got plenty of men here to work the farm said julian i shouldnt have thought there was enough for so many to do on this small place theyre not good workers said jock his face creasing into frowns mums always getting wild with them they just dont know what to do dad gives her plenty of men to work the farm but he always chooses the wrong ones they dont seem to like farmwork and theyre always running off to the nearest town whenever they can theres only one good fellow and hes old see him over there his names will the children looked at will he was working in the little vegetable garden an old fellow with a shrivelled face a tiny nose and a pair of very blue eyes they liked the look of him yes he looks like a farmworker said julian the others dont he wont work with them said jock he just says rude things to them and calls them ninnies and idjits whats an idjit asked anne an idiot silly said dick he walked up to old will good morning he said youre very busy theres always a lot to do on a farm isnt there the old fellow looked at dick out of his very blue eyes and went on with his work plenty to do and plenty of folk to do it and not much done he said in a croaking kind of voice never thought id be put to work with ninnies and idjits not ninnies and idjits there what did i tell you said jock with a grin hes always calling the other men that so wejust have to let him work right away from them still i must say hes about right most of the fellows here dont know the first thing about work on a farm i wish my stepfather would let us have a few proper workers instead of these fellows wheres your stepfather said julian thinking he must be rather peculiar to pour money into a little moorland farm like this and yet choose the wrong kind of workers hes away for the day said jock thank goodness he added with a sideways look at the others why dont you like him asked dick hes all right said jock but hes not a farmer though he makes out hes always wanted to be and whats more he doesnt like me one bit i try to like him for mums sake but im always glad when hes out of the way your mothers nice said george oh yes mums grand said jock you dont know what it means to her to have a little farm of her own again and to be able to run it with the proper machinery and all they came to a large barn the door was locked i told you what was in here before said jock lorries you can peek through that hole here at them dont know why my stepfather wanted to buy up so many but i suppose he got them cheap he loves to get things cheap and sell them dear he did say theyd be useful on the farm to take goods to the market i yes you told us that when we were here yesterday said dick but youve got heaps of wagons for that yes i reckon they werent bought for the farm at all but for holding here till prices went high and he i could make a lot of money said jock lowering his voice i dont tell mum that so long as she gets what she wants for the farm im going to hold my tongue i the children were very interested in all this they wished they could see mr andrews he must be a peculiar sort of fellow they thought anne tried to imagine what he was like big and tall and dark and frowny she thought rather frightening and impatient and he certainly wont like children people like that never do they spent a very pleasant morning poking about the little farm they went back to see biddy the collie and her pups timmy stood patiently outside the shed with his tail down he didnt like george to take so much interest in other dogs a bell rang loudly good dinner said jock wed better wash were all filthy hope you feel hungry because i guess mums got a super dinner for us i feel terribly hungry said anne it seems ages since we had breakfast ive almost forgotten it they all felt the same they went into the farmhouse and were surprised to find a very nice little bathroom to wash in mrs andrews was there putting out a clean roller towel fine little bathroom isnt it she said my husband had it put in for me first proper bathroom ive ever had a glorious smell rose up from the kitchen downstairs come on said jock seizing the soap lets hurry well be down in a minute mum and they were nobody was going to dawdle over washing when a grand meal lay waiting for them downstairs mr andrews comes home they all sat down to dinner there was a big meatpie a cold ham salad potatoes in their jackets and homemade pickles it really was difficult to know what to choose have some of both said mrs andrews cutting the meatpie begin with the pie and go on with the ham thats the best of living on a farm you know you do get plenty to eat after the first course there were plums and thick cream or jam tarts and the same cream everyone tucked in hungrily ive never had such a lovely dinner in my life said anne at last i wish i could eat some more but i cant it was super mrs andrews smashing said dick that was his favourite word these holidays absolutely smashing woof said timmy agreeing he had had a fine plateful of meaty bones biscuits and gravy and he had licked up every crumb and every drop now he felt he would like to have a snooze in the sun and not do a thing for the rest of the day the children felt rather like that too mrs andrews handed them a chocolate each and sent them out of doors you go and have a rest now she said talk to jock he doesnt get enough company of his own age in the holidays you can stay on to tea if you like oh thanks said everyone although they all felt that they wouldnt even be able to manage a biscuit but it was so pleasant at the farm that they felt they would like to stay as long as they could may we borrow one of biddys puppies to have with us asked anne if biddy doesnt mind said mrs andrews beginning to clear away and if timmy doesnt eat it up timmy wouldnt dream of it said george at once you go and get the puppy anne well find a nice place in the sun anne went off to get the puppy biddy didnt seem to mind a bit anne cuddled the fat little thing against her and went off to the others feeling very happy the boys had found a fine place against a haystack and sat leaning against it the sun shining down warmly on them those men of yours seem to take a jolly good lunchhour off said julian not seeing any of them about jock gave a snort theyre bone lazy id sack the lot if i were my stepfather mums told him how badly the men work but he doesnt say a word to them ive given up bothering i dont pay their wages if i did id sack the whole lot lets ask jock about the spooktrains said george fondling timmys ears it would be fun to talk about them spooktrains whatever are they asked jock his eyes wide with surprise never heard of them havent you really asked dick well you dont live very far from them jock tell me about them said jock spooktrains no ive never heard of one of those well ill tell you what we know said julian actually we thought youd be able to tell us much more about them than we know ourselves he began to tell jock about their visit to the deserted railway yard and woodenleg sam and his peculiar behaviour jock listened enthralled coo i wish id been with you lets all go there together shall we he said this was quite an adventure you had wasnt it you know ive never had a single adventure in all my life not even a little one have you the four children looked at one another and timmy looked at george adventures what didnt they know about them they had had so many yes weve had heaps of adventures real ones smashing ones said dick weve been down in dungeons weve been lost in caves weve found secret passages weve looked for treasure well i cant tell you what weve done it would take too long no it wouldnt said jock eagerly you tell me go on did you all have the adventures little anne here too yes all of us said george and timmy as well he rescued us heaps of times from danger didnt you t l tim woof woof said timmy and thumped his tail against the hay they began to tell jock about their many adventures he was a very very good listener his eyes almost fell out of his head and he went brickred whenever they came to an exciting part my word he said at last ive never heard such things in my life before arent you lucky you just go about having adventures all the time dont you i say do you think youll have one here these hols julian laughed no whatever kind of adventure would there be on these lonely moorlands why you yourself have lived here for three years and havent even had a tiny adventure jock sighed thats true i havent then his eyes brightened again but see here what about those spooktrains youve been asking me about perhaps youll have an adventure with those oh no i dont want to said anne in a horrified voice an adventure with spooktrains would be simply horrid id like to go down to that old railway yard with you and see woodenleg sam said jock longingly why that would be a real adventure to me you know just talking to a funny old man like that and wondering if he was suddenly going to throw cinders at us take me with you next time you go well dont know that we meant to go again said julian theres really nothing much in his story except imagination the old watchmans gone peculiar in the head through being alone there so much guarding a yard where nothing and nobody ever comes hes just remembering the trains that used to go in and out before the line was given up but the shepherd said the same as sam said jock i say what about going down there one night and watching for a spooktrain no said anne in horror you neednt come said jock just us three boys and me said george at once im as good as any boy and im not going to be left out timmys coming too oh please dont make these awful plans begged poor anne youll make an adventure come if you go on like this nobody took the least notice of her julian looked at jocks excited face well he said if we do go there again well tell you and if we think well go watching for spooktrains well take you with us jock looked as if he could hug julian that would be terrific he said thanks a lot spooktrains i say just suppose we really did see one whod be driving it where would it come from out of the tunnel woodenleg sam says said dick but i dont see how wed spot it except by the noise it made because apparently the spooktrains only arrive in the dark of the night never in the daytime we wouldnt see much even if we were there it was such an exciting subject to jock that he persisted in talking about it all the afternoon anne got tired of listening and went to sleep with biddys puppy in her arms timmy curled up by george and went to sleep too he wanted to go for a walk but he could see that there was no hope with all this talking going on it was teatime before any of them had expected it the bell rang and jock looked most surprised tea would you believe it well i have had an exciting afternoon talking about all this and look here if you dont make up your minds to go spooktrain hunting ill jolly well go off by myself if only i could have an adventure like the kind youve had id be happy they went in to tea after waking anne up with difficulty she took the puppy back to biddy who received it gladly and licked it all over julian was surprised to find that he was quite hungry again well he said as he sat down at the table i didnt imagine id feel hungry again for a week but i do what a marvellous tea mrs andrews isnt jock lucky to have meals like this always there were homemade scones with new honey there were slices of bread thickly spread with butter and newmade cream cheese to go with it there was sticky brown gingerbread hot from the oven and a big solid fruit cake that looked almost like a plum pudding when it was cut it was so black oh dear i wish now i hadnt had so much dinner sighed anne i dont feel hungry enough to eat a bit of everything and i would so like to mrs andrews laughed you eat what you can and ill give you some to take away too she said you can have some cream cheese and the scones and honey and some of the bread i made this morning and maybe youd like a slab of the gingerbread i made plenty oh thanks said julian well be all right tomorrow with all that youre a marvellous cook mrs andrews i wish i lived on your farm there was the sound of a car coming slowly up the rough track to the farmhouse and mrs andrews looked up thats mr andrews come back she said my husband you know jocks stepfather julian thought she looked a little worried perhaps mr andrews didnt like children and wouldnt be pleased to see them sitting round his table when he came home tired would you like us to go mrs andrews he asked politely perhaps mr andrews would like a bit of peace for his meal when he comes in and were rather a crowd arent we jocks mother shook her head no you can stay ill get him a meal in the other room if hed like it mr andrews came in he wasnt in the least like anne or the others had imagined him to be he was a short dark little man with a weak face and a nose much too big for it he looked harassed and badtempered and stopped short when he saw the five children hallo dear said mrs andrews jocks got his friends here today would you like a bit of tea in your room i can easily put a tray there well said mr andrews smiling a watery kind of smile perhaps it would be best ive had a worrying kind of day and not much to eat til get you a tray of ham and pickles and bread said his wife it wont take a minute you go and wash mr andrews went out anne was surprised that he seemed so small and looked rather stupid she had imagined someone big and burly strong and clever who was always going about doing grand deals and making a lot of money well he must be cleverer than he looked to make enough money to give mrs andrews all sheneeded for her farm mrs andrews bustled about with this and that laying a tray with a snowwhite cloth and plates of food mr andrews could be heard in the bathroom splashing as he washed then he came downstairs and put his head in at the door my meal ready he asked well jock had a good day yes thanks said jock as his stepfather took the tray from his mother and turned to go we went all round the farm this morning and we talked and talked this afternoon and oh i say do you know anything about spooktrains sir mr andrews was just going out of the door he turned in surprise spooktrains what are you talking about well julian says theres an old deserted railway yard a good way from here and spooktrains are supposed to come out of the tunnel there in the dark of night said jock have you heard of them mr andrews stood stock still his eyes on his stepson he looked dismayed and shocked then he came back into the room and kicked the door shut behind him ill have my tea here after all he said well to think youve heard of those spooktrains ive been careful not to mention them to your mother or to you jock for fear of scaring you gee said dick are they really true then they cant be you tell me all you know and how you know about it said mr andrews sitting down at the table with his tray go on dont miss out a thing i want to hear everything julian hesitated oh theres nothing really to tell sir just a lot of nonsense you tell it me almost shouted mr andrews then ill tell you a few things and i tell you you wont go near that old railway yard again no that you wont a lazy evening the five children and mrs andrews stared in surprise at mr andrews when he shouted at them he repeated some of his words again go on you tell me all you know and then ill tell you julian decided to tell very shortly what had happened at the old railway yard and what woodenleg sam had said he made the tale sound rather bald and dull mr andrews listened to it with the greatest interest never once taking his eyes off julian then he sat back and drank a whole cup of strong tea in one gulp the children waited for him to speak wondering what he had to say now he said making his voice sound important and impressive you listen to me dont any of you ever go down to that yard again its a bad place why asked julian what do you mean a bad place things have happened there years and years ago said mr andrews bad things accidents it was all shut up after that and the tunnel wasnt used any more see nobody was allowed to go there and nobody did because they were scared they knew it was a bad place where bad things happen anne felt frightened but mr andrews you dont mean there really are spooktrains do you she asked her face rather pale mr andrews pursed up his lips and nodded very solemnly indeed thats just what i do mean spooktrains come and go nobody knows why but its bad luck to be there when they come they might take you away see julian laughed oh not as bad as that sir surely anyway youre frightening anne so lets change the subject i dont believe in spooktrains but mr andrews didnt seem to want to stop talking about the trains woodenleg sam was right to hide himself when they come along he said i dont know how he manages to stay on in a bad place like that never knowing when a train is going to come creeping out of that tunnel in the darkness julian was not going to have anne frightened any more he got up from the table and turned to mrs andrews thank you very much for a lovely day and lovely food he said we must go now come along anne wait a minute said mr andrews i just want to warn you all very solemnly that you mustnt go down to that railway yard you hear me jock you might never come back old woodenleg sams mad and well he may be with spooktrains coming along in the dead of night its a bad and dangerous place youre not to go near it well thank you for the warning sir said julian politely suddenly disliking the small man with the big nose very much indeed well be going goodbye mrs andrews goodbye jock come along tomorrow and have a picnic with us will you oh thanks yes i will said jock but wait a minute arent you going to take any food with you yes of course they are said mrs andrews getting up from her chair she had been listening to the conversation with a look of puzzled wonder on her face she went out into the scullery where there was a big cold larder julian followed her he carried the two baskets til give you plenty said mrs andrews putting loaves butter and cream cheese into the baskets i know what appetites you youngsters get now dont you be too scared at what my husbands just been saying i saw that little anne was frightened ive never heard of the spooktrains and ive been here for three years i dont reckon theres much in the tale you know for all my husbands so set on warning you not to go down to the yard julian said nothing he thought that mr andrews had behaved rather oddly about the whole story was he one of the kind of people who believed in all sorts of silly things and got scared himself he looked weak enough julian found himself wondering how a nice woman like mrs andrews could have married such a poor specimen of a man still he was a generous fellow judging by all jock had said and perhaps jocks mother felt grateful to him for giving her the farm and the money to run it with that must be it julian thanked mrs andrews and insisted on paying her though she would have given him the food for nothing she came into the kitchen with him and he saw that the others had already gone outside only mr andrews was left eating ham and pickles goodbye sir said julian politely goodbye and you remember what ive told you boy said mr andrews bad luck comes to people who see the spooktrains yes terrible bad luck you keep away from them julian gave a polite smile and went out it was evening now and the sun was setting behind the moorland hills though it still had a long way to go before it disappeared he caught up with the others jock was with them im just coming halfway with you said jock i say my stepfather was pretty scary about those trains wasnt he i felt pretty scary too when he was warning us about them said anne i shant go down to that yard again ever will you george if the boys did i would said george who didnt look very much as if she wanted to all the same are you going to the yard again asked jock eagerly im not scared not a bit it would be an adventure to go and watch for a spooktrain we might go said julian well take you with us if we do but the girls arent to come well i like that said george angrily as if you could leave me behind when have i been scared of anything im as brave as any of you yes i know you can come as soon as we find out its all a silly story said julian i shall come whenever you go flashed back george dont you dare to leave me out ill never speak to you again if you do jock looked most surprised at this sudden flareup of temper from george he didnt know how fierce she could be i dont see why george shouldnt come he said i bet shed be every bit as good as a boy i thought she was one when i first saw her george gave him one of her sweetest smiles he couldnt have said anything she liked better but julian would not change his mind i mean what i say the girls wont come if we do go so thats that for one thing anne certainly wouldnt want to come and if george came without her shed be left all alone up at the camp she wouldnt like that she could have mr luffys company said george looking sulky again idiot as if wed want to tell mrluffy we were going off exploring deserted railway yards watched over by a mad onelegged fellow who swears there are spooktrains said julian hed stop us going you know what grownups are like or hed come with us which would be worse yes hed see moths all the time not spooktrains said dick with a grin id better go back now said jock its been a grand day ill come up tomorrow and picnic with you goodbye they called goodbye to jock and went on their way to the camp it was quite nice to see it again waiting for them the two tents flapping a little in the breeze anne pushed her way through the tentflap anxious to see that everything was untouched inside the tent it was very hot anne decided to put the food they had brought under the bottom of the big gorse bush it would be cooler there she was soon busy about her little jobs the boys went down to see if mr luffy was back but he wasnt anne were going to bathe in the stream they called we feel hot and dirty are you coming george is coming too no i wont come anne called back ive got lots of things to do the boys grinned at one another anne did so enjoy playing house so they left her to it and went to the stream from which yells and howls and shrieks soon came the water was colder than they expected and nobody liked to lie down in it but everyone was well and truly splashed and the icycold drops falling on their hot bodies made them squeal and yell timmy didnt in the least mind the iciness of the water he rolled over and over in it enjoying himself look at him showing off said dick aha timmy if i could bathe in a fur coat like you i wouldnt mind the cold water either woof said timmy and climbed up the shallow bank he shook himself violently and thousands of icycold silvery drops flew from him and landed on the three shivering children they yelled and chased him away it was a pleasant lazy evening mr luffy didnt appear at all anne got a light meal of bread and cream cheese and a piece of gingerbread nobody felt like facing another big meal that day they lay in the heather and talked comfortably this is the kind of holiday i like said dick so do i said anne except for the spooktrains thats spoilt it a bit for me dont be silly anne said george if they are not real its just a silly story and if they are real well it might be an adventure there was a little silence are we going down to the yard again asked dick lazily yes i think so said julian im not going to be scared off it by weird warnings from pa andrews then i vote we go one night and wait to see if a spooktrain does come along said dick i shall come too said george no you wont said julian youll stay with anne george said nothing but everyone could feel mutiny in the air do we tell mr luffy or dont we said dick you know weve said we wouldnt said julian he yawned im getting sleepy and the sun has gone so it will soon be dark i wonder where old luffy is do you think id better wait up and see if he wants something to eat said anne anxiously no not unless you want to keep awake till midnight said julian hell have got some food down in his tent hell be all right im going to turn in coming dick the boys were soon in their sleepingbags the girls lay in the heather for a little while longer listening to the lonelysounding cry of the curlews going home in the dusk then they too went into their own tent once safely in their sleepingbags the two boys felt suddenly wide awake they began to talk in low voices shall we take jock down to see the yard in the daytime or shall we go one night and watch for the train from nowhere said julian i vote we go and watch at night said dick well never see a spooktrain in the daytime woodenleg sam is an interesting old chap especially when he chucks cinders about but i dont know that i like him enough to go and visit him again well if jock badly wants to go and have a snoop round tomorrow morning when he comes wed better take him said julian we can always go one night too if we want to right well wait and see what jock says said dick they talked a little longer and then felt sleepy dick was just dropping off when he heard something coming wriggling through the heather a head was stuck through the opening of the tent if you dare to come in ill smack your silly face said dick thinking it was timmy i know what you want you perfect pest you want to flop down on my tummy you just turn yourself round and go away do you hear the head in the opening moved a little but didnt go away dick raised himself up on one elbow put one paw inside my tent and youll be sent rolling down the hill he said i love you very much in the daytime but im not fond of you at night not when im in a sleepingbag anyway scoot the head made a peculiar apologetic sound then it spoke er youre awake i see are all of you all right the girls too im only just back gosh its mr luffy said dick filled with horror i say sir im most awfully sorry i thought you were timmy come to flop himself down on top of me like he often does so sorry sir dont mention it said the shadowy head with a chuckle glad youre all right see you tomorrow night visitor mr luffy slept very late the next morning and nobody liked to disturb him the girls yelled with laughter when they heard how dick had spoken to him the night before thinking he was timmy the dog he was very decent about it said dick seemed to think it was quite amusing i hope hell still think so this morning they were all sitting eating their breakfast ham tomatoes and the bread mrs andrews had given them the day before timmy collected the bits as usual and wondered if george would let him have a lick of the cream cheese she was now putting on her bread timmy loved cheese he looked at the lump in the dish and sighed all over george he could easily eat that in one mouthful how he wished he could i wonder what time jock will come up said george if he came up pretty soon we could go for a nice long walk over the moors and picnic somewhere jock ought to know some fine walks yes well mess about till he comes and then tell him hes to be our guide and take us to the nicest walk he knows said anne oh timmy you beast youve taken my nice lump of cream cheese right out of my fingers well you were waving it about under his nose so what could you expect said george he thought you were giving it to him well he hant have any more its too precious said anne oh dear wish we didnt eat so much we keep bringing in stacks of food and it hardly lasts any time i bet jock will bring some more said dick hes a sensible sort of fellow did you get a peep into that enormous larder of his mothers its like a great cave goes right back into the wall with dozens of stone shelves and all filled with food no wonder jocks tubby is he i never noticed said anne is that him whistling it wasnt it was a curlew very high up too early for him yet said julian shall we help you to clear up anne no thats my job and georges said anne firmly you go down and see if mr luffy is awake he can have a bit of ham and a few tomatoes if he likes they went down to mr luffys tent he was awake sitting at the entrance eating some kind of breakfast he waved a sandwich at them hallo there im late this morning i had a job getting back i went much too far sorry i woke you up last night dick you didnt i wasnt asleep said dick going rather red did you have a good day mr luffy bit disappointing didnt find quite all the creatures id hoped said mr luffy what about you did you have a good day fine said dick and described it mr luffy seemed very interested in everything even in mr andrewss rather frightening warning about the railway yard silly chap he sounds said mr luffy shaking the crumbs off his front all the same i should keep away from the yard if i were you stories dont get about for nothing you know no smoke without fire why sir surely you dont believe theres anything spooky about the trains there said dick in surprise oh no i doubt if there are any trains said mr luffy but when a place has got a bad name its usually best to keep away from it i suppose so sir said dick and julian together then they hastily changed the subject afraid that mr luffy like mr andrews might also be going to forbid them to visit the railway yard and the more they were warned about it and forbidden to go the more they felt that they really must well we must get back said dick were expecting jock thats the boy at the farm to come up for the day and we thought wed go out walking and take our food with us are you going out too sir not today said mr luffy my legs are tired and stiff with so much scrambling about yesterday and i want to mount some of the specimens i found also id like to meet your farm friend whats his name jock yes sir said julian right well bring him along as soon as he comes then off well go youll be left in peace all day but jock didnt come the children waited for him all the morning and he didnt turn up they held up their lunch until they were too hungry to wait any longer and then they had it on the heather in front of their tents funny said julian he knows where the camp is because we pointed it out to him when he came halfway home with us yesterday perhaps hell come this afternoon but he didnt come in the afternoon either nor did he come after tea julian debated whether or not to go and see what was up but decided against it there must be some good reason why jock hadnt come and mrs andrews wouldnt want them all visiting her two days running it was a disappointing day they didnt like to leave the tents and go for even a short stroll in case jock came mr luffy was busy all day long with his specimens he was sorry jock had disappointed them hell come tomorrow he said have you got enough food theres some in that tin over there if you want it oh no thank you sir said julian weve plenty really were going to have a game of cards like to join us yes i think i will said mr luffy getting up and stretching himself can you play rummy they could and they beat poor mr luffy handsomely because he couldnt play at all he blamed his luck on his bad cards but he enjoyed the game immensely he said the only thing that really put him off was the way that timmy stood behind him and breathed down his neck all the time i kept feeling certain that timmy thought he knew how to play my cards better than i could he complained and whenever i did something wrong he breathed down my neck harder than usual everyone laughed and george privately thought that timmy would probably play very much better than mr luffy if only he could hold the cards jock didnt come at all they put the cards away when they could no longer see them and mr luffy announced that he was going to bed it was very late when i got back last night he said i really must have an early night the others thought they would go to bed too the thought of their cosy sleepingbags was always a nice one when darkness came on thegirls crept into their bags and timmy flopped down on george the boys were in their bags about the same time and dick gave a loud yawn good night ju he said and fell fast asleep julian was soon asleep too in fact everyone was sound asleep when timmy gave a little growl it was such a small growl that neither of the girls heard it and certainly dick and julian didnt away in their tent timmy raised his head and listened intently then he gave another small growl he listened again finally he got up shook himself still without waking george and stalked out of the tent his ears cocked and his tail up he had heard somebody or something and although he thought it was all right he was going to make sure dick was sound asleep when he felt something brushing against the outside of his tent he awoke at once and sat up he looked at the tent opening a shadow appeared there and looked in was it timmy was it mr luffy he mustnt make a mistake this time he waited for the shadow to speak but it didnt it just stayed there as if it were listening for some movement inside the tent dick didnt like it timmy he said at last in a low voice then the shadow spoke dick or is it julian its jock here ive got timmy beside me can i come in jockl said dick in surprise whatever have you come at this time of night for and why didnt you come today we waited ages for you yes i know im awfully sorry said jocks voice and the boy wriggled himself into the tent dick poked julian awake julian heres jock and timmy get off me timmy here jock see if you can squeeze inside my sleepingbag theres room for us both i think oh thanks said jock and squeezed inside with difficulty how warm it is i say im terribly sorry i didnt come today but my stepfather suddenly announced he wanted me to go somewhere with him for the whole day cant think why he doesnt bother about me as a rule that was mean of him seeing that he knew you were to come on a picnic with us said julian was it something important no not at all said jock he drove off to endersfield thats about forty miles away parked me in the public library there saying hed be back in a few minutes and he didnt come back till past teatime i had some sandwiches with me luckily i felt pretty angry about it i can tell you never mind come tomorrow instead said dick i cant said jock in despair hes gone and arranged for me to meet the son of some friend of hisa boy called cecil dearlove what a name im to spend the day with this frightful boy the worst of it is mums quite pleased about it she never thinks my stepfather takes enough notice of me good thing he doesnt think oh blow so you wont be able to come tomorrow either said julian well what about the next day it should be all right said jock but ive feeling ill have dear love of a cecil plonked on me for the day to show him the cows and the puppies dear pet ugh when i could be with you four and timmy its bad luck said julian it really is i thought id better come and tell you said jock its the first chance ive had creeping up here tonight ive brought some more food for you by the way i guessed youd want some i feel down in the dumps about that adventure you know going to see the railway yard i was going to ask you to take me today well if you cant come tomorrow either and perhaps not the next day what about going one night said dick would you like to come up tomorrow night about this time we wont tell the girls well just go off by ourselves we three boys and watch jock was too thrilled to say a word he let out a deep breath of joy dick laughed dont get too thrilled we probably shant see a thing bring a torch if youve got one come to our tent and jerk my toe ill probably be awake but if im not thatll wake me all right and dont say a word to anyone of course rather not said jock overjoyed well suppose id better be going it was pretty weird coming over the moorland in the dark theres no moon and the stars dont give much light ive left the food outside the tent better look out that timmy doesnt get it right thanks awfully said julian jock got out of dicks sleepingbag and went backwards out of the tent with timmy obligingly licking his nose all the way jock then found the bag of food and rolled it in to julian who put it safely under the groundsheet good night said jock in a low voice and they heard him scrambling over the heather timmy went with him pleased at this unexpected visitor and the chance of a midnight walk jock was glad to have the dogs company timmy went right to the farm with him and then bounded back over the moorland to the campingplace longing to pounce on the rabbits he could smell here and there but wanting to get back to george in the morning anne was amazed to find the food in her larder under the gorse bush julian had popped it there to surprise her look at this she cried in astonishment meatpies more tomatoes eggs wherever did they come from spooktrain brought them in the night said dick with a grin volcano shot them up into the air said mr luffy who was also there anne threw a teacloth at him tell me how it came here she demanded i was worried about what to give you all for breakfast and now theres more than we can possibly eat who put it there george do you know but george didnt she glanced at the smiling faces of the two boys i bet jock was here last night she said to them wasnt he and to herself she said yes and somehow i think theyve planned something together you wont trick me dick and julian ill be on the lookout from now on wherever you go i go too hunt for a spooktrain that day passed pleasantly enough the children timmy and mr luffy all went off to a pool high up on the moorlands it was called the green pool because of its cucumbergreen colour mr luffy explained that some curious chemicals found there caused the water to look green i hope we shant come out looking green too said dick getting into his bathing trunks are you going to bathe mr luffy mr luffy was the children expected him to be a very poor swimmer and to splash about at the edge and do very little but to their surprise he was magnificent in the water and could swim faster even than julian they had great fun and when they were tired they came out to bask in the sun the highroad ran alongside the green pool and the children watched a herd of sheep being driven along then a car or two came by and finally a big army lorry a boy sat beside the driver and to the childrens surprise he waved wildly at them who was that said julian astonished surely he doesnt know us georges sharp eye had seen who it was it was jock sitting beside the driver and look here comes his stepfathers fine new car jocks preferred to go with the lorrydriver instead of his stepfather i dont blame him either the bright new car came by driven by mr andrews he didnt glance at the children by the wayside but drove steadily on after the lorry going to market i suppose said dick lying back again wonder what theyre taking so do i said mr luffy he must sell his farm produce at very high prices to be able to buy that fine car and all the machinery and gear youve told me about clever fellow mr andrews he doesnt look at all clever said anne he looks rather a weak feeble sort of man really mr luffy i cant even imagine him being clever enough to beat anyone down or get the better of them very interesting said mr luffy well what about another dip before we have our dinner it was a very nice day and mr luffy was very good company he could make fine jokes very solemnly indeed and only the fact that his ear waggled violently showed the others that he too was enjoying the joke his right ear seemed to love to join in the joke even if mr luffys face was as solemn as timmys they arrived home at the camp about teatime and anne got a fine tea ready they took it down to eat in front of mr luffys tent as the evening came on julian and dick felt excitement rising in them in the daytime neither of them really believed a word about the spooktrains but as the sun sank and long shadows crept down the hills they felt pleasantly thrilled would they really see anything exciting that night it was a very dark night at first because clouds lay across the sky and hid even the stars the boys said good night to the girls and snuggled down into their sleepingbags they watched the sky through the tent opening gradually the big clouds thinned out a few stars appeared the clouds thinned still more and fled away in rags soon the whole sky was bright with pinpoints of light and a hundred thousand stars looked down on the moorlands we shall have a bit of starlight to see by whispered julian thats good i dont want to stumble about over the heather and break my ankle in rabbitholes in the pitch darkness nor do i want to use my torch on the way to the yard in case its seen its going to be fun dick whispered back i hope jock comes it will be maddening if he doesnt he did come there was a scrambling over the heather and once again a shadow appeared at the tent opening julian dick ive come are you ready it was jocks voice of course dicks thumb pressed the switch of his torch and for a moment its light fell on jocks red excited face and then was switched off again hallo jock so you were able to come said dick i say was that you in the lorry this morning going by the green pool yes did you see me i saw you and waved like mad said jock i wanted to stop the lorry and get down and speak to you but the drivers an awful badtempered sort of fellow he wouldnt hear of stopping said my stepfather would be wild with him if he did did you see him my stepfather i mean he was in his car behind were you off to market or something asked julian i expect thats where the lorry was going said jock it was empty so i suppose my stepfather was going to pick up something there i came back in the car the lorry was supposed to come later how did you like cecil dearlove asked dick grinning in the darkness awful worse than his name groaned jock wanted me to play soldiers all the time the frightful thing is ive got to have him at the farm for the day tomorrow another day wasted what shall i do with him roll him in the pigsty suggested dick or put him with biddys puppies and let him sleep there tell him to play soldiers with them jock chuckled i wish i could the worst of it is mum is awfully pleased that my stepfathers got this cecil boy for me to be friends with dont lets talk about it are you ready to start off yes said julian and began to scramble quietly out of his bag we didnt tell the girls anne doesnt want to come and i dont want george to leave anne by herself now lets be very very quiet till were out of hearing dick got out of his bag too the boys had not undressed that night except for their coats so all they had to do was to slip these on and then crawl out of the tent which is the way over there whispered jock julian took his arm and guided him he hoped he wouldnt lose his way in the starlit darkness the moorland look so different at night if we make for that hill you can dimly see over there against the starlit sky we should be going in the right direction said julian so on they went keeping towards the dark hill that rose up to the west it seemed very much farther to the railway yard at night than in the daytime the three boys stumbled along sometimes almost falling as their feet caught in tufts of heather they were glad when they found some sort of path they could keep on this is about where we met the shepherd said dick in a low voice he didnt know why he spoke so quietly he just felt as if he must im sure we cant be very far off now tiey went on for some way and then julian pulled dick by the arm look he said down there i believe thats the old yard you can see the line gleaming faintly here and there they stood on the heathery slope above the old yard straining their eyes soon they could make out dim shapes yes it was the railway yard all right jock clutched julians sleeve look theres a light down there do you see it the boys looked and sure enough down in the yard towards the other side of it was a small yellow light they stared at it oh i think i know what it is said dick at last its the light in the watchmans little hut old woodenleg sams candle dont you think so ju yes youre right said julian i tell you what well do well creep right down into the yard and go over to the hut well peep inside and see if old sam is there then well hide somewhere about and wait for the spooktrain to come they crept down the slope their eyes had got used to the starlight by now and they were beginning to see fairly well they got right down to the yard where their feet made a noise on some cinders there they stopped someone will hear us if we make a row like this whispered julian who will whispered back dick theres no one here except old sam in his hut how do you know there isnt said julian good heavens jock dont make such a row with your feet they stood there debating what was the best thing to do wed better walk right round the edge of the yard said julian at last as far as i remember the grass has grown there well walk on that so they made their way to the edge of the yard sure enough there was grass there and they walked on it without a sound they went slowly and softly to where the light shone dimly in sams little hut the window was high and small it was just about at the level of their heads and the three boys cautiously eased themselves along to it and looked in woodenleg sam was there he sat sprawled in a chair smoking a pipe he was reading a newspaper squinting painfully as he did so he obviously had not had his broken glasses mended yet on a chair beside him was his wooden leg he had unstrapped it and there it lay hes not expecting the spooktrain tonight or he wouldnt have taken off his wooden leg whispered dick the candlelight flickered and shadows jumped about the tiny hut it was a poor illfurnished little place dirty and untidy a cup without saucer or handle stood on the table and a tin kettle boiled on a rusty stove sam put down his paper and rubbed his eyes he muttered something the boys could not hear it but they felt certain it was something about his broken glasses are there many lines in this yard whispered jock tired of looking in at old sam where do they go to about half a mile or so up there is a tunnel said julian pointing past jock the lines come from there and run here where they break up in many pairs for shunting and so on in the old days i suppose when this place was used lets go up the lines to the tunnel said jock come on theres nothing to be seen here lets walk up to the tunnel all right said julian we may as well i dont expect well see much up there either i think these spooktrains are all a tall story of old sams they left the little hut with its forlorn candlelight and made their way round the yard again then they followed the singletrack line away from the yard and up towards the tunnel it didnt seem to matter walking on cinders now and making a noise they walked along talking in low voices and then things began to happen a faroff muffled noise came rumbling out of the tunnel which was now so near that the boys could see its black mouth julian heard it first he stood still and clutched dick i say listen can you hear that the others listened yes said dick but its only a train going through one of the underground tunnels the noise is echoing out through this one it isnt that noise is made by a train coming through this tunnel said julian the noise grew louder and louder a clanking made itself heard too the boys stepped off the lines and crouched together by the side waiting hardly daring to breathe could it be the spooktrain they watched for the light of an enginelamp to appear like a fiery eye in the tunnel but none came it was darker than night in there but the noise came nearer and nearer and nearer could there be the noise of a train without a train julians heart began to beat twice as fast and dick and jock found themselves clutching one another without knowing it the noise grew thunderous and then out from the tunnel came something long and black with a dull glow in front that passed quickly and was gone the noise deafened the boys and then the clanking and rumbling grew less as the train or whatever it was passed by the ground trembled and then was still well there you are said julian in a rather trembly voice the spooktrain without a light or a signal wheres it gone to the yard do you think shall we go and see asked dick i didnt see anyone in the cab even in the glow of what must have been the fire there but there must be someone driving it i say what a weird thing isnt it it sounded real enough anyway well go to the yard said jock who of the three seemed the least affected come on they made their way very slowly and then dick gave a sharp cry blow ive twisted my ankle haifa minute he sank down to the ground in great pain it was only a sharp twist not a sprain but for a few minutes dick could do nothing but groan the others dared not eave him uian knelt by him offering to rub the ankle but dick wouldnt let him touch it jock stood by anxiously it took about twenty minutes for dicks ankle to be strong enough for him to stand on again with the help of the others he got to his feet and tested his ankle its all right i think i can walk on it slowly now well go to the yard and see whats happening but even as they started to walk slowly back they heard a noise coming up the lines from the faraway yard rumble rumble rumble jangle clank its coming back again said julian stand still watch itll be going back into the tunnel they stood still and watched and listened again the noise came nearer and grew thunderous they saw the glow of what might be the fire in the cab and then it passed the train disappeared into the blackness of the tunnel mouth and they heard the echo of its rumblings for some time well there you are there is a spooktrain said julian trying to laugh though he felt a good deal shaken it came and it went where from or where to nobody knows but weve heard it and seen it in the darkness of the night and jolly creepy it was too mostly about jock the three boys stood rather close together glad to feel each other in the darkness they couldnt believe that they had found what they had come looking for so doubtfully what kind of a train was this that had come rumbling out of the tunnel so mysteriously and then after a pause at the yard had gone just as mysteriously back again if only i hadnt twisted my ankle we could have followed the train down the lines to the yard and have gone quite close to it there groaned dick what an ass i am messing things up at the most exciting moment you couldnt help it said jock i say weve seen the spooktrain i can hardly believe it does it go all by itself with nobody to drive it is it a real train judging by the noise it made its real all right said julian and it shot out smoke too all the same its jolly strange i cant say i like it much lets go and see whats happened to woodenleg sam said dick i bet hes under his bed they made their way slowly back to the yard dick limping a little though his ankle was practically all right again when they came to the yard they looked towards sams hut the light was there no longer hes blown it out and got under the bed said dick poor sam it really must be terrifying for him lets go and peep into his hut they went over to it and tried to see in at the window but there was nothing to be seen the hut was in complete darkness then suddenly a little flare flashed out somewhere near the floor look theres sam hes lighting a match said julian see hes peeping out from under the bed he looks scared stiff lets tap on the window and ask him if hes all right but that was quite the wrong thing to do as soon as julian tapped sharply on the window sam gave an anguished yell and retired hurriedly under the bed again his wavering matchlight going out its come for to take me they heard him wailing its come for to take me and me with my wooden leg off too were only frightening the poor old fellow said dick come on lets leave him hell have a fit or something if we call out to him he honestly thinks the spooktrains come to get him they wandered round the dark yard for a few minutes but there was nothing to find out in the darkness no more rumbling came to their ears the spooktrain was evidently not going to run again that night lets go back said julian that really was exciting honestly my hair stood on end when that train came puffing out of the tunnel where on earth did it come from and whats the reason for it they gave it up and began to walk back to the camp they scrambled through the heather tired but excited shall we tell the girls weve seen the train said dick no said julian it would only scare anne and george would be furious if she knew wed gone without her well wait and see if we discover any thing more before we say anything either to the girls ortooldluffy right said dick youll hold your tongue too wont you jock course said jock scornfully who would i tell my stepfather not likely how furious hed be if he knew wed all poohpoohed his warnings and gone down to see the spooktrain after all he suddenly felt something warm against his legs and gave a startled cry whats this get away but the warm thing turned out to be timmy who had come to meet the three boys he pressed against each of them in turn and whined a little he says why didnt you take me with you said dick sorry old thing but we couldnt george would never have spoken to us again if wed taken you and left her behind how would you have liked spooktrains timmy would you have run into a corner somewhere and hidden woof said timmy scornfully as if he would be afraid of anything they reached their campingplace and began to speak in whispers goodbye jock come up tomorrow if you can hope you dont have that cecil boy to cope with goodbye see you soon whispered jock and disappeared into the darkness with timmy at his heels another chance of a midnight walk good thought timmy just what hed like it was hot in the tent and a scamper in the cool night air would be fine timmy growled softly when they came near to ollys farm and stood still the hackles on his neck rising up a little jock put his hand on the dogs head and stopped whats the matter old boy burglars or something he strained his eyes in the darkness big clouds now covered the stars and there was no light at all to see by jock made out a dim light in one of the barns he crept over to it to see what it was it went out as he came near and then he heard the sound of footsteps the quiet closing of the barn door and the click of a padlock as it was locked jock crept nearer too near for whoever it was must have heard him and swung round lashing out with his arm he caught jock on the shoulder and the boy overbalanced he almost fell and the man who had struck him clutched hold of him a flashlight was put on and he blinked in the sudden light its you jock said an astonished voice rough and impatient what are you doing out here at this time of night well what are you doing demanded jock wriggling free he switched on his own torch and let the light fall on the man who had caught him it was peters one of the farm men the one in whose lorry he had ridden that very day whats it to do with you said peters angrily i had a breakdown and ive only just got back look here youre fully dressed where have you been at this time of night did you hear me come in and get up to see what was happening you never know said jock cheekily he wasnt going to say anything that might make peters suspicious of him you just never know is that biddy said peters seeing a dark shadow slinking away do you mean to say youve been out with biddy what in the world have you been doing jock thanked his lucky stars that peters hadnt spotted it was timmy not biddy he moved off without saying another word let peters think what he liked it was bad luck though that peters had had a breakdown and come in late if the man told his stepfather hed seen jock fully dressed in the middle of the night thered be questions asked by both his mother and his stepfather and jock who was a truthful boy would find things very difficult to explain he scuttled off to bed climbing up the peartree outside his window and dropping quietly into his room he opened his door softly to hear if anyone was awake in the house but all was dark and silent blow peters thought jock if he splits on me im for it he got into bed pondered over the curious happenings of the night for a few minutes and then slid into an uneasy sleep in which spooktrains peters and timmy kept doing most peculiar things he was glad to awake in the bright sunny morning and find his mother shaking him get up jock youre very late whatevers made you so sleepy were halfway through breakfast peters apparently didnt say anything to jocks stepfather about seeing jock in the night jock was very thankful he began to plan how to slip off to the others at the camp hed take them some food that would be a fine excuse mum can i take a basket of stuff to the campers he said after breakfast they must be running short now well that boy is coming said his mother whats his name cecil something your stepfather says hes such a nice boy you did enjoy your day with him yesterday didnt you jock would have said quite a lot of uncomplimentary things about dear cecil if his stepfather had not been there sitting by the window reading the paper as it was he shrugged his shoulders and made a face hoping that his mother would understand his feelings she did what time is cecil coming she said perhaps theres time for you to run to the camp with a basket i dont want him running off up there said mr andrews suddenly butting into the conversation and putting down his newspaper cecil may be here at any minute and i know what jock is hed start talking to those kids and forget all about coming back cecils father is a great friend of mine and jocks got to be polite to him and be here to welcome him theres to be no running off to that camp today jock looked sulky why must his stepfather suddenly interfere in his plans like this rushing him off to the town making him take cecil for a friend just when some other children had come into his rather lonely life and livened it up too it was maddening perhaps i can go up to the camp myself with some food said his mother comfortingly or maybe the children will come down for some jock was still sulky he stalked out into the yard and went to look for biddy she was with her pups who were now trying to crawl round the shed after her jock hoped the campers would come to fetch food themselves that day then at least he would get a word with them cecil arrived by car he was about the same age as jock though he was small for twelve years old he had curly hair which was too long and his grey flannel suit was very very clean and wellpressed hallo he called to jock ive come what shall we play at soldiers no red indians said jock who had suddenly remembered his old red indian headdress with masses of feathers round it and a trail of them falling down the back he rushed indoors grinning he changed into the whole suit and put on his headdress he took his paintbox and hurriedly painted a frightful pattern of red blue and green on his face he found his tomahawk and went downstairs he would play at red indians and scalp that annoying paleface cecil was wandering round by himself to his enormous horror as he turned a corner a most terrifying figure rose up from behind a wall gave a horrible yell and pounced on him waving what looked like a dangerous chopper cecil turned and fled howling loudly with jock leaping madly after him whooping for all he was worth and thoroughly enjoying himself he had had to play at soldiers all the day before with dear cecil he didnt see why cecil shouldnt play red indians all day with him today just at that moment the four campers arrived to fetch food with timmy running beside them they stopped in amazement at the sight of cecil running like the wind howling dismally and a fullydressed and painted red indian leaping fiercely after him jock saw them did a comical wardance all round them much to timmys amazement yelled dramatically pretended to cut off timmys tail and then tore after the vanishing cecil the children began to laugh helplessly oh dear said anne with tears of laughter in her eyes that must be cecil hes after i suppose this is jocks revenge for having to play soldiers all day with him yesterday look there they go round the pigsty poor cecil he really thinks hes going to be scalped cecil disappeared into the farm kitchen sobbing and mrs andrews ran to comfort him jock made off back to the others grinning all over his warpainted face hallo he said im just having a nice quiet time with dear cecil im so glad to see you i wanted to come over but my stepfather said i wasnt to must play with cecil isnt he frightful awful everyone agreed i say will your mother be furious with you for frightening cecil like that perhaps wed better not ask her for any food yet said julian yes youd better wait a bit said jock leading them to the sunny side of the haystack they had rested by before hallo timmy did you get back all right last night jock had completely forgotten that the girls didnt know of the happenings of the night before both anne and george at once pricked up their ears julian frowned at jock and dick gave him a secret nudge whats up said george seeing all this byplay what happened last night oh i just came up to have a little nighttalk with the boys and timmy walked back with me said jock airily hope you didnt mind him coming george george flushed an angry red youre keeping something from me she said to the boys yes you are i know you are i believe you went off to the railway yard last night did you there was an awkward silence julian shot an annoyed look at poor jock who could have kicked himself go on tell me persisted george an angry frown on her forehead you beasts you did go and you never woke me up to go with you oh i do think youre mean did you see anything said anne her eyes going from one boy to another each of the girls sensed that there had been some kind of adventure in the night well began julian and then there was an interruption cecil came round the haystack his eyes red with crying he glared at jock your father wants you he said youre to go at once youre a beast and i want to go home cant you hear your father yelling for you hes got a stick but im not sorry for you i hope he whacks you hard george loses her temper jock made a face at cecil and got up he went slowly off round the haystack and the others listened in silence for whacks and yells but none came he frightened me said cecil sitting down by the others poor icle ting said dick at once darling baby said george mothers pet said julian cecil glared at them all he got up again very red if i didnt know my manners id smack your faces he said and marched off hurriedly before his own could be smacked the four sat in silence they were sorry for jock george was angry and sulky because she knew the others had gone off without her the night before anne was worried they all sat there for about ten minutes then round the haystack came jocks mother looking distressed she carried a big basket of food the children all stood up politely good morning mrs andrews said julian im sorry i cant ask you to stop today said mrs andrews but jock has really behaved very foolishly i wouldnt let mr andrews give him a hiding because it would only make jock hate his stepfather and that would never do so ive sent him up to bed for the day you wont be able to see him im afraid here is some food for you to take oh dear im really very sorry about all this i cant think what came over jock to behave in such a way its not a bit like him cecils face appeared round the haystack looking rather smug julian grinned to himself would you like us to take cecil for a nice long walk over the moors he said we can climb hills and jump over streams and scramble through the heather it would make such a nice day for him cecils face immediately disappeared well said mrs andrews that really would be very kind of you now that jocks been sent upstairs for the day theres no one for cecil to play with but im afraid hes a bit of a mothers boy you know youll have to go carefully with him cecil cecil where are you come and make friends with these children but cecil had gone there was no answer at all he didnt want to make friends with these children he knew better than that mrs andrews went in search of him but he had completely disappeared the four children were not at all surprised julian dick and anne grinned at one another george stood with her back to them still sulky mrs andrews came back again out of breath i cant find him she said never mind ill find something for him to do when he appears again yes perhaps youve got some beads for him to thread or a nice easy jigsaw puzzle to do said julian very politely the others giggled a smile appeared on mrs andrewss face bad boy she said oh dear poor jock well its his own fault now goodbye i must get on with my work she ran off to the dairy the children looked round the haystack mr andrews was getting into his car he would soon be gone they waited a few minutes till they heard the car set off down the rough carttrack thats jocks bedroom where the peartree is said julian lets just have a word with him before we go its a shame they went across the farmyard and stood under the peartree all except george who stayed behind the haystack with the food frowning julian called up to the window above jock a head came out the face still painted terrifyingly in streaks and circles hallo he didnt whack me mum wouldnt let him all the same id rather he had its awful being stuck up here this sunny day wheres dear cecil i dont know probably in the darkest corner of one of the barns said julian jock if things are difficult in the daytime come up at night weve got to see you somehow right said jock how do i look like a real red indian you look frightful grinned julian i wonder old timmy knew you wheres george asked jock sulking behind the haystack said dick we shall have an awful day with her now you let the cat properly out of the bag you idjit yes im a ninny and an idjit said jock and anne giggled look theres cecil you might tell him to beware of the bull will you is there a bull said anne looking alarmed no but thats no reason why he shouldnt beware of one grinned jock so long have a nice day the three left him and strolled over to cecil who had just appeared out of a dark little shed he made a face at them and stood ready to run to the dairy where mrs andrews was busy julian suddenly clutched dick and pointed behind cecil the bull beware of the bull he yelled suddenly dick entered into the joke the bulls loose look out beware of the bull he shouted anne gave a shriek it all sounded so real that although she knew it was a joke she felt halfscared the bull she cried cecil turned green his legs shook wwwwhere is it he stammered look out behind you yelled julian pointing poor cecil convinced that a large bull was about to pounce on him from behind gave an anguished cry and tore on tottering legs to the dairy he threw himself against mrs andrews save me save me the bulls chasing me but theres no bull here said mrs andrews in surprise really cecil was it a pig after you or something helpless with laughter the three children made their way back to george they tried to tell her about the makebelieve bull but she turned away and wouldnt listen julian shrugged his shoulders best to leave george to herself when she was in one of her rages she didnt lose her temper as often as she used to but when she did she was very trying indeed they went back to the camp with the basket of food timmy followed soberly he knew something was wrong with george and he was unhappy his tail was down and he looked miserable george wouldnt even pat him when they got back to the camp george flared up how dare you go off without me when i told you i meant to come fancy taking jock and not letting me go i think youre absolute beasts i never really thought youd do a thing like that you and dick dont be silly george said julian i told you we didnt mean to let you and anne go ill tell you all that happened and its pretty thrilling what tell me quickly begged anne but george obstinately turned away her head as if she was not interested julian began to relate all the curious happenings of the night anne listened breathlessly george was listening too though she pretended not to she was very angry and very hurt well there you are said julian when he had finished if thats what people mean by spooktrains there was one puffing in and out of that tunnel all right i felt pretty scared i can tell you sorry you werent there too george but i didnt want to leave anne alone george was not accepting any apologies she still looked furious i suppose timmy went with you she said i think that was horrid of him to go without waking me when he knew id like to be with you on the adventure oh dont be so silly said dick in disgust fancy being angry with old tim too youre making him miserable and anyway he didnt come with us he just came to meet us when we got back and then went off to keep jock company on his way back to the farm oh said george and she reached out her hand to pat timmy who was filled with delight at least timmy was loyal to me then thats something there was a silence nobody ever knew quite how to treat george when she was in one of her moods it was really best to leave her to herself but they couldnt very well go off and leave the camp just because george was there cross and sulky anne took hold of georges arm she was miserable when george behaved like this george she began theres no need to be cross with me too havent done anything if you werent such a little coward too afraid to go with us id have been able to go too said george unkindly dragging her arm away julian was disgusted he saw annes hurt face and was angry with george shut up george he said youre being horrid saying catty things like that im astonished at you george was ashamed of herself but she was too proud to say so she glared at julian and im astonished at you she said after all the adventures weve had together you try to keep me out of this one but you will let me come next time wont you julian what after your frightful behaviour today said julian who could be just as obstinate as george when he wanted to certainly not this is my adventure and dicks and perhaps jocks not yours or annes he got up and stalked down the hill with dick george sat pulling bits of heather off the stems looking mutinous and angry anne blinked back tears she hated this sort of thing she got up to get dinner ready perhaps after a good meal they would all feel better mr luffy was sitting outside his tent reading he had already seen the children that morning he looked up smiling hallo come to talk to me yes said julian an idea uncurling itself in his mind could i have a look at that map of yours mr luffy the big one youve got showing every mile of these moorlands of course its in the tent somewhere said mr luffy the boys found it and opened it dick at once guessed why julian wanted it mr luffy went on reading it shows the railways that run under the moorlands too doesnt it said julian mr luffy nodded yes there are quite a few lines i suppose it was easier to tunnel under the moors from valley to valley rather than make a permanent way over the top of them in any case a railway over the moors would probably be completely snowed up in the wintertime the boys bent their heads over the big map it showed the railways as dotted lines when they went underground but by long black lines when they appeared in the open air in the various valleys they found exactly where they were then julians finger ran down the map a little and came to where a small line showed itself at the end of a dotted line he looked at dick who nodded yes that showed where the tunnel was out of which the spooktrain had come and the lines to the deserted yard julians finger went back from the yard to the tunnel where the dotted lines began his finger traced the dotted lines a little way till they became whole lines again that was where the train came out into another valley then his finger showed where the tunnel that led from the yard appeared to join up with another one that also ran for some distance before coming out into yet another valley the boys looked at one another in silence mr luffy suddenly spotted a dayflying moth and got up to follow it the boys took the chance of talking to one another the spooktrain either runs through its own tunnel to the valley beyond or it turns off into this fork and runs along to the other valley said julian in a low voice i tell you what well do dick well get mr luffy to run us down to the nearest town to buy something and well slip along to the station there and see if we cant make a few inquiries about these two tunnels we may find out something good idea said dick as mr luffy came back i say sir are you very busy today could you possibly run us down to the nearest town after dinner certainly certainly said mr luffy amiably the boys looked at one another in delight now they might find out something but they wouldnt take george with them no they would punish her for her bad temper by leaving her behind a thrilling plan anne called them to dinner come along she cried tve got it all ready tell mr luffy theres plenty for him too mr luffy came along willingly he thought anne was a marvellous camphousekeeper he looked approvingly at the spread set out on a white cloth on the ground hm salad hardboiled eggs slices of ham and whats this applepie my goodness dont tell me you cooked that here anne anne laughed no all this came from the farm of course except the lime juice and water george ate with the others but said hardly a word she was brooding over her wrongs and mr luffy looked at her several times puzzled are you quite well george he said suddenly george went red yes thank you she said and tried to be more herself though she couldnt raise a smile at all mr luffy watched her and was relieved to see that she ate as much as the others probably had some sort of row he guessed correctly well it would blow over he knew better than to interfere they finished lunch and drank all the lime juice it was a hot day and they were very thirsty indeed timmy emptied all his dish of water and went and gazed longingly into the canvas bucket of washing water but he was too wellbehaved to drink it now that he knew he mustnt anne laughed and poured some more water into his dish well said mr luffy beginning to fill his old brown pipe if anyone wants to come into town with me this afternoon ill be starting in fifteen minutes til come said anne at once it wont take george and me long to washup these things will you come too george no said george and the boys heaved a sigh of relief they had guessed she wouldnt want to come with them but if shed know what they were going to try and find out she would have come all right tm going for a walk with timmy said george when all the washingup had been done all right said anne who secretly thought that george would be much better left on her own to work off her illfeelings that afternoon see you later george and timmy set off the others went with mr luffy to where his car was parked beside the great rock they got in hi the trailers fastened to it called julian wait a bit let me get out and undo it we dont want to take an empty trailer bumping along behind us for miles dear me i always forget to undo the trailer said mr luffy vexed the times i take it along without meaning to the children winked at one another dear old luffy he was always doing things like that no wonder his wife fussed round him like an old hen with one foolish chicken when he was at home they went off in the car jolting over the rough road till they came to the smooth highway they stopped in the centre of the town mr luffy said he would meet them for tea at five oclock at the hotel opposite the parkingplace the three of them set off together leaving mr luffy to go to the library and browse there it seemed funny to be without george anne didnt much like it and said so well we dont like going off without george either said julian but honestly she cant behave like that and get away with it i thought shed grown out of that sort of thing well you know how she adores an adventure said anne oh dear if i hadnt felt so scared youd have taken me along and george would have gone too its quite true what she said about me being a coward youre not said dick you cant help being scared of things sometimes after all youre the youngest of us but being scared doesnt make you a coward ive known you to be as brave as any of us when youve been scared stiff where are we going asked anne the boys told her and her eyes sparkled oh are we going to find out where the spooktrain comes from it might come from one of two valleys then judging from the map yes the tunnels arent really very long ones said julian not more than a mile i should think we thought wed make some inquiries at the station and see if theres anyone who knows anything about the old railway yard and the tunnel beyond we shant say a word about the spooktrain of course they walked into the station they went up to a railway plan and studied it it didnt tell them much julian turned to a young porter who was wheeling some luggage along i say could you help us were camping up on the moorlands and were quite near a deserted railway yard with lines that run into an old tunnel why isnt the yard used any more dont know said the boy you should ask old tucky there see him he knows all the tunnels under the moors like the back of his hand worked in them all when he was a boy thanks said dick pleased they went over to where an old whiskered porter was sitting in the sun enjoying a rest till the next train came in excuse me said julian politely ive been told that you know all about the moorland tunnels like the back of your hand they must be very very interesting my father and my grandfather built those tunnels said the old porter looking up at the children out of small faded eyes that watered in the strong sunlight and ive been guard on all the trains that ran through them he mumbled a long string of names going through all the list of tunnels in his mind the children waited patiently till he had finished theres a tunnel near where were camping on the moorlands said julian getting a word in at last were not far from ollys farm we came across an old deserted railway yard with lines that led into a tunnel do you know it oh yes thats an old tunnel said tucky nodding his grey head on which his porters cap sat all crooked hasnt been used for many a long year nor the yard either wasnt enough traffic there far as i remember they shut up the yard tunnel isnt used any more the boys exchanged glances so it wasnt used any more well they knew better the tunnel joins another doesnt it said julian the porter pleased at their interest in the old tunnels he knew so well got up and went into an office behind he came out with a dirty muchused map which he spread out on his knee his black fingernail pointed to a mark on the map thats the yard see it was called ollys yard after the farm therere the lines to the tunnel heres the tunnel it runs right through to kilty vale there it is and heres where it used to join the tunnel to rokers vale but that was bricked up years ago something happened there the roof fell in i think it was and the company decided not to use the tunnel to rokers vale at all the children listened with the utmost interest julian reasoned things out in his mind if that spooktrain came from anywhere then it must come from kilty vale because that was the only place the lines went to now since the way to rokers vale had been bricked up where the tunnels joined i suppose no trains run through the tunnel from kilty vale to ollys yard now then he said tucky snorted didnt i tell you it hasnt been used for years the yard at kilty vales been turned into something else though the lines are still there theres been no engine through that tunnel since i was a young man this was all very very interesting julian thanked old tucky so profusely that he wanted to tell the children everything all over again he even gave them the old map oh thanks said julian delighted to have it he looked at the others thisll be jolly useful he said and they nodded they left the pleased old man and went out into the town they found a little park and sat down on a seat they were longing to discuss all that tucky had told them its jolly strange said dick no trains run there now the tunnels not been used for ages and ollys yard must have been derelict for years and yet there appear to be trains that come and go said julian then they must be spooktrains said anne her eyes wide and puzzled julian they must be mustnt they looks like it said julian its most mysterious i cant understand it ju said dick suddenly i know what well do well wait one night again till we see the spooktrain come out of the tunnel to the yard then one of us can sprint off to the other end of the tunnel its only about a mile long and wait for it to come out the other side then well find out why a train still runs from kilty vale to ollys yard through that old tunnel jolly good idea said julian thrilled what about tonight if jock comes he can go too if he doesnt just you and i will go nat george they all felt excited anne wondered if she would be brave enough to go too but she knew that when the night came she wouldnt feel half as brave as she did now no she wouldnt go there was really no need for her to join in this adventure at present it hadnt even turned out to be a proper one yet it was only an unsolved mystery george hadnt come back from her walk when they reached the camp they waited for her and at last she appeared with timmy looking tired out sorry i was an ass this morning she said at once ive walked my temper off dont know what came over me thats all right said julian amiably forget it they were all very glad that george had recovered her temper for she was a very prickly person indeed when she was angry she was rather subdued and said nothing at all about spooktrains or tunnels so they said nothing either the night was fine and clear stars shone out brilliantly again in the sky the children said good night to mr luffy at ten oclock and got into their sleepingbags julian and dick did not mean to go exploring till midnight so they lay and talked quietly about eleven oclock they heard somebody moving cautiously outside they wondered if it was jock but he did not call out to them who could it be then julian saw a familiar head outlined against the starlit sky it was george but what in the world was she doing he couldnt make it out at all whatever it was she wasnt making any noise over it and she obviously thought the boys were asleep julian gave a nice little snore or two just to let her go on thinking so at last she disappeared julian waited a few minutes and then put his head cautiously out of the tent opening he felt about and his fingers brushed against some string he grinned to himself and got back into the tent ive found out what george was doing he whispered shes put string across the entrance of our tent and i bet it runs to her tent and shes tied it to her big toe or something so that if we go out without her shell feel the pull of the string when we go through it and wake up and follow us good old george chuckled dick well shell be unlucky well squeeze out under the sides of the tent which was what they did do at about a minute past twelve they didnt disturb georges string at all they were out on the heather and away down the slope while george was sleeping soundly in her tent beside anne waiting for the pull on her toe which didnt come poor george the boys arrived at the deserted railway yard and looked to see if woodenleg sams candle was alight it was so the spooktrain hadnt come along that night yet they were just scrambling down to the yard when they heard the train coming there was the same rumbling noise as before muffled by the tunnel and then out of the tunnel again with no lamps came the spooktrain clanking on its way to the yard quick dick you sprint off to the tunnel opening and watch for the train to go back in again and ill find my way across the moor to the other end of the tunnel there was a path marked on that old map and ill follow that julians words tumbled over each other in his excitement til jolly well watch for the spooktrain to complete its journey and see if it vanishes into thin air or what and off he went to find the path that led over the moors to the other end of the tunnel he meant to see what happened at the other end if he had to run all the way jock comes to camp julian found the path quite by chance and went along it as fast as he could he used his torch for he did not think he would meet anyone out on such a lonely way at that time of night the path was very much overgrown but he could follow it fairly easily even running at times if that spooktrain stops about twenty minutes in the yard again as it did before it will give me just about time to reach the other end of the tunnel panted julian til be at kiltys yard before it comes it seemed a very long way but at last the path led downwards and some way below him julian could see what might be a railway yard then he saw that big sheds were built there or what looked like big sheds in the starlight he remembered what the old porter had said kiltys yard was used for something else nowmaybe the lines had been taken up maybe even the tunnel had been stopped up too he slipped quickly down the path and came into what had once been the old railway yard big buildings loomed up on every side julian thought they must be workshops of some kind he switched his torch on and off very quickly but the short flash had shown him what he was looking for two pairs of railway lines they were old and rusty but he knew they must lead to the tunnel he followed them closely right up to the black mouth of the dark tunnel he couldnt see inside at all he switched his torch on and off quickly yes the lines led right inside the tunnel julian stopped and wondered what to do til sneak into the tunnel a little way and see if its bricked up anywhere he thought so in he went walking between one pair of lines he put on his torch certain that no one would see its light and challenge him to say what he was doing out so late at night the tunnel stretched before him a great yawning hole disappearing into deep blackness it was certainly not bricked up julian saw a little niche in the brickwork of the tunnel and decided to crouch in it it was one of the niches made for workmen to stand in when trains went by in the old days julian crouched down in the dirty old niche and waited he glanced at the luminous face of his watch he had been twenty minutes getting here maybe the train would be along in a few minutes he would be very very close to it julian couldnt help wishing that dick was with him it was so eerie waiting there in the dark for a mysterious train that apparently belonged to no one and came and went from nowhere to nowhere he waited and he waited once he thought he heard a rumble far away down the tunnel and he held his breath feeling certain that the train was coming but it didnt come julian waited for half an hour and still the train had not appeared what had happened to it til wait another ten minutes and then im going julian decided tve had about enough of hiding in a dark dirty tunnel waiting for a train that doesnt come maybe it has decided to stay in ollys yard for the night after ten minutes he gave it up he left the tunnel went into kiltys yard and then up the path to the moors he hurried along it eager to see if dick was at the other end of the tunnel surely he would wait there till julian came back dick was there tired and impatient when he saw a quick flash from julians torch he answered it with his own the two boys joined company thankfully you have been ages said dick reproachfully what happened the spooktrain went back into the tunnel ages and ages ago it only stayed about twenty minutes in the yard again went back into the tunnel exclaimed julian did it really well it never came out the other side i waited for ages i never even heard it though i did hear a very faint rumble once or thought i did the boys fell silent puzzled and mystified what sort of a train was this that puffed out of a tunnel at dead of night and went back again but didnt appear out of the other end i suppose the entrance to that second tunnel the porter told us about is really bricked up said julian at last if it wasnt the train could go down there of course yes thats the only solution if the trains a real one and not a spook one agreed dick well we cant go exploring the tunnels now lets wait and do it in the daytime ive had enough tonight julian had had enough too in silence the two boys went back to camp they quite forgot the string in front of their tent and scrambled right through it they got into the sleepingbags thankfully the string fastened to georges big toe through a hole she had cut in her sleepingbag pulled hard and george woke up with a jump timmy was awake having heard the boys come back he licked george when she sat up george had not undressed properly she slipped quickly out of her bag and crawled out of her tent now she would catch the two boys going off secretly and follow them but there was no sign or sound of them anywhere around she crawled silently to their tent both boys had fallen asleep immediately tired out with their midnight trip julian snored a little and dick breathed so deeply that george could quite well hear him as she crouched outside listening she was very puzzled someone had pulled at her toe so somebody must have scrambled through that string after listening for a few minutes she gave it up and went back to her tent in the morning george was furious julian and dick related their nights adventure and george could hardly believe that once again they had gone without her and that they had managed to get away without disturbing the string dick saw georges face and couldnt help laughing sorry old thing we discovered your little trick and avoided it when we set out but typically we forgot all about it coming back we must have given your toe a frightful tug did we i suppose you did tie the other end of the string to your toe george looked as if she could throw all the breakfast things at him fortunately for everyone jock arrived at that moment he didnt wear his usual beaming smile but seemed rather subdued hallo jock said julian just in time for a spot of breakfast sit down and join us i cant said jock ive only a few minutes listen isnt it rotten im to go away and stay with my stepfathers sister for two weeks two weeks youll be gone when i come back wont you yes but jock why have you got to go away said dick surprised has there been a row or something i dont know said jock mum wont say but she looks pretty miserable my stepfathers in a frightful temper its my opinion they want me out of the way for some reason i dont know this sister of my stepfathers very well only met her once but shes pretty awful well come over here and stay with us if they want to get rid of you said julian sorry for jock jocks face brightened i say thats a fine idea he said smashing agreed dick well i dont see whats to stop you if they want to get rid of you it cant matter where you go for a fortnight wed love to have you right ill come said jock ill not say a word about it though to my stepfather ill let mum into the secret she was going to take me away today but ill just tell her im coming to you instead i dont think shell split on me and i hope shell square things with my stepaunt jocks face beamed again now the others beamed back even george and timmy wagged his tail it would be nice to have jock and what a lot they had to tell him he went off to break the news to his mother while the others washed up and cleared things away george became sulky again when jock was gone she simply could not or would not realise that julian meant what he said when they began to discuss everything that had happened the night before george refused to listen im not going to bother about your stupid spooktrains any more she said you wouldnt let me join you when i wanted to and now i shant take any interest in the matter and she walked off with timmy not saying where she was going well let her go said julian exasperated and cross what does she expect me to do climb down and say well let her come the next night we go we said wed go in the daytime said dick she could come then because if anne doesnt want to come it wont matter leaving her here alone in the daytime youre right said julian lets call her back and tell her but by that time george was out of hearing shes taken sandwiches said anne she means to be gone all day isnt she an idiot jock came back after a time with two rugs and an extra jersey and more food i had hard work to persuade mum he said but she said yes at last though mind you id have come anyhow im not going to be shoved about by my stepfather just out of spite i say isnt this great i never thought id be camping out with you if there isnt room in your tent for me julian i can sleep out on the heather therell be room said julian hallo mr luffy youve been out early mr luffy came up and glanced at jock ah is this your friend from the farm how do you do come to spend a few days with us i see you have an armful of rugs yes jocks coming to camp a bit with us said julian look at all the food hes brought enough to stand a siege it is indeed said mr luffy well im going to go through some of my specimens this morning what are you going to do oh mess about till lunchtime said julian then we might go for a walk mr luffy went back to his tent and they could hear him whistling softly as he set to work suddenly jock sat up straight and looked alarmed whats the matter asked dick then he heard what jock had heard a shrill whistle blown loudly by somebody some way off thats my stepfathers whistle said jock hes whistling for me mum must have told him or else hes found out ive come over here quick lets scoot away and hide said anne if youre not here he cant take you back come on maybe hell get tired of looking for you and go nobody could think of a better idea and certainly nobody wanted to face a furious mr andrews all four shot down the slope and made their way to where the heather was high and thick they burrowed into it and lay still hidden by some high bracken mr andrewss voice could soon be heard shouting for jock but no jock appeared mr andrews came out by mr luffys tent mr luffy surprised at the shouting put his head out of his tent to see what it was all about he didnt like the look of mr andrews at all wheres jock mr andrews demanded scowling at him i really do not know said mr luffy hes got to come back said mr andrews roughly i wont have him hanging about here with those kids whats wrong with them inquired mr luffy i must say i find them very wellbehaved and pleasantmannered mr andrews stared at mr luffy and put him down as a silly harmless old fellow who would probably help him to get jock back if he went about it the right way now look here said mr andrews i dont know who you are but you must be a friend of the childrens and if so then id better warn you theyre running into danger see really in what way asked mr luffy mildly and disbelievingly well theres bad and dangerous places about these moorlands said mr andrews very bad i know them and those children have been messing about in them see and if jock comes here hell start messing about too and i dont want him to get into any danger it would break his mothers heart quite said mr luffy well will you talk to him and send him back said mr andrews that railway yard now thats a most dangerous place and folks do say that therere spooktrains there i wouldnt want jock to be mixed up in anything of that sort quite said mr luffy again looking closely at mr andrews you seem very concerned about this er railway yard me oh no said mr andrews never been near the horrible place i wouldnt want to see spooktrains make me run a mile its just that i dont want jock to get into danger id be most obliged if youd talk to him and send him home when they all come back from wherever they are quite said mr luffy again most irritatingly mr andrews gazed at mr luffys bland face and suddenly wished he could smack it quite quite quite grrrrrrr he turned and went away when he had gone for some time and was a small speck in the distance mr luffy called loudly hes gone please send jock here so that i can er address a few words to him four children appeared from their heathery hidingplace jock went over to mr luffy looking mutinous i just wanted to say said mr luffy that i quite understand why you want to be away from your stepfather and that i consider its no business of mine where you go in order to get away from him jock grinned oh thanks awfully he said i thought you were going to send me back he rushed over to the others its all right he said im going to stay and i say what about going and exploring down that tunnel after lunch we might find that spooktrain then good idea said julian we will poor old george shell miss that little adventure too george has an adventure george had gone off with one fixed idea in her mind she was going to find out something about that mysterious tunnel she thought she would walk over the moorlands to kiltys yard and see what she could see there maybe she could walk right back through the tunnel itself she soon came to ollys yard there it lay below her with woodenleg sam pottering about she went down to speak to him he didnt see or hear her coming and jumped violently when she called to him he swung round squinting at her fiercely you clear off he shouted ive been told to keep you children out of here see do you want me to lose my job who told you to keep us out asked george puzzled as to who could have known they had been in the yard he did see said the old man he rubbed his eyes and then peered at george shortsightedly again ive broken my glasses he said whos he the person who told you to keep us out said george but the old watchman seemed to have one of his sudden strange changes of temper again he bent down and picked up a large cinder he was about to fling it at george when timmy gave a loud and menacing growl sam dropped his arm you clear out he said you dont want to get a poor old man like me into trouble do you you look a nice kind boy you do you wouldnt get woodenleg sam into trouble would you george turned to go she decided to take the path that led to the tunnel and peep inside but when she got there there was nothing to see she didnt feel that she wanted to walk all alone inside that dark mouth so she took the path that julian had taken the night before over the top of the tunnel but she left it halfway to look at a curious bump that jutted up from the heather just there she scraped away at the heather and found something hard beneath she pulled at it but it would not give timmy thinking she was obligingly digging for rabbits came to help he scrambled below the heather and then he suddenly gave a bark of fright and disappeared george screamed timmy what have you done where are you to her enormous relief she heard timmys bark some way down where could he be she called again and once more timmy barked george tugged at the tufts of heather and then suddenly she saw what the curious mound was it was a builtup venthole for the old tunnel a place where the smoke came curling out in the days when trains ran there often it had been barred across with iron but the bars had rusted and fallen in and heather had grown thickly over them oh timmy you must have fallen down the vent said george anxiously but not very far down wait a bit and ill see what i can do if only the others were here to help but they werent and george had to work all by herself to try and get down to the broken bars it took her a very long time but at last she had them exposed and saw where timmy had fallen down he kept giving short little barks as if to say its all right i can wait im not hurt george had to sit down and take a rest after her efforts she was hungry but she said to herself that she would not eat till she had somehow got down to timmy and found out where he was soon she began her task again she climbed down through the fallenin vent it was very difficult and she was terrified of the rusty old iron bars breaking off under her weight but they didnt once down in the vent she discovered steps made of great iron nails projecting out some of them had thin rungs across there had evidently once been a ladder up to the top of the vent most of the rungs had gone but the iron nails that supported them still stood in the brick walls of the old round vent she heard timmy give a little bark he was quite near her now cautiously she went down the great hole her foot touched timmy he had fallen on a collection of broken iron bars which caught in part of the old iron ladder stuck out from it and made a rough landingplace for the dog to fall on oh timmy said george horrified however am i going to get you out of here this hole goes right down into the tunnel she couldnt possibly pull timmy up the hole it was equally impossible to get him down he could never climb down the iron ladder especially as it had so many rungs missing george was in despair oh timmy why did i lose my temper and walk out on the others to do some exploring all by myself dont fall timmy youll break your legs if you do timmy had no intention of falling he was frightened but so far his curious landingplace felt firm he kept quite still listen tim said george at last the only thing i can think of is to climb down round it somehow and see how far it is to the tunnel itself there might even be someone there to help no thats silly there cant be but i might find an old rope anything that i could use to help you down with oh dear what a horrible nightmare george gave timmy a reassuring pat and then began to feel about for the iron rungs with her feet further down they were all there and it was easy to climb lower and lower she was soon down in the tunnel itself she had her torch with her and switched it on then she nearly gave a scream of horror just near to her was a silent train she could almost touch the engine was it could it be the spooktrain itself george stared at it breathing fast it looked very very old and outofdate it was smaller than the trains she was used to the engine was smaller and so were the trucks the funnel was longer and the wheels were different from those of ordinary trains george stared at the silent train by the light of her torch her mind in a muddle she really didnt know what to think it must be the spooktrain it had come from this tunnel the night before and had gone back again and it hadnt run all the way through to kiltys yard because julian had watched for it and it hadnt come out there no it had run here to the middle of the dark tunnel and there it stood waiting for night so that it might run again george shivered the train belonged to years and years ago who drove it at night did anybody or did it run along without a driver remembering its old days and old ways no that was silly trains didnt think or remember george shook herself and remembered timmy and just at that very moment poor timmy lost his foothold on the iron bars and fell he had stretched out to listen for george his foot had slipped and now he was hurtling down the vent he gave a mournful howl he struck against part of the ladder and that stopped his headlong fall for a moment but down he went again scrabbling as he fell trying to get hold of something to save himself george heard him howl and knew he was falling she was so horrorstricken that she simply couldnt move she stood there at the bottom of the vent like a statue not even breathing timmy fell with a thump beside her and a groan was jerked out of him in a trice george was down by him on her knees timmy are you hurt are you alive oh timmy say something woof said timmy and got up rather unsteadily on his four legs he had fallen on a pile of the softest soot the smoke of many many years had sooted the walls of the vent and the weather had sent it down to the bottom until quite a pile had collected at one side timmy had fallen plump in the middle of it and almost buried himself he shook himself violently and soot flew out all over george she didnt know or care she hugged him and her face and clothes grew as black as soot she felt about and found the soft pile that had saved timmy from being hurt its soot i came down the other side of the vent so i didnt know the soot was there oh timmy what a bit of luck for you i thought youd be killed or at least badly hurt said george he licked her sooty nose and didnt like the taste of it george stood up she didnt like the idea of climbing up that horrid vent again and anyway timmy couldnt the only thing to do was to walk out of the tunnel she wouldnt have fancied walking through the tunnel before in case she met the spooktrainbut here it was close beside her and she had been so concerned about timmy that she had quite forgotten it timmy went over to the engine and smelt the wheels then he jumped up into the cab somehow the sight of timmy doing that took away all georges fear if timmy could jump up into the spooktrain there couldnt be much for her to be afraid of she decided to examine the trucks there were four of them all covered trucks shining her torch she climbed up into one of them pulling timmy up behind her she expected to find it quite empty unloaded many many years ago by longforgotten rail way men but it was loaded with boxes george was surprised why did a spooktrain run about with boxes in it she shone her torch on to one and then quickly switched it out she had heard a noise in the tunnel she crouched down in the truck put her hand on timmys collar and listened timmy listened too the hackles rising on his neck it was a clanging noise then there came a bang then a light shone out and the tunnel was suddenly as bright as day the light came from a great lamp in the side of the tunnel george peeped cautiously out through a crack in the truck she saw that this place must be where the tunnel forked one fork went on to kiltys yard but surely the other fork was supposed to be bricked up george followed the lines with her eyes one set went on down the tunnel to kiltys yard the other set ran straight into a great wall which was built across the second tunnel that once led to rokers yard yes it is bricked up just as the old porter told julian said george to herself and then she stared in the greatest amazement clutching the side of the truck hardly believing her eyes part of the wall was opening before her before her very eyes a great mass of it slid back in the centre of the wall back and back until a strangeshaped opening about the size of the train itself showed in the thick wall george gasped whatever could be happening a man came through the opening george felt sure she had seen him before somewhere he came up to the engine of the train and swung himself into the cab there were all sorts of sounds then from the cab what was the man doing starting the fire to run the train george did not dare to try and see she was trembling now and timmy pressed himself against her to comfort her then came another set of noises steam noises the man must be going to start the engine moving smoke came from the funnel more noises and some clanks and clangs it suddenly occurred to george that the man might be going to take the train through that little opening in the brickedup wall thensupposing he shut the wall up again george would be a prisoner she would be in the truck hidden behind that wall and the wall would be closed so that she couldnt escape i must get out before its too late thought george in a panic i only hope the man doesnt see me but just as she was about to try and get out the engine gave a loud choochoo and began to move backwards it ran down the lines a little way then forward again and this time its wheels were on the set of lines that led to the second tunnel where the small opening now showed so clearly in the wall george didnt dare to get out of the moving train so there she crouched as the engine steamed quickly to the hole in the wall that stretched right across the other tunnel that hole just fitted it it must have been made for it thought george as the train moved through it the train went right through and came out in another tunnel here there was a bright light too george peered out through the crack there was more than a tunnel here what looked like vast caves stretched away on each side of the tunnel and men lounged about in them who on earth were they and what were they doing with that old train there was a curious noise at the back of the train the hole in the stout brick wall closed up once more now there was no way in or out its like the opensesame trick in ali baba and the forty thieves thought george and like ali baba im in the cave and dont know the way to get myself out thank goodness timmy is with me the train was now at a standstill behind it was the thick wall and then george saw that in front of it was a thick wall too this tunnel must be bricked up in two places and in between was this extraordinary cavern or whatever it was george puzzled her head over the strange place but couldnt make head or tail ofit well whatever would the others say if they knew you and i were actually in the spooktrain itself tucked away in its hidingplace where nobody in the world can find it whispered george to timmy what are we to do timmy timmy wagged his tail cautiously he didnt understand all this he wanted to lie low for a bit and see how things turned out well wait till the men have gone away timmy whispered george that is if they ever do then well get out and see if we can manage that opensesame entrance and get away wed better tell mr luffy about all this theres something very strange and very mysterious here and weve fallen headlong into it in the tunnel again jock was really enjoying himself at the camp he had a picnic lunch with the others and ate as much as they did looking very happy mr luffy joined them and jock beamed at him feeling that he was a real friend wheres george asked mr luffy gone off by herself said julian have you quarrelled by any chance said mr luffy a bit said julian we have to let george get over it by herself mr luffy shes like that wheres she gone said mr luffy helping himself to a tomato why isnt she back to dinner shes taken hers with her said anne i feel a bit worried about her somehow i hope shes all right mr luffy looked alarmed i feel a bit worried myself he said still shes got timmy with her were going off on a bit of exploring said julian when they had all finished eating what are you going to do mr luffy i think ill come with you said mr luffy unexpectedly the childrens hearts sank they couldnt possibly go exploring for spooktrains in the tunnel if mr luffy was with them well i dont think it will be very interesting for you sir said julian rather feebly however mr luffy took the hint andrealised he wasnt wanted that afternoon right he said in that case ill stay here and mess about the children sighed with relief anne cleared up with jock helping her and then they called goodbye to mr luffy and set off taking their tea with them jock was full of excitement he was so pleased to be with the others and he kept thinking of sleeping in the camp that night what am it would be good old mr luffy taking his side like that he bounded after the others joyfully as they went off to the old railway yard woodenleg sam was pottering about there as usual they waved to him but he didnt wave back instead he shook his fist at them and tried to bawl in his husky voice you clear out trespassing thats what you are dont you come down here or ill chase you well we wont go down then said dick with a grin poor old man thinking of chasing us with that wooden leg of his we wont give him the chance well just walk along here climb down the lines and walk up them to the tunnel which is what they did much to the rage of poor sam he yelled till his voice gave out but they took no notice and walked quickly up the lines the mouth of the tunnel looked very round and black as they came near now well jolly well walk right through this tunnel and see where that spooktrain is that came out of it the other night said julian it didnt come out the other end so it must be somewhere in the middle of the tunnel if its a real spooktrain it might completely disappear said anne not liking the look of the dark tunnel at all the others laughed it wont have disappeared said dick we shall come across it somewhere and well examine it thoroughly and try and find out exactly what it is and why it comes and goes in such a mysterious manner they walked into the black tunnel and switched on their torches which made little gleaming paths in front of them they walked up the middle of one pair of lines julian in front keeping a sharp lookout for anything in the shape of a train the lines ran on and on the childrens voices sounded weird and echoing in the long tunnel anne kept close to dick and half wished she hadnt come then she remembered that george had called her a coward and she put up her head determined not to show that she was scared jock talked almost without stopping tve never done anything like this in my life i call this a proper adventure hunting for spooktrains in a dark tunnel it makes me feel nice and shivery all over i do hope we find the train it simply must be here somewhere they walked on and on and on but there was no sign of any train they came to where the tunnel forked into the second one that used to run to rokers vale julian flashed his torch on the enormous brick wall that stretched across the second tunnel yes its well and truly bricked up he said so that only leaves this tunnel to explore come on they went on again little knowing that george and timmy were behind that brick wall hidden in a truck of the spooktrain itself they walked on and on down the lines and found nothing interesting at all they saw a little round circle of bright light some way in front of them see that said julian that must be the end of this tunnel the opening that goes into kiltys yard well if the train isnt between here and kiltys yard its gone in silence they walked down the rest of the tunnel and came out into the open air workshops were built all over kiltys yard the entrance to the tunnel was weedgrown and neglected weeds grew even across the lines there well no train has been out of this tunnel here for years said julian looking at the thick weeds the wheels would have chopped the weeds to bits its extraordinary said dick puzzled weve been right through the tunnel and theres no train there at all yet we know it goes in and out of it whats happened to it it is a spooktrain said jock his face red with excitement must be it only exists at night and then comes out on its lines like it used to do years ago i dont like thinking that said anne troubled its a horrid thought what are we going to do now julian asked we seem to have come to a blank no train nothing to see empty tunnel what a dull end to an adventure lets walk back all the way again said jock he wanted to squeeze as much out of this adventure as he could i know we shant see the train this time any more than we did the last time but you never know im not coming through that tunnel again said anne i want to be out in the sun ill walk over the top of the tunnel along the path there that julian took the other night and you three can walk back and meet me at the other end right said julian and the three boys disappeared into the dark tunnel anne ran up the path that led alongside the top of it how good it was to be in the open air again that horrid tunnel she ran along cheerfully glad to be out in the sun she got to the other end of the tunnel quite quickly and sat down on the path above the yard to wait for the others she looked for woodenleg sam he was nowhere to be seen perhaps he was in his little hut she hadnt been there for more than two minutes when something surprising happened a car came bumping slowly down the rough track to the yard anne sat up and watched a man got out and annes eyes almost fell out of her head why it was surely it was mr andrews jocks stepfather he went over to sams hut and threw open the door anne could hear the sound of voices then she heard another noise the sound of a heavy lorry coming she saw it come cautiously down the steep rough track it ran into an old tumbledown shed and stayed there then three men came out and anne stared at them where had she seen them before of course theyre the farm labourers at jocks farm she thought but what are they doing here how very strange mr andrews joined the men and to annes dismay they began to walk up the lines to the tunnel her heart almost stopped goodness julian dick and jock were still in that tunnel walking through it they would bump right into mr andrews and his men and then what would happen mr andrews had warned them against going there and had ordered jock not to go anne stared at the four men walking into the faroff mouth of the tunnel what could she do how could she warn the boys she couldnt she would just have to stay there and wait for them to come out probably chased by a furious mr andrews and the other men oh dear dear if they were caught they would probably all get an awful telling off what could she do i can only wait thought poor anne theres nothing else to do oh do come julian dick and jock i darent do anything but wait for you she waited and waited it was now long past teatime julian had the tea so there was nothing for anne to eat nobody came out of the tunnel not a sound was heard anne at last decided to go down and ask woodenleg sam a few questions so rather afraid the girl set off down to the yard sam was in his hut drinking cocoa and looking very sour something had evidently gone wrong when he saw annes shadow across the doorway he got up at once shaking his fist what you children again you went into that tunnel this afternoon and so i went up and telephoned mr andrews to come and catch you all poking your noses in all the time how did you get out of that tunnel are the others with you didnt mr andrews catch you eh anne listened to all this in horror so old sam had actually managed to telephone mr andrews and tell tales on them so that jocks stepfather and his men had come to catch them this was worse than ever you come in here said sam suddenly and he darted his big arm at her come on i dont know where the others are but ill get one of you anne gave a scream and ran away at top speed woodenleg sam went after her for a few yards and then gave it up he bent down and picked up a handful of cinders a shower of them fell all round anne and made her run faster than ever she tore up the path to the heather and was soon on the moors again panting and sobbing oh julian oh dick whats happened to you oh wheres george if only she would come home shed be brave enough to look for them but im not i must tell mr luffy hell know what to do she ran on and on her feet catching continually in the tufts of thick heather she kept falling over and scrambling up again she now had only one idea in her mind to find mr luffy and tell him every single thing yes she would tell him about the spooktrains and all there was something strange and important about the whole thing now and she wanted a grownups help she staggered on and on mr luffy oh mr luffy where are you mr luffy but no mr luffy answered her she came round the gorse bushes she thought were the ones sheltering the camp but alas the camp was not there anne had lost her way im lost said anne the tears running down her cheeks but i mustnt get scared i must try to find the right path now oh dear im quite lost mr luffy poor anne she stumbled on blindly hoping to come to the camp calling every now and again mr luffy can you hear me mr lufffffffy an amazing find in the meantime what had happened to the three boys walking back through the tunnel they had gone slowly along examining the lines to see if a train could have possibly run along them recently few weeds grew in the dark airless tunnel so they could not tell by those but when they came about halfway julian noticed an interesting thing look he said flashing his torch on to the lines before and behind them see that the lines are black and rusty behind us now but here this pair of lines is quite bright as if they had been used a lot he was right behind them stretched black and rusty lines sometimes buckled in places but in front of them stretching to the mouth of the tunnel leading to ollys yard the lines were bright as if trainwheels had run along them thats funny said dick looks as if the spooktrain ran only from here to ollys yard and back but why and where in the world is it now its vanished into thin air julian was as puzzled as dick where could a train be if it was not in the tunnel it had obviously run to the middle of the tunnel and then stopped but where had it gone now lets go to the mouth of the tunnel and see if the lines are bright all the way said julian at last we cant discover much here unless the train suddenly materialises in front of us they went on down the tunnel their torches flashing on the lines in front of them they talked earnestly as they went they didnt see four men waiting for them four men who crouched in a little niche at the side of the tunnel waiting there in the dark well said julian i think and then he stopped because four dark figures suddenly pounced on the three boys and held them fast julian gave a shout and struggled but the man who had hold of him was far too strong to escape from their torches were flung to the ground julians broke and the other two torches lay there their beams shining on the feet of the struggling company it didnt take more than twenty seconds to make each boy a captive his arms behind his back julian tried to kick but his captor twisted his arm so fiercely that he groaned in pain and stopped his kicking look here whats all this about demanded dick who are you and what do you think youre doing were only three boys exploring an old tunnel whats the harm in that take them all away said a voice that everyone recognised at once mr andrews is it you cried julian set us free you know us the boys at the camp and jocks here too what do you think youre doing mr andrews didnt answer but he gave poor jock a box on the right ear that almost sent him to the ground their captors turned them about and led them roughly up the tunnel towards the middle nobody had a torch so it was all done in the darkness and the three boys stumbled badly though the men seemed surefooted enough they came to a halt after a time mr andrews left them and julian heard him go off somewhere to the left then there came a curious noise a bang a clank and then a sliding grating sound what could be happening julian strained his eyes in the darkness but he could see nothing at all he didnt know that mr andrews was opening the brickedup wall through which the train had gone he didnt know that he and the others were being pushed out of the first tunnel into the other one through the curious hole in the wall the three boys were shoved along in the darkness not daring to protest now they were in the curious place between the two walls which were built right across the place where the second tunnel forked from the first one the place where the spooktrain stood in silence the place where george was still hidden in one of the trucks with timmy but nobody knew that of course not even mr andrews guessed that a girl and a dog were listening in a truck nearby he put on a torch and flashed it in the faces of the three boys who although they were not showing any fear felt rather scared all the same this was so weird and unexpected and they had no idea where they were at all you were warned not to go down to that yard said the voice of one of the men you were told it was a bad and dangerous place so it is and youve got to suffer for not taking heed of the warning youll be tied up and left here till weve finished our business maybe thatll be three days maybe itll be three weeks look here you cant keep us prisoner for all that time said julian alarmed why there will be search parties out for us all over the place they will be sure to find us oh no they wont said the voice nobody will find you here now peters tie em up peters tied the three boys up they had their legs tied and their arms too and were set down roughly against a wall julian protested again what are you doing this for were quite harmless we dont know a thing about your business whatever it is were not taking any chances said the voice it was not mr andrewss voice but a firm strong one full of determination and a large amount of annoyance what about mum said jock suddenly to his stepfather shell be worried well let her be worried said the voice again answering before mr andrews could say a word its your own fault you were warned the feet of the four men moved away then there came the same noises again as the boys had heard before they were made by the hole in the wall closing up but the boys didnt know that they couldnt imagine what they were the noises stopped and there was dead silence there was also pitch darkness the three boys strained their ears and felt sure that the men had gone well the brutes whatever are they up to said julian in a low voice trying to loosen the ropes round his hands theyve got some secret to hide said dick gosh theyve tied my feet so tightly that the rope is cutting into my flesh whats going to happen came jocks scared voice this adventure didnt seem quite so grand to him now sh said julian suddenly i can hear something they all lay and listened what was it they could hear its its a dbg whining said dick suddenly it was it was timmy in the truck with george he had heard the voices of the boys he knew and he wanted to get to them but george not sure yet that the men had gone still had her hand on his collar her heart beat for joy to think she was alone no longer the three boys and anne too perhaps were there in the same strange place as she and timmy were the boys listened hard the whining came again then george let go her hold of timmys collar and he leapt headlong out of the truck his feet pattered eagerly over the ground he went straight to the boys in the darkness and julian felt a wet tongue licking his face a warm body pressed against him and a little bark told him who it was timmy i say dick its timmy cried julian in joy where did he come from timmy is it really you woof said timmy and licked dick next and then jock wheres george then wondered dick here said a voice and out of the truck scrambled george switching on her torch as she did so she went over to the boys whatevers happened how did you come here were you captured or something yes said julian but georgewhere are we and what are you doing here too its like a peculiar dream til cut your ropes first before i stop to explain anything said george and she took out her sharp knife in a few moments she had cut the boys bonds and they all sat up rubbing their sore ankles and wrists groaning thanks george now i feel fine said julian getting up where are we gracious is that an engine there whavs it doing here that julian is the spooktrain said george with a laugh yes it is really but we walked all the way down the tunnel and out of the other end without finding it said julian puzzled its most mysterious listen ju said george you know where that second tunnel is bricked up dont you well theres a way in through the wall a whole bit of it moves back in a sort of opensesame manner the spooktrain can run in through the hole on the rails once its beyond the wall it stops and the hole is closed up again george switched her torch round to show the astonished boys the wall through which they had come then she swung her torch to the big wall opposite see that she said there are two walls across this second tunnel with a big space in between where the spooktrain hides clever isnt it it would be if i could see any sense in it said julian but i cant why should anyone mess about with a silly spooktrain at night thats what weve got to find out said george and nows our chance look julian look at all the caves stretching out on either side of the tunnel here they would make wonderful hidingplaces what for said dick i cant make head or tail of this george swung her torch on the three boys and then asked a sudden question i say wheres anne anne she didnt want to come back with us through the tunnel so she ran over the moorlands to meet us at the other end by ollys yard said julian shell be worried stiff wont she when we dont turn up i only hope she doesnt come wandering up the tunnel to meet us shell run into those men if she does everyone felt worried anne hated the tunnel and she would be very frightened if people pounced on her in the darkness julian turned to george swing your torch round and lets see these caves there doesnt seem to be anyone here now we could have a snoop round george swung her torch round and julian saw vast and apparently fathomless caves stretching out on either side cut out of the sides of the tunnel jock saw something else by the light of the torch he caught sight of a switch on the wall perhaps it opened the hole in the wall he crossed to it and pulled it down immediately the place was flooded with a bright light it was a lightswitch he had found they all blinked in the sudden glare thats better said julian pleased good for you jock now we can see what were doing he looked at the spooktrain standing silently near them on its rails it certainly looked very old and forgotten as if it belonged to the last century not to this its quite a museum piece said julian with interest so thats what we heard puffing in and out of the tunnel at night old spooky i hid in that truck there said george pointing and she told them her own adventure the boys could hardly believe she had actually puffed into this secret place hidden on the spooktrain itself come on now lets look at these caves said dick they went over to the nearest one it was packed with crates and boxes of all kinds julian pulled one open and whistled all black market stuff i imagine look herecrates of tea crates of whisky and brandy boxes and boxes of stuff goodness knows what this is a real black market hidingplace the boys explored a little further the caves were piled high with valuable stuff worth thousands of pounds all stolen i suppose said dick but what do they do with it i mean how do they dispose of it they bring it here in the train of course and hide it but they must have some way of getting rid of it would they repack it on the rain and run it back to the yard when they had enough lorries to take it away said julian no said dick of course not let me see they steal it pile it on to lorries at night take it somewhere temporarily yes to my mothers farm said jock in a scared voice all those lorries there in the barn thats what theyre used for and they come down to ollys yard at night and the stuff is loaded in secret on the old train that comes puffing out to meet them and then its taken back here and hidden wheeeeeew julian whistled youre right jock thats just what happens what a cunning plot to use a perfectly honest little farm as a hidingplace to stock the farm with blackmarket men for labourers no wonder they are such bad workers and to wait for dark nights to run the stuff down to the yard and load it on the train your stepfather must make a lot of money at this game said dick to jock yes thats why he can afford to pour money into the farm said jock miserably poor mum this will break her heart all the same i dont think my step fathers the chief one in this theres somebody behind him yes said julian thinking of the mean little mr andrews with his big nose and weak chin there probably is now ive thought of something else if this stuff is got rid of in any other way except down the tunnel it came up there must somewhere be a way out of these caves i believe youre right said george and if there is well find it and whats more well escape that way come on said julian and he switched off the glaring light your torch will give enough light now well try this cave first keep your eyes open all of you a way of escape the four children and timmy went into the big cave they made their way round piles of boxes chests and crates marvelling at the amount the men must have stolen from time to time these arent manmade caves said julian theyre natural i expect the roof did perhaps fall in where the two tunnels met and the entrance between them was actually blocked up but were two walls built then said dick oh no we cant guess how it was that this black market hidingplace came into existence said julian but it might perhaps have been known there were caves here and when someone came prospecting along the tunnel one day maybe they even found an old train buried under a rooffall or something like that and resurrected it and built another wall secretly for a hidingplace and used the train for their own purposes said dick made that secret entrance too how ingenious or its possible the place was built during the last war said julian maybe secret experiments were carried on here and given up afterwards the place might have been discovered by the black marketeers then and used in this clever way we cant tell they had wandered for a good way in the cave by now without finding anything of interest beyond the boxes and chests of all kinds of goods then they came to where a pile was very neatly arranged with numbers chalked on boxes that were built up one on top of another julian halted now this looks as if these boxes were about to be shifted off somewhere he said all put in order and numbered surely the exit must be somewhere here he took georges torch from her and flashed it all round then he found what he wanted the beam of light shone steadily on a strong roughlymade wooden door set in the wall of the cave they went over to it in excitement this is what we want said julian i bet this is the exit to some very lonely part of the moors not far from a road that lorries can come along to collect any goods carried out of here there are some very deserted roads over these moors running in the middle of miles of lonely moorland its a clever organisation said dick lorries stored at an innocent farm full of goods for hiding in the tunnelcaves at a convenient time the train comes out in the dark to collect the goods and takes them back here till the hue and cry after the goods has died down then out they go through this door to the moorlands down to the lorries which come to collect them and whisk them away to the black market i told you how i saw peters late one night locking up the barn didnt i said jock excitedly well he must have got the lorry full of stolen goods then and the next night he loaded them on to the spooktrain thats about it said julian who had been trying the door to see if he could open it i say this doors maddening i cant make it budge an inch theres no lock that i can see they all shoved hard but the door would not give at all it was very stout and strong though rough and unfinished panting and hot the four of them at last gave it up do you know what i think said dick i think the beastly thing has got something jammed hard against it on the outside sure to have when you come to think of it said julian it will be well hidden too heather and bracken and stuff all over it nobody would ever find it i suppose the lorrydrivers come across from the road to open the door when they want to collect the goods and shut it and jam it after them no way of escape there then said george in disappointment fraid not said julian george gave a sigh tired old thing julian asked kindly or hungry both said george well weve got some food somewhere havent we said julian i remember one of the men slinging my bag in after me weve not had what we brought for tea yet what about having a meal now we cant seem to escape at the moment lets have it here said george i simply cant go a step further they sat down against a big crate dick undid his kitbag there were sandwiches cake and chocolate the four of them ate thankfully and wished they had something to wash down the food with julian kept wondering about anne i wonder what she did he said shed wait and wait i suppose then she might go back to the camp but she doesnt know the way very well and she might get lost oh dear dont know which would be worse for anne being lost on the moor or a prisoner down here with us perhaps shes neither said jock giving timmy his last bit sandwich i must say im jolly glad to have timmy honest george i couldnt believe it when i heard tim whine and then heard your voice too i thought i must be dreaming they sat where they were for a little longer and then decided to go back to the tunnel where the train was its just possible we might find the switch that works the opensesame bit said julian we ought to have looked before really but i didnt think of it they went back to where the train stood silently on its pair of lines it seemed such an ordinary old train now that the children couldnt imagine why they had ever thought it was strange and spooky they switched on the light again then they looked about for any lever or handle that might perhaps open the hole in the wall there didnt seem to be anything at all they tried a few switches but nothing happened then george suddenly came across a big lever low down in the brick wall itself she tried to move it and couldnt she called julian ju come here i wonder if this has got anything to do with opening that hole the three boys came over to george julian tried to swing the lever down nothing happened he pulled it but it wouldnt move then he and dick pushed it upwards with all their strength and hey presto there came a bang from somewhere as something heavy shifted and then a clanking as if machinery was at work then came the sliding grating noise and a great piece of the brick wall moved slowly back and then swung round sideways and stopped the way of escape was open open sesame said dick grandly as the hole appeared better switch off the light here said julian if theres anyone still in the tunnel they might see the reflection of it on the tunnelwall beyond and wonder what it was he stepped back and switched it off and the place was in darkness again george put on her torch and its feeble beam lighted up the way of escape come on said dick impatiently and they all crowded out of the hole well make for ollys yard they began to make their way down the dark tunnel listen said julian in a low voice wed better not talk at all and wed better go as quietly as we can we dont know who may be in or out of this tunnel this evening we dont want to walk bang into somebody so they said nothing at all but kept close to one another in single file walking at the side of the track they had not gone more than a quarter of a mile before julian stopped suddenly the others bumped into one another and timmy gave a little whine as somebody trod on his paw georges hand went down to his collar at once the four of them and timmy listened hardly daring to breathe somebody was coming up the tunnel towards them they could see the pinpoint of a torch and hear the distant crunch of footsteps other way quick whispered julian and they all turned with jock leading them now they made their way as quickly and quietly as they could back to the place where the two tunnels met they passed it and went on towards kiltys yard hoping to get out that way but alas for their hopes a lantern stood some way down the tunnel there and they did not dare to go on there might be nobody with the lanternon the other hand there might what were they to do theyll see that hole in the wall is open suddenly said dick we left it open theyll know weve escaped then were caught again theyll come down to find us and here well be they stood still pressed close together timmy growling a little in his throat then george remembered something julian dick we could climb up that vent that i came down she whispered the one poor old timmy fell down have we time where is the vent said julian urgently quick find it george tried to remember yes it was on the other side of the tunnel near the place where the two tunnels met she must look for the pile of soot how she hoped the little light from her torch would not be seen whoever was coming up from ollys yard must be almost there by now she found the pile of soot that timmy had fallen into here it is she whispered but oh julian how can we take timmy we cant said julian we must hope hell manage to hide and then slink out of the tunnel by himself hes quite clever enough he pushed george up the vent first and her feet found the first rungs then jock went up his nose almost on georges heels then dick and last of all julian but before he managed to climb the first steps something happened a bright glare filled the tunnel as someone switched on the light that hung there timmy slunk into the shadows and growled in his throat then there came a shout whos opened the hole in the wall its open whos there it was mr andrewss voice then came another voice angry and loud whos here whos opened this place those kids cant have moved the lever said mr andrews we bound them up tightly the men three of them went quickly through the hole in the wall julian climbed up the first few rungs thankfully poor timmy was left in the shadows at the bottom out came the men at a run theyve gone their ropes are cut how could they have escaped we put kit down one end of the tunnel and weve been walking up this end those kids must be about here somewhere or hiding in the caves said another voice peters go and look while we hunt here the men hunted everywhere they had no idea that the vent was nearby in the wall they did not see the dog that slunk by them like a shadow keeping out of their way and lying down whenever the light from a torch came near hitn george climbed steadily feeling with her feet for the iron nails whenever she came to broken rungs then she came to a stop something was pressing on her head what was it she put up her hand to feel it was the collection of broken iron bars that timmy had fallen on that morning he had dislodged some of them and they had then fallen in such a way that they had lodged across the vent all twined into each other george could climb no higher she tried to move the bars but they were heavy and strong besides she was afraid she might bring the whole lot on top of her and the others they might be badly injured then whats up george why dont you go on asked jock who was next theres some iron bars across the vent ones that must have fallen when timmy fell said george i cant go any higher i darent pull too hard at the bars jock passed the message to dick and he passed it down to julian the four of them came to a fullstop blow said julian i wish id gone up first what are we to do now what indeed the four of them hung there in the darkness hating the smell of the sooty old vent miserably uncomfortable on the broken rungs and nails how do you like adventures now jock asked dick i bet you wish you were in your own bed at home i dont said jock i wouldnt miss this for worlds i always wanted an adventure and im not grumbling at this one what an adventure and now what had happened to anne she had stumbled on and on for a long time shouting to mr luffy and outside his tent mr luffy sat reading peacefully but as the evening came and then darkness he became very worried indeed about the five children he wondered what to do it was hopeless for one man to search the moors haifa dozen or more were needed for that he decided to get his car and go over to ollys farm to get the men from there so off he went but when he got there he found no one at home except mrs andrews and the little maid mrs andrews looked bewildered and worried what is the matter said mr luffy gently as she came running out to the car looking troubled oh its you mr luffy she said when he told her who he was i didnt know who you were mr luffy something strange is happening all the men have gone and all the lorries too my husband has taken the car and nobody will tell me anything im so worried mr luffy decided not to add to her worries by telling her the children were missing he just pretended he had come to collect some milk dont worry he said comfortingly to mrs andrews youll find things are all right in the morning i expect ill come and see you then now i must be off on an urgent matter he went bumping along the road in his car puzzled he had known there was something funny about ollys farm and he had puzzled his brains a good deal over ollys yard and the spooktrains he hoped the children hadnt got mixed up in anything dangerous id better go down and report to the police that theyre missing he thought after all im more or less responsible for them its very worrying indeed he told what he knew at the police station and the sergeant an intelligent man at once mustered six men and a police car have to find those kids he said and well have to look into this ollys farm business sir and these here spooktrains whatever they may be weve known there was something funny going on but we couldnt put our finger on it but well find the children first they went quickly up to the moors and the six men began to fan out to search with mr luffy at the head and the first thing they found was anne she was still stumbling along crying for mr luffy but in a very small weak voice now when she heard his voice calling her in the darkness she wept for joy oh mr luffy you must save the boys she begged him theyre in that tunnel and theyve been caught by mr andrews and his men im sure they didnt come out and i waited and waited do come ive got some friends here who will certainly come and help said mr luffy gently he called the men and in a few words told them what anne had said in the tunnel said one of them where the spooktrains run well come on men well go down there you stay behind anne said mr luffy but she wouldnt so he carried her as he followed the men who were making their way through the heather down to ollys yard they did not bother with woodenleg sam they went straight to the tunnel and walked up it quietly mr luffy was a good way behind with anne she refused to stay with him in the yard no she said tm not a coward really im not i want to help to rescue the boys i wish george was here wheres george mr luffy had no idea anne clung to his hand scared but eager to prove that she was not a coward mr luffy thought she was grand meanwhile julian and the others had been in the vent for a good while tired and uncomfortable the men had searched in vain for them and were now looking closely into every niche at the sides of the tunnel and of course they found the vent one of the men shone his light up it it shone on to poor julians feet the man gave a loud shout that almost made julian fall off the rung he was standing on here they are up this vent whod have thought it come on down or itll be the worse for you julian didnt move george pushed desperately at the iron bars above her head but she could not move them one of the men climbed up the vent and caught hold of julians foot he dragged so hard at it that the boys foot was forced off the rung then the man dragged off the other foot and julian found himself hanging by his arms with the man tugging hard at his feet he could hang on no longer his tired arms gave way and he fell heavily down landing half on the man and half on the pile of soot another man pounced on julian at once while the first climbed up the vent to find the next boy soon dick felt his feet being tugged at too all right all right ill come down he yelled and climbed down then jock climbed down too the men looked at them angrily giving us a chase like this who undid your ropes said mr andrews roughly one of the men put a hand on his arm and nodded up towards the vent someone else is coming down he said we only tied up three boys didnt we whos this then it was george of course she wasnt going to desert the three boys down she came as black as night with soot another boy said the men where did he come from any more up there asked mr andrews look and see said julian and got a box on the ears for his answer treat them rough now ordered peters teach them a lesson the little pests take them away the childrens hearts sank the men caught hold of them roughly blow now they would be made prisoners again suddenly a cry came from down the tunnel police run for it the men dropped the childrens arms at once and stood undecided a man came tearing up the tunnel i tell you the police are coming he gasped are you stone deaf theres a whole crowd of them run for it somebodys split on us get along to kiltys yard shouted peters we can get cars there run for it to the childrens dismay the men tore down the tunnel to kiltys yard they would escape they heard the sound of the mens feet as they ran along the line george found her voice timmy where are you after them timmy stop them a black shadow came streaking by out of the hole in the wall where timmy had been hiding and watching for a chance to come to george he had heard her voice and obeyed he raced after the men like a greyhound his tongue hanging out panting as he went these were the men who had illtreated george and the others were they aha timmy knew how to deal with people like that the policemen came running up and mr luffy and anne came up behind them theyve gone down there with timmy after them shouted george the men looked at her and gasped she was black all over the others were filthy dirty too with sootyblack faces in the light of the lamp that still shone down from the wall of the tunnel george shrieked anne in delight julian oh are you all safe i went bach to tell mr luffy about you and i got lost im so ashamed youve nothing to be ashamed of anne said mr luffy youre a grand girl brave as a lion from down the tunnel came shouts and yells and loud barks timmy was at work he had caught up with the men and launched himself on them one after anuher bringing each one heavily to the ground they were terrified to find a big animal growling and snapping all around them timmy held them at bay in the tunnel riot allowing them to go one step further snapping at any man who dared to go near the police ran up timmy growled extra fiercely just to let the men know that it was quite impossible to get by him in a trice each of the men was imprisoned by a pair of strong arms and they were being told to come quietly they didnt go quietly for one thing mr andrews lost his nerve and howled dismally jock felt very ashamed of him shut up said a burly policeman we know youre only the miserable little catspaw taking money from the big men to hold your tongue and obey orders timmy barked as if to say yes dont you dare call him a dogs paw that would be too good a name for him well i dont think i ever in my life saw dirtier children said mr luffy i vote we all go back to my car and i drive the lot of you over to ollys farm for a meal and a bath so back they all went tired dirty and also feeling very thrilled what a night they told anne all that had happened and she told them her story too she almost fell asleep in the car as she talked she was so tired mrs andrews was sensible and kind though upset to hear that her husband had been taken off by the police she got hot water for baths and laid a meal for the hungry children i wouldnt worry overmuch mrs andrews said kindly mr luffy that husband of yours needs a lesson you know this will probably keep him going straight in future the farm is yours and you can now hire proper farmworkers who will do what you want them to do and i think jock will be happier without a stepfather for the present youre right mr luffy said mrs andrews wiping her eyes quickly quite right ill let jock help me with the farm and get it going beautifully to think that mr andrews was in with all those black marketeers its that friend of his you know who makes him do all this hes so weak he knew jock was snooping about in that tunnel and thats why he wanted him to go away and kept making him have a boy here or go out with him i knew there was something funny going on no wonder he was worried when jock took it into his head to go and camp with our little lot said mr luffy to think of that old yard and tunnel being used again said mrs andrews and all those tales about spooktrains and tha way they hid that train and hid all the stuff too why its like a fairy tale isnt it she ran to see if the water was hot for the baths it was and she went to call the children who were in the big bedroom next door she opened it and looked in then she called mr luffy upstairs he looked in at the door too the five and timmy were lying on the floor in a heap waiting for the bathwater they hadnt liked to sit on chairs or beds they were so dirty and they had fallen asleep where they sat their faces as black as a sweeps talk about black marketeers whispered mrs andrews anyone would think wed got the whole lot of them here in the bedroom they all woke up and went to have a bath one by one and a good meal after that then back to camp with mr luffy jock with them too it was glorious to snuggle down into the sleepingbags george called out to the three boys now dont you dare to go off without me tonight see the adventure is over called back dick how did you like it jock like it said jock with a happy sigh it was simply smashing a complete list of the famous five adventures by enid blyton five on a treasure island five
