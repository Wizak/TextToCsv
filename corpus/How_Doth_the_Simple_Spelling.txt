shining ower of course i know not how it may be with you but with me the mail brings daily a multitude of communications that i have not sought and do not want nor do i refer to bills alone and so when there came one day a printed card saying why heifer i tossed it into my wastepaper basket and remembered it no more some days had passed during which i had worked onward at the index of my forthcoming volume when my memory was jogged by the arrival of a new absurdity why not heffer like its predecessor this card went at once into my basket i had nearly finished the bs in my index before the mail brought the following it ought to be your custom now to simplify and spell plough plow therefore write quickly on your cuff from this day forth to spell tough tuff a third must follow these first tu so you will always spell through thru nor in the midst of things leave off but joyfully now make cough coff by this time you must clearly noa dough cant be doe do dow but doa well if they purposed to reform our spelling which has always been a mere ragbag of lawlessness i hoped that they would do it right but i was too deeply immersed in completing the index of my forthcoming volume to spend thought upon this question nor did i court interruption my wastepaper basket therefore received another willing contribution and when presently the clue to these cards reached me in the following telegraphic message just at the outset of my mornings work chickle university arkansopolis october english spelling rotten to the core help us masticator b fellows i responded not without satire utterly prostrated by news helpless thomas greenberry and thinking that thus i was rid of him i proceeded quietly with the index of my forthcoming volume but masticator b fellows president and proprietor of chickle university had not done with me so easily since his streetboyhood sixty years ago this ardent personality tis thus the daily press describes him had made his own way and had his own way he was his own capital and there is no record of his ever having sunk a cent of it of habits strictly pure he had never seen a card or a drop of liquor that he had touched and he had never seen a dollar that he had not touched he had organized every industry along his path from paperselling bootblacking and so upward to his organized lobby at washington through which he had caused a heavy tariff to be put upon every commodity necessary to the american people it was he who had advised his brother organizers to keep religion on the free list because as he assured them if we tax it theyll do without it while if we dont theyll trust us for a while yet and now at the age of seventyfive with uncounted millions and ten united states senators and a fourth young wife all in his pocket he proposed to hand his name to immortality by simplifying the spelling of english all over the earth well let him do it if he would only do it right but this he must do without my assistance there were other professors many of them i did not permit the circulars that now began to pour in from chickle university to distract me from my index striking as these circulars were and i will instance but one of them judge budge ridge acknowledge are slow call in and try our quick spelling juj buj rij aknolej they went into the basket one after another to this method of suggestion a second was soon added and my coatpockets as well as my mail began to be filled with spelling literature i would go out for a walk and during this exercise some paper or pamphlet would be slipped into the coat which i would discover upon my return i remember pulling out a little book of verse beginning i am only a primer to teach you to spel which is something that nobody does very wel a sweet little primer a dear little primer sing hel bel tel fel sel nel quel swel and smel i felt let me confess it annoyed the next day on returning from my walk to find a new method of suggestion in great charcoal letters on the white marble of my housefront such nuisances as solemn comptroller and wednesday are preventing the king of siam from learning english nor was my annoyance decreased by the further announcement that defaced my housefront upon the day following millions of school children turn away weeping from people manuoevre diaphragm much should be conceded to the man who is fighting for his immortality as was masticator but not too much and displeasure it may fairly be said began to rise in me when i found next morning a page of the primer introduced in the midst of my index of the bad english spelling youll surely beware when you notice how stair pear and heir rhyme with there the sad english spelling the mad english spelling sing hi for the mare and the mayor and the prayer next consider for instance a word like enhearsed now what business has it to be rhyming with first sing hi the old spelling the horrible spelling the spelling of nursed and of versed and of worst but our simplified speling can cure every il and permits nothing foolish like two ls in pil sing hi the new speling our comforting speling sing pil bil fil wil til sil quil spil yes masticator was going too far and how had he managed to tamper with my index i rang the bell and questioned my man edward sharply he knew nothing of it nor did the housemaid whom i also questioned sharply and i trusted i should be less harassed on the morrow illustration flung the cakes at my man edward but on the morrow at breakfast lifting with my fork the top buckwheat cake in order to spread butter upon the second i found a leaflet between the two cakes inscribed phthisis how can you eat while a word like that is allowed i flung the cakes at my man edward and in five minutes i had dismissed every servant in the house quite unable to work i left the house myself and set out to take the air no masticator was not doing it right he was taking too many sudden liberties not only with the language but with myself becoming gradually aware that a number of young persons were following me with loud and disconcerting expressions i stepped into a shop where i am unknown and where they at once offered to brush off my back a double mirror showed me these words chalked plainly he wants a p in consumtion being now without servants i decided that i should be free from persecution in the luxurious wilderness of a great hotel upon getting into bed in my room in the twelfth story a dreadful contact caused me to leap to the floor where my foot dashed down upon some similar dreadfulness and the shock threw me flat on my face and stomach only to feel myself instantly plastered with more of the same odious and encasing substance i believe that i shouted loudly in the dark for some time before hotel employees rushed to my succor the door was burst open and the light turned on it was flypaper and much time was consumed in relieving my person of it every piece bore its motto such as if youll but drop the e in pi better on stomach pi will li and also the b in lam s not worth a dam and others as early as possible the next morning i sent a message of capitulation to masticator b fellows what can i do for you was the message and the reply came back delighted you are with us private car train twentyone today the secretary of masticator was at the steps of the car and presented me at once to a most lovely girl at the news she was to serve on the simplified spelling committee with me my heart bounded every doubt left me and i exclaimed i will spell just as you say then she most sweetly returned never let us consent to any simplification of kiss and i counted such answer a very happy omen she had come from a womans college and her important work on the authorship of shakespeares plays had demonstrated beyond refutation that the plays had been written by queen elizabeth in collaboration with sir walter raleigh and lady jane grey shall we be in harrisburg soon mr kibosh she asked the secretary it will be ten minutes after seven miss appleby and that is a whole three hours she cried with no pleasure in her voice here is some good chickle said kibosh and when she would take none then i will he said the private stock of masticator b fellows the public gets nothing like this he took a small object from the box that he held and put it in his mouth and soon while the train sped on his large long jaws were oscillating with a smooth motion and content like a lukewarm glaze overspread his immense bald features thus it came to me what chickle was chewinggum i exclaimed kibosh opened gentle eyes upon me we do not use that word at arkansopolis he smiled removed the plastic morsel from his mouth and placed it on the windowsill that he might speak to me without impediment we always say chickle at arkansopolis we like that better masticator b fellows likes that better when his genius bought up the small plants is there a chewinggum trust too asked miss appleby chickle miss appleby chickle if you please when masticators genius organized this noble industry thereby placing a superior pure cheap and uniform article within the reach of eighty million jaws but the whole nation does not chew gum the lovely girl again with some spirit interrupted chickle miss appleby if you please fifty per cent of our population chickles and that makes eighty million jaws when the time came to ahem float the proposition after the bonds there was an issue of one billion preferred and two billions of common stock it did not seem fitting miss appleby it did not seem dignified that wall street should bandy back and forth such an expression as ahem chewinggum common to the eye such an expression printed in the financial columns would seem would in short hence chickle miss appleby noun and verb never anything else at arkansopolis will you not chickle now no ah well but at least you are with us in the higher spelling his hand sought the windowsill and then his mouth and his jaws resumed their placid oscillation miss appleby had gone out upon the broad rear platform of our car and there as she sat alone i joined her saying shall we talk of the higher spelling but she seemed inclined for not much talk upon any subject and the nearer harrisburg drew the more difficult i found it to engage her attention there is nothing to see i assured her when as our train entered the station she left me with something almost like eagerness i did not get out during our somewhat long stop being occupied in my private stateroom with unpacking and disposing my clothes for the journey as we started again i emerged to find miss appleby in bright conversation with a newcomer professor jesse willows said kibosh of pawpaw university mountain dew city and as the extraordinarily handsome young man rose quite sixfeettwo to greet me kibosh continued the professors dictionary of deadly weapons as well as his great work on bowieknives in the stone age makes him a welcome member of our committee i felt i know not why less glad to see this professor willows than miss appleby seemed his long black coat and black tie were fairly proper for a man of erudition but his hat was soft and broad of brim and his trousers were of brown corduroy drawn over high boots and what sir i asked him may your views be on the higher spelling bless yore heart suh he gayly responded whats spellin anyway just alphabet lettuhs fixed like some man chose to fix em befo you an me were bawn an so i say such a mans had his notions moren long enough and its high time weall took a whirl at the dictionary i admit sir i responded that our spelling is but a ragbag of lawlessness but it has been ratified by a noble army of great writers they and the daily press have spread it over the world therefore we must go slowly we must do it right derivation bless yore heart suh the impetuous youth interrupted me whats derivation just conquest follod by mispronunciation julius cжsuh he lambastes gaul and he talks latin to em he says honor an he goes home an the gauls retain cжsuhs idea as all puffeck gennlemen should but the nearest they kin git to the latin is honneur an then whoop they come over to england an they lambaste the anglosaxons an talk to em about honneur an the anglosaxons bein also puffeck gennlemen they ketches on to the idea but bejeroosalemmed if they kin say it straight either an so it gits to be honour an then comes our glorious revolution an we tell the english goodby to yo king geawge goodby to yore iniquitous parliament goodby to yore whole doggoned outfit of tyrants and helots weall don keer how youall spell anything whatsoever an the language of washington an jeffuhson an patrick henry an all the glorious fathuhs of libuhty is goin to spell it honor without a u an there you are back to yore original latin a noble sentiment professor said kibosh a truly noble sentiment will you not join me in a chickle the professor bounded to his full long height with all the agility of the felis catus of his own wild native mountains im with you suh he exclaimed bejeroosalemmed if i wasnt powful thirsty chickle is not liquid refreshment said kibosh mildly and he held out the box to his tall guest illustration chickle is not liquid refreshment the professor glared at it for a moment you and yore chickle he then began with alarming deliberation can go right a quick girlish cough sounded behind him to my private cabin in this cyah the professor continued with no change in countenance or voice where i will join you and where we will find liquid refreshment kibosh did not dare refuse him and i came without being asked its a glorious exercise suh said the professor to me in the private cabin in moderation yes i answered may i inquiuh to what youall are referrin he asked haughtily why to this i answered tapping my glass the professor grew more stiff i referred to simplifyin the spellin of our language he said a glorious exercise i repeated vaguely fo the imagination suh turn yore eye whah you will youll see words that need refawmin words that need our help words that cry an clamuh to be relieved of the stigma of their congested and nonsensical appearance nouns adjectives verbs all stuck in the hopeless mud of antiquity an holdin out their hands for weall to drag em out an bring em up to date he now gave me a list look suh at those pore sufferin aged cripples awaitin the renewal of their youth you have a magnificent collection i remarked to him after a glance at the list pshaw he returned i could double that in an hour i just jotted that down as i came up the valley from pawpaw in the chattanooga limited why just lookin out of the cyah windo would give me notions i saw a thistle down she went on the list an down went whistle next her suggested by our locomotive thistle whistle look at those disgraces look at the dead wood in em are not they just congested all up with pitfalls for the young once we get to work at arkansopolis and theyll be thissl and wissl or my name is not jesse willows he paused and i looked at his list again the railway journey had given him a number of suggestions i saw in hasty writing freight thats dopy should be frate bridge another hasbeen brij my perusal was interrupted by his seizing the list away from me the potuh has turned the gas higher he said that gives me another whole big line of em and he wrote light should be lite so also fight and tight and others on the same plan potuh he called out what is yore name michael colonel the man answered another exclaimed the professor and he wrote michael mycle because cycle bicicle because icicle i kept various doubts to myself and resolved that such must continue my policy if i were ever to have peace but no matter how i might agree to spell bicycle i was secretly determined never to address my younger brother as mycle imagine thus mutilating a name that had been in our family for generations professor willows showed his list to miss appleby i saw him and i saw her evidently add some words to it but to my surprise this seemed to cause them mirth they did not seek my company and conversed together without ceasing in a corner of our car while kibosh slumbered and i wondered if the higher spelling was the subject that brought their heads so close to each other that girl was more and more a disappointment to me and i retired in no very good humor mycle was not the only word to which as i dressed myself next morning i found my opinion to be entirely adverse frate seemed to me objectionable nor did i feel any leanings toward brij and lite and the surprising readiness with which professor willows accepted my criticism failed to make upon me the happy impression which the adoption of ones views by another is apt to cause you dont like frate suh he said whipping out his pencil and quickly writing on his list bless yore heart then well just make it frait how does that hit yore fancy i thanked him for his amiability but my fancy was as little hit by frait as it had been by frate and it was still less hit when he came to me with his customary enthusiasm some twentyfive minutes after breakfast to show me fortythree more words that he had simplified since rising from table still keeping all thoughts to myself i read earth and dearth to irth and dirth like mirth also worth to wirth pheasants whirr cats should pirr i passed the list back with i know not what commendations of his rapidity he retired with it to the rear platform where sat miss appleby and almost immediately i heard egregious peals of laughter coming from them both this for some reason kindled in me such annoyance that i put my head out of the door and cried loudly to them do you intend to make flirt flurt or hurt hirt and how about squirt and i shut the door sharp upon my words before they could make answer to me but still even through the closed door and thick plateglass windows their shameless merriment reached me and seemed if anything louder than ever the outlook for the higher spelling was scarce a bright one i thought if the rest of my colleagues whom i had yet to meet should approach their solemn responsibilities in anything of the spirit shown by professor willows and miss appleby his facile adoption of a new spelling and equally facile relinquishment of it gave but poor evidence of any deep thought on this matter and to see him through the plateglass as he talked to her on the rear platform no one would easily be persuaded that spelling was the subject of their colloquy and lastly when he fetched a large shawl and hung it across the window outside so that they were wholly screened from view i found it no light effort to believe that it was to shield her from the cold blast as he informed me i sought without great eagerness the companionship of kibosh do you not fear i asked him that we may not find ourselves able to reach an agreement as to the system by which this respelling should proceed what would hinder it he inquired of course our present spelling is but a ragbag of lawlessness i replied for i was growing fond of my description of it but great authors and newspapers have spread it round the globe the sun never sets on english spelling we must join the great english universities with us we must join canada india australia we must do it right england will have to follow us he declared if youll watch england i said i think youll find she has her own ideas about that then our publishers and writers will ignore england he replied if youll watch our publishers and writers i again said youll see theyll be slow to let go their english market by making books that would be illegible throughout the british empire what are authors anyhow he demanded it is our business men who are our glory if youll watch our business men i repeated not without acerbity youll find they have london correspondents and theyll not care to run two sorts of spelling with their stenographers kibosh thought awhile and then with his gentle smile he again removed his chickle and placed it on the windowsill but nevertheless masticator will have gained his point he said scarcely so if a system fails us and we do nothing i suggested he seemed not to hear me and all of the committee every member will have gained the point as well youll pardon me but what is the point i now asked him and the english language he continued more and more gently it will have gained the point too i must confess i said to utter ignorance of your meaning kibosh smiled for a long while looking at me very kindly you will readily appreciate he at length began that the greatest need of mankind is publicity it is as essential to the german emperor as it is to the female society leader or the trick mule we are no exceptions we leaders of thought and teachers of youth and captains of industry we too must have publicity or ahem pass under and as the demand for publicity increases the supply of it naturally diminishes you understand that well now any association with masticator b fellows means publicity at once for the lucky individual but there are times when the vast sweep of economic currents ties up all the available publicity and at those times great enterprises languish from its scarcity it may befall that even such giant operators as masticator b fellows find themselves embarrassed it is then only the man of genius whose magic hand can smite the rock in some novel way and cause publicity again to gush forth fresh and sparkling it is then only he who is heard from there has been such a time of late publicity was tied up and masticator needed some for his for certain plans he has to benefit the human race now what does masticator do he surveys the general situation he thinks it over and presently he says spelling reform he smites the rock and there you have it you understand me well supposing you gentlemen do fail to ahem make any considerable impression upon the english language you will have made a considerable impression on the public the rock will have gushed masticators point will be gained he will have secured the publicity he needs for his his benevolent enterprises each of you gentlemen will have secured publicity for your names and works and we mustnt forget the english language it will have got publicity too it needs it like all the rest of us im sure you understand me thus kibosh finished and it entered my mind to descend at our next stop and take the first train back to my own place but this thought i quickly dismissed remembering masticators methods of reaching those whom he wanted and although i know this is unworthy i was become very curious to see what we should all do once we were gathered together were all the rest of my colleagues coming for publicity i glanced at the window where the shawl still screened professor willows and miss appleby and it seemed to me that they had come rather for privacy who are the rest of my colleagues i now asked kibosh well now im afraid youve got me he responded theres let me see professor flawless nathaniel maverick of fishball university massachusetts he is with us a profound scholar sir what is his line i asked well now thats another tough one let us see did he write the fuel of the future i shook my head being ignorant or was it the mustard plaster in pharaohs time kibosh dreamily pursued what is the fuel of the future i asked pecan nuts i am certain of that answered kibosh but whether hes that one or whether its lysander totts who is lysander totts i inquired another profound scholar sir of numa pompilius university new york but weve got them from all around from seminole florida oglethorpe georgia lafitte louisiana sandys virginia graftsburg pennsylvania but youll meet them tomorrow at chickle university all profound scholars sir it was totts come to think of it think of what i asked pecan nuts said kibosh i should have been glad to learn the names of all my colleagues and what they had written that i might be the better prepared to meet them but kibosh could be sure only of totts and his book and professor willows and miss appleby had not heard even of totts when i asked them at lunch to enlighten me what mattuh suh cried willows cheerily theyll tell you quick enough themselves why theyre so famous at this remark miss appleby broke into much gayety got many words this mawnin professuh asked willows of me and i retorted with what should have been telling reproof that i was not of those who can improvise thorough work it was extraordinary how much this young mans remarks pleased miss appleby he was but a poor companion for the lovely girl and when after lunch he retired to slumber in his cabin as he called it i took my seat beside her on the rear platform she was most amiable but bade me first take down the shawl behind us the cold blasts she said had ceased we talked for some time and it was easy to see that under proper guidance her mind would open to all befitting things not until professor willows came out of his cabin and joined us did i feel her grow distant again without preliminary he asked what does a man who sits down on a sharp needle most resemble and without waiting he answered a profane upstart into such levity i could not possibly enter i resolved to wait the morrow and the succeeding days of our convention at chickle university for opportunities to exert upon this impressionable young girl my wholesome influence we reached our destination during the forenoon of the next day and i was amazed when i beheld spreading out before me the vast institution where we were to hold our sittings chickle university covered with its grounds and buildings four square miles swift electric cars ran everywhere by routes so well planned that less than four minutes were consumed between the two most distant points the several thousand buildings were of a uniform pattern but lettered on the outside so as easily to be distinguished house of latin house of chiropody house of marriage and divorce and so forth everything was taught here and had its separate house and the courses of instruction were named on a plan as uniform as the buildings get french quick get religion quick get football quick and so forth the university was open to both sexes i saw great crowds of young men and women trying to push their way into the house of marriage and divorce and kibosh informed me that this course was the second in popularity and in such active demand that a corps of ninetysix instructors was kept lecturing continuously day and night the football course had overflowed its own building so copiously that it was also filling the houses of latin greek music history and literature and what do those students do i inquired there have been none he answered we have accommodations for two million students but if this spelling reform fails to prove the ahem youll remember what we said about rocksmiting mr greenberry fails to prove the er attraction that masticator anticipates any idle houses in this university plant can be readily turned into the chickle plant which adjoins it i asked him would they not meet great difficulty in finding professors for two million students professors are our lightest expense he replied we can always pick them up for next to nothing so saying kibosh led us to the library and here were some gentlemen assembled whose appearance clearly proclaimed them to be profound scholars and who were to be of our spelling committee while kibosh made us known to each other and we exchanged our formal greetings the eye of each scholar sought the eye of every other scholar with that thirsty look an author wears when the hope for compliments upon his writings flutters in his breast but we were true professors all of us and not one had read a word that any of the others had ever written deceit should always be discouraged nay firmly punished in the young for by reason of their immaturity they have but little judgment when to practise it but to the old it is frequently of the greatest service intending therefore to be as agreeable as possible i approached professor lysander totts with a feigned knowledge of his work shaking him cordially by the hand i said ah yes pecan nuts what he replied staring why pecan nuts i repeated let me congratulate my name is totts he interrupted to be sure i exclaimed who has not read the fuel of the future i havent said totts i corrected myself hastily what an absurd slip of the tongue i gayly ejaculated i meant mustard plasters in pharaohs time i havent read that either said totts i should now have been at some loss but a plaintive voice behind me said hup hup hup hup i turned and saw a smiling little old man with delicate silver locks that hung wellnigh to his collar hup hup said he again very amiably i turned back to totts in bewilderment he stutters totts explained the voice behind me now said with a sudden sort of explosion i wrote it i turned again and catching both his hands as a drowning man is said to catch a straw i wrung them earnestly and long a great work i called out to him as if he were deaf a very great work and not well knowing what i did i further shouted to miss appleby who was passing us he wrote it pecan nuts hup hup said the little man mustard plasters little as i owe miss appleby i must always hold her memory in gratitude for her coming forward at this extreme moment of course it is mustard plasters she said with delightful sweetness and you must write your name in my copy dear professor egghorn he extended an eager hand for the volume it is in my trunk she continued promptly and your signature will make a unique gem of what is already a precious treasure and you dear professor totts when i am unpacked you will surely not refuse me the same honor professor totts you know she added to me has proved that cleopatra was a man then who wrote pecan nuts i whispered to her hastily he hasnt come yet she hastily whispered back i am sure said kibosh leading a tall new arrival among us that professor camillo cottsill needs no introduction here we all welcome the man who has said the last word on the last word on on well now really it escapes me professor he finished turning his wide gentle smile upon the newcomer who glared at him angrily and announced with unnecessary loudness nostalgia in the lobster thank you professor said kibosh thank you kindly i think lunch is now awaiting us in the house of bread after brief preparation in the rooms assigned to us we lunched with the students and as i passed down the hall i saw totts and egghorn signing their respective volumes for miss appleby illustration professors totts and egghorn signing their respective works so quickly unpacked i asked her dear no she returned professor willows easily bought them for me at the university book shop i have but one complaint against your exquisite deceit i said to her why did you leave me out ah she said who could deceive you i strove but unsuccessfully to occupy a seat beside her at table it was jesse willows who got it the other being taken by egghorn while totts placed himself opposite napoleon preferred men with great noses but that of totts would have pleased him too well i think and totts blew it continually it was my hope that supper or dinner or whatever they called the next meal would not be served with the distressing rapidity of this one one had barely the time to swallow and the food went whole down ones throat but the next meal and all meals were the same and had our convention lasted longer than it did i should have fallen victim to a grave dyspepsia this i learned was another instance of the vast genius of masticator b fellows while educating his students he created in them the need for the product of his own monopoly he gave them no time to chew at their meals and chickle was served free in all the houses for chewing at some time or other is necessary to digestion and among the thousands at chickle university i saw not one anywhere boy or girl whose mouth was not going like a slow rabbits and to judge from the universal oscillatory motion of the jaws of the american people in trains and all public places i see they are learning that great economic principle of masticators which is announced everywhere in the street cars time is money he who chickles saves his nickles nickles being the simple spelling of nickels this great man allowed us at length to see him next morning when we assembled to begin our work we sat round an imposing table some twenty strong for all the profound scholars were now arrived and in front of each scholar on the ample green baize tablecover was a great dictionary with a great glass inkstand and writing materials tall blackboards stood behind us waiting to receive the words we should reform but the best of it was to find myself sitting next miss appleby with willows quite an agreeable distance away kibosh had arranged all our seats and it is the best thing i know of him illustration masticator b fellows when masticator b fellows entered to open our convention it was plain at once whence kibosh had acquired his manner and his appearance so far as he could acquire this latter the secretary might have been an early bad photograph of the magnate to see masticator he was the creature of brotherly love the preacher of benign gospels the teacher of female academies no smell of senate or syndicate hung about him bald with a silken skullcap bland with his ten pointed fingers meeting as if to bless with a sunrise smile and a black coat as long and unlovely as conscious virtue he stood before us in benevolent silence and we rose as one scholar but at once he motioned us to sit down i think theres a dollarsign in his jaw whispered miss appleby to me already masticator was addressing us slowly and softly dear friends he said be welcome i am worth two hundred and fortyfive millions thank god that you are not thank god that you are poor thank god for your scanty meals and clothing and your ceaseless failure to make both ends meet pray god you may die poor how i envy you all your blessed privilege of struggle thank god and now to business everything is getting better man is getting better woman is getting better life liberty happiness all getting better and chickle better and better then why not english spelling dear friends i expect results from you let us sing the ode a gasoline organ began to play at the end of the apartment and we profound scholars stood up and sang together my spelling tis of thee sweet land of spellingbee of thee i sing land of the pilgrims pride land where my fathers dide for spelling simplifide let freedom ring a beautiful pome said lysander totts on my other side where were you educated i asked him surracuse noo yorruk he responded and he blew his large nose and now dear friends masticator was saying i leave you remember the poor foreigners remember the little children it is for them that the english language exists and for them we must therefore smooth our spellings cruel path i expect results dear friends so saying he was gone yes there is a dollarsign in his jaw repeated miss appleby suggestions are now in order said kibosh taking the chairmans seat three profound scholars stood up the only way they began with one voice professor flawless nathan maverick has the floor said kibosh i presume the professor will think no change in pecan nuts necessary and the chairman smiled sociably at the scholar the only way said maverick is to abolish all words that foreigners cannot spell you mean cut em out of the language suh inquired jesse willows i do phew whistled willows order gentlemen smiled the chairman professor camillo cottsill has the floor the only way said this scholar is to abolish all words that children cannot spell phew repeated willows order gentlemen please said the chairman gently tapping an inkstand with a pencil but he was not heeded who are you whistling at demanded camillo cottsill cant yore children spell retorted willows can yours shouted cottsill at this jesse willows blushed a deep red and so did miss appleby he is not married professor said kibosh tapping the inkstand soothingly my little daughter zola b can spell everything said maverick how about the others demanded cottsill my salary only affords me one stated maverick with resignation then how can you judge said cottsill receive and believe and bereave should be cut out at once they should not said maverick oh cut everything out sighed willows hup hup hup hup began professor egghorn the author of mustard plasters has the floor said kibosh with civility the only way continued egghorn is to hup hup hup start the organ please said kibosh to an assistant and while the gasoline music played my spelling tis of thee kibosh walked round the table and gave every one an individual box of chickle we chewed in silence waiting for the voice of professor egghorn to go again hup hup said he at length phonetic i object cottsill and maverick called out loudly together i move its phonetic said totts second the hup hup said egghorn those in favor kibosh began thats not properly seconded interrupted cottsill motion finished egghorn with a shriek and we carried phonetic by eighteen to two since professor egghorn has shown us the only way said kibosh will he not kindly lead off with his suggestions for a reform list but once again the professors utterance was transfixed give the pore gennleman a piece of chalk said willows and send him to the blackboad with the blackboard we now made visible progress which i decided it was best for the present not to interrupt let as many suggestions as possible be made then we could weed them out consent was undivided upon a number of words and some old spelling passed away in peace the letter u disappeared from honor and favor although with much surprise i overheard miss appleby saying to herself that she intended to retain it in all her private correspondence the k was kicked out of frederic theres nothing new about that either said miss appleby in a whisper but i shall not permit any such liberty to be taken with my own name said professor maverick firmly and this was conceded to him professor totts objecting we shall never reach consistency at this rate grumbled lysander totts who came here to be consistent retorted maverick we came here for spelling reform added camillo

oh gentlemen wailed kibosh but consistency objected maverick you cut out consistency yourself cottsill reminded him we despatched the past participles and came also without much disturbance through catalog demagog and so forth vogue and rogue made some trouble and our fundamental principle of inconsistency had once more to be asserted but when their blood was roused and the fire of simplification grew hot in them and they adopted the following with cheers and noises of feet receev deceev conceev beleev weev leev greev seez pleez teez i felt that we had really got near the weedingout point especially when jesse willows rose and added fleez plural of dogbiters he explained and sat down quietly at this miss appleby gave one brief happy laugh but at once resumed a singular tapping of her foot which i had begun to observe we now thoroughly phoneticked many words blud for instance and wunss which is so much phoneticker than once and the days of the week munday for instance and toozday i say tewsday myself but i did not mention it to these profound american scholars my little daughter zola b said professor maverick can always spell wednesday my nine children

hotter constitooshun deklarayshun and united staits were adopted but my zola b began maverick what are youall goin to call yore next asked willows maverick sighed my salary only affords beg yore pardon suh i forgot said willows with sympathy it was here that i rose gentlemen i said let us do it right of course english spelling is but a ragbag of lawlessness he has said that before muttered jesse willows but i continued the sun never sets on english spelling i object to these constant trivial interruptions stated cottsill yes let us onward urged the chairman play ball added totts chew gum finished cottsill im through egghorn said sitting down it was beyond my power to guide them i also sat down i also was through through exclaimed totts that reminds me and running to his blackboard he wrote thru whats that thing asked willows hup hup began egghorn through replied totts raising his voice what said willows raising his voice too through through answered the convention in a body and miss appleby amid the general din remarked thats the way a pig would spell if it got the chance thru clu blu nu hu wrote totts hu hu repeated willows vacantly whats hu hup hup hup vainly continued egghorn waving his arms hus who explained cottsill loudly who who explained the whole convention to willows booh pooh said willows and running to the blackboard he added bu pu and stu also glu but egghorn was now standing on his chair and screaming hup hup hup with the most energetic violence oh write it every one cried out to him they lifted egghorn down from his chair and he ran eagerly to his blackboard upon which he wrote this is illiterate this is unscholarly and again the convention cried out together were not here to be scholarly were not here to be literate have yore way gennlemen said jesse willows ill stand for anything well i cant stand this any longer exclaimed miss appleby and rising to her pretty feet she continued gentlemen in your charitable solicitude for foreigners you may be making our spelling easy for lithuanians though i doubt it but you are making it quite impossible for the english upon this a cold silence fell and then and who are the english madam asked cottsill miss appleby gave her delightful brief laugh im sorry you dont know sir said she for i didnt come here to begin your education and she sat down there was an impulse in me to call her gertrude but i felt it to be premature a general murmuring confusion of consulting and dissenting voices now arose among the scholars but what did you come here for i asked miss appleby not to see unbroken dogs put their muddy paws all over the greatest language in the world she retorted dear me dear me i returned with soothing deprecation for she was plainly very much incensed then what did you come for oh for reasons she returned evasively doubts that i could not define began suddenly to fill my mind and i said to her didnt you write about shakespeare a college joke she answered contemptuously im writing a poem now i shall call it how we brought the good spelling from ghent to aix then you dont believe in the higher spelling i asked no she declared with defiance does professor willows i pursued hadnt you better ask him about that she replied i think my face must have turned the reddest that anger can paint faces for now at any rate i had no doubts as to how i had been made game of in the private car yes they had mocked me the impudent young man had manufactured absurd spelling for my serious attention and he and miss appleby had then made merry together over it and over myself but before i could frame a fitting rebuke to the frivolous though lovely young woman beside me a distracting hubbub of voices was set up and through this i heard kibosh calling on your blackboards gentlemen on your blackboards illustration professor dudelsacker the convention gradually heard him too and scholar after scholar bounded from his chair seized a piece of chalk and began to write only one was left who stood at his place pouring forth the most execrable sounds i have ever heard professor dudelsacker has the floor said kibosh burrmeowskreeyiyiwurrburrwowwowmeow went the professor turn that central pennsylvania dutch quacker out shouted some one ive resigned already meowowwow squealed dudelsacker in a fury and he took his departure at once but this brought us no calm twenty pieces of chalk were rattling on the blackboards like a platoon of busy telegraphic instruments each scholar was making his own list for the new dictionary of english and i read the lists of totts maverick and cottsill so far as they had written them jesse willows was writing too with sweeping flourishes but i had ceased to place faith in his integrity surracuse beverly fahms cyar yurrup rud cyard surrup but cyart mawrul cut gyarden sawrul grantha coathouse kwawrul anywheres awringe everywheres cottsills list amurrican nowheres tremenjus tremendious awringe i murmured aloud in ignorance of its meaning but my own voice revealed to me that it was our chief florida fruit as pronounced by lysander totts of numa pompilius new york discoverer of cleopatras true sex the whole great west was rattling away on the boards behind me but what i saw in front of me was enough to hold my attention and my eyes were straying back and forth between awringe and grantha when totts happening to glance up from his work beheld the work of maverick next him he stopped abruptly rud he inquired of the professor from fishball university author of pecan nuts road explained maverick writing out the old spelling road boat coat hm said totts with disapprobation but what is grantha i whispered to miss appleby can it be a breakfast food she suggested and again i wished to call her gertrude totts was still gazing at mavericks list hm yes he repeated bean talk from boston we dont want it are we phonetic or not returned maverick sharply but totts had now caught sight of cottsills list anywheres he read aloud why anywheres rub all those out i will not declared the author of nostalgia in the lobster i guess if you can be phonetic i can im afraid theyre skipping grantha said miss appleby who says anywheres demanded totts i do snapped cottsill well i dont totts replied and whats more i wont cottsill raised his voice i guess i can be phonetic just as anywheres is vulgar interrupted totts vulgar yourself screamed cottsill jumping up and down vulgar vulgar chimed in maverick whom the term bean talk had nettled but totts had spied the list of jesse willows and was pointing at it disdainfully and pray said he what may a coathouse be now the handsome young man from pawpaw was the last person to select for addressing in such a tone as lysander totts had taken i beg yore pardon suh he remarked so politely that i became filled with apprehension miss appleby was gazing at him with all her eyes what do you think of him she whispered to me i suppose that indignation at his unwarrantable treatment of me in the car rendered me imprudent my dear miss appleby i said to her my dear gertrude he is as beautiful as the day as ignorant as a socialist and as dishonest as a plumber how dare you speak of my husband so she replied we were married this morning thats all we came for to your silly convention goodby and rising she swept out of the room but her exit was unobserved the great west was still rattling on its blackboards maverick and cottsill were scowling darkly at totts totts was pointing one finger at coathouse and willows was smiling steadily at totts in a manner that now convinced me we were approaching the edge of something quite particular nor did even the bridegroom know that his bride had left us i beg yore pardon suh he repeated coathouse whats that said totts it is whah theyd have you suh if they caught you teachin any o those railroad accidents o yores to the young yes indeed yes indeed cried maverick and cottsill eagerly totts loudly blew his nose it shall remain courthouse in the dictionary of scholars he remarked willows ran his eye up and down totts list and then up and down totts schooling he softly returned has done powerful little for the amurrican who sails to yurrup and puts surrup on his hot cakes yes indeed yes indeed said cottsill and maverick again gentlemen gentlemen pleaded kibosh do not quarrel kwawrul you mean smiled jesse willows its immawrul to kwawrul in surracuse noo yorruk totts now began to show signs of jumping up and down have we adopted phonetic spelling or have we not he roared not yore kind said willows yore echoed totts listen to that dialect and he blew his noise more loudly hup hup began egghorn but his voice stuck as usual you should get a chauffeur said cottsill severely to him hup hup compromise finished egghorn ah yes gentlemen there we have it said kibosh earnestly compromise is progress let us all accept one another thus the cause will profit his exhortation produced a brief a very brief lull each looked at the neighboring blackboards in silence and kibosh doubtless with the idea of harmony set the organ once more to playing my spelling tis of thee while the rattling west continued to create a new language behind us at length cottsill sighed very well he said for the sake of anywheres ill vote for surrup thats wise thats kind thats good said kibosh and he beat one hand gently on the table at this hopeful point jesse willows noticed for the first time that no lady was now present and his long body made a singular twisting and free motion beneath his clothes i will vote for rud and anywheres totts said but i doubt if i can accept coathouse jesse willows took him instantly by the nose youll accept nothin said he with great sweetness and he shook him forward and back i am weary of you and yore antics and he shook him right and left youre goin to rub out everything you have written and he shook him round and round help gurgled the struggling totts help no indeed no indeed cried maverick and cottsill delighted you gentlemen are included said willows to them and they both hastily covered their noses with their hands i dont mean that way he continued but youre goin to rub yore lists out too why youre the contemptiblest of all the great american frauds just because you have written a picayune book on some picayune specialty you pass for bein educated in our halfcivilized country put you among genuine scholars and you would look like old gum shoes i know my accent is provincial he paused and looked at totts for a moment but its a heap prettiern yores he shook totts round and round again and you and i are just goin to let the english language take care of herself she has done it for a thousand years and shell do it for a thousand more changin what she pleases an keepin what she pleases so saying the young man even as one drags a resisting dog by a chain dragged the howling totts by his nose to the blackboard and forced the rubber into his hand and as totts hung back his firmly imprisoned organ received a still more acute sensation whereat he leaped into the air and erased his surracuse list at one sweep and next since cottsill and maverick were hanging back also one with his arms shielding grantha while the other shielded anywheres totts was conducted to those words out with grantha commanded jesse well keep it grandfather for a while yet mr bean talk they attempted to defend their lists but vainly and in the conflict that arose a rubber flew crooked and hit one of the great west sharply in the back of the neck he being under a misapprehension thereupon kicked his neighbor savagely and in a moment all the profound scholars engaged together in a blind war rubbing out one anothers lists whacking one anothers heads and often rolling by twos and threes beneath the table from which dictionaries and inkstands were falling continuously it was with the greatest difficulty that i got the gasoline organ between myself and harms way jesse willows had mounted upon the table with the still faintly bellowing totts whom he led slowly from one end to the other amid the clouds of chalk and the general bedlam illustration jesse had mounted upon the table with the still faintly bellowing totts at the first pause which exhaustion brought masticator b fellows was perceived to be looking on quietly gentlemen he said dear friends and these words stopped everything i am well pleased with what you have accomplished i expected results and i have got them the surgeon awaits you in the house of bandages no serious wounds were found but also no scholar was found to be upon speaking terms with any other by the generosity of masticator each was sent home separately in a private car on a special train with plenty of chickle masticator had created all the publicity that he desired new students swarmed in armies to his university and he presently issued a billion more shares of chickle common the press of the whole country rang with the enterprise simple spellers wed was one of the first headlines that greeted me upon my homeward journey yes jesse willows and gertrude appleby were the exceptions these two scholars had gone away in the same car together to their honeymoon while i returned lonely to the index of my forthcoming volume heigho
