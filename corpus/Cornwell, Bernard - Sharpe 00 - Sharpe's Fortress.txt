wanted it above all other things but somehow it was just too difficult like trying to light a tinderbox in a rainfilled wind either the men disliked him or they ignored him or they were overfamiliar and he was unsure how to cope with any of the three attitudes while the battalions other officers plain disapproved of him you can put a racing saddle on a cart horse captain urquhart had said one night in the ragged tent which passed for the officers mess but that dont make the beast quick he had not been talking about sharpe not directly but all the other officers glanced at him the battalion had stopped in the middle of nowhere it was hot as hell and no wind alleviated the sodden heat they were surrounded by tall crops that hid everything except the sky a cannon fired somewhere to the north but sharpe had no way of knowing whether it was a british gun or an enemy cannon a dry ditch ran through the tall crops and the men of the company sat on the ditch lip as they waited for orders one or two lay back and slept with their mouths wide open while sergeant colquhoun leafed though his tattered bible the sergeant was shortsighted so had to hold the book very close to his nose from which drops of sweat fell onto the pages usually the sergeant read quietly mouthing the words and sometimes frowning when he came across a difficult name but today he was just slowly turning the pages with a wetted finger looking for inspiration sergeant sharpe asked i am not sir colquhoun answered respectfully but somehow managed to convey that the question was still impertinent he dabbed a finger on his tongue and carefully turned another page so much for that bloody conversation sharpe thought somewhere ahead beyond the tall plants that grew higher than a man another cannon fired the discharge was muffled by the thick stems a horse neighed but sharpe could not see the beast he could see nothing through the high crops are you going to read us a story sergeant corporal mccallum asked he spoke in english instead of gaelic which meant that he wanted sharpe to hear i am not john i am not go on sergeant mccallum said read us one of those dirty tales about tits the men laughed glancing at sharpe to see if he was offended one of the sleeping men jerked awake and looked about him startled then muttered a curse slapped at a fly and lay back the other soldiers of the company dangled their boots towards the ditchs crazed mud bed that was decorated with a filigree of dried green scum a dead lizard lay in one of the dry fissures sharpe wondered how the carrion birds had missed it the laughter of fools john mccallum sergeant colquhoun said is like the crackling of thorns under the pot away with you sergeant mccallum said i heard it in the kirk once when i was a wee kid all about a woman whose tits were like bunches of grapes mccallum twisted to look at sharpe have you ever seen tits like grapes mister sharpe i never met your mother corporal sharpe said the men laughed again mccallum scowled sergeant colquhoun lowered his bible and peered at the corporal the song of solomon john mccallum colquhoun said likens a womans bosom to clusters of grapes and i have no doubt it refers to the garments that modest women wore in the holy land perhaps their bodices possessed balls of knotted wool as decoration i cannot see it is a matter for your merriment another cannon fired and this time a round shot whipped through the tall plants close to the ditch the stems twitched violently discharging a cloud of dust and small birds into the cloudless sky the birds flew about in panic for a few seconds then returned to the swaying seed heads i knew a woman who had lumpy tits private hollister said he was a darkjawed violent man who spoke rarely lumpy like a coal sack they were he frowned at the memory then shook his head she died this conversation is not seemly colquhoun said quietly and the men shrugged and fell silent sharpe wanted to ask the sergeant about the clusters of grapes but he knew such an enquiry would only cause ribaldry among the men and as an officer sharpe could not risk being made to look a fool all the same it sounded odd to him why would anyone say a woman had tits like a bunch of grapes grapes made him think of grapeshot and he wondered if the bastards up ahead were equipped with canister well of course they were but there was no point in wasting canister on a field of bulrushes were they bulrushes it seemed a strange thing for a farmer to grow but india was full of oddities there were naked sods who claimed to be holy men snakecharmers who whistled up hooded horrors dancing bears draped in tinkling bells and contortionists draped in bugger all a right bloody circus and the clowns ahead would have canister they would wait till they saw the redcoats then load up the tin cans that burst like duck shot from the gun barrels for what we are about to receive among the bulrushes sharpe thought may the lord make us truly thankful ive found it colquhoun said gravely found what sharpe asked i was fairly sure in my mind sir that the good book mentioned millet and so it does ezekiel the fourth chapter and the ninth verse the sergeant held the book close to his eyes squinting at the text he had a round face afflicted with wens like a suet pudding studded with currants take thou also unto thee wheat and barley he read laboriously and beans and lentils and millet and fitches and put them in one vessel and make thee bread thereof colquhoun carefully closed his bible wrapped it in a scrap of tarred canvas and stowed it in his pouch it pleases me sir he explained if i can find everyday things in the scriptures i like to see things sir and imagine my lord and saviour seeing the selfsame things but why millet sharpe asked these crops sir colquhoun said pointing to the tall stems that surrounded them are millet the natives call itjowari but our name is millet he cuffed the sweat from his face with his sleeve the red dye of his coat had faded to a dull purple this of course he went on is pearl millet but i doubt the scriptures mention pearl millet not specifically millet eh sharpe said so the tall plants were not bulrushes after all they looked like bulrushes except they were taller nine or ten feet high must be a bastard to harvest he said but got no response sergeant colquhoun always tried to ignore swear words what are fitches mccallum asked a crop grown in the holy land colquhoun answered he plainly did not know sounds like a disease sergeant mccallum said a bad dose of the fitches leads to a course of mercury one or two men sniggered at the reference to syphilis but colquhoun ignored the levity do you grow millet in scotland sharpe asked the sergeant not that i am aware of sir colquhoun said ponderously after reflecting on the question for a few seconds though i daresay it might be found in the lowlands they grow strange things there english things he turned pointedly away and sod you too sharpe thought and where the hell was captain urquhart where the hell was anybody for that matter the battalion had marched long before dawn and at midday they had expected to make camp but then came a rumour that the enemy was waiting ahead and so general sir arthur wellesley had ordered the baggage to be piled and the advance to continue the kings th had plunged into the millet then ten minutes later the battalion was ordered to halt beside the dry ditch while captain urquhart rode ahead to speak with the battalion commander and sharpe had been left to sweat and wait with the company where he had damn all to do except sweat damn all it was a good company and it did not need sharpe urquhart ran it well colquhoun was a magnificent sergeant the men were as content as soldiers ever were and the last thing the company needed was a brand new officer an englishman at that who just two months before had been a sergeant the men were talking in gaelic and sharpe as ever wondered if they were discussing him probably not most likely they were talking about the dancing girls in ferdapoor where there had been no mere clusters of grapes but bloody great naked melons it had been some sort of festival and the battalion had marched one way and the halfnaked girls had writhed in the opposite direction and sergeant colquhoun had blushed as scarlet as an unfaded coat and shouted at the men to keep their eyes front which had been a pointless order when a score of undressed bibb is were hobbling down the highway with silver bells tied to their wrists and even the officers were staring at them like starving men seeing a plate of roast beef and if the men were not discussing women they were probably grumbling about all the marching they had done in the last weeks crisscrossing the mahratta countryside under a blazing sun without a sight or smell of the enemy but whatever they were talking about they were making damn sure that ensign richard sharpe was left out which was fair enough sharpe reckoned he had marched in the ranks long enough to know that you did not talk to officers not unless you were spoken to or unless you were a slickbellied crawling bastard looking for favours officers were different except sharpe did not feel different he just felt excluded i should have stayed a sergeant he thought he had increasingly thought that in the last few weeks wishing he was back in the seringapatam armoury with major stokes that had been the life and simone joubert the frenchwoman who had clung to sharpe after the battle at assaye had gone back to seringapatam to wait for him better to be there as a sergeant he reckoned than here as an unwanted officer no guns had fired for a while perhaps the enemy had packed up and gone perhaps they had hitched their painted cannon to their ox teams stowed the canister in its limbers and buggered off northwards in which case it would be a quick aboutturn back to the village where the baggage was stored then another awkward evening in the officers mess lieutenant cahill would watch sharpe like a hawk adding tuppence to sharpes mess bill for every glass of wine and sharpe as the junior officer would have to propose the loyal toast and pretend not to see when half the bastards wafted their mugs over their canteens king over the water toasting a dead stuart pretender to the throne who had died in roman exile jacobites who pretended george iii was not the proper king not that any of them were truly disloyal and the secret gesture of passing the wine over the water was not even a real secret but rather was intended to goad sharpe into english indignation except sharpe did not give a fig old king cole could have been king of britain for all sharpe cared colquhoun suddenly barked orders in gaelic and the men picked up their muskets jumped into the irrigation ditch where they formed into four ranks and began trudging northwards sharpe taken by surprise meekly followed he supposed he should have asked colquhoun what was happening but he did not like to display ignorance and then he saw that the rest of the battalion was also marching so plainly colquhoun had decided number six company should advance as well the sergeant had made no pretence of asking sharpe for permission to move why should he even if sharpe did give an order the men automatically looked for colquhouns nod before they obeyed that was how the company worked urquhart commanded colquhoun came next and ensign sharpe tagged along like one of the scruffy dogs adopted by the men captain urquhart spurred his horse back down the ditch well done sergeant he told colquhoun who ignored the praise the captain turned the horse its hooves breaking through the ditchs crust to churn up clots of dried mud the rascals are waiting ahead urquhart told sharpe i thought they might have gone sharpe said theyre formed and ready urquhart said formed and ready the captain was a finelooking man with a stern face straight back and steady nerve the men trusted him in other days sharpe would have been proud to serve a man like urquhart but the captain seemed irritated by sharpes presence well be wheeling to the right soon urquhart called to colquhoun forming line on the right in two ranks aye sir urquhart glanced up at the sky three hours of daylight left he guessed enough to do the job youll take the left files ensign yes sir sharpe said and knew that he would have nothing to do there the men understood their duty the corporals would close the files and sharpe would simply walk behind them like a dog tied to a cart there was a sudden crash of guns as a whole battery of enemy cannon opened fire sharpe heard the round shots whipping through the millet but none of the missiles came near the th the battalions pipers had started playing and the men picked up their feet and hefted their muskets in preparation for the grim work ahead two more guns fired and this time sharpe saw a wisp of smoke above the seed heads and he knew that a shell had gone overhead the smoke trail from the burning fuse wavered in the windless heat as sharpe waited for the explosion but none sounded cut his fuse too long urquhart said his horse was nervous or perhaps it disliked the treacherous footing in the bottom of the ditch urquhart spurred the horse up the bank where it trampled the millet what is this stuff he asked sharpe maize colquhoun says its millet sharpe said pearl millet urquhart grunted then kicked his horse on towards the front of the company sharpe cuffed sweat from his eyes he wore an officers red tail coat with the white facings of the th the coat had belonged to a lieutenant blaine who had died at assaye and sharpe had purchased the coat for a shilling in the auction of dead officers effects then he had clumsily sewn up the bullet hole in the left breast but no amount of scrubbing had rid the coat of blaines blood which stained the faded red weave black he wore his old trousers the ones issued to him when he was a sergeant red leather riding boots that he had taken from an arab corpse in ahmednuggur and a tasselled red officers sash that he had pulled off a corpse at assaye for a sword he wore a light cavalry sabre the same weapon he had used to save wellesleys life at the battle of assaye he did not like the sabre much it was clumsy and the curved blade was never where you thought it was you struck with the sword and just when you thought it would bite home you found that the blade still had six inches to travel the other officers carried claymores big straightbladed heavy and lethal and sharpe should have equipped himself with one but he had baulked at the auction prices he could have bought every claymore in the auction if he had wished but he had not wanted to give the impression of being wealthy which he was but a man like sharpe was not supposed to have money he was up from the ranks a common soldier gutterborn and gutterbred but he had hacked down a halfdozen men to save wellesleys life and the general had rewarded sergeant sharpe by making him into an officer and ensign sharpe was too canny to let his new battalion know that he possessed a kings fortune a dead kings fortune the jewels he had taken from the tippoo sultan in the blood and smokestinking water gate at seringapatam would he be more popular if it was known he was rich he doubted it wealth did not give respectability not unless it was inherited besides it was not poverty that excluded sharpe from both the officers mess and the ranks alike but rather that he was a stranger the th had taken a beating at assaye not an officer had been left unwounded and companies that had paraded seventy or eighty strong before the battle now had only forty to fifty men the battalion had been ripped through hell and back and its survivors now clung to each other sharpe might have been at assaye he might even have distinguished himself on the battlefield but he had not been through the murderous ordeal of the th and so he was an outsider line to the right sergeant colquhoun shouted and the company wheeled right and shook itself into a line of two ranks the ditch had emerged from the millet to join a wide dry riverbed and sharpe looked northwards to see a rill of dirty white gunsmoke on the horizon mahratta guns but a long way away now that the battalion was free of the tall crops sharpe could just detect a small wind it was not strong enough to cool the heat but it would waft the gunsmoke slowly away halt urquhart called face front the enemy cannon might be far off but it seemed that the battalion would march straight up the riverbed into the mouths of those guns but at least the th was not alone the th another highland battalion was on their right and on either side of those two scottish battalions were long lines of madrassi sepoys urquhart rode back to sharpe stevensons joined the captain spoke loud enough for the rest of the company to hear urquhart was encouraging them by letting them know that the two small british armies had combined general wellesley commanded both but for most of the time he split his forces into two parts the smaller under colonel stevenson but today the two small parts had combined so that twelve thousand infantry could attack together but against how many sharpe could not see the mahratta army beyond their guns but doubtless the bastards were there in force which means the ths off to our left somewhere urquhart added loudly and some of the men muttered their approval of the news the th was another scottish regiment so today there were three scottish battalions attacking the mahrattas three scottish and ten sepoy battalions and most of the scots reckoned that they could have done the job by themselves sharpe reckoned they could too they may not have liked him much but he knew they were good soldiers tough bastards he sometimes tried to imagine what it must be like for the mahrattas to fight against the scots hell he guessed absolute hell the thing is colonel mccandless had once told sharpe it takes twice as much to kill a scot as it does to finish off an englishman poor mccandless he had been finished off shot in the dying moments of assaye any of the enemy might have killed the colonel but sharpe had convinced himself that the traitorous englishman william dodd had fired the fatal shot and dodd was still free still fighting for the mahrattas and sharpe had sworn over mccandlesss grave that he would take vengeance on the scotsmans behalf he had made the oath as he had dug the colonels grave getting blisters as he had hacked into the dry soil mccandless had been a good friend to sharpe and now with the colonel deep buried so that no bird or beast could feast on his corpse sharpe felt friendless in this army guns a shout sounded behind the th make way two batteries of sixpounder galloper guns were being hauled up the dry riverbed to form an artillery line ahead of the infantry the guns were called gallopers because they were light and were usually hauled by horses but now they were all harnessed to teams of ten oxen so they plodded rather than galloped the oxen had painted horns and some had bells about their necks the heavy guns were all back on the road somewhere so far back that they would probably be too late to join this days party the land was more open now there were a few patches of tall millet ahead but off to the east there were arable fields and sharpe watched as the guns headed for that dry grassland the enemy was watching too and the first round shots bounced on the grass and ricocheted over the british guns a few minutes before the gunners bother themselves with us i fancy urquhart said then kicked his right foot out of its stirrup and slid down beside sharpe jock he called a soldier hold onto my horse will you the soldier led the horse off to a patch of grass and urquhart jerked his head inviting sharpe to follow him out of the companys earshot the captain seemed embarrassed as was sharpe who was not accustomed to such intimacy with urquhart dyou use a cigar sharpe the captain asked sometimes sir here urquhart offered sharpe a roughly rolled cigar then struck a light in his tinderbox he lit his own cigar first then held the box with its flickering flame to sharpe the major tells me a new draft has arrived in madras thats good sir it wont restore our strength of course but itll help urquhart said he was not looking at sharpe but staring at the british guns that steadily advanced across the grassland there were only a dozen of the cannon far fewer than the mahratta guns a shell exploded by one of the ox teams blasting the beasts with smoke and scraps of turf and sharpe expected to see the gun stop as the dying beasts tangled the traces but the oxen trudged on miraculously unhurt by the shells violence if they advance too far urquhart murmured theyll become so much scrap metal are you happy here sharpe happy sir sharpe was taken aback by the sudden question urquhart frowned as if he found sharpes response unhelpful happy he said again content not sure a soldiers meant to be happy sir not true not true urquhart said disapprovingly he was as tall as sharpe rumour said that urquhart was a very rich man but the only sign of it was his uniform which was cut very elegantly in contrast to sharpes shabby coat urquhart rarely smiled which made it difficult to be easy in his company sharpe wondered why the captain had sought this conversation which seemed untypical of the unbending urquhart perhaps he was nervous about the imminent battle it seemed unlikely to sharpe after urquhart had endured the cauldron of fire at assaye but he could think of no other explanation a fellow should be content in his work urquhart said with a flourish of his cigar and if he aint its probably a sign that hes in the wrong line of business dont have much work to do sir sharpe said wishing he did not sound so surly dont suppose you do urquhart said slowly i do see your meaning indeed i do he shuffled his feet in the dust company runs itself i suppose colquhouns a good fellow and sergeant craigs showing well dont you think yes sir sharpe knew he did not need to call urquhart sir all the time but old habits died hard theyre both good calvinists you see urquhart said makes em trustworthy yes sir sharpe said he was not exactly sure what a calvinist was and he was not going to ask maybe it was the same as a freemason and there were plenty of those in the ths mess though sharpe again did not really know what they were he just knew he was not one of them thing is sharpe urquhart went on though he did not look at sharpe as he spoke youre sitting on a fortune if you follow me a fortune sir sharpe asked with some alarm had urquhart somehow smelt out sharpes hoard of emeralds rubies diamonds and sapphires youre an ensign urquhart explained and if you aint happy you can always sell your commission plenty of fine fellows in scotland wholl pay you fora the rank even some fellows here i gather the scotch brigade has some gentlemen rankers so urquhart was not nervous about the coming fight but rather about sharpes reaction to this conversation the captain wanted to be rid of sharpe and the realization made sharpe even more awkward he had wanted to be made an officer so badly and already he wished he had never dreamed of the promotion what had he expected to be slapped on the back and welcomed like a longlost brother to be given a company of troops urquhart was watching him expectantly waiting for a response but sharpe said nothing four hundred pounds sharpe urquhart said thats the official rate for an ensigns commission but between you and me you can squeeze at least another fifty maybe even a hundred and in guineas but if you do sell to a ranker here then make damn sure his note is good sharpe said nothing were there really gentlemen rankers in the th such men could afford to be officers and had an officers breeding but until a commission was vacant they served in the ranks yet ate in the mess they were neither fish nor fowl like sharpe himself and any one of them would snap at the chance to buy a commission in the th but sharpe hardly needed the money he possessed a fortune already and if he wanted to leave the army then all he needed to do was resign his commission and walk away walk away a rich man of course urquhart went on oblivious of sharpes thoughts if the notes written on a decent army agent then you wont have any worries most of our fellows use john borrey in edinburgh so if you see one of his notes then you can place full trust in it borreys an honest fellow another calvinist you see and a freemason sir sharpe asked he was not really sure why he asked but the question just got blurted out he supposed he wanted to know if it was the same thing as a calvinist i really couldnt say urquhart frowned at sharpe and his voice became colder the point is sharpe hes trustworthy four hundred and fifty guineas sharpe thought it was not to be spat on it was another small fortune to add to his jewels and he felt the temptation to accept urquharts advice he was never going to be welome in the th and with his plunder he could set himself up in england coins on the barrelhead urquhart said think on it sharpe think on it jock my horse sharpe threw away the cigar his mouth was dry with dust and the smoke was harsh but as urquhart mounted his horse he saw the scarcely smoked cigar lying on the ground and gave sharpe an unfriendly look for a second it seemed as if the captain might say something then he pulled on the reins and spurred away bugger it sharpe thought cant do a thing right these days the mahratta cannon had got the range of the british galloper guns now and one of their round shot landed plumb on a carriage one wheel splintered tipping the sixpounder gun onto its side the gunners leaped off the limber but before they could detach the spare wheel the ox team bolted they dragged the broken gun back towards the sepoys leaving a vast plume of dust where the axle boss dragged through the dry soil the gunners ran to head the oxen off but then a second team panicked the beasts had their painted horns down and were galloping away from the bombardment the mahratta guns were firing fast now a round shot slashed into another gun team spurting ox blood bright into the sky the enemy guns were big brutes and with a much longer range than the small british sixpounders a pair of shells exploded behind the panicked oxen driving them even faster towards the sepoy battalions on the right of wellesleys line the limbers were bouncing frantically on the uneven ground and every lurch sent shot tumbling or powder spilling sharpe saw general wellesley turn his horse towards the sepoys he was doubtless shouting at them to open ranks and so allow the bolting oxen to pass through the line but instead quite suddenly the men themselves turned and ran jesus sharpe said aloud earning himself a reproving look from sergeant colquhoun two battalions of the sepoys were fleeing sharpe saw the general riding among the fugitives and he imagined wellesley shouting at the frightened men to stop and reform but instead they kept running towards the millet they had been panicked by the oxen and by the weight of enemy shot that beat the dry grassland with dust and smoke the men vanished in the high stalks leaving nothing behind but a scatter of embarrassed officers and astonishingly the two panicked gun teams which had inexplicably stopped short of the millet and now waited patiently for the gunners to catch them sit yourselves down urquhart called to his men and the company squatted in the dry riverbed one man took a stump of clay pipe from his pouch and lit it with a tinderbox the tobacco smoke drifted slowly in the small wind a few men drank from their canteens but most were hoarding their water against the dryness that would come when they bit into their cartridges sharpe glanced behind hoping to see the pucka lees who brought the battalion water but there was no sign of them when he turned back to the north he saw that some enemy cavalry had appeared on the crest their tall lances making a spiky thicket against the sky doubtless the enemy horsemen were tempted to attack the broken british line and so stampede more of the nervous sepoys but a squadron of british cavalry emerged from a wood with their sabres drawn to threaten the flank of the enemy horsemen neither side charged but instead they just watched each other the ths pipers had ceased their playing the remaining british galloper guns were deploying now facing up the long gentle slope to where the enemy cannon lined the horizon are all the muskets loaded urquhart asked colquhoun theyd better be sir or ill want to know why urquhart dismounted he had a dozen full canteens of water tied to his saddle and he unstrung six of them and gave them to the company share it out he ordered and sharpe wished he had thought to bring some extra water himself one man cupped some water in his hands and let his dog lap it up the dog then sat and scratched its fleas while its master lay back and tipped his shako over his eyes what the enemy should do sharpe thought is throw their infantry forward all of it send a massive attack across the skyline and down towards the millet flood the riverbed with a horde of screaming warriors who could add to the panic and so snatch victory but the skyline stayed empty except for the guns and the stalled enemy lancers and so the redcoats waited colonel william dodd commanding officer of dodds cobras spurred his horse to the skyline from where he stared down the slope to see the british force in disarray it looked to him as though two or more battalions had fled in panic leaving a gaping hole on the right of the redcoat line he turned his horse and kicked it to where the mahratta warlord waited under his banners dodd forced his horse through the aides until he reached prince manu bappoo throw everything forward sahib he advised bappoo now manu bappoo showed no sign of having heard dodd the mahratta commander was a tall and lean man with a long scarred face and a short black beard he wore yellow robes had a silver helmet with a long horsetail plume and carried a drawn sword that he claimed to have taken in single combat from a british cavalry officer dodd doubted the claim for the sword was of no pattern that he recognized but he was not willing to challenge bappoo directly on the matter bappoo was not like most of the mahratta leaders that dodd knew bappoo might be a prince and the younger brother of the cowardly rajah of berar but he was also a fighter attack now dodd insisted much earlier in the day he had advised against fighting the british at all but now it seemed that his advice had been wrong for the british assault had dissolved in panic long before it reached musket range attack with everything weve got sahib dodd urged bappoo if i throw everything forward colonel dodd bappoo said in his oddly sibilant voice then my guns will have to cease fire let the british walk into the cannon fire then we shall release the infantry i bappoo had lost his front teeth to a lance thrust and hissed his words so that to dodd he sounded like a snake he even looked reptilian maybe it was his hooded eyes or perhaps it was just his air of silent menace but at least he could fight bappoos brother the rajah of berar had fled before the battle at assaye but bappoo who had not been present at assaye was no coward indeed he could bite like a serpent the british walked into the cannon fire at assaye dodd growled and there were fewer of them and we had more guns but still they won bappoo patted his horse which had shied away from the sound of a nearby cannon it was a big black arab stallion and its saddle was encrusted with silver both horse and saddle had been gifts from an arabian sheik whose tribesmen sailed to india to serve in bappoos own regiment they were mercenaries from the pitiless desert who called themselves the lions of allah and they were reckoned to be the most savage regiment in all india the lions of allah were arrayed behind bappoo a phalanx of darkfaced whiterobed warriors armed with muskets and long curved scimitars you truly think we should fight them in front of our guns bappoo asked dodd muskets will kill more of them than cannon will dodd said one of the things he liked about bappoo was that the man was willing to listen to advice meet them halfway sahib thin the bastards out with musket fire then pull back to let the guns finish them with canister better still sahib put the guns on the flank to rake them too late to do that bappoo said aye well mebbe dodd sniffed why the indians stubbornly insisted on putting guns in front of infantry he did not know daft idea it was but they would do it he kept telling them to put their cannon between the regiments so that the gunners could slant their fire across the face of the infantry but indian commanders reckoned that the sight of guns directly in front heartened their men but put some infantry out front sahib he urged bappoo thought about dodds proposal he did not much like the englishman who was a tall ungainly and sullen man with long yellow teeth and a sarcastic manner but bappoo suspected his advice was good the prince had never fought the british before but he was aware that they were somehow different from the other enemies he had slaughtered on a score of battlefields across western india there was he understood a stolid indifference to death in those red ranks that let them march calmly into the fiercest cannonade he had not seen it happen but he had heard about it from enough men to credit the reports even so he found it hard to abandon the tried and tested methods of battle it would seem unnatural to advance his infantry in front of the guns and so render the artillery useless he had thirtyeight cannon all of them heavier than anything the british had yet deployed and his gunners were as well trained as any in the world thirtyeight heavy cannon could make a fine slaughter of advancing infantry yet if what dodd said was true then the redcoated ranks would stoically endure the punishment and keep coming except some had already run which suggested they were nervous so perhaps this was the day when the gods would finally turn against the british i saw two eagles this morning bappoo told dodd outlined against the sun so bloody what dodd thought the indians were great ones for auguries forever staring into pots of oil or consulting holy men or worrying about the errant fall of a trembling leaf but there was no better augury for victory than the sight of an enemy running away before they even reached the fight i assume the eagles mean victory dodd asked politely they do bappoo agreed and the augury suggested the victory would be his whatever tactics he used which inclined him against trying anything new besides though prince manu bappoo had never fought the british nor had the british ever faced the lions of allah in battle and the numbers were in bappoos favour he was barring the british advance with forty thousand men while the redcoats were not even a third of that number we shall wait bappoo decided and let the enemy get closer he would crush them with cannon fire first then with musketry perhaps i shall release the lions of allah when the british are closer colonel he said to pacify dodd one regiment wont do it dodd said not even your arabs sahib throw every man forward the whole line maybe bappoo said vaguely though he had no intention of advancing all his infantry in front of the precious guns he had no need to the vision of eagles had persuaded him that he would see victory and he believed the gunners would make that victory he imagined dead redcoated bodies among the crops he would avenge assaye and prove that redcoats could die like any other enemy to your men colonel dodd he said sternly dodd wheeled his horse and spurred towards the right of the line where his cobras waited in four ranks it was a fine regiment splendidly trained which dodd had extricated from the siege of ahmednuggur and then from the panicked chaos of the defeat at assaye two disasters yet dodds men had never flinched the regiment had been a part of scindias army but after assaye the cobras had retreated with the rajah of berars infantry and prince manu bappoo summoned from the north country to take command of berars shattered forces had persuaded dodd to change his allegiance from scindia to the rajah of berar dodd would have changed allegiance anyway for the dispirited scindia was seeking to make peace with the british but bappoo had added the inducement of gold silver and a promotion to colonel dodds men mercenaries all did not care which master they served so long as his purse was deep gopal dodds secondincommand greeted the colonels return with a rueful look he wont advance he wants the guns to do the work gopal heard the doubt in dodds voice and they wont they didnt at assaye dodd said sourly damn it we shouldnt be fighting them here at all never give redcoats open ground we should be making the bastards climb walls or cross rivers dodd was nervous of defeat and he had cause to be for the british had put a price on his head that price was now seven hundred guineas nearly six thousand rupees and all of it promised in gold to whoever delivered william dodds body dead or alive to the east india company dodd had been a lieutenant in the companys army but he had encouraged his men to murder a goldsmith and faced with prosecution dodd had deserted and taken over a hundred sepoys with him that had been enough to put a price on his head but the price rose after dodd and his treacherous sepoys murdered the companys garrison at chasalgaon now dodds body was worth a fortune and william dodd understood greed well enough to be fearful if bappoos army collapsed today as the mahratta army had disintegrated at assaye then dodd would be a fugitive on an open plain dominated by enemy cavalry we should fight them in the hills he said grimly then we should fight them at gawilghur gopal said gawilghur dodd asked it is the greatest of all the mahratta fortresses sahib not all the armies of europe could take gawilghur gopal saw that dodd was sceptical of the claim not all the armies of the world could take it sahib he added earnestly it stands on cliffs that touch the sky and from its walls men are reduced to the size of lice theres a way in though dodd said theres always a way in there is sahib but the way into gawilghur is across a neck of high rock that leads only to an outer fortress a man might fight his way through those outer walls but then he will come to a deep ravine and find the real stronghold lies on the ravines far side there are more walls more guns a narrow path and vast gates barring the way gopal sighed i saw it once years ago and prayed i would never have to fight an enemy who had taken refuge there dodd said nothing he was staring down the gentle slope to where the redcoated infantry waited every few seconds a puff of dust showed where a round shot struck the ground if things go badly today gopal said quietly then we shall go to gawilghur and there we shall be safe the british can follow us but they cannot reach us they will break themselves on gawilghurs rocks while we take our rest at the edge of the fortresss lakes we shall be in the sky and they will die beneath us like dogs if gopal was right then not all the kings horses nor all the kings men could touch william dodd at gawilghur but first he had to reach the fortress and maybe it would not even be necessary for prince manu bappoo might yet beat the redcoats here bappoo believed there was no infantry in india that could stand against his arab mercenaries away on the plain dodd could see that the two battalions that had fled into the tall crops were now being brought back into the line in a moment he knew that line would start forward again tell our guns to hold their fire he ordered gopal dodds cobras possessed five small cannon of their own designed to give the regiment close support dodds guns were not in front of his whitecoated men but away on the right flank from where they could lash a murderous slanting fire across the face of the advancing enemy load with canister he ordered and wait till theyre close the important thing was to win but if fate decreed otherwise then dodd must live to fight again at a place where a man could not be beaten at gawilghur the british line at last advanced from east to west it stretched for three miles snaking in and out of millet fields through pastureland and across the wide dry riverbed the centre of the line was an array of thirteen redcoated infantry battalions three of them scottish and the rest sepoys while two regiments of cavalry advanced on the left flank and four on the right beyond the regular cavalry were two masses of mercenary horsemen who had allied themselves to the british in hope of loot drums beat and pipes played the colours hung above the shakos a great swathe of crops was trodden flat as the cumbersome line marched north the british guns opened fire their small sixpound missiles aimed at the mahratta guns those mahratta guns fired constantly sharpe walking behind the left flank of number six company watched one particular gun which stood just beside a bright clump of flags on the enemyheld skyline he slowly counted to sixty in his head then counted it again and worked out that the gun had managed five shots in two minutes he could not be certain just how many guns were on the horizon for the great cloud of powder smoke hid them but he tried to count the muzzle flashes that appeared as momentary bright flames amidst the greywhite vapour and as best he could guess he reckoned there were nearly forty cannon there forty times five was what two hundred so a hundred shots a minute were being fired and each shot if properly aimed might kill two men one in the front rank and one behind once the attack was close of course the bastards would switch to canister and then every shot could pluck a dozen men out of the line but for now as the redcoats silently trudged forward the enemy was sending round shot down the gentle slope a good many of these missed some screamed overhead and a few bounced over the line but the enemy gunners were good and they were lowering their cannon barrels so that the round shot struck the ground well ahead of the redcoat line and by the time the missile reached the target it had bounced a dozen times and so struck at waist height or below grazing the gunners called it and it took skill if the first graze was too close to the gun then the ball would lose its momentum and do nothing but raise jeers from the redcoats as it rolled to a harmless stop while if the first graze was too close to the attacking line then the ball would bounce clean over the redcoats the skill was to skim the ball low enough to be certain of a hit and all along the line the round shots were taking their toll men were plucked back with shattered hips and legs sharpe passed one spent cannonball that was sticky with blood and thick with flies lying twenty paces from the man it had eviscerated close up the sergeants shouted and the fileclosers tugged men to fill the gaps the british guns were firing into the enemy smoke cloud but their shots seemed to have no effect and so the guns were ordered farther forward the ox teams were brought up the guns were attached to the limbers and the sixpounders trundled on up the slope like ninepins ensign venables had appeared at sharpes side roderick venables was sixteen years old and attached to number seven company he had been the battalions most junior officer till sharpe joined and venables had taken it on himself to be a tutor to sharpe in how officers should behave theyre bowling us over like ninepins eh richard before sharpe could reply a halfdozen men of number six company threw themselves aside as a cannonball bounced hard and low towards them it whipped harmlessly through the gap they had made the men laughed at having evaded it then sergeant colquhoun ordered them back into their two ranks arent you supposed to be on the left of your company sharpe asked venables youre still thinking like a sergeant richard venables said pigears doesnt mind where i am pigears was captain lomax who had earned his nickname not because of any peculiarity about his ears but because he had a passion for crisply fried pigears lomax was easygoing unlike urquhart who liked everything done strictly according to regulations besides venables went on theres damn all to do the lads know their business waste of time being an ensign sharpe said nonsense an ensign is merely a colonel in the making venables said our duty richard is to be decorative and stay alive long enough to be promoted but no one expects us to be useful good god a junior officer being useful thatll be the day venables gave a hoot of laughter he was a bumptious vain youth but one of the few officers in the th who offered sharpe companionship did you hear a new draft has come to madras he asked urquhart told me fresh men new officers you wont be junior any more sharpe shook his head depends on the date the new men were commissioned doesnt it suppose it does quite right and they must have sailed from britain long before you got the jump up eh so youll still be the mess baby bad luck old fellow old fellow quite right sharpe thought he was old probably ten years older than venables though sharpe was not exactly sure for no one had ever bothered to note down his birth date ensigns were youths and sharpe was a man whoah venables shouted in delight and sharpe looked up to see that a round shot had struck the edge of an irrigation canal and bounced vertically upwards in a shower of soil tigears says he once saw two cannonballs collide in midair venables said well he didnt actually see it of course but he heard it he says they suddenly appeared in the sky bang then flopped down theyd have shattered and broken up sharpe said not according to pigears venables insisted he says they flattened each other a shell exploded ahead of the company whistling scraps of iron casing overhead no one was hurt and the files stepped round the smoking fragments venables stooped and plucked up a scrap juggling it because of the heat like to have keepsakes he explained slipping the piece of iron into a pouch ill send it home for my sisters why dont our guns stop and fire still too far away sharpe said the advancing line still had half a mile to go and while the sixpounders could fire at that distance the gunners must have decided to get really close so that their shots could not miss get close that was what colonel mccandless had always told sharpe it was the secret of battle get close before you start slaughtering a round shot struck a file in seven company it was on its first graze still travelling at blistering speed and the two men of the file were whipped backwards in a spray of mingling blood jesus venables said in awe jesus the corpses were mixed together a jumble of splintered bones tangled entrails and broken weapons a corporal one of the file closers stooped to extricate the mens pouches and haversacks from the scattered offal two more names in the church porch venables remarked who were they corporal the mcfadden brothers sir the corporal had to shout to be heard over the roar of the mahratta guns poor bastards venables said still there are six more a fecund lady rosie mcfadden sharpe wondered what fecund meant then decided he could guess venables for all his air of carelessness was looking slightly pale as though the sight of the churned corpses had sickened him this was his first battle for he had been sick with the malabar itch during assaye but the ensign was forever explaining that he could not be upset by the sight of blood because from his earliest days he had assisted his father who was an edinburgh surgeon but now he suddenly turned aside bent over and vomited sharpe kept stolidly walking some of the men turned at the sound of venabless retching eyes front sharpe snarled sergeant colquhoun gave sharpe a resentful look the sergeant believed that any order that did not come from himself or from captain urquhart was an unnecessary order venables caught up with sharpe something i ate india does that sharpe said sympathetically not to you not yet sharpe said and wished he was carrying a musket so he could touch the wooden stock for luck captain urquhart sheered his horse left wards to your company mister venables venables scuttled away and urquhart rode back to the companys right flank without acknowledging sharpes presence major swinton who commanded the battalion while colonel wallace had responsibility for the brigade galloped his horse behind the ranks the hooves thudded heavily on the dry earth all well swinton called to urquhart all well good man swinton spurred on the sound of the enemy guns was constant now like thunder that did not end a thunder that pummelled the ears and almost drowned out the skirl of the pipers earth fountained where round shot struck sharpe glancing to his left could see a scatter of bodies lying in the wake of the long line there was a village there how the hell had he walked straight past a village without even seeing it it was not much of a place just a huddle of reedthatched hovels with a few patchwork gardens protected by cactusthorn hedges but he had still walked clean past without noticing its existence he could see no one there the villagers had too much sense they would have packed their few pots and pans and buggered off as soon as the first soldier appeared near their fields a mahratta round shot smacked into one of the hovels scattering reed and dry timber and leaving the sad roof sagging sharpe looked the other way and saw enemy cavalry advancing in the distance then he glimpsed the blue and yellow uniforms of the british igth dragoons trotting to meet them the lateafternoon sunlight glittered on drawn sabres he thought he heard a trumpet call but maybe he imagined it over the hammering of the guns the horsemen vanished behind a stand of trees a cannonball screamed overhead a shell exploded to his left then the ths light company edged inwards to give an ox team room to pass back southwards the british cannon had been dragged well ahead of the attacking line where they had now been turned and deployed gunners rammed home shot pushed priming quills into touchholes stood back the sound of the guns crashed across the field blotting the immediate view with greywhite smoke and filling the air with the nauseous stench of rotted eggs the drummers beat on timing the long march north for the moment it was a battle of artillerymen the puny british sixpounders firing into the smoke cloud where the bigger mahratta guns pounded at the advancing redcoats sweat trickled down sharpes belly it stung his eyes and it dripped from his nose flies buzzed by his face he pulled the sabre free and found that its handle was slippery with perspiration so he wiped it and his right hand on the hem of his red coat he suddenly wanted to piss badly but this was not the time to stop and unbutton breeches hold it he told himself till the bastards are beaten or piss in your pants he told himself because in this heat no one would know it from sweat and it would dry quickly enough might smell though better to wait and if any of the men knew he had pissed his pants he would never live it down pisspants sharpe a ball thumped overhead so close that its passage rocked sharpes shako a fragment of something whirred to his left a man was on the ground vomiting blood a dog barked as another tugged blue guts from an opened belly the beast had both paws on the corpse to give its tug purchase a filecloser kicked the dog away but as soon as the man was gone the dog ran back to the body sharpe wished he could have a good wash he knew he was lousy but then everyone was lousy even general wellesley was probably lousy sharpe looked eastwards and saw the general spurring up behind the kilted th sharpe had been wellesleys orderly at assaye and as a result he knew all the staff officers who rode behind the general they had been much friendlier than the ths officers but then they had not been expected to treat sharpe as an equal bugger it he thought maybe he should take urquharts advice go home take the cash buy an inn and hang the sabre over the serving hatch would simone joubert go to england with him she might like running an inn the buggered dream he could call it and he would charge army officers twice the real price for any drink the mahratta guns suddenly went silent at least those that were directly ahead of the th and the change in the battles noise made sharpe peer ahead into the smoke cloud that hung over the crest just a quartermile away more smoke wreathed the th but that was from the british guns the enemy gun smoke was clearing carried northwards on the small wind but there was nothing there to show why the guns at the centre of the mahratta line had ceased fire perhaps the buggers had run out of ammunition some hope he thought some bloody hope or perhaps they were all reloading with canister to give the approaching redcoats a rajahs welcome god but he needed a piss and so he stopped tucked the sabre into his armpit then fumbled with his buttons one came away he swore stooped to pick it up then stood and emptied his bladder onto the dry ground then urquhart was wheeling his horse must you do that now mister sharpe he asked irritably yes sir three bladders full sir and damn your bloody eyes sir sorry sir sharpe said instead so maybe proper officers didnt piss he sensed the company was laughing at him and he ran to catch up fiddling with his buttons still there was no gunfire from the mahratta centre why not but then a cannon on one of the enemy flanks fired slantwise across the field and the ball grazed right through number six company ripping a front rank mans feet off and slashing a man behind through the knees another soldier was limping his leg deeply pierced by a splinter from his neighbours bone corporal mccallum one of the fileclosers tugged men into the gap while a piper ran across to bandage the wounded men the injured would be left where they fell until after the battle when if they still lived they would be carried to the surgeons and if they survived the knives and saws they would be shipped home good for nothing except to be a burden on the parish or maybe the scots did not have parishes sharpe was not sure but he was certain the buggers had workhouses everyone had workhouses and paupers graveyards better to be buried out here in the black earth of enemy india than condemned to the charity of a workhouse then he saw why the guns in the centre of the mahratta line had ceased fire the gaps between the guns were suddenly filled with men running forward men in long robes and headdresses they streamed between the gaps then joined together ahead of the guns beneath long green banners that trailed from silvertopped poles arabs sharpe thought he had seen some at ahmednuggur but most of those had been dead he remembered sevajee the mahratta who fought alongside colonel mccandless saying that the arab mercenaries were the best of all the enemy troops now there was a horde of desert warriors coming straight for the th and their kilted neighbours the arabs came in a loose formation their guns had decorated stocks that glinted in the sunlight while curved swords were scabbarded at their waists they came almost jauntily as though they had utter confidence in their ability how many were there a thousand sharpe reckoned at least a thousand their officers were on horseback they did not advance in ranks and files but in a mass and some the bravest men ran ahead as if eager to start the killing the great robed mass was chanting a shrill war cry while in its centre drummers were beating huge instruments that pulsed a bellythumping beat across the field sharpe watched the nearest british gun load with canister the green banners were being waved from side to side so that the silk trails snaked over the warriors heads something was written on the banners but it was in no script that sharpe recognized th major swinton called halt the th had also halted the two highland battalions both under strength after their losses at assaye were taking the full brunt of the arab charge the rest of the battlefield seemed to melt away all sharpe could see was the robed men coming so eagerly towards him make ready swinton called make ready urquhart echoed make ready sergeant colquhoun shouted the men raised their muskets chest high and pulled back the heavy hammers sharpe pushed into the gap between number six company and its lefthand neighbour number seven he wished he had a musket the sabre felt flimsy present swinton called present colquhoun echoed and the muskets went into the mens shoulders heads bowed to peer down the barrels lengths youll fire low boys urquhart said from behind the line youll fire low to your place mister sharpe bugger it sharpe thought another bloody mistake he stepped back behind the company where he was supposed to make sure no one tried to run the arabs were close less than a hundred paces to go now some had their swords drawn the air miraculously smokefree was filled with their bloodchilling war cry which was a weird ululating sound not far now not far at all the scotsmens muskets were angled slightly down the kick drove the barrels upwards and untrained troops not ready for the heavy recoil usually fired high but this volley would be lethal wait boys wait pigears called to number seven company ensign venables slashed at weeds with his claymore he looked nervous urquhart had drawn a pistol he dragged the cock back and his horses ears flicked back as the pistols spring clicked arab faces screamed hatred their great drums were thumping the redcoat line just two ranks deep looked frail in front of the savage charge major swinton took a deep breath sharpe edged towards the gap again bugger it he wanted to be in the front line where he could kill it was too nerveracking behind the line th swinton shouted then he paused mens fingers curled about their triggers let them get close swinton was thinking let them get close it then kill them it prince manu bappoos brother the rajah of berar was not at the village of argaum where the lions of allah now charged to destroy the heart of the british attack the rajah did not like battle he liked the idea of conquest he loved to see prisoners paraded and he craved the loot that filled his storehouses but he had no belly for fighting manu bappoo had no such qualms he was thirtyfive years old he had fought since he was fifteen and all he asked was the chance to go on fighting for another twenty or forty years he considered himself a true mahratta a pirate a rogue a thief in armour a looter a pestilence a successor to the generations of mahrattas who had dominated western india by pouring from their hill fastnesses to terrorize the plump princedoms and luxurious kingdoms in the plains a quick sword a fast horse and a wealthy victim what more could a man want and so bappoo had ridden deep and far to bring plunder and ransom back to the small land of berar but now all the mahratta lands were threatened one british army was conquering their northern territory and another was here in the south it was this southern redcoat force that had broken the troops of scindia and berar at assaye and the rajah of berar had summoned his brother to bring his lions of allah to claw and kill the invader this was not a task for horsemen the rajah had warned bappoo but for infantry it was a task for the arabs but bappoo knew this was a task for horsemen his arabs would win of that he was sure but they could only break the enemy on the immediate battlefield he had thought to let the british advance right up to his cannon then release the arabs but a whim an intimation of triumph had decided him to advance the arabs beyond the guns let the lions of allah loose on the enemys centre and when that centre was broken the rest of the british line would scatter and run in panic and that was when the mahratta horsemen would have their slaughter it was already early evening and the sun was sinking in the reddened west but the sky was cloudless and bappoo was anticipating the joys of a moonlit hunt across the flat deccan plain we shall gallop through blood he said aloud then led his aides towards his armys right flank so that he could charge past his arabs when they had finished their fight he would let his victorious lions of allah pillage the enemys camp while he led his horsemen on a wild victorious gallop through the moontouched darkness and the british would run they would run like goats from the tiger but the tiger was clever he had only kept a small number of horsemen with the army a mere fifteen thousand while the greater part of his cavalry had been sent southwards to raid the enemys long supply roads the british would flee straight into those mens sabres bappoo trotted his horse just behind the right flank of the lions of allah the british guns were firing canister and bappoo saw how the ground beside his arabs was being flecked by the blasts of shot and he saw the robed men fall but he saw how the others did not hesitate but hurried on towards the pitifully thin line of redcoats the arabs were screaming defiance the guns were hammering and bappoos soul soared with the music there was nothing finer in life he thought than this sensation of imminent victory it was like a drug that fired the mind with noble visions he might have spared a moments thought and wondered why the british did not use their muskets they were holding their fire waiting until every shot could kill but the prince was not worrying about such trifles in his dreams he was scattering a broken army slashing at them with his tulwar carving a bloody path south a fast sword a quick horse and a broken enemy it was the mahratta paradise and the lions of allah were opening its gates so that this night manu bappoo prince warrior and dreamer could ride into legend chapter fire swinton shouted the two highland regiments fired together close to a thousand muskets flaming to make an instant hedge of thick smoke in front of the battalions the arabs vanished behind the smoke as the redcoats reloaded men bit into the greasecoated cartridges tugged ramrods that they whirled in the air before rattling them down into the barrels the churning smoke began to thin revealing small fires where the musket wadding burned in the dry grass platoon fire major swinton shouted from the flanks light company captain peters called on the left flank first platoon fire kill them your mothers are watching colonel harness shouted the colonel of the yth was mad as a hatter and half delirious with a fever but he had insisted on advancing behind his kilted highlanders he was being carried in a palanquin and as the platoon fire began he struggled from the litter tojoin the battle his only weapon a broken riding crop he had been recently bled and a stained bandage trailed from a coat sleeve give them a flogging you dogs give them a flogging the two battalions fired in half companies now each half company firing two or three seconds after the neighbouring platoon so that the volleys rolled in from the outer wings of each battalion met in the centre and then started again at the flanks clockwork fire sharpe called it and it was the result of hours of tedious practice beyond the battalions flanks the sixpounders bucked back with each shot their wheels jarring up from the turf as the canisters ripped apart at the muzzles wide swathes of burning grass lay under the cannon smoke the gunners were working in shirtsleeves swabbing ramming then ducking aside as the guns pitched back again only the gun commanders most of them sergeants seemed to look at the enemy and then only when they were checking the alignment of the cannon the other gunners fetched shot and powder sometimes heaved on a handspike or pushed on the wheels as the gun was re laid then swabbed and loaded again water a corporal shouted holding up a bucket to show that the swabbing water was gone fire low dont waste your powder major swinton called as he pushed his horse into the gap between the centre companies he peered at the enemy through the smoke behind him next to the ths twin flags general wellesley and his aides also stared at the arabs beyond the smoke clouds colonel wallace the brigade commander trotted his horse to the battalions flank he called something to sharpe as he went by but his words were lost in the welter of gunfire then his horse half spun as a bullet struck its haunch wallace steadied the beast looked back at the wound but the horse did not seem badly hurt colonel harness was thrashing one of the native palanquin bearers who had been trying to push the colonel back into the curtained vehicle one of wellesleys aides rode back to quieten the colonel and to persuade him to go southwards steady now sergeant colquhoun shouted aim low the arab charge had been checked but not defeated the first volley must have hit the attackers cruelly hard for sharpe could see a line of bodies lying on the turf the bodies looked red and white blood against robes but behind that twitching heap the arabs were firing back to make their own ragged cloud of musket smoke they fired haphazardly untrained in platoon volleys but they reloaded swiftly and their bullets were striking home sharpe heard the butchers sound of metal hitting meat saw men hurled backwards saw some fall the fileclosers hauled the dead out of the line and tugged the living closer together close up close up the pipes played on adding their defiant music to the noise of the guns private hollister was hit in the head and sharpe saw a cloud of white flour drift away from the mans powdered hair as his hat fell off then blood soaked the whitened hair and hollister fell back with glassy eyes one platoon fire sergeant colquhoun shouted he was so shortsighted that he could barely see the enemy but it hardly mattered no one could see much in the smoke and all that was needed was a steady nerve and colquhoun was not a man to panic two platoon fire urquhart shouted christ jesus a man called close to sharpe he reeled backwards his musket falling then he twisted and dropped to his knees oh god oh god oh god he moaned clutching at his throat sharpe could see no wound there but then he saw blood seeping down the mans grey trousers the dying man looked up at sharpe tears showed at his eyes then he pitched forward sharpe picked up the fallen musket then turned the man over to unstrap the cartridge box the man was dead or so near as to make no difference flint a front rank man called i need a flint sergeant colquhoun elbowed through the ranks holding out a spare flint and wheres your own spare flint john hammond christ knows sergeant then ask him for youre on a charge a man swore as a bullet tore up his left arm he backed out of the ranks the arm hanging useless and dripping blood sharpe pushed into the gap between the companies put the musket to his shoulder and fired the kick slammed into his shoulder but it felt good something to do at last he dropped the butt fished a cartridge from the pouch and bit off the top tasting the salt in the gunpowder he rammed fired again loaded again a bullet made an odd fluttering noise as it went past his ear then another whined overhead he waited for the rolling volley to come down the battalions face then fired with the other men of six companys first platoon drop the butt new cartridge bite prime pour ram ramrod back in the hoops gun up butt into the bruised shoulder and haul back the doghead sharpe did it as efficiently as any other man but he had been trained to it that was the difference he thought grimly he was trained but no one trained the officers they had bugger all to do so why train them ensign venables was right the only duty of a junior officer was to stay alive but sharpe could not resist a fight besides it felt better to stand in the ranks and fire into the enemys smoke than stand behind the company and do nothing the arabs were fighting well damned well sharpe could not remember any other enemy who had stood and taken so much concentrated platoon fire indeed the robed men were trying to advance but they were checked by the ragged heap of bodies that had been their front ranks how many damned ranks had they a dozen he watched a green flag fall then the banner was picked up and waved in the air their big drums still beat making a menacing sound to match the redcoats pipers the arab guns had unnaturally long barrels that spewed dirty smoke and licking tongues of flame another bullet whipped close enough to sharpe to bat his face with a gust of warm air he fired again then a hand seized his coat collar and dragged him violently backwards your place ensign sharpe captain urquhart said vehemently is here behind the line the captain was mounted and his horse had inadvertently stepped back as urquhart seized sharpes collar and the weight of the horse had made the captains tug far more violent than he had intended youre not a private any longer he said steadying sharpe who had almost been pulled off his feet of course sir sharpe said and he did not meet urquharts gaze but stared bitterly ahead he was blushing knowing he had been reprimanded in front of the men damn it to hell he thought prepare to charge major swinton called prepare to charge captain urquhart echoed spurring his horse away from sharpe the scotsmen pulled out their bayonets and twisted them onto the lugs of their musket barrels empty your guns swinton called and those men who were still loaded raised their muskets and fired a last volley th swinton shouted forward i want to hear some pipes let me hear pipes go on swinton go on wallace shouted there was no need to encourage the battalion forward for it was going willingly but the colonel was excited he drew his claymore and pushed his horse into the rear rank of number seven company onto them lads onto them the redcoats marched forward trampling through the scatter of little fires started by their musket wadding the arabs seemed astonished that the redcoats were advancing some drew their own bayonets while others pulled long curved swords from scabbards they wont stand wellesley shouted they wont stand they bloody well will a man grunted go on swinton shouted go on and the th released to the kill ran the last few yards and jumped up onto the heaps of dead before slashing home with their bayonets off to the right the yth were also charging home the british cannon gave a last violent blast of canister then fell silent as the scots blocked the gunners aim some of the arabs wanted to fight others wanted to retreat but the charge had taken them by surprise and the rearward ranks were still not aware of the danger and so pressed forward forcing the reluctant men at the front onto the scottish bayonets the highlanders screamed as they killed sharpe still held the unloaded musket as he closed up on the rear rank he had no bayonet and was wondering whether he should draw his sabre when a tall arab suddenly hacked down a front rank man with a scimitar then pushed forward to slash with the reddened blade at the second man in the file sharpe reversed the musket swung it by the barrel and hammered the heavy stock down onto the swordsmans head the arab sank down and a bayonet struck into his spine so that he twisted like a speared eel sharpe hit him on the head again kicked him for good measure then shoved on men were shouting screaming stabbing spitting and right in the face of number six company a knot of robed men were slashing with scimitars as though they could defeat the th by themselves urquhart pushed his horse up against the rear rank and fired his pistol one of the arabs was plucked back and the others stepped away at last all except one short man who screamed in fury and slashed with his long curved blade the front rank parted to let the scimitar cut the air between two files then the second rank also split apart to allow the short man to come screaming through on his own with only sharpe in front hes only a lad a scottish voice shouted in warning as the ranks closed again it was not a short man at all but a boy maybe only twelve or thirteen years old sharpe guessed as he fended off the scimitar with the musket barrel the boy thought he could win the battle singlehanded and leaped at sharpe who parried the sword and stepped back to show he did not want to fight put it down lad he said the boy spat leaped and cut again sharpe parried a third time then reversed the musket and slammed its stock into the side of the boys head for a second the lad stared at sharpe with an astonished look then he crumpled to the turf theyre breaking wellesley shouted from somewhere close by theyre breaking colonel wallace was in the front rank now slicing down with his claymore he hacked like a farmer blow after blow he had lost his cocked hat and his bald pate gleamed in the late sunlight there was blood on his horses flank and more blood spattered on the white turn backs of his coat tails then the pressure of the enemy collapsed and the horse twisted into the gap and wallace spurred it on come on boys come on a man stooped to rescue wallaces cocked hat its plumes were bloodsoaked the arabs were fleeing go swinton shouted go keep em running go a man paused to search a corpses robes and sergeant colquhoun dragged the man up and pushed him on the fileclosers were making sure none of the enemy bodies left behind the scottish advance were dangerous they kicked swords and muskets out of injured mens hands prodded apparently unwounded bodies with bayonets and killed any man who showed a spark of fight two pipers were playing their ferocious music driving the scots up the gentle slope where the big arab drums had been abandoned man after man speared the drum skins with bayonets as they passed forward on forward on urquhart bellowed as though he were on a hunting field to the guns wellesley called keep going sharpe bellowed at some laggards go on you bastards go on the enemy gun line was at the crest of the low rise but the mahratta gunners dared not fire because the remnants of the lions of allah were between them and the redcoats the gunners hesitated for a few seconds then decided the day was lost and fled take the guns wellesley called colonel wallace spurred among the fleeing enemy striking down with the claymore then reined in beside a gaudily painted eighteen pounder come on lads come on to me the scotsmen reached the guns most had reddened bayonets all had sweat streaks striping their powderblackened faces some began rifling the limbers where gunners stored food and valuables load urquhart called load form ranks sergeant colquhoun shouted he ran forward and tugged men away from the limbers leave the carts alone boys form ranks smartly now sharpe for the first time could see down the long reverse slope three hundred paces away were more infantry a great long line of it massed in a dozen ranks and beyond that were some walled gardens and the roofs of a village the shadows were very long for the sun was blazing just above the horizon the arabs were running towards the stationary infantry where are the galloper guns wallace roared and an aide spurred back down the slope to fetch the gunners give them a volley swinton wellesley called the range was very long for a musket but swinton hammered the battalions fire down the slope and maybe it was that volley or perhaps it was the sight of the defeated arabs that panicked the great mass of infantry for a few seconds they stood under their big bright flags and then like sand struck by a flood they dissolved into a rabble cavalry trumpets blared british and sepoy horsemen charged forward with sabres while the irregular horse those mercenaries who had attached themselves to the british for the chance of loot lowered their lances and raked back their spurs it was a cavalrymans paradise a broken enemy with nowhere to hide some mahrattas sought shelter in the village but most ran past it throwing down their weapons as the terrible horsemen streamed into the fleeing horde with sabres and lances slicing and thrusting puckaleesl urquhart shouted standing in his stirrups to look for the men and boys who brought water to the troops there was none in sight and the th was parched the mens thirst made acute by the saltpetre in the gunpowder which had fouled their mouths where the urquhart swore then frowned at sharpe mister sharpe ill trouble you to find our pucka lees yes sir sharpe said not bothering to hide his disappointment at the order he had hoped to find some loot when the th searched the village but instead he was to be a fetcher of water he threw down the musket and walked back through the groaning slowmoving litter of dead and dying men dogs were scavenging among the bodies forward now wellesley called behind sharpe and the whole long line of british infantrymen advanced under their flags towards the village the cavalry was already far beyond the houses killing with abandon and driving the fugitives ever farther northwards sharpe walked on southwards he suspected the pucka lees were still back with the baggage which would mean a threemile walk and by the time he had found them the battalion would have slaked its thirst from the wells in the village bugger it he thought even when they gave him a job it was a useless errand a shout made him look to his right where a score of native cavalrymen were slicing apart the robes of the dead arabs in search of coins and trinkets the scavengers were mahrattas who had sold their services to the british and sharpe guessed that the horsemen had not joined the pursuit for fear of being mistaken for the defeated enemy one of the arabs had only been feigning death and now despite being hugely outnumbered defied his enemies with a pistol that he dragged from beneath his robe the taunting cavalrymen had made a ring and the arab kept twisting around to find that his tormentor had skipped away before he could aim the small gun the arab was a short man then he turned again and sharpe saw the bruised bloody face and recognized the child who had charged the th so bravely the boy was doomed for the ring of cavalrymen was slowly closing for the kill one of the mahrattas would probably die or at least be horribly injured by the pistol ball but that was part of the game the boy had one shot they had twenty a man prodded the boy in the back with a lance point making him whip round but the man with the lance had stepped fast back and another man slapped the boys headdress with a tulwar the other cavalrymen laughed sharpe reckoned the boy deserved better he was a kid nothing more but brave as a tiger and so he crossed to the cavalrymen let him be he called the boy turned towards sharpe if he recognized that the british officer was trying to save his life he showed no sign of gratitude instead he lifted the pistol so that its barrel pointed at sharpes face the cavalrymen reckoning this was even better sport urged him to shoot and one of them approached the boy with a raised tulwar but did not strike he would let the boy shoot sharpe then kill him let him be sharpe said stand back the mahrattas grinned but did not move sharpe could take the single bullet then they would tear the boy into sabreshredded scraps of meat the boy took a step towards sharpe dont be a bloody fool lad sharpe said the boy obviously did not speak english but sharpes tone was soothing it made no difference the lads hand was shaking and he looked frightened but defiance had been bred into his bone he knew he would die but he would take an enemy soul with him and so he nerved himself to die well tut the gun down sharpe said softly he was wishing he had not intervened now the kid was just distraught enough and mad enough to fire and sharpe knew he could do nothing about it except run away and thus expose himself to the jeers of the mahrattas he was close enough now to see the scratches on the pistols blackened muzzle where the rammer had scraped the metal dont be a bloody fool boy he said again still the boy pointed the pistol sharpe knew he should turn and run but instead he took another pace forward just one more and he reckoned he would be close enough to swat the gun aside then the boy shouted something in arabic something about allah and pulled the trigger the hammer did not move the boy looked startled then pulled the trigger again sharpe began laughing the expression of woe on the childs face was so sudden and so unfeigned that sharpe could only laugh the boy looked as if he was about to cry the mahratta behind the boy swung his tulwar he reckoned he could slice clean through the boys grubby headdress and decapitate him but sharpe had taken the extra step and now seized the boys hand and tugged him into his belly the sword hissed an inch behind the boys neck i said to leave him alone sharpe said or do you want to fight me instead none of us a calm voice said behind sharpe wants to fight ensign sharpe sharpe turned one of the horsemen was still mounted and it was this man who had spoken he was dressed in a tattered european uniform jacket of green cloth hung with small silver chains and he l had a lean scarred face with a nose as hooked as sir arthur wellesleys he now grinned down at sharpe syud sevajee sharpe said i never did congratulate you on your promotion sevajee said and leaned down to offer sharpe his hand sharpe shook it it was mccandlesss doing he said no sevajee disagreed it was yours sevajee who led this band of horsemen waved his men away from sharpe then looked down at the boy who struggled in sharpes grip you really want to save that little wretchs life why not a tiger cub plays like a kitten sevajee said but it still grows into a tiger and one day it eats you this ones no kitten sharpe said thumping the boy on the ear to stop his struggles sevajee spoke in quick arabic and the boy went quiet i told him you saved his life sevajee explained to sharpe and that he is now beholden to you sevajee spoke to the boy again who after a shy look at sharpe answered his names ahmed sevajee said and i told him you were a great english lord who commands the lives and deaths of a thousand men you told him what i told him youd beat him bloody if he disobeys you sevajee said looking at his men who denied their entertainment had gone back to looting the dead you like being an officer he asked sharpe i hate it sevajee smiled revealing redstained teeth mccandless thought you would but didnt know how to curb your ambition sevajee slid down from his saddle i am sorry mccandless died the indian said me too you know who killed him i reckon it was dodd sevajee nodded me too syud sevajee was a highborn mahratta the eldest son of one of the rajah of berars warlords but a rival in the rajahs service had murdered his father and sevajee had been seeking revenge ever since if that revenge meant marching with the enemy british then that was a small price to pay for family pride seva e had ridden with colonel mccandless when the scotsman had pursued dodd and thus he had met sharpe beny singh was not with the enemy today he told sharpe sharpe had to think for a few seconds before remembering that beny singh was the man who had poisoned sevajees father how do you know his banner wasnt among the mahratta flags today we faced manu bappoo the rajahs brother hes a better man than the rajah but he refuses to take the throne for himself hes also a better soldier than the rest but not good enough it seems dodd was there he was he got away sevajee turned and gazed northwards and i know where theyre going where to gawilghur sevajee said softly to the sky fort gawilghur i grew up there sevajee spoke softly still gazing at the hazed northern horizon my father was kill adar of gawilghur it was a post of honour sharpe for it is our greatest stronghold it is the fortress in the sky the impregnable refuge the place that has never fallen to our enemies and beny singh is now its kill adar somehow we shall have to get inside you and i and i shall kill singh and you will kill dodd thats why im here sharpe said no sevajee gave sharpe a sour glance youre here ensign because you british are greedy he looked at the arab boy and asked a question there was a brief conversation then sevajee looked at sharpe again i have told him he is to be your servant and that you will beat him to death if he steals from you i wouldnt do that sharpe protested i would sevajee said and he believes you would but it still wont stop him thieving from you better to kill him now he grinned then hauled himself into his saddle i shall look for you at gawilghur mister sharpe i shall look for you sharpe said sevajee spurred away and sharpe crouched to look at his new servant ahmed was as thin as a halfdrowned cat he wore dirty robes and a tattered headdress secured by a loop of frayed rope that was stained with blood evidently where sharpes blow with the musket had caught him during the battle but he had bright eyes and a defiant face and though his voice had not yet broken he was braver than many fullgrown men sharpe unslung his canteen and pushed it into the boys hand first taking away the broken pistol that he tossed away drink up you little bugger sharpe said then come for a walk the boy glanced up the hill but his army was long gone it had vanished into the evening beyond the crest and was now being pursued by vengeful cavalry he said something in arabic drank what remained of sharpes water then offered a grudging nod of thanks so sharpe had a servant a battle had been won and now he walked south in search of pucka lees colonel william dodd watched the lions of allah break and spat with disgust it had been foolish to fight here in the first place and now the foolery was turning to disaster jemadar he called sahib well form square put our guns in the centre and the baggage families sahib families too dodd watched manu bappoo and his aides galloping back from the british advance the gunners had already fled which meant that the mahrattas heavy cannon would all be captured every last piece of it dodd was tempted to abandon his regiments small battery of fivepounders which were about as much use as peashooters but a soldiers pride persuaded him to drag the guns from the field bappoo might lose all his guns but it would be a cold day in hell before william dodd gave up artillery to an enemy his cobras were on the mahratta right flank and there for the moment they were out of the way of the british advance if the rest of the mahratta infantry remained firm and fought then dodd would stay with them but he saw that the defeat of the arabs had demoralized bappoos army the ranks began to dissolve the first fugitives began to run north and dodd knew this army was lost first assaye now this a goddamn disaster he turned his horse and smiled at his whitejacketed men you havent lost a battle he shouted to them you havent even fought today so youve lost no pride but youll have to fight now if you dont if you break ranks youll die if you fight youll live jemadar march the cobras would now attempt one of the most difficult of all feats of soldiering a fighting withdrawal they marched in a loose square the centre of which gradually filled with their women and children some other infantry tried to join the families but dodd snarled at his men to beat them away fire if they wont go he shouted the last thing he wanted was for his men to be infected by panic dodd trailed the square he heard cavalry trumpets and he twisted in his saddle to see a mass of irregular light horsemen come over the crest halt he shouted close ranks charge bayonets the whitejacketed cobras sealed the loose square tight dodd pushed through the face of the square and turned his horse to watch the cavalrymen approach he doubted they would come close not when there were easier pickings to the east and sure enough as soon as the leading horsemen saw that the square was waiting with levelled muskets they sheered away dodd holstered his pistol march on jemadar twice more dodd had to halt and form ranks but both times the threatening horsemen were scared away by the calm discipline of his whitecoated soldiers the redcoated infantry was not pursuing they had reached the village of argaum and were content to stay there leaving the pursuit to the horsemen and those horsemen chased after the broken rabble that flooded northwards but none chose to die by charging dodds formed ranks dodd inclined to the west angling away from the pursuers by nightfall he was confident enough to form the battalion into a column of companies and by midnight under a clear moon he could no longer even hear the british trumpets he knew that men would still be dying ridden down by cavalry and pierced by lances or slashed by sabres but dodd had got clean away his men were tired but they were safe in a dark countryside of millet fields droughtemptied irrigation ditches and scattered villages where dogs barked frantically when they caught the scent of the marching column dodd did not trouble the villagers he had sufficient food and earlier in the night they had found an irrigation tank that had yielded enough water for men and beasts do you know where we are jemadar he asked no sahib gopal grinned his teeth showing white in the darkness nor do i but i know where were going where sahib to gawilghur gopal to gawilghur then we must march north sahib gopal pointed to the mountains that showed as a dark line against the northern stars it is there sahib dodd was marching to the fortress that had never known defeat to the impregnable fastness on the cliff to gawilghur dawn came to the millet fields raggedwinged birds flopped down beside corpses the smell of death was already rank and would only grow worse as the sun rose to become a furnace in a cloudless sky bugles called reveille and the picquets who had guarded the sleeping army around argaum cleared their muskets by loosing off shots the gunfire startled birds up from corpses and made the feasting dogs growl among the human dead regiments dug graves for their own dead there were few enough to bury for no more than fifty redcoats had died but there were hundreds of mahratta and arab corpses and the lascars who did the armys fetching and carrying began the task of gathering the bodies some enemies still lived though barely and the luckiest of those were despatched with a blow of a mattock before their robes were rifled the unlucky were taken to the surgeons tents the enemys captured guns were inspected and a dozen selected as suitable for british service they were all well made forged in agra by frenchtrained gunsmiths but some were the wrong calibre and a few were so overdecorated with writhing gods and goddesses that no selfrespecting gunner could abide them the twentysix rejected guns would be doubleshot ted and exploded a dangerous business lieutenant colonel william wallace remarked to sharpe indeed sir you saw the accident at assaye wallace asked the colonel took off his cocked hat and fanned his face the hats white plumes were still stained with blood that had dried black i heard it sir didnt see it sharpe said the accident had occurred after the battle of assaye when the enemys captured cannon were being destroyed and one monstrous piece a great siege gun had exploded prematurely killing two engineers leaves us short of good engineers wallace remarked and well need them if were going to gawilghur gawilghur sir a ghastly fortress sharpe quite ghastly the colonel turned and pointed north only about twenty miles away and if the mahrattas have any sense thats where theyll be heading wallace sighed ive never seen the place so maybe it isnt as bad as they say but i remember poor mccandless describing it as a brute a real brute like stirling castle he said only much larger and the cliffs twenty times higher sharpe had never seen stirling castle so had no real idea what the colonel meant he said nothing he had been idling the morning away when wallace sent for him and now he and the colonel were walking through the battles litter the arab boy followed a dozen paces behind yours is he wallace asked think so sir sort of picked him up yesterday you need a servant dont you urquhart tells me you dont have one so urquhart had been discussing sharpe with the colonel no good could come of that sharpe thought urquhart had been nagging sharpe to find a servant implying that sharpes clothes were in need of cleaning and pressing which they were but as he only owned the clothes he wore he could not really see the point in being too finicky i hadnt really thought what to do with the lad sir sharpe admitted wallace turned and spoke to the boy in an indian language and ahmed stared up at the colonel and nodded solemnly as though he understood what had been said perhaps he did though sharpe did not ive told him hes to serve you properly wallace said and that youll pay him properly the colonel seemed to disapprove of ahmed or maybe he just disapproved of everything to do with sharpe though he was doing his best to be friendly it had been wallace who had given sharpe the commission in the th and wallace had been a close friend of colonel mccandless so sharpe supposed that the balding colonel was in his way an ally even so sharpe felt awkward in the scotsmans company he wondered if he would ever feel relaxed among officers hows that woman of yours sharpe wallace asked cheerfully my woman sir sharpe asked blushing the frenchwoman cant recall her name took quite a shine to you didnt she simone sir shes in seringapatam sir seemed the best place for her sir quite quite simone joubert had been widowed at assaye where her husband who had served scindia had died she had been sharpes lover and after the battle she had stayed with him where else she asked was she to go but wellesley had forbidden his officers to take their wives on the campaign and though simone was not sharpes wife she was white and so she had agreed to go to seringapatam and there wait for him she had carried a letter of introduction to major stokes sharpes friend who ran the armoury and sharpe had given her some of the tippoos jewels so that she could find servants and live comfortably he sometimes worried he had given her too many of the precious stones but consoled himself that simone would keep the surplus safe till he returned so are you happy sharpe wallace asked bluffly yes sir sharpe said bleakly keeping busy not really sir difficult isnt it wallace said vaguely he had stopped to watch the gunners loading one of the captured cannon a great brute that looked to take a ball of twenty or more pounds the barrel had been cast with an intricate pattern of lotus flowers and dancing girls then painted with garish colours the gunners had charged the gaudy barrel with a double load of powder and now they rammed two cannonballs down the blackened gullet an engineer had brought some wedges and a gunner sergeant pushed one down the barrel then hammered it home with the rammer so that the ball would jam when the gun was fired the engineer took a ball of fuse from his pocket pushed one end into the touchhole then backed away uncoiling the pale line best if we give them some space wallace said gesturing that they should walk south a small way dont want to be beheaded by a scrap of gun eh no sir very difficult wallace said picking up his previous thought coming up from the ranks admirable sharpe admirable but difficult yes i suppose so sir sharpe said unhelpfully wallace sighed as though he was finding the conversation unexpectedly hard going urquhart tells me you seem the colonel paused looking for the tactful word unhappy takes time sir of course of course these things do quite the colonel wiped a hand over his bald pate then rammed his sweatstained hat back into place i remember when i joined years ago now of course and i was only a little chap didnt know what was going on they said turn left then turned right damned odd i thought i was arse over elbow for months i can tell you the colonels voice tailed away damned hot he said after a while damned hot ever heard of the th sharpe th sir another scottish regiment lord no the th rifles theyre a new regiment couple of years old used to be called the experimental corps of riflemen wallace hooted with laughter at the clumsy name but a friend of mine is busy with the rascals willie stewart hes called the honourable william stewart capital fellow but willies got some damned odd ideas his fellows wear green coats green and he tells me his riflemen aint as rigid as he seems to think we are wallace smiled to show he had made some kind of joke thing is sharpe i wondered if you wouldnt be better suited to stewarts outfit his idea you should understand he wrote wondering if i had any bright young officers who could carry some experience of india to shorncliffe i was going to write back and say we do precious little skirmishing here and its skirmishing that willies rogues are being trained to do but then i thought of you sharpe sharpe said nothing whichever way you wrapped it up he was being dismissed from the th though he supposed it was kind of wallace to make the th sound like an interesting sort of regiment sharpe guessed they were the usual shambles of a hastily raised wartime battalion staffed by the leavings of other regiments and composed of gutter rogues discarded by every other recruiting sergeant the very fact they wore green coats sounded bad as though the army could not be bothered to waste good red cloth on them they would probably dissolve in panicked chaos in their first battle ive written to willie about you wallace went on and i know hell have a place for you meaning sharpe thought that the honourable william stewart owed wallace a favour and our problem frankly wallace continued is that a new draft has reached madras werent expecting it till spring but theyre here now so well be back to strength in a month or so wallace paused evidently wondering if he had softened the blow sufficiently and the fact is sharpe he resumed after a while that scottish regiments are more like well families families thats it just it my mother always said so and she was a pretty shrewd judge of these things like families more so i think than english regiments dont you think yes sir sharpe said trying to hide his misery but i cant let you go while theres a war on wallace continued heartily the colonel had turned to watch the cannon again the engineer had finished unwinding his fuse and the gunners now shouted at everyone within earshot to stand away i do enjoy this the colonel said warmly nothing like a bit of gratuitous destruction to set the juices flowing eh the engineer stooped to the fuse with his tinderbox sharpe saw him strike the flint then blow the charred linen into flame there was a pause then he put the fuse end into the small fire and the smoke fizzed up the fuse burned fast the smoke and sparks snaking through the dry grass and starting small fires then the red hot trail streaked up the back of the gun and down into the touchhole for a heartbeat nothing happened then the whole gun just seemed to disintegrate the charge had tried to propel the double shot up the wedged barrel but the resistance was just big enough to restrict the explosion the touchhole shot out first the shaped piece of metal tearing out a chunk of the upper breach then the whole rear of the painted barrel split apart in smoke flame and whistling lumps of jagged metal the forward part of the barrel jaggedly torn off dropped to the grass as the guns wheels were splayed out the gunners cheered one less mahratta gun wallace said ahmed was grinning broadly did you know mackay wallace asked sharpe no sir captain mackay hugh mackay east india company officer fourth native cavalry very good fellow indeed sharpe i knew his father well point is though that young hugh was put in charge of the bullock train before assaye and he did a very good job very good but he insisted on joining his troopers in the battle disobeyed orders dyou see wellesley was adamant that mackay must stay with his bullocks but young hugh wanted to be on the dance floor and quite right too except that the poor devil was killed cut in half by a cannonball wallace sounded shocked as though such a thing was an outrage its left the bullock train without a guiding hand sharpe christ sharpe thought but he was to be made bullock master not fair to say they dont have a guiding hand wallace continued because they do but the new fellow dont have any experience with bullocks torrance hes called and im sure hes a good fellow but things are likely to get a bit more sprightly from now on going deeper into enemy territory see and there are still lots of their damned horsemen at large and torrance says he needs a deputy officer someone to help him thought you might be just the fellow for the job sharpe wallace smiled as though he was granting sharpe a huge favour dont know anything about bullocks sir sharpe said doggedly im sure you dont who does and there are dromedaries and elephants a regular menagerie eh but the experience sharpe will do you good think of it as another string to your bow sharpe knew a further protest would do no good so he nodded yes sir he said good good splendid wallace could not hide his relief it wont be for long sharpe scindias already suing for peace and the rajah of berars bound to follow we may not even have to fight at gawilghur if thats where the rogues do take refuge so go and help torrance then you can set a course for england eh become a greenjacket so ensign sharpe had failed failed utterly he had been an officer for two months and now he was being booted out of a regiment sent to the bullocks and the dromedaries whatever the hell they were and after that to the greencoated dregs of the army bloody hell fire he thought bloody hell fire the british and their allied cavalry rode all night and in the dawn they briefly rested watered their horses then hauled themselves into their saddles and rode again they rode till their horses were reeling with tiredness and white with sweat and only then did they give up the savage pursuit of the mahratta fugitives their sabre arms were weary their blades blunted and their appetites slaked the night had been a wild hunt of victory a slaughter under the moon that had left the plain reeking with blood and the sun brought more killing and widewinged vultures that flapped down to the feast the pursuit ended close to a sudden range of hills that marked the northern limit of the deccan plain the hills were steep and thickly wooded no place for cavalry and above the hills reared great cliffs dizzyingly high cliffs that stretched from the eastern to the western horizon like the nightmare ramparts of a tribe of giants in places there were deep reentrants cut into the great cliff and some of the british pursuers gaping at the vast wall of rock that barred their path supposed that the wooded clefts would provide a path up to the cliffs summit though none could see how anyone could reach the highland if an enemy chose to defend it between two of the deep reentrants a great promontory of rock jutted from the cliff face like the prow of a monstrous stone ship the summit of the jutting rock was two thousand feet above the horsemen on the plain and one of them scrubbing blood from his sabre blade with a handful of grass glanced up at the high peak and saw a tiny puff of whiteness drifting from its crest he thought it a small cloud but then he heard a faint bang of gunfire and a second later a round shot dropped vertically into a nearby patch of millet his captain pulled out a telescope and trained it high into the sky he stared for a long time then gave a low whistle what is it sir its a fortress the captain said he could just see black stone walls shrunken by distance poised above the greywhite rock its hell in the bloody sky he said grimly thats what it is its gawilghur more guns fired from the fortress but they were so high in the air that their shots lost all their forward momentum long before they reached the ground the balls fell like nightmare rain and the captain shouted at his men to lead their horses out of range their final refuge he said then laughed but its nothing to do with us boys the infantry will have to deal with that big bastard the cavalrymen slowly moved southwards some of their horses had lost shoes which meant they had to be walked home but their nights work was well done they had ravaged a broken army and now the infantry must cope with the mahrattas final refuge a sergeant shouted from the right flank and the captain turned westwards to see a column of enemy infantry appearing from a grove of trees just over a mile away the whitecoated battalion still possessed their artillery but they showed no sign of wanting a fight a crowd of civilians and several companies of fugitive mahrattas had joined the regiment which was heading for a road that twisted into the hills beneath the fort then zigzagged its way up the face of the rock promontory if that road was the only way into the fort the cavalry captain thought then god help the redcoats who had to attack gawilghur he stared at the infantry through his telescope the whitecoated troops were showing small interest in the british cavalry but it still seemed prudent to quicken his pace southwards a moment later and the cavalry was hidden behind millet fields the captain turned a last time and gazed again at the fortress on the soaring cliffs it seemed to touch the sky so high it stood above all india bastard of a place the captain said wonderingly then turned and left he had done his job and now the infantry must climb to the clouds to do theirs colonel william dodd watched the bluecoated cavalrymen walk their tired horses southwards until they vanished beyond a field of standing millet the sub adar in charge of the regiments small cannon had wanted to unlimber and open fire on the horsemen but dodd had refused his permission there would have been no point in attacking for by the time the guns were loaded the cavalrymen would have walked out of range he watched a last salvo of round shot plummet to earth from the forts high guns those cannon were of little use dodd thought except to overawe people on the plain it took dodds regiment over seven hours to climb to the fort of gawilghur and by the time he reached the summit dodds lungs were burning his muscles aching and his uniform soaked with sweat he had walked every step of the way refusing to ride his horse for the beast was tired and besides if he expected his men to walk up the long road then he would walk it as well he was a tall sallowfaced man with a harsh voice and an awkward manner but william dodd knew how to earn his mens admiration they saw that he walked when he could have ridden and so they did not complain as the steep climb sapped their breath and stole their strength the regiments families its baggage and its battery of cannon were still far below on the twisting treacherous track that in its last few miles was little more than a ledge hacked from the cliff dodd formed his cobras into four ranks as they approached gawilghurs southern entrance where the great metalstudded gates were being swung open in welcome march smartly now dodd called to his men youve nothing to be ashamed of you lost no battle he pulled himself up into his saddle and drew his goldhiked sword to salute the flag of berar that flapped above the high gatetower then he touched his heels to the mares flanks and led his undefeated men into the towers long entrance tunnel he emerged into the afternoon sun to find himself staring at a small town that was built within the strongholds ramparts and on the summit of gawilghurs promontory the alleys of the town were crammed with soldiers most of them mahratta cavalrymen who had fled in front of the british pursuit but twisting in his saddle dodd saw some infantry of gawilghurs garrison standing on the fire step he also saw manu bappoo who had out ridden the british pursuit and now gestured to dodd from the gatetowers turret dodd told one of his men to hold his horse then climbed the black walls to the top fire step of the tower where he stopped in awed astonishment at the view it was like standing at the edge of the world the plain was so far beneath and the southern horizon so far away that there was nothing in front of his eyes but endless sky this dodd thought was a gods view of earth the eagles view he leaned over the parapet and saw his guns struggling up the narrow road they would not reach the fort till long after nightfall you were right colonel manu bappoo said ruefully dodd straightened to look at the mahratta prince its dangerous to fight the british in open fields he said but here dodd gestured at the approach road here they will die sahib the forts main entrance bappoo said in his sibilant voice is on the other side to the north dodd turned and gazed across the roof of the central palace he could see little of the great fortresss northern de fences though a long way away he could see another tower like the one on which he now stood is the main entrance as difficult to approach as this one he asked i no but it isnt easy the enemy has to approach along a narrow strip of rock then fight through the outer fort after that comes a ravine and then the inner fort i want you to guard the inner gate dodd looked suspiciously at bappoo not the outer fort dodd reckoned his cobras should guard the place where the british would attack that way the british would be defeated the outer fort is a trap bappoo explained he looked tired but the defeat at argaum had not destroyed his spirit merely sharpened his appetite for revenge if the british capture the outer fort they will think they have won they wont know that an even worse barrier waits beyond the ravine that barrier has to be held i dont care if the outer fort falls but we must hold the inner that means our best troops must be there it will be held dodd said bappoo turned and stared southwards somewhere in the heathazed distance the british forces were readying to march on gawilghur i thought we could stop them at argaum he admitted softly dodd who had advised against fighting at argaum said nothing but here bappoo went on they will be stopped here dodd thought they would have to be stopped he had deserted from the east india companys army because he faced trial and execution but also because he believed he could make a fortune as a mercenary serving the mahrattas so far he had endured three defeats and each time he had led his men safe out of the disaster but from gawilghur there would be no escape the british would block every approach so the british must be stopped they must fail in this high place and so they would dodd consoled himself for nothing imaginable could take this fort he was on the worlds edge lifted into the sky and for the redcoats it would be like scaling the very heights of heaven so here at last deep inside india the redcoats would be beaten six cavalrymen in the blue and yellow coats of the igth light dragoons waited outside the house where captain torrance was said to be billeted they were under the command of a longlegged sergeant who was lounging on a bench beside the door the sergeant glanced up as sharpe approached i hope you dont want anything useful out of the bastards he said acidly then saw that the shabbyuniformed sharpe despite wearing a pack like any common soldier also had a sash and a sabre he scrambled to his feet sorry sir sharpe waved him back down onto the bench useful he asked horseshoes sir thats all we bleeding want horseshoes supposed to be four thousand in store but can they find them the sergeant spat tells me theyre lost im to go to the bhinjarries and buy them im supposed to tell my captain that so now we have to sit here till captain torrance gets back maybe he knows where they are that monkey in there he jerked his thumb at the houses front door doesn know a bloody thing sharpe pushed open the door to find himself in a large room where a halfdozen men argued with a harried clerk the clerk an indian sat behind a table covered with curling ledgers captain torrance is ill the clerk snapped at sharpe without waiting to discover the newcomers business and take that dirty arab boy outside the clerk added jerking his chin at ahmed who armed with a musket he had taken from a corpse on the battlefield had followed sharpe into the house muskets a man tried to attract the clerks attention horseshoes an east india company lieutenant shouted buckets a gunner said come back tomorrow the clerk said tomorrow you said that yesterday the gunner said and im back wheres captain torrance sharpe asked hes ill the clerk said disapprovingly as though sharpe had risked the captains fragile health even by asking the question he cannot be disturbed and why is that boy here he is an arab because i told him to be here sharpe said he walked round the table and stared down at the ledgers what a bleeding mess sahib the clerk had now realized sharpe was an officer other side of the table sahib please sahib there is a system here sahib i stay this side of the table and you remain on the other please sahib whats your name sharpe asked the clerk seemed affronted at the question i am captain torranees assistant he said grandly and torrance is ill the captain is very sick so whos in charge i am the clerk said not any longer sharpe said he looked up at the east india company lieutenant what did you want horseshoes so where are the bleeding horseshoes sharpe asked the clerk i have explained sahib i have explained the clerk said he was a middleaged man with a lugubrious face and pudgy inkstained fingers that now hastily tried to close all the ledgers so that sharpe could not read them now please sahib join the queue where are the horseshoes sharpe insisted leaning closer to the sweating clerk this office is closed the clerk shouted closed till tomorrow all business will be conducted tomorrow captain torrances orders ahmed sharpe said shoot the bugger ahmed spoke no english but the clerk did not know that he held his hands out i am closing the office work cannot be done like this i shall complain to captain torrance there will be trouble big trouble the clerk glanced at a door that led to the inner part of the house is that where torrance is sharpe asked gesturing at the door no sahib and you cannot go in there the captain is sick sharpe went to the door and pushed it open the clerk yelped a protest but sharpe ignored him a muslin screen hung on the other side of the door and entangled sharpe as he pushed into the room where a sailors hammock hung from the beams the room seemed empty but then a whimper made him look into a shadowed corner a young woman crouched there she was dressed in a said but she looked european to sharpe she had been sewing gold braid onto the outer seams of a pair of breeches but now stared in wideeyed fright at the intruder who are you maam sharpe asked the woman shook her head she had very black hair and very white skin her terror was palpable is captain torrance here sharpe asked no she whispered hes sick is that right if he says so sir she said softly her london accent confirmed that she was english i aint going to hurt you love sharpe said for fear was making her tremble are you mrs torrance no so you work for him yes sir and you dont know where he is no sir she said softly looking up at sharpe with huge eyes she was lying he reckoned but he guessed she had good reason to lie perhaps fearing torrances punishment if she told the truth he considered soothing the truth out of her but reckoned it might take too long he wondered who she was she was pretty despite her terror and he guessed she was torrances bibbi lucky torrance he thought ruefully im sorry to have disturbed you maam he said then he negotiated the muslin curtain back into the front room the clerk shook his head fiercely you should not have gone in there sahib that is private quarters private i shall be forced to tell captain torrance sharpe took hold of the clerks chair and tipped it forcing the man off the men waiting in the room gave a cheer sharpe ignored them sat on the chair himself and pulled the tangle of ledgers towards him i dont care what you tell captain torrance he said so long as you tell me about the horseshoes first they are lost the clerk protested how were they lost sharpe asked the clerk shrugged things get lost he said sweat was pouring down his plump face as he tentatively tried to tug some of the ledgers away from sharpe but he recoiled from the look on the ensigns face things get lost the clerk said again weakly it is the nature of things to get lost muskets sharpe asked lost the clerk admitted buckets lost the clerk said paperwork sharpe said the clerk frowned paperwork sahib if somethings lost sharpe said patiently theres a record this is the bloody army you cant have a piss without someone making a note of it to show me the records of whats been lost the clerk sighed and pulled one of the big ledgers open here sahib he said pointing an inky finger one barrel of horseshoes see being carried on an ox from jamkandhi lost in the godavery on november th how many horseshoes in a barrel sharpe asked a hundred and twenty the longlegged cavalry sergeant had come into the office and now leaned against the doorpost and there are supposed to be four thousand horseshoes in store sharpe asked here the clerk turned a page another barrel see sharpe peered at the illwritten entry lost in the godavery he read aloud and here the clerk stabbed his finger again stolen sharpe read a drop of sweat landed on the page as the clerk turned it back so who stole it the enemy sahib the clerk said their horsemen are everywhere their bloody horsemen run if you so much as look at them the tall cavalry sergeant said sourly they couldnt steal an egg from a chicken the convoys are ambushed sahib the clerk insisted and things are stolen sharpe pushed the clerks hand away and turned the pages back looking for the date when the battle had been fought at assaye he found it and discovered a different handwriting had been used for the previous entries he guessed captain mackay must have kept the ledger himself and in mackays neat entries there were far fewer annotations reading stolen or lost mackay had marked eight cannonballs as being lost in a river crossing and two barrels of powder had been marked down as stolen but in the weeks since assaye no fewer than sixtyeight oxen had lost their burdens to either accidents or thieves more tellingly each of those oxen had been carrying a scarce commodity the army would not miss a load of round shot but it would suffer grievously when its last reserve of horseshoes was gone whose handwriting is this sharpe had turned to the most recent page mine sahib the clerk was looking frightened how do you know when something is stolen the clerk shrugged the captain tells me or the sergeant tells me the sergeant he isnt here the clerk said hes bringing a convoy of oxen north whats the sergeants name sharpe asked for he could find no record in the ledger hakeswill the cavalry sergeant said laconically hes the bugger we usually deal with on account of captain torrance always being ill bloody hell sharpe said and pushed the chair back hakeswill obadiah bloody hakeswill why wasnt he sent back to his regiment sharpe asked he isnt supposed to be here at all he knows the system the clerk explained captain torrance wanted him to stay sahib and no bloody wonder sharpe thought hakeswill had worked himself into the armys most profitable billet he was milking the cow but making sure it was the clerks handwriting in the ledger no flies on obadiah how does the system work he asked the clerk chitties the clerk said chitties an ox driver is given a chitty sahib and when he has delivered his load the chitty is signed and brought here then he is paid no chitty no money it is the rule sahib no chitty no money and no bloody horseshoes either put in the lean sergeant of the and sergeant hakeswill pays the money sharpe asked if he is here sahib the clerk said that doesnt get me my damned horseshoes the company lieutenant protested or my buckets the gunner put in the bhinjarries have all the essentials the clerk insisted he made shooing gestures go and see the bhinjarriesl they have necessaries this office is closed till tomorrow but where did the bhinjarries get their necessaries eh answer me that sharpe demanded but the clerk merely shrugged the bhinjarries were merchants who travelled with the army contributing their own vast herds of pack oxen and carts they sold food liquor women and luxuries ard now it seemed they were offering military supplies as well which meant that the army would be paying for things that were normally issued free and doubtless if bloody hakeswill had a finger in the pot things which had been stolen from the army in the first place where do i go for horseshoes sharpe asked the clerk the clerk was reluctant to answer but he finally spread his hands and suggested sharpe ask in the merchants encampment someone will tell you sahib you tell me sharpe said i dont know so how do you know they have horseshoes i hear these things the clerk protested sharpe stood and bullied the clerk back against the wall you do more than hear things he said leaning his forearm against the clerks neck you know things so you bloody well tell me or ill have my arab boy chop off your goo lies for his breakfast hes a hungry little bugger the clerk fought for breath against the pressure of sharpes arm naig he offered the name plaintively when sharpe relaxed his arm naig sharpe asked the name rang a distant bell a longago bell naig then he remembered a merchant of that name who had followed the army to seringapatam naig sharpe asked again a fellow with green tents the very one sahib the clerk nodded but i did not tell you this thing these gentlemen are witnesses i did not tell you he runs a brothel sharpe said remembering and he remembered too how naig had been a friend to sergeant obadiah hakeswill four years before sharpe had been a private then and hakeswill had trumped up charges that had fetched sharpe a flogging nasty naig had been the mans nickname and back then he had sold paleskinned whores who travelled in greencurtained wagons right sharpe said this office is closed the gunner protested and the cavalry sergeant looked disappointed were going to see naig sharpe announced no the clerk said too loud no sharpe asked he will be angry sahib why should he be angry sharpe demanded im a customer aint i hes got horseshoes and we want horseshoes he should be delighted to see us he must be treated with respect sahib the clerk said nervously he is a powerful man naig you have money for him i just want to look at his horseshoes sharpe said and if theyre army issue then ill ram one of them down his bloody throat the clerk shook his head he has guards sahib he has jettisl i think i might let you go on your own the east india company lieutenant said backing away jettis the light dragoon sergeant asked strongmen sharpe explained big buggers who kill you by wringing your neck like a chicken he turned back to the clerk where did naig get hisjettis from seringapatam yes sahib i killed enough of the buggers sharpe said so i dont mind killing a few more are you coming he asked the cavalry sergeant why not the man grinned anyone else sharpe asked but no one else seemed to want a fight that afternoon please sahib the clerk said weakly sharpe ignored him and followed by ahmed and the cavalryman went back into the sunlight whats your name sharpe asked the sergeant lockhart sir eli lockhart im dick sharpe eli and you dont have to call me sir im not a proper bleeding officer i was made up at assaye and i wish the buggers had left me a sergeant now they sent me to be a bloody bullock driver because im not fit for anything else he looked at lockharts six troopers who were still waiting what are they doing here didnt expect me to carry the bloody horseshoes myself did you lockhart said then gestured at the troopers come on boys were going to have a scrap who said anything about a scrap sharpe asked hes got horseshoes lockhart explained but we dont have money so theres only one way to get them off him true sharpe said and grinned lockhart suddenly looked oddly shy was you in the captains quarters sir yes why the toughlooking sergeant was actually blushing now you didnt see a woman there did you sir darkhaired girl pretty thats her who is she torrances servant a widow he brought her and her husband out from england but the fellow died and left her on her own torrance wont let her go and youd like to take her off his hands is that it ive only ever seen her at a distance the sergeant admitted torranee was in another regiment one of the madrassis but we camped together often enough shes still there sharpe said drily still alive he keeps her close he does lockhart said then kicked a dog out of his path the eight men had left the village and entered the sprawling encampment where the merchants with their herds wagons and families were camped great white oxen with painted horns were hobbled by pegs and children scurried among the beasts collecting their dung which they slapped into cakes that would be dried for fuel so tell me about these jet tis lockhart asked like circus strongmen sharpe said only its some kind of religious thing dont ask me none of it makes bleeding sense to me got muscles like mountains they have but theyre slow i killed four of the buggers at seringapatam and you know hakeswill i know bloody hakeswill recruited me he did and hes been persecuting me ever since he shouldnt even be with this army hes supposed to be with the havercakes down south but he came up here with a warrant to arrest me that didnt work so hes just stayed hasnt he and hes working the bleeding system you can wager your last shilling that hes the bastard who supplies naig and splits the profit sharpe stopped to look for green tents how come you dont carry your own spare horseshoes we do but when theyve gone you have to get more from the supplies thats how the systems supposed to work and yesterdays pursuit left half the hooves wrecked we need shoes sharpe had seen a cluster of faded green tents thats where the bastard is he said then looked at lockhart this could get nasty lockhart grinned he was as tall as sharpe and had a face that looked as though it had survived a lifetime of tavern brawls come this far aint i is that thing loaded sharpe nodded at the pistol at lockharts belt a sabre also hung there just like the one at sharpes hip it will be lockhart drew the pistol and sharpe turned to ahmed and mimed the actions of loading the musket ahmed grinned and pointed to the lock indicating that his weapon was already charged how many of the buggers will be waiting for us lockhart asked a dozen sharpe guessed lockhart glanced back at his six men we can deal with a dozen buggers right sharpe said so lets bloody well make some trouble he grinned because for the first time since he had become an officer he was enjoying himself which meant someone was about to get a thumping chapter major general sir arthur wellesley rode northwards among a cavalcade of officers whose horses kicked up a wide trail of dust that lingered in the air long after the horsemen had passed two troops of east india company cavalry provided the generals escort manu bappoos army might have been trounced and its survivors sent skeltering back into gawilghur but the deccan plain was still infested with mahratta cavalry ready to pounce on supply convoys woodcutting parties or the grasscutters who supplied the armys animals with fodder and so the two troops rode with sabres drawn wellesley set a fast pace revelling in the freedom to ride in the long open country did you visit colonel stevenson this morning he called back to an aide i did sir and hes no better than he was but he can get about on his elephant sir wellesley grunted stevenson was the commander of his smaller army but the old colonel was ailing so was harness the commander of one of wellesleys two brigades but there was no point in asking about harness it was not just physical disease that assaulted harness for the scotsmans wits were gone as well the doctors claimed it was the heat that had desiccated his brains but wellesley doubted the diagnosis heat and rum maybe but not the heat alone though he did not doubt that indias climate was bad for a europeans health few men lived long without falling prey to some wasting fever and wellesley was thinking it was time he left himself time to go back home before his health was abraded and more important before his existence was forgotten in london french armies were unsettling all europe and it could not be long before london despatched an army to fight the old foe and wellesley wanted to be a part of it he was in his middle thirties and he had a reputation to make but first he had to finish off the mahrattas and that meant taking gawilghur and to that end he was now riding towards the great rampart of cliffs that sealed off the plains northern edge an hours ride brought him to the summit of a small rise which offered a view northwards the plain looked dun starved of water by the failed monsoon though here and there patches of millet grew tall in a good year wellesley guessed the millet would cover the plain from horizon to horizon a sea of grain bounded by the gawilghur cliffs he dismounted on the small knoll and took out a telescope that he settled on his horses saddle it was a brand new glass a gift from the merchants of madras to mark wellesleys pacification of mysore trade now moved freely on indias eastern flank and the telescope which had been specially ordered from matthew berge of london was a generous token of the merchants esteem but wellesley could not get used to it the shape of the eyepiece was less concave than the one he was used to and after a moment he snapped the new telescope shut and pulled out his old glass which though lower powered was more comfortable he stared for a long time gazing at the fort which crowned the rock promontory the black stone of the fortress walls looked particularly sinister even in the sunlight good god the general muttered after a while fail up there he thought and there would be no point in going home he could go to london with some victories under his belt and men would respect him even if the victories had not been against the french but go with a defeat and they would despise him gawilghur he thought sourly had the look of a careerbreaker colonel wallace wellesleys healthy brigade commander had also dismounted and was inspecting the fortress through his own glass devil of a place sir arthur wallace said how high is it blackiston wellesley called to one of his aides an engineer i took a triangulation yesterday sir blackiston said and discovered the fortress walls are eighteen hundred feet above the plain is there water up there colonel butters the chief engineer asked we hear there is sir blackiston said there are tanks in the fort huge things like lakes but the water level must be low this year butters suggested i doubt its low enough sir blackiston murmured knowing that butters had been hoping that thirst might defeat the garrison and the rascals will have food no doubt wellesley commented doubtless wallace agreed drily which means theyll have to be prised out the general said then bent to the glass again and lowered the lens to look at the foothills below the bluff just south of the fort was a conical hill that rose almost halfway up the flank of the great promontory can we get guns on that near hill he asked there was a pause while the other officers decided which hill he was referring to colonel butters flinched we can get them up there sir but i doubt theyll have the elevation to reach the fort youll get nothing bigger than a twelvepounder up there wallace said dubiously then slid the telescopes view up the bluff to the walls and youll need bigger shot than twelvepounders to break down that wall sir arthur the warning call came from the officer commanding the east india company cavalry who was pointing to where a group of mahratta horsemen had appeared in the south they had evidently been following the lingering dust cloud left by the generals party and though the approaching horsemen only numbered about twenty men the sepoy cavalry wheeled to face them and spread into a line its all right wellesley called theyre ours i asked them to meet us here he had inspected the approaching horsemen through his telescope and now waving the sepoy cavalry back he walked to greet the silladars syud sevajee wellesley acknowledged the man in the shabby green and silver coat who led the cavalrymen thank you for coming syud sevajee nodded brusquely at wellesley then stared up at gawilghur you think you can get in i think we must wellesley said no one ever has sevajee said with a sly smile wellesley returned the smile but slowly as if accepting the implied challenge and then as sevajee slid down from his saddle the general turned to wallace youve met syud sevajee wallace ive not had that pleasure sir wellesley made the introduction then added that syud sevajees father had been one of the rajah of berars generals but is no longer wallace asked sevajee beny singh murdered him sevajee said grimly so i fight with you colonel to gain my chance to kill beny singh and beny singh now commands that fortress he nodded towards the distant promontory so how do we get inside wellesley asked the officers gathered around sevajee as the indian drew his tulwar and used its tip to draw a figure eight in the dust he tapped the lower circle of the eight which he had drawn far larger than the upper thats what youre looking at he said the inner fort and there are only two entrances theres a road that climbs up from the plain and goes to the southern gate he drew a squiggly line that tailed away from the bottom of the figure eight but that road is impossible you will climb straight into their guns a child with a pile of rocks could keep an army from climbing that road the only possible route into the inner fort is through the main entrance he scratched a brief line across the junction of the two circles which will not be easy wellesley asked drily sevajee offered the general a grim smile the main entrance is a long corridor barred by four gates and flanked by high walls but even to reach it sir arthur you will have to take the outer fort he tapped the small upper circle of the figure eight wellesley nodded and that too is difficult again two entrances sevajee said one is a road that climbs from the plain you cant see it from here but it twists up the hills to the west and it comes to the fort here he tapped the waist of the figure eight its an easier climb than the southern road but for the last mile of the journey your men will be under the guns of the outer fort and the final halfmile general is steep he stressed the last word on one side of the road is a cliff and on the other is a precipice and the guns of the outer fort can fire straight down that halfmile of road colonel butters shook his head in gloomy contemplation of sevajees news how come you know all this he asked i grew up in gawilghur sevajee said my father before he was murdered was kill adar of the fortress he knows wellesley said curtly and the main entrance of the outer fort that sevajee said is the fortresss weakest point he scratched a line that pierced the uppermost curve of the small circle its the only level approach to the fortress but its very narrow on one side he tapped the eastern flank of the line the ground falls steeply away on the other side is a reservoir tank so to reach the fort you must risk a narrow neck of land that is swept by two ramparts of guns one above the other two walls wallace asked set on a steep hill sevajee said nodding you must fight uphill across both walls there is an entrance but its like the inner forts entrance a series of gates with a narrow passage leading from one to the other and men above you on both sides hurling down rocks and round shot and once weve captured the outer fort wellesley asked what then sevajee offered a wolfish smile then your troubles are just beginning sir arthur he scuffed out the diagram he had made in the dust and scratched another this one showing two circles one large and one small with a space between them the two forts are not connected they are separated here he tapped the space between the circles with his tulwar and that is a ravine a deep ravine so once you have the outer fort you still have to assault the inner fort and its de fences will be untouched it has a wall which stands at the top of the ravines cliff and that is where your enemy will be taking refuge inside the wall of the inner fort my father reckoned no enemy could ever capture gawilghurs inner fort if all india should fall he said then its heart would still beat at gawilghur wellesley walked a few paces north to stare at the high promontory how big is the garrison normally sevajee said about a thousand men but now it could be six or seven times that many there is room inside for a whole army and if the fort did not fall wellesley thought then the mahrattas would take heart they would gather a new army and in the new year raid southwards again there would be no peace in western india till gawilghur fell major blackiston sir youll make an exploration of the plateau the general turned to sevajee will you escort major blackiston up into the hills i want sketches blackiston of the neck of land leading to the main entrance i want you to tell me where we can place breaching batteries i need to know how we can get guns up to the tops of the hills and i need to know it all within two days two days blackiston sounded appalled we dont want the rascals to take root up there do we speed blackiston speed can you leave now this question was directed at sevajee i can sevajee answered wellesley waved blackiston on his way two days major i want you back tomorrow evening colonel butters frowned at the far hills youre taking the army to the top half the army wellesley said the other half will stay on the plain he would need to hold gawilghur between his redcoats like a nut and hope that when he squeezed it was the nut and not the nutcracker that broke he pulled himself back into the saddle then waited as the other officers mounted then he turned his mare and started back towards the camp itll be up to the engineers to get us onto the heights he said then a weeks hard carrying to lift the ammunition to the batteries the thought of that job made the general frown whats the problem with the bullock train he demanded of butters im hearing complaints over two thousand muskets stolen from convoys and huddlestone tells me there are no spare horseshoes that cant be right torrance says that bandits have been active sir butters said and i gather there have bepn accidents he added lamely whos torrance wellesley asked company man sir a captain he took over poor mackays duties i could surmise all that for myself the general said acidly who is he butters blushed at the reproof his fathers a canon at wells i think or maybe salisbury but more to the point sir he has an uncle in leadenhall street wellesley grunted an uncle in leadenhall street meant that torrance had a patron who was senior in the east india company someone to wield the influence that a clergyman father might not have is he as good as mackay butters a heavyset man who rode his horse badly shrugged he was recommended by huddlestone which means huddlestone wanted to be rid of him wellesley snapped im sure hes doing his best butters said defensively though he did ask me for an assistant but i had to turn him down ive no one to spare im short of engineers already sir as you well know ive sent for more wellesley said wallace intervened i gave torrance one of my ensigns sir arthur you can spare an ensign wallace sharpe sir ah wellesley grimaced never does work out does it you lift a man from the ranks and you do him no favours he might be happier in an english regiment wallace said so im recommending he exchanges into the rifles you mean theyre not particular wellesley asked then scowled how the devil are we to fight a war without horseshoes he kicked back at the mare angry at the predicament my god butters but your captain torrance must do his job wellesley better than anyone knew that he would never take gawilghur if the supply train failed and gawilghur had never been taken dear god wellesley thought but how was it ever to be done big buggers sergeant eli lockhart murmured as they neared the two green tents the cavalryman was speaking of the guards who lolled in chairs outside naigs tents there were four in view and two of them had bare oiled chests that bulged with unnatural muscle their hair was never cut but was instead coiled around their heads they were keeping guard outside the larger of the tents the one sharpe guessed was naigs brothel the other tent might have been the merchants living quarters but its entrance was tightly laced so sharpe could not glimpse inside the two greasy fellows are thejettis sharpe said big as bloody beeves they are lockhart said do they really wring your neck back to front sharpe said or else they drive a nail into your skull with their bare hand he swerved aside to go past the tents it was not that he feared to pick a fight with naigs guards indeed he expected a scrap but there was no point in going baldheaded into battle a bit of cleverness would not go amiss im being canny he explained to lockhart then turned to make sure that ahmed was keeping up the boy was holding sharpes pack as well as his musket the four guards all of them armed with fire locks and tulwars watched the british soldiers walk out of sight they didnt like the look of us lockhart said mangy buggers they are sharpe said he was glancing about the encampment and saw what he wanted just a few paces away it was some straw and near it was a smouldering campfire and he screwed a handful of the straw stalks into a spill that he lit and carried to the rear of the smaller tent he pushed the flaming spill into a fold of the canvas a child watched wideeyed if you say anything sharpe told the halfnaked child ill screw your head off back to front the child who did not understand a word grinned broadly youre not really supposed to be doing this are you lockhart asked no sharpe said lockhart grinned but said nothing instead he just watched as the flames licked at the faded green canvas which for a moment or two resisted the fire the material blackened but did not burn then suddenly it burst into fire that licked greedily up the tents high side thatll wake em up sharpe said what now lockhart asked watching the flame sear up the tents side we rescue whats inside of course sharpe drew his sabre come on lads he ran back to the front of the tent fire he shouted fire fetch water fire the four guards stared uncomprehendingly at the englishman then leaped to their feet as sharpe slashed at the laces of the small tents doorway one of them called a protest to sharpe fire lockhart bellowed at the guards who still unsure of what was happening did not try to stop sharpe then one of them saw the smoke billowing over the ridge of the tent he yelled a warning into the larger tent as his companions suddenly moved to pull the englishman away from the tents entrance hold them off sharpe called and lockharts six troopers closed on the three men sharpe slashed at the lacing hacking down through the tough rope as the troopers thumped into the guards someone swore there was a grunt as a fist landed then a yelp as a troopers boot slammed into ajettfs groin sharpe sawed through the last knot then pushed through the loosened tent flaps jesus he stopped staring at the boxes and barrels and crates that were stacked in the tents smoky gloom lockhart had followed him inside doesnt even bother to hide the stuff properly does he the sergeant said in amazement then crossed to a barrel and pointed to a that had been cut into one of the staves thats our mark the buggers got half our supplies he looked up at the flames that were now eating away the tent roof well lose the bloody lot if we dont watch it cut the tent ropes sharpe suggested and push it all down the two men ran outside and slashed at the guy ropes with their sabres but more of naigs men were coming from the larger tent now watch your back eli sharpe called then turned and sliced the curved blade towards ajettis face the man stepped back and sharpe followed up hard slashing again driving the huge man farther back now bugger off he shouted at the vast brute theres a bloody fire fire lockhart had put his attacker on the ground and was now stamping on his face with a spurred boot the troopers were coming to help and sharpe let them deal with naigs men while he cut through the last of the guy ropes then ran back into the tent and heaved on the nearest pole the air inside the tent was choking with swirling smoke but at last the whole heavy array of canvas sagged towards the fire lifting the canvas wall behind sharpe into the air sahib ahmeds shrill voice shouted and sharpe turned to see a man aiming a musket at him the lifting tent flap was exposing sharpe but he was too far away to rush the man then ahmed fired his own musket and the man shuddered turned to look at the boy then winced as the pain in his shoulder struck home he dropped the gun and clapped a hand onto the wound the sound of the shot startled the other guards and some reached for their own muskets but sharpe ran at them and used his sabre to beat the guns down theres a bloody fire he shouted into their faces a fire you want everything to burn they did not understand him but some realized that the fire threatened their masters supplies and so ran to haul the halfcollapsed burning canvas away from the wooden crates but who started the fire a voice said behind sharpe and he turned to see a tall fat indian dressed in a green robe that was embroidered with looping fish and longlegged waterbirds the fat man was holding a halfnaked child by the hand the same small boy who had watched sharpe push the burning straw into a crease of the canvas british officers the fat man said have a deal of freedom in this country but does that mean they can destroy an honest mans property are you naig sharpe asked the fat man waved to his guards so that they gathered behind him the tent had been dragged clear of the crates and was burning itself out harmlessly the greenrobed man now had sixteen or seventeen men with him four of themjettis and all of them armed while sharpe had lockhart and his battered troopers and one defiant child who was reloading a musket as tall as himself i will give you my name the fat man said unpleasantly when you tell me yours sharpe ensign sharpe a mere ensign the fat man raised his eyebrows i thought ensigns were children like this young man he patted the halfnaked boys head i am naig so perhaps you can tell me sharpe said why that tent was stuffed full of our supplies your supplies naig laughed they are my goods ensign sharpe perhaps some of them are stored in old boxes that once belonged to your army but what of that i buy the boxes from the quartermasters department lying bastard sergeant lockhart growled he had prised open the barrel with the number incised on its side and now flourished a horseshoe ours he said naig seemed about to order his guards to finish off sharpes small band but then he glanced to his right and saw that two british officers had come from the larger tent the presence of the two both captains meant that naig could not just drive sharpe away for now there were witnesses naig might take on an ensign and a few troopers but captains carried too much authority one of the captains who wore the red coat of the scotch brigade crossed to sharpe trouble he asked his revels had plainly been interrupted for his trousers were still unbuttoned and his sword and sash were slung across one shoulder this bastard sir has been pilfering our supplies sharpe jerked his thumb at naig then nodded towards the crates its all marked as stolen in the supply ledgers but ill wager its all there buckets muskets horseshoes the captain glanced at naig then crossed to the crates open that one he ordered and lockhart obediently stooped to the box and levered up its nailed lid with his sabre i have been storing these boxes naig explained he turned to the second captain an extraordinarily elegant cavalryman in company uniform and he pleaded with him in an indian language the company captain turned away and naig went back to the scotsman the merchant was in trouble now and he knew it i was asked to store the boxes he shouted at the scotsman but the infantry captain was staring down into the opened crate where ten brand new muskets lay in their wooden cradles he stooped for one of the muskets and peered at the lock just forward of the hammer and behind the pan was an engraved crown with the letters gr beneath it while behind the hammer the word tower was engraved ours the scotsman said flatly i bought them naig was sweating now i thought you said you were storing them the scotsman said now you say you bought them which is it my brother and i bought the guns from silladars naig said we dont sell these tower muskets the captain said hefting the gun that was still coated with grease naig shrugged they must have been captured from the supply convoys please sahib take them i want no trouble how was i to know they were stolen he turned and pleaded again with the company cavalry captain who was a tall lean man with a long face but the cavalryman turned and walked a short distance away a crowd had collected now and watched the drama silently and sharpe looking along their faces suspected there was not much sympathy for naig nor sharpe thought was there much hope for the fat man naig had been playing a dangerous game but with such utter confidence that he had not even bothered to conceal the stolen supplies at the very least he could have thrown away the government issue boxes and tried to file the lock markings off the muskets but naig must have believed he had powerful friends who would protect him the cavalryman seemed to be one of those friends for naig had followed him and was hissing in his ear but the cavalryman merely pushed the indian away then turned to sharpe hang him he said curtly hang him sharpe asked in puzzlement its the penalty for theft aint it the cavalryman insisted sharpe looked to the scottish captain who nodded uncertainly thats what the general said the scotsman confirmed id like to know how he got the supplies sir sharpe said youll give the fat bastard time to concoct a story the cavalryman demanded he had an arrogance that annoyed sharpe but everything about the cavalryman irritated sharpe the man was a dandy he wore tall spurred boots that sheathed his calves and knees in soft polished leather his white breeches were skin tight his waistcoat had gold buttons while his red tail coat was clean uncreased and edged with gold braid he wore a frilled stock a red silk sash was draped across his right shoulder and secured at his left hip by a knot of golden braid his sabre was scabbarded in red leather while his cocked hat was plumed with a lavishly curled feather that had been dyed pale green the clothes had cost a fortune and clearly his servants must spend hours on keeping their master so beautifully dressed he looked askance at sharpe a slight wrinkle of his nostrils suggesting that he found sharpes appearance distressing the cavalrymans face suggested he was a clever man but also that he despised those who were less clever than himself i dont suppose sir arthur will be vastly pleased when he hears that you let the fellow live ensign he said acidly swift and certain justice aint that the penalty for theft hang the fat beast that is what the standing orders say the scotch brigade captain agreed but does it apply to civilians he should have a trial sharpe protested not because he was so committed to naigs right to a hearing but because he feared the whole episode was getting out of hand he had thought to find the supplies maybe have a mill with naigs guards but no one was supposed to die naig deserved a good kicking but death standing orders apply to anyone within the picquet lines the cavalry captain averred confidently so for gods sake get on with it dangle the bastard he was sweating and sharpe sensed that the elegant cavalryman was not quite so confident as he appeared bugger a trial sergeant lockhart said happily ill hang the bastard he snapped at his troopers to fetch a nearby ox cart naig had tried to retreat to the protection of his guards but the cavalry captain had drawn a pistol that he now held close to naigs head as the grinning troopers trundled the empty ox cart into the open space in front of the pilfered supplies sharpe crossed to the tall cavalryman shouldnt we talk to him sir my dear fellow have you ever tried to get the truth out of an indian the captain asked they swear by a thousand gaudy gods that theyll tell the truth then lie like a rug be quiet naig had begun to protest and the cavalryman rammed the pistol into the indians mouth breaking a tooth and gashing naigs gum another damned word naig and ill castrate you before i hang you the cavalryman glanced at sharpe who was frowning are you squeamish ensign dont seem right sir i mean i agree he deserves to be hung but shouldnt we talk to him first if you like conversation so much the cavalryman drawled institute a philosophical society then you can enjoy all the hot air you like sergeant this last was to lockhart take the bastard off my hands will you pleasure sir lockhart seized naig and shoved him towards the cart one of the cavalry troopers had cut a length of guy rope from the burnt remnants of the tent and he now tied one end to the tip of the single shaft that protruded from the front of the ox cart he made a loop in the ropes end naig screamed and tried to pull away some of his guards started forward but then a hard voice ordered them back and sharpe turned to see that a tall thin indian in a black and green striped robe had come from the larger tent the newcomer who looked to be in his forties walked with a limp he crossed to the cavalry captain and spoke quietly and sharpe saw the cavalryman shake his head vehemently then shrug as if to suggest that he was powerless then the captain gestured to sharpe and the tall indian gave the ensign a look of such malevolence that sharpe instinctively put his hand on his sabres hilt lockhart had pulled the noose over naigs head are you sure sir he asked the cavalry captain of course im sure sergeant the cavalryman said angrily just get on with it sir sharpe appealed to the scots captain who frowned uncertainly then turned and walked away as though he wanted nothing more to do with the affair the tall indian in the striped robe spat into the dust then limped back to the tent lockhart ordered his troopers to the back of the cart naig was attempting to pull the noose free of his neck but lockhart slapped his hands down now boys he shouted the troopers reached up and hauled down on the backboard so that the cart tipped like a seesaw on its single axle and as the troopers pulled down so the shaft rose into the air the rope stretched and tightened naig screamed then the cavalryman jumped up to sit on the carts back and the shaft jerked higher still and the scream was abruptly choked off naig was dangling now his feet kicking wildly under the lavishly embroidered robe none of the crowd moved none protested naigs face was bulging and his hands were scrabbling uselessly at the noose which was tight about his neck the cavalry officer watched with a small smile a pity he said in his elegant voice the wretched man ran the best brothel i ever found were not killing his girls sir sharpe said thats true ensign but will their next owner treat them as well the cavalryman turned to the big tents entrance and took off his plumed hat to salute a group of saidclad girls who now watched wideeyed as their employer did the gallows dance i saw nancy merrick hang in madras the cavalryman said and she did the jig for thirty seven minutes thirtyseven id wagered on sixteen so lost rather a lot of tin dont think i can watch naig dance for half an hour its too damned hot sergeant help his soul to perdition will you lockhart crouched beneath the dying man and caught hold of his heels then he tugged down hard swearing when naig pissed on him he tugged again and at last the body went still do you see what happens when you steal from us the cavalry captain shouted at the crowd then repeated the words in an indian language if you steal from us you will die again he translated his words then gave sharpe a crooked grin but only of course if youre stupid enough to be caught and i didnt think naig was stupid at all rather the reverse just how did you happen to discover the supplies ensign tent was on fire sir sharpe said woodenly me and sergeant lockhart decided to rescue whatever was inside how very publicspirited of you the captain gave sharpe a long speculative look then turned back to lockhart is he dead sergeant near as makes no difference sir lockhart called back use your pistol to make sure the captain ordered then sighed a shame he said i rather liked naig he was a rogue of course but rogues are so much more amusing than honest men he watched as lockhart lowered the shaft then stooped over the prostrate body and put a bullet into its skull i suppose ill have to find some carts to fetch these supplies back where they belong the captain said ill do that sir sharpe said you will the captain seemed astonished to discover such willingness why on earth would you want to do that ensign its my job sir sharpe said im captain torrances assistant you poor benighted bastard the captain said pityingly poor sir why because im captain torrance good day to you ensign torrance turned on his heel and walked away through the crowd bastard sharpe said for he had suddenly understood why torrance had been so keen to hang naig he spat after the departed captain then went to find some bullocks and carts the army had its supplies back but sharpe had made a new enemy as if hakeswill were not enough he now had torrance as well the palace in gawilghur was a sprawling onestorey building that stood on the highest point within the inner fort to its north was a garden that curled about the largest of the fortresss lakes the lake was a tank a reservoir but its banks had been planted with flowering trees and a flight of steps led from the palace to a small stone pavilion on the lakes northern shore the pavilion had an arched ceiling on which the reflections of the lakes small waves should have rippled but the season had been so dry that the lake had shrunk and the water level was some eight or nine feet lower than usual the water and the exposed banks were rimed with a green foulsmelling scum but beny singh the killadar of gawilghur had arranged for spices to be burned in low flat braziers so that the dozen men inside the pavilion were not too offended by the lakes stench if only the rajah was here beny singh said we should know what to do beny singh was a short plump man with a curling moustache and nervous eyes he was the fortress commander but he was a courtier by avocation not a soldier and he had always regarded his command of the great fortress as a licence to make his fortune rather than to fight the rajahs enemies prince manu bappoo was not surprised that his brother had chosen not to come to gawilghur but had instead fled farther into the hills the rajah was like beny singh he had no belly for a fight but bappoo had watched the first british troops creep across the plain beneath the forts high walls and he welcomed their coming we dont need my brother here to know what we must do he said we fight the other men all commanders of the various troops that had taken refuge in gawilghur voiced their agreement the british cannot be stopped by walls beny singh said he was cradling a small white lap dog which had eyes as wide and frightened as its masters they can and they will bappoo insisted singh shook his head were they stopped at seringapatam at ahmednuggur they crossed those city walls as though they had wings they are what is the word your arabs use djinnsl he looked about the gathered council and saw no one who would support him they must have the djinns on their side he added weakly so what would you do bappoo asked treat with them beny ungh said ask for cowle cowled it was colonel dodd who intervened speaking in his crude newly learned marathi ill tell you what terms wellesley will offer you none hell march you away as a prisoner hell slight these walls and take away the rajahs treasures there are no treasures here beny singh said but no one believed him he was soothing the little dog which had been frightened by the englishmans harsh voice and hell give your women to his men as playthings dodd added nastily beny singh shuddered his wife his concubines and his children were all in the palace and they were all dear to him he pampered them worshipped them and adored them perhaps i should remove my people from the fort he suggested hesitantly i could take them to multai the british will never reach multai youd run away dodd asked in his harsh voice you bloody wont he spoke those three words in english but everyone understood what they meant he leaned forward if you run away he said the garrison loses heart the rest of the soldiers cant take their women away so why should you we fight them here and we stop them here stop them dead he stood and walked to the pavilions edge where he spat onto the greenscummed bank before turning back to beny singh your women are safe here killadar i could hold this fortress from now till the worlds end with just a hundred men the british are djinns beny singh whispered the dog in his arms was shivering they are not djinns dodd snapped there are no demons they dont exist winged djinns beny singh said in almost a whimper invisible djinnsl in the air dodd spat again bloody hell he said in english then turned fast towards beny singh im an english demon me understand im a djinn and if you take your women away ill follow you and ill come to them at night and fill them with black bile he bared his yellowed teeth and the killadar shuddered the white dog barked shrilly manu bappoo waved dodd back to his seat dodd was the only european officer left in his forces and though bappoo was glad to have the englishmans services there were times when colonel dodd could be tiresome if there are djinns bappoo told singh they will be on our side he waited while the killadar soothed the frightened dog then he leaned forward tell me he demanded of beny singh can the british take the fortress by using the roads up the hill beny singh thought about those two steep winding roads that twisted up the hill beneath gawilghurs walls no man could survive those climbs not if the defenders were raining round shot and rocks down the precipitous slopes no he admitted so they can only come one way only one way across the land bridge and my men will guard the outer fort and colonel dodds men will defend the inner fort and no one dodd said harshly no one will get past my cobras he still resented that his welltrained whitecoated soldiers were not defending the outer fort but he had accepted manu bappoos argument that the important thing was to hold the inner fort if by some chance the british did capture the outer fort they would never fight past dodds men my men dodd growled have never been defeated they never will be manu bappoo smiled at the nervous beny singh you see killadar you will die here of old age or of too many women another man put in provoking laughter a cannon sounded from the outer forts northern ramparts followed a few seconds later by another no one knew what might have caused the firing and so the dozen men followed manu bappoo as he left the pavilion and walked towards the inner forts northern ramparts silverfurred monkeys chattered at the soldiers from the high branches arab guards stood at the gate of the rajahs garden they were posted to stop any common soldiers of the garrison going to the paths beside the tank where the killadars women liked to stroll in the cool of the evening a hundred paces beyond the garden gate was a steep sided rock pit about twice as deep as a man stood high and dodd paused to look down into its shadowed depths the sides had been chiselled smooth by stoneworkers so that nothing could climb up from the floor that was littered with white bones the traitors hole bappoo said as he paused beside dodd but the bones are from baby monkeys but they do eat men dodd asked intrigued by the shadowed blackness at the foot of the hole they kill men bappoo said but dont eat them theyre not big enough i cant see any dodd said disappointed then suddenly a sinuous shadow writhed swiftly between two crevices there he said happily dont they grow big enough to eat men most years they escape bappoo said the monsoon floods the pit and the snakes swim to the top and wriggle out then we must find new ones this year weve been saved the trouble these snakes will grow bigger than usual beny singh waited a few paces away clutching his small dog as though he feared dodd would throw it down to the snakes theres a bastard who ought to be fed to the snakes dodd said to bappoo nodding towards the killadar my brother likes him bappoo said mildly touching dodds arm to indicate that they should walk on they share tastes such as women music luxury we really do not need him here dodd shook his head if you let him go sahib then half the damned garrison will want to run away and if you let the women go what will the men fight for besides do you really think theres any danger none bappoo admitted he had led the officers up a steep rock stairway to a natural bastion where a vast iron gun was trained across the chasm towards the distant cliffs of the high plateau from here the far cliffs were almost a mile away but dodd could just see a group of horsemen clustered at the chasms edge it was those horsemen all in native robes who had prompted the outer forts gunners to open fire but the gunners seeing their shots fall well short of the target had given up dodd drew out his telescope trained it and saw a man in the uniform of the royal engineers sitting on the ground a few paces from his companions the engineer was sketching the horsemen were all indians dodd lowered the telescope and looked at the huge iron gun is it loaded he asked the gunners yes sahib a haideri apiece if you can kill the man in the dark uniform the one sitting at the cliffs edge the gunners laughed their gun was over twenty feet long and its wroughtiron barrel was cast with decorations that had been painted green white and red a pile of round shot each over a foot in diameter stood beside the massive carriage that was made from giant baulks of teak the gun captain fussed over his aim shouting at his men to lever the vast carriage a thumbs width to the right then a fingers breadth back until at last he was satisfied he squinted along the barrel for a second waved the officers who had followed bappoo to move away from the great gun then leaned over the breach to dab his glowing port fire onto the guns touchhole the reed glowed and smoked for a second as the fire dashed down to the charge then the vast cannon crashed back the teak runners sliding up the timber ramp that formed the lower half of the carriage smoke jetted out into the chasm as a hundred startled birds flapped from their nests on the rock faces and circled in the warm air dodd had been standing to one side watching the engineer through his glass for a second he actually saw the great round shot as a flicker of grey in the lower right quadrant of his lens then he saw a boulder close to the engineer shatter into scraps the engineer fell sideways his sketch pad falling but then he picked himself up and scrambled up the slope to where his horse was being guarded by the cavalrymen dodd took a single gold coin from his pouch and tossed it to the gunner you missed he said but it was damned fine shooting thank you sahib a whimper made dodd turn beny singh had handed his dog to a servant and was staring through an ivorybarrelled telescope at the enemy horsemen what is it bappoo asked him syud sevajee singh said in a small voice whos syud sevajee dodd asked bappoo grinned his father was once kill adar here but he died was it poison he asked beny singh he just died singh said he just died murdered probably bappoo said with amusement and beny singh became kill adar and took the dead mans daughter as his concubine dodd turned to see the enemy horsemen vanishing among the trees beyond the far cliff come for revenge has he you still want to leave he demanded of beny singh because that fellow will be waiting for you hell track you through the hills killadar and slit your throat in the nights darkness we shall stay here and fight beny singh declared retrieving the dog from his servant fight and win dodd said and he imagined the british breaching batteries on that far cliff and he imagined the slaughter that would be made among the crews by this one vast gun and there were fifty other heavy guns waiting to greet the british approach and hundreds of lighter pieces that fired smaller missiles guns rockets canister muskets and cliffs those were gawilghurs de fences and dodd reckoned the british stood no chance no chance at all the big guns smoke drifted away in the small breeze they will die here dodd said and we shall chase the survivors south and cut them down like dogs he turned and looked at beny singh you see the chasm that is where their demons will die their wings will be scorched they will fall like burning stones to their deaths and their screams will lull your children to a dreamless sleep he knew he spoke true for gawilghur was impregnable i take pleasure no dilip make that i take humble pleasure in reporting the recovery of a quantity of stolen stores captain torrance paused night had just fallen and torrance uncorked a bottle of arrack and took a sip am i going too fast for you yes sahib dilip the middleaged clerk answered humble pleasure he said aloud as his pen moved laboriously over the paper in reporting the recovery of a quantity of stolen stores add a list of the stores torrance ordered you can do that later just leave a space man yes sahib dilip said i had suspected for some time torrance intoned then scowled as someone knocked on the door come he shouted if you must sharpe opened the door and was immediately entangled in the muslin he fought his way past its folds its you torrance said unpleasantly me sir you let some moths in torrance complained sorry sir that is why the muslin is there sharpe to keep out moths ensigns and other insignificant nuisances kill the moths dilip the clerk dutifully chased the moths about the room swatting them with a roll of paper the windows like the door were closely screened with muslin on the outside of which moths clustered attracted by the candles that were set in silver sticks on torrances table dilips work was spread on the table while captain torrance lay in a wide hammock slung from the roof beams he was naked do i offend you sharpe offend me sir i am naked or had you not noticed doesnt bother me sir nudity keeps clothes clean you should try it is the last of the enemy dead dilip the moths are all deceased sahib then we shall continue where were we i had suspected for some time dilip read back the report surmised is better i think i had surmised for some time torrance paused to draw on the mouthpiece of a silverbellied hookah what are you doing here sharpe come to get orders sir how very assiduous of you i had surmised for some time that depredations i can spell it if you cannot dilip were being made upon the stores entrusted to my command what the devil were you doing sharpe poking about naigs tents just happened to be passing them sir sharpe said when they caught fire torrance gazed at sharpe plainly not believing a word he shook his head sadly you look very old to be an ensign sharpe i was a sergeant two months ago sir torrance adopted a look of pretended horror oh good god he said archly good god alive may all the spavined saints preserve us youre not telling me youve been made up from the ranks yes sir sweet suffering jesus torrance said he lay his head back on the hammocks pillow and blew a perfect smoke ring that he watched wobble its way up towards the ceiling having confidential information as to the identity of the thief i took steps to apprehend him you will notice sharpe that i am giving you no credit in this report no sir indeed i am not this report will go to colonel butters an appallingly bombastic creature who will i suspect attempt to take some of the credit for himself before passing the papers on to arthur wellesley who as you may know is our commander a very stern man our arthur he likes things done properly he plainly had a very stern governess in his nursery i know the general sir you do torrance turned his head to look at sharpe socially perhaps you and he dine together do you pass the time of day do you hunt together maybe drink port talk about old times whore together perhaps torrance was mocking but there was just an edge of interest in his voice in case sharpe really did know sir arthur i mean ive met him sir torrance shook his head as though sharpe had been wasting his time do stop calling me sir it may be your natural subservience sharpe or more likely it is the natural air of superiority that emanates from my person but it ill becomes an officer even one dredged up from the ranks a search of his tents dilip secured the missing items i then in accordance with general orders hanged the thief as an example i have the honour to be et cetera et cetera two thousand muskets are still missing sir sharpe said sorry sir didnt mean to call you sir if it pleases you to grovel sharpe then do so two thousand muskets still missing eh i suspect the bugger sold them on dont you im more interested in how he got them in the first place sharpe said how very tedious of you torrance said lightly id suggest talking to sergeant hakeswill when he gets back sharpe said i wont hear a word spoken against obadiah torrance said obadiah is a most amusing fellow hes a lying thieving bastard sharpe said vehemently sharpe please torrances voice was pained how can you say such wicked things you dont even know the fellow oh i know him sir i served under him in the havercakes you did torrance smiled i see we are in for interesting times perhaps i should keep the two of you apart or perhaps not brick the last word was shouted towards a door that led to the back of the commandeered house the door opened and the blackhaired woman slipped past the muslin captain she asked she blushed when she saw torrance was naked and torrance sharpe saw enjoyed her embarrassment brick my dear torrance said my hookah has extinguished itself will you attend to it dilip is busy or i would have asked him sharpe may i have the honour of naming you to brick brick this is ensign sharpe ensign sharpe this is brick pleased to meet you sir the woman said dropping a brief curtsey before she stooped to the hookah she had clearly not told torrance that she had met sharpe earlier maam sharpe said maam torrance said with a laugh shes called brick sharpe brick sir sharpe asked sourly the name was utterly unsuited to the delicatefeatured woman who now deftly disassembled the hookah her real name is mrs wall torrance explained and she is my laundress seamstress and conscience is that not right little brick if you say so sir i cannot abide dirty clothes torrance said they are an abomination unto the lord cleanliness we are constantly told by tedious folk is next to godliness but i suspect it is a superior virtue any peasant can be godly but it is a rare person who is clean brick however keeps me clean if you pay her a trifle sharpe she will doubtless wash and mend those rags you are pleased to call a uniform theyre all ive got sir so walk naked until brick has serviced you or does the idea embarrass you i wash my own clothes sir i wish you would torrance said tartly remind me why you came here sharpe orders sir very well torrance said at dawn you will go to colonel butterss quarters and find an aide who can tell you what is required of us you then tell dilip dilip then arranges everything after that you may take your rest i trust you will not find these duties onerous sharpe wondered why torrance had asked for a deputy if the clerk did all the work then supposed that the captain was so lazy that he could not be bothered to get up early in the morning to fetch his orders i get tomorrows orders at dawn sir sharpe said from an aide of colonel butters there torrance said with mock amazement you have mastered your duties ensign i congratulate you we already have tomorrows orders sahib dilip said from the table where he was copying a list of the recovered stores into torrances report we are to move everything to deogaum the pioneers stores are to be moved first sahib the colonels orders are on the table sahib with the chitties pioneers stores first then everything else well i never torrance said see your first days work is done sharpe he drew on the hookah which the woman had relit excellent my dear he said then held out a hand to stop her from leaving she crouched beside the hammock averting her eyes from torrances naked body sharpe sensed her unhappiness and torrance sensed sharpes interest in her brick is a widow sharpe he said and presumably looking for a husband though i doubt shes ever dared to dream of marrying as high as an ensign but why not the social ladder is there to be climbed and low a rung as you might be sharpe you still represent a considerable advancement for brick before she joined my service she was a mopsqueezer from mopsqueezer to an officers wife theres progress for you i think the two of you would suit each other vastly well i shall play cupid or rather dilip will take a letter to the chaplain of the th dilip hes rarely sober but im sure he can waddle through the marriage ceremony without falling over i cant marry sir sharpe protested torrance amused at himself raised an eyebrow you are averse to women you dislike dear brick or youve taken an oath of celibacy perhaps sharpe blushed im spoken for sir you mean youre engaged how very touching is she an heiress perhaps sharpe shrugged shes in seringapatam he said lamely and were not engaged but you have an understanding torrance said with this ravishing creature in seringapatam is she black sharpe a black bibbi im sure clare wouldnt mind would you a white man in india needs a bibbi or two as well as a wife dont you agree brick he turned to the woman who ignored him the late mister wall died of the fever torrance said to sharpe and in the christian kindness of my heart i continue to employ his widow does that not speak well of my character if you say so sir sharpe said i see my attempt to play cupid is not meeting with success torrance said so sharpe to business tomorrow morning i suggest you go to deogaum wherever the hell that is with the bullocks sir torrance raised his eyebrows in exasperation you are an officer sharpe not a bullock driver you dont prod rumps you leave that to the natives go early ride there at dawn and your first duty will be to find me quarters i dont have a horse sharpe said you dont have a horse dont have a horse good god alive man what bloody use are you youll just have to bloody well walk then i shall find you in deogaum tomorrow afternoon and god help you if you havent found me decent quarters a front room sharpe where dilip can conduct business a large room for me and a hole for brick i would also like to have a walled garden with adequate shade trees and a small pool where is deogaum sharpe asked northwards sahib dilip answered close to the hills beneath gawilghur sharpe guessed yes sahib sharpe looked back to torrance can i ask a favour of you sir torrance sighed if you insist at gawilghur sir id like permission to join the assault party torrance stared at sharpe for a long time you want what he finally asked i want to be with the attack sir theres a fellow inside see who killed a friend of mine i want to see him dead torrance blinked at sharpe dont tell me youre enthusiastic good god a sudden look of terror came to the captains face youre not a methodist are you no sir torrance pointed the hookahs mouthpiece towards a corner of the room there is a linen press sharpe dyou see it inside it are my clothes amidst my clothes you will find a pistol take the pistol remove yourself from my presence apply the muzzle to your head and pull the trigger it is a much quicker and less painful way of dying but you wont mind if i join the attack mind youre not surely labouring under the misapprehension that i care about your existence you think i might mourn you even after such a short acquaintance my dear sharpe i fear i shall not miss you at all i doubt ill even remember your name once youre dead of course you can join the assaulting party do what you like now i suggest you get some sleep not here though i like my privacy find a tree perhaps and slumber beneath its sheltering branches good night to you sharpe good night sir and dont let any moths in sharpe negotiated the muslin and slipped out of the door torrance listened to the footsteps go away then sighed a tedious man dilip yes sahib i wonder why he was made an officer torrance frowned as he sucked on his hookah then shook his head poor naig sacrificed to a mere ensigns ambition how did that wretched sharpe even know to look in naigs tent did he talk to you yes sahib dilip admitted torrance stared at him did you let him look at the ledgers he insisted sahib youre a bloody fool dilip a bloody bloody fool i should thrash you if i wasnt so tired maybe tomorrow no sahib please oh just bugger away off dilip torrance snarled and you can go too brick the girl fled to the kitchen door dilip collected his ink bottle and sandsprinkler shall i take the chitties now sahib for the morning go torrance roared you bore me go dilip fled to the front room and torrance lay back in the hammock he was indeed bored he had nothing to do and nowhere to go most nights he would go to naigs tents and there drink gamble and whore but he could hardly visit the green pavilion this night not after stringing naig up by the neck damn it he thought he glanced at the table where a book a gift from his father lay unopened the first volume of some reflections on pauls epistle to the ephesians by the reverend courtney mallison and it would be a frigid day in the devils house before torrance read that turgid tome the reverend mallison had been torrances childhood tutor and a vicious beast he had been a whipper that was mallison loved to whip his pupils torrance stared at the ceiling money it was all down to money everything in the damned world was down to money make money he thought and he could go home and make courtney mallisons life a misery have the bastard on his knees and mallisons daughter have that prim bitch on her back there was a knock on the door i said i didnt want to be disturbed torrance shouted but despite his protest the door opened and the muslin billowed inward letting in a flutter of moths for christs sake torrance cursed then fell abruptly silent he fell silent for the first man through the door was ajetti his bare torso gleaming with oil and behind him came the tall man with a limp the same man who had pleaded for naigs life his name was jama and he was naigs brother and his presence made torrance acutely aware of his nudity he swung off the hammock and reached for his dressing gown but jama twitched the silk garment off the chair back captain torrance he said with a bow who let you in torrance demanded i expected to see you in our small establishment tonight captain jama said where his brother had been plump noisy and a braggart jama was lean silent and watchful torrance shrugged maybe tomorrow night you will be welcome captain as always jama took a small sheaf of papers from his pocket and fanned his face with them ten thousand welcomes captain ten thousand rupees that was the value of the papers in jamas hand all of them notes signed by torrance he had signed far more but the others he had paid off with supplies filched from the convoys jama was here to remind torrance that his greatest debts remained unpaid about today torrance said awkwardly ah yes jama said as though he had momentarily forgotten the reason for his visit about today captain do tell me about today the jetti said nothing just leaned against the wall with folded arms his oiled muscles shining in the candlelight and his dark eyes fixed immovably on torrance ive already told you it wasnt of my doing torrance said with as much dignity as a naked man could muster you were the one who demanded my brothers death jama said what choice did i have once the supplies were found but perhaps you arranged for them to be found no torrance protested why the hell would i do that jama was silent a moment then indicated the huge man at his side his name is prithviraj i once saw him castrate a man with his bare hands jama mimed a pulling action smiling youd be astonished at how far a little skin can stretch before it breaks for gods sake torrance had gone pale it was not my doing then whose doing was it his name is sharpe ensign sharpe jama walked to torrances table where he turned the pages of some reflections on pauls epistle to the ephesians this sharpe he asked he was not obeying your orders of course not jama shrugged my brother was careless he admitted over confident he believed that with your friendship he could survive any enquiry we were doing business torrance said it was not friendship and i told your brother he should have hidden the supplies yes jama said he should and so i told him also but even so captain i come from a proud family you expect me to watch my brother killed and do nothing about it he fanned out the notes of torrances debts i shall return these to you captain when you deliver ensign sharpe to me alive i want prithviraj to take my revenge you understand torrance understood well enough sharpes a british officer he said if hes murdered therell be an enquiry a real enquiry heads will be broken that is your problem captain torrance jama said how you explain his disappearance is your affair as are your debts he smiled and pushed the notes back into the pouch at his belt give me sharpe captain torrance or i shall send prithviraj to visit you in the night in the meantime you will please continue to patronize our establishment bastard torrance said but jama and his huge companion had already gone torrance picked up some reflections on pauls epistle to the ephesians and slammed the heavy book down on a moth bastard he said again but on the other hand it was sharpe who would suffer not him so it did not really matter and what was sharpe anyway nothing but an upstart from the ranks so who would care if he died torrance killed another moth then opened the kitchen door come here brick no sir please shut up and come here you can kill these damn moths while i get drunk filthy drunk he reckoned for he had been scared today he knew he had very nearly got caught when sharpe had stripped the tent away from the purloined supplies but by killing naig quickly torrance had protected himself and now the price of his continued survival was sharpes death arrange that he thought and all his troubles would be past he forced brick to drink some arrack knowing how she hated it then he drank some himself damn sharpe to hell he thought damn the interfering bastard to hell which was where sharpe was going anyway so torrance drank to that happy prospect farewell mister sharpe chapter sharpe was not sure how far away deogaum was but guessed it was close to twenty miles and that was at least a sevenhour journey on foot and so it was long before dawn when he stirred ahmed from his sleep beside the smouldering remains of a bullockdung fire then set off under the stars he tried to teach ahmed some english stars sharpe said pointing stars ahmed repeated dutifully moon sharpe said moon ahmed echoed sky moon ahmed asked curious that sharpe was still pointing to the sky sky you bugger skyoobugger never mind sharpe said he was hungry and he had forgotten to ask captain torrance where he was supposed to draw rations but their northward route took them through the village of argaum where the fighting battalions of the army were bivouacked unburied bodies still littered the battlefield and scavenging wild dogs growled from the dark stench as sharpe and ahmed walked past a picquet challenged them at the village and sharpe asked the man where he would find the cavalry lines he could not imagine taking ahmed to the ths mess for breakfast but sergeant eli lockhart might be more welcoming the reveille had sounded by the time sharpe came to the gully where the horses were picketed and the troopers campfires were being restored to life lockhart scowled at the unexpected visitor through the smoky dawn gloom then grinned when he recognized sharpe must be some fighting to do lads he announced the bleeding infantrys here good morning sir need our help again i need some breakfast sharpe admitted tea thatll start you off smithers pork chops davies some of that bread youre hiding from me look lively now lockhart turned back to sharpe dont ask me where the chops come from sir i might have to lie he spat in a tin mug scoured its interior with the end of his blanket then filled it with tea there you are sir does your boy want some here you are lad lockhart a mug of tea in his own hand then insisted on taking sharpe to the picketed horses see sir he lifted a horses leg to show off the new horseshoe my guvnors beholden to you i might introduce you after breakfast sharpe assumed that lockhart was talking of his troop commander but once the pork chops and bread had been eaten the sergeant led sharpe across to the lines of the native cavalry and then to the tent of the th native cavalrys commanding officer who it seemed was in charge of all the armys cavalry hes called huddlestone lockhart said and hes a decent fellow hell probably offer us another breakfast colonel huddlestone did indeed insist that both lockhart and sharpe join him for a breakfast of rice and eggs sharpe was beginning to see that lockhart was a useful man someone who was trusted by his officers and liked by his troopers for huddlestone greeted the sergeant warmly and immediately plunged into a conversation about some local horses that had been purchased for remounts and which huddlestone reckoned would never stand the strain of battle though lockhart seemed to feel that a few of them would be adequate so youre the fellow who smoked out naig huddlestone said to sharpe after a while didnt take much doing sir no one else did it man dont shy away from credit im damned grateful to you couldnt have done it without sergeant lockhart sir damned army would come to a stop without eli aint that so the colonel said and lockhart his mouth full of egg just grinned huddlestone turned back to sharpe so they gave you to torrance yes sir hes a lazy bugger huddlestone said vengefully sharpe astonished at the open criticism said nothing hes one of my own officers huddlestone went on and i confess i wasnt sorry when he asked to be given duty with the bullock train he asked sir sharpe found it curious that a man would prefer to be with the baggage when he could be in a fighting unit his uncle is grooming him for a career in the company huddlestone said an uncle in leadenhall street know what leadenhall street is sharpe company offices sir the very same the uncle pays him an allowance and he wants torrance to get some experience in dealing with bhinjarries got it all planned out a few years in the companys army another few trading in spices then home to inherit his uncles estate and his seat in the court of directors one day well all be tugging our forelocks to the lazy bugger still if he wants to run the baggage train its no skin off our bums sharpe no one likes the job so torrance is welcome to it but my guess is that youll be doing most of his work the colonel frowned he arrived in india with three english servants can you believe it it aint as if servants are hard to find here but torrance wanted the cachet of white scullions two of em died of the fever then torrance had the nerve to say that one of them hadnt earned the cost of the voyage out and so hes forcing the widow to stay on and pay the debt huddlestone shook his head then gestured for his servant to pour more tea so what brings you here ensign on my way to deogaum sir he really came to beg his breakfast colonel lockhart put in and ive no doubt the sergeant fed you before you came to steal my victuals huddlestone asked then grinned youre in luck ensign were moving up to deogaum today you can ride with us sharpe blushed ive no horse sir eli huddlestone looked at lockhart ive got a horse he can ride sir good huddlestone blew on his tea welcome to the cavalry sharpe lockhart found two horses one for sharpe and the other for ahmed sharpe ever uncomfortable on horseback struggled into the saddle under the cavalrys sardonic gaze while ahmed jumped up and kicked back his heels revelling in being back on a horse they went gently northwards taking care not to tire the horses sharpe as he rode found himself thinking about clare wall and that made him feel guilty about simone joubert the young french widow who waited for him in seringapatam he had sent her there with a southbound convoy and a letter for his friend major stokes and doubtless simone was waiting for sharpe to return when the campaign against the mahrattas was over but now he needed to warn her that he was being posted back to england would she come with him did he want her to come he was not sure about either question though he felt obscurely responsible for simone he could give her a choice of course but whenever simone was faced by a choice she tended to look limp and wait for someone else to make the decision he had to warn her though would she even want to go to england but what else could she do she had no relatives in india and the nearest french settlements were miles away his thoughts were interrupted at midmorning when eli lockhart spurred alongside his horse see it see what up there lockhart pointed ahead and sharpe peering through the dust haze thrown up by the leading squadrons saw a range of high hills the lower slopes were green with trees but above the timber line there was nothing but brown and grey cliffs that stretched from horizon to horizon and at the very top of the topmost bluff he could just see a streak of dark wall broken by a gatetower gawilghur lockhart said how the hell do we attack up there sharpe asked the sergeant laughed we dont its a job for the infantry reckon youre better off attached to that fellow torrance sharpe shook his head i have to get in there eli why sharpe gazed at the distant wall theres a fellow called dodd in there and the bastard killed a friend of mine lockhart thought for a second seven hundred guineas dodd thats the fellow sharpe said but im not after the reward i just want to see the bugger dead me too lockhart said grimly you assaye lockhart said brusquely what happened we charged his troops they were knocking seven kinds of hell out of the th and we caught the buggers in line knocked em hard back but we must have had a dozen troopers unhorsed we didnt stop though we just kept after their cavalry and it wasnt till the battle was over that we found our lads theyd had their throats cut all of them that sounds like dodd sharpe said the renegade englishman liked to spread terror make a man afraid dodd had once told sharpe and he wont fight you so hard so maybe ill go into gawilghur with you lockhart said cavalry sharpe asked they wont let cavalry into a real fight lockhart grinned i couldnt let an ensign go into a fight without help poor little bugger might get hurt sharpe laughed the cavalry had swerved off the road to pass a long column of marching infantry who had set off before dawn on their march to deogaum the leading regiment was sharpes own the th and sharpe moved even farther away from the road so that he would not have to acknowledge the men who had wanted to be rid of him but ensign venables spotted him leaped the roadside ditch and ran to his side going up in the world richard venables asked borrowed glory sharpe said the horse belongs to the igth venables looked slightly relieved that sharpe had not suddenly been able to afford a horse are you with the pioneers now he asked nothing so grand sharpe said reluctant to admit that he had been reduced to being a bullock guard venables did not really care because thats what were doing he explained escorting the pioneers it seems they have to make a road up there sharpe guessed nodding towards the fortress that dominated the plain captain urquhart says you might be selling your commission venables said does he are you are you making an offer ive got a brother you see venables explained three actually and some sisters my father might buy he took a piece of paper from a pocket and handed it up to sharpe so if you go home why not see my pater thats his address he reckons one of my brothers should join the army aint any good for anything else see ill think on it sharpe said taking the paper the cavalry had stretched ahead and so he clapped his heels back and the horse jerked forward throwing sharpe back in the saddle for a second he sprawled almost falling over the beasts rump then he flailed wildly to catch his balance and just managed to grasp the saddle pommel he thought he heard laughter as he trotted away from the battalion gawilghur soared above the plain like a threat and sharpe felt like a poacher with nowhere to hide from up there sharpe reckoned the approaching british army would look like so many ants in the dust he wished he had a telescope to stare at the high distant fortress but he had been reluctant to spend money he was not sure why it was not that he was poor indeed there were few soldiers richer yet he feared that the real reason was that he felt fraudulent wearing an officers sash and that if he were to buy the usual appurtenances of an officer a horse and a telescope and an expensive sword then he would be mocked by those in the army who claimed he should never have been commissioned in the first place nor should he he thought he had been happier as a sergeant much happier all the same he wished he had a telescope as he gazed up at the stronghold and saw a great billow of smoke jet from one of the bastions seconds later he heard the fading boom of the gun but he saw no sign of the shot falling it was as though the cannonball had been swallowed into the warm air a mile short of the foothills the road split into three the sepoy horsemen went westwards while the igth light dragoons took the right hand path that angled away from the domineering fortress the country became more broken as it was cut by small gullies and heaped with low wooded ridges thfe first hints of the tumultuous surge of land that ended in the vast cliffs trees grew thick in those foothills and deogaum was evidently among the low wooded hills it lay east of gawilghur safely out of range of the fortresss guns a crackle of musketry sounded from a timbered cleft and the igth dragoons riding ahead of sharpe spread into a line ahmed grinned and made sure his musket was loaded sharpe wondered which side the boy was on another spatter of muskets sounded this time to the west the mahrattas must have had men in the foothills perhaps they were stripping the villages of the stored grain the sepoys of the east india company cavalry had vanished while the horsemen of the igth were filing into the wooded cleft a gun boomed in the fort and this time sharpe heard a thump as a cannonball fell to earth like a stone far behind him a patch of dust drifted from a field where the shot had plummeted then he and ahmed followed the dragoons into the gully and the leaves hid them from the invisible watchers high above the road twisted left and right then emerged into a patchwork of small fields and woods a large village lay beyond the fields sharpe guessed it must be deogaum then there were shots to his left and he saw a crowd of horsemen burst out of the trees a halfmile away they were mahrattas and at first sharpe thought they were intent on charging the igth light dragoons then he realized they were fleeing from the company cavalry there were fifty or sixty of the enemy horsemen who on seeing the blueandyellowcoated dragoons swerved southwards to avoid a fight the dragoons were turning drawing sabres and spurring into pursuit a trumpet sounded and the small fields were suddenly a whirl of horses dust and gleaming weapons sharpe reined in among a patch of trees not wanting to be at the centre of a mahratta cavalry charge the enemy horse pounded past in a blur of hooves shining helmets and lance points the company cavalry was still a quartermile behind when ahmed suddenly kicked back his heels and shot out of the hiding place to follow the mahratta cavalry sharpe swore the little bastard was running back to join the mahrattas not that sharpe could blame him but he still felt disappointed he knew he had no chance of catching ahmed who had unslung his musket and now rode up behind the rearmost enemy horseman that man looked round saw ahmed was not in british uniform and so ignored him ahmed galloped alongside then swung his musket by its barrel so that the heavy stock cracked into the mahrattas forehead the man went off the back of his horse as though jerked by a rope his horse ran on stirrups flapping ahmed reined in turned and jumped down beside his victim sharpe saw the flash of a knife the sepoy cavalry was closer now and they might think ahmed was the enemy so sharpe shouted at the boy to come back ahmed scrambled back into his saddle and kicked his horse to the trees where sharpe waited he had plundered a sabre a pistol and a leather bag and had a grin as wide as his face the bag held two stale loaves of flat bread some glass beads and a small book in a strange script ahmed gave one loaf to sharpe threw away the book draped the cheap beads about his neck and hung the sabre at his waist then watched as the dragoons cut into the rearward ranks of the fugitives there was the blacksmiths sound of steel on steel two horses stumbled in flurries of dust a man staggered bleeding into a ditch pistols banged a lance shivered point downwards in the dry turf and then the enemy horse was gone and the british and sepoy cavalry reined in why cant you be a proper servant sharpe asked ahmed clean my boots wash my clothes make my supper eh ahmed who did not understand a word just grinned instead i get some murderous urchin so come on you bugger sharpe kicked his horse towards the village he passed a halfempty tank where some clothes lay to dry on bushes then he was in the dusty main street which appeared to be deserted though he was aware of faces watching nervously from dark windows and curtainhung doorways dogs growled from the shade and two chickens scratched in the dust the only person in sight was a naked holy man who sat cross legged under a tree with his long hair cascading to the ground about him he ignored sharpe and sharpe ignored him we have to find a house sharpe told the uncomprehending ahmed house see house the village headman the naique ventured into the street at least sharpe assumed he was the naique just as the naique assumed that the mounted soldier was the leader of the newly arrived cavalrymen he clasped his hands before his face and bowed to sharpe then clicked his fingers to summon a servant carrying a small brass tray on which stood a little cup of arrack the fierce liquor made sharpes head feel suddenly light the naique was talking ten to the dozen but sharpe quietened him with a wave no good talking to me he said im nobody talk to him he pointed to colonel huddlestone who was leading his indian cavalrymen into the village the troopers dismounted as huddlestone talked to the headman there was a squawk as the two chickens were snatched up huddlestone turned at the sound but his men all looked innocent high above sharpe a gun banged in the fortress the shot seared out to fall somewhere in the plain where the british infantry marched the dragoons came into the village some with bloodied sabres and sharpe surrendered the two horses to lockhart then he searched the street to find a house for torrance he saw nothing which had a walled garden but he did find a small mudwalled home that had a courtyard and he dropped his pack in the main room as a sign of ownership there was a woman with two small children who shrank away from him its all right sharpe said you get paid no one will hurt you the woman wailed and crouched as though expecting to be hit bloody hell sharpe said does no one in this bleeding country speak english he had nothing to do now until torrance arrived he could have hunted through the village to discover paper a pen and ink so he could write to simone and tell her about going to england but he decided that chore could wait he stripped off his belt sabre and jacket found a rope bed and lay down far overhead the fortress guns fired it sounded like distant thunder sharpe slept sergeant obadiah hakeswill tugged off his boots releasing a stench into the room that caused captain torrance to close his eyes good god torrance said weakly the captain felt ill enough already he had drunk the best part of a bottle of arrack had woken in the night with gripes in the belly and then slept unevenly until dawn when someone had scratched at his door and torrance had shouted at the pest to go away after which he had at last fallen into a deeper sleep now he had been woken by hakeswill who oblivious of the stench began to unwrap the cloths that bound his feet it smelt torrance thought like rotted cheese that had been stored in a corpses belly he shifted his chair slightly towards the window and pulled his dressing gown tighter about his chest im truly sorry about naig torrance said hakeswill had listened in disbelief to the tale of naigs death and seemed genuinely saddened by it just as he had been shocked by the news that sharpe was now torrances assistant the bleeding scotch didnt want him sir did they hakeswill said never thought the scotch had much sense but they had wits enough to get rid of sharpie hakeswill had uncovered his right foot and torrance barely able to endure the stink suspected there was black fungus growing between the sergeants toes now youve got him sir hakeswill went on and i pities you i does decent officer like you sir last thing you deserved bleeding sharpie he aint got no right to be an officer sir not sharpie he aint a gentleman like your good self sir hes just a common toad like the rest of us so why was he commissioned torrance asked watching as hakeswill tugged at the crusted cloth on his left foot on account of saving the generals life sir leastwise thats what is said hakeswill paused as a spasm made his face twitch saved sir arthurs life at assaye not that i believe it sir but sir arthur does and the result of that sir is that sir arthur thinks bloody sharpie is a blue eyed boy sharpie farts and sir arthur thinks the winds turned southerly does he now torrance asked that was worth knowing four years ago sir hakeswill said i had sharpie flogged would have been a dead un too he would like he deserved only sir arthur stopped the flogging after two hundred lashes stopped it the injustice of the act still galled the sergeant now hes a bleedin officer i tells you sir the army aint what it was gone to the dogs it has he pulled the cloth from his left foot then frowned at his toes i washed them in august he said in wonderment but it dont look like it does it it is now december sergeant torrance said reprovingly a good sluice should last six months sir some of us engage in a more regular toilet torrance hinted you would sir being a gentleman thing is sir i wouldnt normally take the toe rags off only theres a blister hakeswill frowned havent had a blister in years poor naig for a blackamoor he wasnt a bad sort of fellow naig torrance believed had been as evil a creature as any on the surface of the earth but he smiled piously at hakeswills tribute we shall certainly miss him sergeant pity you had to hang him sir but what choice did you have between the devil and a deep blue buggeration thats where you were sir but poor naig hakeswill shook his head in sad remembrance you should have strung up sharpie sir mores the pity you couldnt strung him up proper like what he deserves a murdering bastard he is murdering and an indignant hakeswill told captain torrance how sharpe had tried to kill him first by throwing him among the tippoos tigers then by trapping him in a courtyard with an elephant trained to kill by crushing men with its forefoot only the tigers werent hungry see on account of being fed and as for the elephant sir i had me knife didnt i i jabbed it in the paw i did he mimed the stabbing action right in its paw deep in it didnt like it i cant die sir i cant die the sergeant spoke hoarsely believing every word he had been hanged as a child but he had survived the gallows and now believed he was protected from death by his own guardian angel mad torrance thought bedlammad but he was nevertheless fascinated by obadiah hakeswill to look at the sergeant appeared the perfect soldier it was the twitch that suggested something more interesting lay behind the bland blue eyes and what lay behind those childish eyes torrance had decided was a breathtaking malevolence yet one that was accompanied by an equally astonishing confidence hakeswill torrance had decided would murder a baby and find justification for the act so you dont like mister sharpe torrance asked i hates him sir and i dont mind admitting it ive watched him i have slither his way up the ranks like a bleeding eel up a drain hakeswill had taken out a knife presumably the one which he had stabbed into the elephants foot and now cocked his right heel on his left knee and laid the blade against the blister torrance shut his eyes to spare himself the sight of hakeswill performing surgery the thing is sergeant he said that naigs brother would rather like a private word with mister sharpe does he now hakeswill asked he stabbed down look at that sir proper bit of pus soon be healed aint had a blister in years reckon it must be the new boots he spat on the blade and poked the blister again ill have to soak the boots in vinegar sir so jama wants sharpes goo lies does he literally as it happens yes he can join the bleeding queue no torrance said sternly it is important to me sergeant that mister sharpe is delivered to jama alive and that his disappearance occasions no curiosity you mean no one must notice hakeswilps face twitched while he thought then he shrugged aint difficult sir it isnt ill have a word with jama sir then you can give sharpie some orders and ill be waiting for him itll be easy sir glad to do it for you you are a comfort to me sergeant thats my job sir hakeswill said then leered at the kitchen door where clare wall had appeared sunshine of my life he said in what he hoped was a winning tone your tea sir clare said offering torrance a cup a mug for the sergeant brick where are your manners she dont need manners hakeswill said still leering at the terrified clare not with what shes got put some sugar in it darling if the captain will spare me some give him sugar brick torrance ordered hakeswill watched brick go back to the kitchen a proper little woman that sir a flower thats what she is a flower no doubt you would like to pluck her its time i was married hakeswill said a man should leave a son sir says so in the scriptures you want to do some begetting eh torrance said then frowned as someone knocked on the outer door come he called an infantry captain whom neither man recognized put his head round the door captain torrance thats me torrance said grandly sir arthur wellesleys compliments the captain said his acid tone suggesting that the compliments would be remarkably thin but is there any reason why the supplies have not moved northwards torrance stared at the man for a second he was speechless then he cursed under his breath my compliments to the general he said and my assurances that the bullock train will be on its way immediately he waited until the captain had gone then swore again what happened sir hakeswill asked the bloody chitties torrance said still here dilip must have come for them this morning but i told him to bugger off he swore again bloody wellesley will pull my guts out backwards for this hakeswill found the chitties on the table and went to the door leaving small bloody marks on the floor from his opened blister dilly dilly you black bastard heathen swine here take these on your way no damn torrance said standing and pacing the small room damn damn damn nothing to worry about sir hakeswill said easy for you to say sergeant hakeswill grinned as his face was distorted by twitches just blame someone else sir he said as is usually done in the army who sharpe you said yourself hes wellesleys blueeyed boy im supposed to blame him or you perhaps hakeswill tried to calm the captain down by giving him his cup of tea blame dilly sir on account of him being a heathen bastard as black as my new boots hell simply deny everything when questioned torrance protested hakeswill smiled wont be in a position to deny anything sir will he on account of being he paused stuck his tongue out opened his eyes wide and made a choking noise good god sergeant torrance said shuddering at the horrid picture suggested by hakeswills contorted face besides hes a good clerk its damned difficult to replace good men its easy sir jama will give us a man give us a good man hakeswill grinned itll make things much easier sir if we can trust the clerk as well as each other torrance flinched at the thought of being in league with obadiah hakeswill yet if he was ever to pay off his debts he needed the sergeants cooperation and hakeswill was marvellously efficient he could strip the supplies bare and not leave a trace of his handiwork always making sure someone else took the blame and doubtless the sergeant was right if jama could provide a clerk then the clerk could provide a false set of accounts and if dilip was blamed for the late arrival of the pioneers stores then torrance would be off that particularly sharp and nasty hook as ever it seemed as though hakeswill could find his way through the thorniest of problems just leave it to me sir hakeswill said ill look after everything sir i will he bared his teeth at clare who had brought his mug of tea youre the flower of womanhood he told her then watched appreciatively as she scuttled back to the kitchen her and me sir are meant for each other says so in the scriptures not till sharpes dead torrance said hell be dead sir hakeswill promised and the sergeant shivered in as he anticipated the riches that would follow that death not just clare wall but the jewels the jewels hakeswill had divined that it had been sharpe who had killed the tippoo sultan in seringapatam and sharpe who must have stripped the rulers body of its diamonds and emeralds and sapphires and rubies and sharpe hakeswill reckoned was still hiding those stones from far away dulled by the heat of the day came the sound of artillery firing gawilghur hakeswill thought where sharpe should not reach on account of sharpe being hakeswills business and no one elses i will be rich the sergeant promised himself i will be rich colonel william dodd stood on the southernmost battlements of gawilghur with his back against the parapet so that he was staring down into a palace courtyard where beny singh had erected a striped pavilion small silver bells that tinkled prettily in the small breeze were hung from the pavilions fringed hem while under the canopy a group of musicians played the strange longnecked stringed instruments which made a music that to dodds ears sounded like the slow strangulation of cats beny singh and a dozen pretty creatures in saris were playing some form of blind mans buff and their laughter rose to the ramparts making dodd scowl though if truth were told he was inordinately jealous of beny singh the man was plump short and timid yet he seemed to work some magical spell on the ladies while dodd who was tall hard and scarred to prove his bravery had to make do with a whore damn the killadar dodd turned sharply away and stared over the heatbaked plain beneath him and just far enough to the east to be out of range of gawilghurs largest guns the edge of the british encampment showed from this height the rows of dull white tents looked like speckles to the south still a long way off dodd could see the enemy baggage train trudgiilg towards its new encampment it was odd he thought that they should make the oxen carry their burdens through the hottest part of the day usually the baggage marched just after midnight and camped not long after dawn but today the great herd was stirring the dust into the broiling afternoon air and it looked dodd thought like a migrating tribe there were thousands of oxen in the armys train all loaded with round shot powder tools salt beef arrack horseshoes bandages flints muskets spices rice and with them came the merchants beasts and the merchants families and the ox herdsmen had their own families and they all needed more beasts to carry their tents clothes and food a dozen elephants plodded in the herds centre while a score of dromedaries swayed elegantly behind the elephants mysore cavalry guarded the great caravan while beyond the mounted picquets halfnaked grasscutters spread into the fields to collect fodder that they stuffed into nets and loaded onto yet more oxen dodd glanced at the sentries who guarded the southern stretch of gawilghurs walls and he saw the awe on their faces as they watched the enormous herd approach the dust from the hooves rose to smear the southern skyline like a vast sea fog theyre only oxen dodd growled to the men only oxen oxen dont fire guns oxen dont climb walls none of them understood him but they grinned dutifully dodd walked eastwards after a while the wall ended giving way to the bare lip of a precipice there was no need for walls around much of the perimeters of gawilghurs twin forts for nature had provided the great cliffs that were higher than any rampart a man could make but dodd as he walked to the bluffs edge noted places here and there where an agile man could with the help of a rope scramble down the rock face a few men deserted gawilghurs garrison every day and dodd did not doubt that this was how they escaped but he did not understand why they should want to go the fort was impregnable why would a man not wish to stay with the victors he reached a stretch of wall at the forts southeastern corner and there high up on a gun platform he opened his telescope and stared down into the foothills he searched for a long time his glass skittering over trees shrubs and patches of dry grass but at last he saw a group of men standing beside a narrow path some of the men were in red coats and one was in blue what are you watching colonel prince manu bappoo had seen dodd on the rampart and had climbed to join him british dodd said without taking his eye from the telescope theyre surveying a route up to the plateau bappoo shaded his eyes and stared down but without a telescope he could not see the group of men it will take them months to build a road up to the hills itll take them two weeks dodd said flatly less you dont know how their engineers work sahib but i do theyll use powder to break through obstacles and a thousand axe men to widen the tracks theyll start their work tomorrow and in a fortnight theyll be running guns up to the hills dodd collapsed the telescope let me go down and break the bastards he demanded no bappoo said he had already had this argument with dodd who wanted to take his cobras down into the foothills and there harass the roadmakers dodd did not want a standup fight a battle of musket line against musket line but instead wanted to raid ambush and scare the enemy he wanted to slow the british work to dishearten the sappers and by such delaying tactics force wellesley to send forage parties far into the countryside where they would be prey to the mahratta horsemen who still roamed the deccan plain bappoo knew dodd was right and that the british road could be slowed by a campaign of harassment but he feared to let the white coated cobras leave the fortress the garrison was already nervous awed by the victories of wellesleys small army and if they saw the cobras march out of the fort then many would think they were being abandoned and the trickle of deserters would become a flood we have to slow them dodd snarled we shall bappoo said i shall send silladars colonel and reward them for every weapon they bring back to the fort but you will stay here and help prepare the de fences he spoke firmly showing that the subject was beyond discussion then offered dodd a gaptoothed smile and gestured towards the palace at the centre of the inner fort come colonel i want to show you something the two men walked through the small houses that surrounded the palace past an arab sentry who protected the palace precincts then through some flowering trees where monkeys crouched dodd could hear the tinkle of the bells where beny singh was playing with his women but that sound faded as the path twisted deeper into the trees the path ended at a rock face that was pierced by an arched wooden door dodd looked up while bappoo unlocked the door and saw that the great rock slab formed the palace foundations and when bappoo thrust back the creaking door he understood that it led into the palace cellars a lantern stood on a shelf just inside the door and there was a pause while bappoo lit its wick come bappoo said and led dodd into the marvelous coolness of the huge low cellar it is rumoured bappoo said that we store the treasures of berar in here and in one sense it is true but they are not the treasures that men usually dream of he stopped by a row of barrels and casually knocked off their lids revealing that the tubs were filled with copper coins no gold or silver bappoo said but money all the same money to hire new mercenaries to buy new weapons and to make a new army bappoo trickled a stream of the newly minted coins through his fingers we have been lax in paying our men he confessed my brother for all his virtues is not generous with his treasury dodd grunted he was not sure what virtues the rajah of berar did possess certainly not valour nor generosity but the rajah was fortunate in his brother for bappoo was loyal and evidently determined to make up for the rajahs shortcomings gold and silver dodd said would buy better arms and more men my brother will not give me gold or silver only copper and we must work with what we have not with what we dream of bappoo put the lids back onto the barrels then edged between them to where rack after rack of muskets stood these colonel he said are the weapons for that new army there were thousands of muskets all brand new and all equipped with bayonets and cartridge boxes some of the guns were locally made copies of french muskets but several hundred looked to dodd to be of british make he lifted one from the racks and saw the tower mark on its lock how did you get these he asked surprised bappoo shrugged we have agents in the british camp they arrange it we meet some of their supply convoys well to the south and pay for their contents it seems there are traitors in the british army who would rather make money than seek victory you buy guns with copper dodd asked scathingly he could not imagine any man selling a tower musket for a handful of copper no bappoo confessed to buy the weapons and the cartridges we need gold so i use my own my brother i trust will repay me one day dodd frowned at the hawkfaced bappoo youre using your money to keep your brother on the throne he asked and though he waited for an answer none came dodd shook his head implying that bappoos nobility was beyond understanding then he cocked and fired the unloaded musket the spark of the flint flashed a sparkle of red light against the stone ceiling a musket in its rack kills no one he said true but as yet we dont have the men to carry these muskets but we will colonel once we have defeated the british the other kingdoms will join us that dodd reflected was true enough scindia dodds erstwhile employer was suing for peace while holkar the most formidable of the mahratta monarchs was staying aloof from the contest but if bappoo did win his victory those chieftains would be eager to share future spoils and not just the other kingdoms bappoo went on but warriors from all india will come to our banner i intend to raise a compoo armed with the best weapons and trained to the very highest standard many i suspect will be sepoys from wellesleys defeated army and they will need a new master when he is dead i thought perhaps you would lead them dodd returned the musket to its rack youll not pay me with copper bappoo bappoo smiled you will pay me with victory colonel and i shall reward you with gold dodd saw some unfamiliar weapons farther down the rack he lifted one and saw it was a hunting rifle the lock was british but the filigree decoration on the stock and barrel was indian youre buying rifles he asked no better weapon for skirmishing bappoo said maybe dodd allowed grudgingly the rifle was accurate but slow to load a small group of men with rifles bappoo said backed up by muskets could be formidable maybe dodd said again then instead of putting the rifle back onto the rack he slung it on his shoulder id like to try it he explained you have ammunition bappoo gestured across the cellar and dodd went and scooped up some cartridges if youve got the cash he called back why not raise your new army now bring it to gawilghur theres no time bappoo said and besides no one will join us now they think the british are beating us so if we are to make our new army colonel then we must first win a victory that will ring through india and that is what we shall do here at gawilghur he spoke very confidently for bappoo like dodd believed gawilghur to be unassailable he led the englishman back to the entrance blew out the lantern and carefully locked the armoury door the two men climbed the slope beside the palace passing a line of servants who carried drinks and sweetmeats to where beny singh whiled away the afternoon as ever when dodd thought of the killadar he felt a surge of anger beny singh should have been organizing the fortresss de fences but instead he frittered away his days with women and liquor bappoo must have divined dodds thoughts for he grimaced my brother likes beny singh they amuse each other do they amuse you dodd asked bappoo paused at the northern side of the palace and there he gazed across the ravine to the outer fort which was garrisoned by his lions of allah i swore an oath to my brother he answered and i am a man who keeps my oaths there must be those dodd said carefully who would rather see you as rajah of course bappoo answered equably but such men are my brothers enemies and my oath was to defend my brother against all his enemies he shrugged we must be content colonel with what fate grants us it has granted me the task of fighting my brothers wars and i shall do that to the best of my ability he pointed to the deep ravine that lay between the outer and the inner forts and there colonel i shall win a victory that will make my brother the greatest ruler of all india the british cannot stop us even if they make their road even if they haul their guns up to the hills even if they make a breach in our walls and even if they capture the outer fort they must still cross that ravine and they cannot do it no one can do it bappoo stared at the steep gorge as if he could already see its rocks soaked in enemy blood who rules that ravine colonel rules india and when we have our victory then we shall unlock the cellar and raise an army that will drive the redcoats not just from berar but from hyderabad from mysore and from madras i shall make my brother emperor of all southern india and you and i colonel shall be his warlords bappoo turned to gaze into the dust smeared immensity of the southern sky it will all belong to my brother he said softly but it will begin here at gawilghur and here dodd suddenly thought it would end for bappoo no man who was willing to endure a feeble wretch like beny singh or protect a cowardly libertine like the rajah deserved to be a warlord of all india no dodd thought he would win his own victory here and then he would strike against bappoo and against beny singh and he would raise his own army and use it to strike terror into the rich southern kingdoms other europeans had done it benoit de boigne had made himself richer than the kings of all christendom while george thomas an illiterate irish sailor had risen to rule a princedom for his widowed mistress dodd saw himself as a new presterjohn he would make a kingdom from the rotting scraps of india and he would rule from a new palace in gawilghur that would be like no other in the world he would have roofs of gold walls of white marble and garden paths made from pearls and men from all india would come to pay him homage he would be lord of gawilghur dodd thought and smiled not bad for a millers son from suffolk but gawilghur was a place to stir dreams for it lifted mens thoughts into the heavens and dodd knew that india above all the lands on gods earth was a place where dreams could come true here a man was either made rich beyond all desire or else became nothing and dodd would not be nothing he would be lord of gawilghur and the terror of india once the redcoats were defeated is this the best you could manage sharpe torrance enquired looking about the main room of the commandeered house no sir sharpe said there was a lovely house just up the road big shady courtyard couple of pools a fountain and a gaggle of dancing girls but i thought you might prefer the view from these windows sarcasm ill becomes an ensign torrance said dropping his saddlebags on the earthen floor indeed very little becomes ensigns sharpe except a humble devotion to serving their betters i suppose the house will have to suffice who is that he shuddered as he stared at the woman whose house he was occupying she lives here sir not now she doesnt get rid of the black bitch and her foul children brick clare wall came in from the sunlight carrying a sack sir im hungry brick find the kitchen we made a late start sharpe torrance explained and missed dinner i imagine thats why the general wants to see you sir sharpe said not because you missed dinner but because the supplies werent here on time torrance stared at sharpe in horror wellesley wants to see me six oclock sir at his tent oh christ torrance threw his cocked hat across the room just because the supplies were a little late twelve hours late sir torrance glared at sharpe then fished a watch from his fob its half past five already god help us cant you brush that coat sharpe he dont want to see me sir just you well hes bloody well going to see both of us clean uniform sharpe hair brushed paws washed face scrubbed sunday best torrance frowned suddenly why didnt you tell me you saved wellesleys life is that what i did sir i mean good god man he must be grateful to you torrance asked sharpe just shrugged you saved his life torrance insisted and that means hes in your debt and you must use the advantage tell him we dont have enough men to run the supply train properly put in a good word for me sharpe and ill repay the favour brick forget the food i need a clean stock boots polished hat brushed and give my dress coat a pressing sergeant hakeswill edged through the door your am mock sir he said to torrance then saw sharpe and a slow grin spread across his face look who it isnt sharpie torrance wheeled on the sergeant mister sharpe is an officer hakeswill in this unit we do observe the proprieties quite forgot myself sir hakeswill said his face twitching on account of being reunited with an old comrade mister sharpe ever so pleased to see you sir lying bastard sharpe said aint officers supposed to observe the properties sir hakeswill demanded of torrance but the captain had gone in search of his native servant who had charge of the luggage hakeswill looked back to sharpe fated to be with you sharpie you stay out of my light obadiah sharpe said or ill slit your throat i cant be killed sharpie cant be killed hakeswills face wrenched itself in a series of twitches it says so in the scriptures he looked sharpe up and down then shook his head ruefully ive seen better things dangling off the tails of sheep i have you aint an officer sharpie youre a bleeding disgrace torrance backed into the house shouting at his servant to drape the windows with muslin then turned and hurried to the kitchen to harry clare he tripped over sharpes pack and swore whose is this mine sharpe said youre not thinking of billeting yourself here are you sharpe good as anywhere sir i like my privacy sharpe find somewhere else torrance suddenly remembered he was speaking to a man who might have influence with wellesley if youd be so kind sharpe i just cant abide being crowded an affliction i know but there it is i need solitude its my nature brick did i tell you to brush my hat and the plume needs a combing sharpe picked up his pack and walked out to the small garden where ahmed was sharpening his new tulwar clare wall followed him into the sunlight muttered something under her breath then sat and started to polish one of torrances boots why the hell do you stay with him sharpe asked she paused to look at sharpe she had oddly hooded eyes that gave her face an air of delicate mystery what choice do i have she asked resuming her polishing sharpe sat beside her picked up the other boot and rubbed it with blackball so whats he going to do if you bugger off she shrugged i owe him money like hell how can you owe him money he brought my husband and me here she said paid our passage from england we agreed to stay three years then charlie died she paused again her eyes suddenly gleaming then sniffed and began to polish the boot obsessively sharpe looked at her she had dark eyes curling black hair and a long upper lip if she was not so tired and miserable he thought she would be a very pretty woman how old are you love she gave him a sceptical glance whos your woman in seringapatam then shes a frenchie sharpe said a widow like you officers widow clare asked sharpe nodded and youre to marry her clare asked nothing like that sharpe said like what then she asked i dont know really sharpe said he spat on the boots flank and rubbed the spittle into the bootblack but you like her clare asked picking the dirt from the boots spur she seemed embarrassed to have posed the question for she hurried on im nineteen she said but nearly twenty then youre old enough to see a lawyer sharpe said you aint indentured to the captain you have to sign papers dont you or make your mark on a paper thats how it was done in the foundling home where they dumped me wanted to make me into a chimney sweep they did bloody hell but if you didnt sign indenture papers you should talk to a lawyer clare paused staring at a sad tree in the courtyards centre that was dying from the drought i wanted to get married a year back she said softly and thats what tom told me he were called tom see a cavalryman he was only a youngster what happened fever she said bleakly but it wouldnt have worked anyway because torrance wouldnt ever let me marry she began polishing the boot again he said hed see me dead first she shook her head but whats the point in seeing a lawyer you think a lawyer would talk to me they like money lawyers do and do you know a lawyer in india that aint in the companys pocket mind you she glanced towards the house to make sure she was not being overheard he hasnt got any money either he gets an allowance from his uncle and his company pay and he gambles it all away but he always seems to find more she paused and what would i do if i walked away she left the question hanging in the warm air then shook her head im miles from bleeding home i dont know he was good to me at first i liked him i didnt know him then you see she half smiled funny isnt it you think because someones a gentleman and the son of a clergyman that they have to be kind but he aint she vigorously brushed the boots tassel and hes been worse since he met that hakeswill i do hate him she sighed just fourteen months to go she said wearily and then ill have paid the debt hell no sharpe said walk away from the bugger she picked up torrances hat and began brushing it i dont have family she said so where would i go youre an orphan she nodded i got work as a house girl in torrances uncles house thats where i met charlie he were a footman then mr henry thats his uncle see said we should join the captains household charlie became captain torrances valet that was a step up and the money was better only we werent paid not once we were in madras he said we had to pay our passage what the devil are you doing sharpe torrance had come into the garden youre not supposed to clean boots youre an officer sharpe tossed the boot at torrance i keep forgetting sir if you must clean boots sharpe start with your own good god man you look like a tinker the generals seen me looking worse sharpe said besides he never did care what men looked like sir so long as they do their job properly i do mine properly torrance bridled at the implication i just need more staff you tell him that sharpe you tell him give me that hat brick were late in fact torrance arrived early at the generals tent and had to kick his heels in the evening sunshine what exactly did the general say when he summoned me he asked sharpe he sent an aide sir captain campbell wanted to know where the supplies were you told him they were coming told him the truth sir which was that i didnt bloody well know where they were oh christ thank you sharpe thank you very much torrance twitched at his sash making the silk fall more elegantly do you know what loyalty is before sharpe could answer the tent flaps were pushed aside and captain campbell ducked out into the sunlight wasnt expecting you sharpe he said genially holding out his hand sharpe shook hands how are you sir busy campbell said you dont have to go in if you dont want he does torrance said sharpe shrugged might as well he said then ducked into the tents yellow light as campbell pulled back the flap the general was in his shirtsleeves sitting behind a table that was covered with major blackistons sketches of the land bridge to gawilghur blackiston was beside him travelstained and tired while an irasciblelooking major of the royal engineers stood two paces behind the table if the general was surprised to see sharpe he showed no sign of it but instead looked back to the drawings how wide is the approach he asked at its narrowest sir about fifty feet blackiston tapped one of the sketches its wide enough for most of the approach two or three hundred yards but just here theres a tank and it squeezes the path cruelly a ravine to the left a tank to the right fall to your death on one side the general said and drown on the other and doubtless the fifty feet between is covered by their guns smothered sir must be twenty heavy cannon looking down the throat of the approach and god knows how much smaller metal plenty wellesley removed the inkwells that had been serving as weights so that the drawings rolled up with a snap not much choice though is there he asked none sir wellesley looked up suddenly his eyes seeming very blue in the tents half light the supply train is twelve hours late captain why he spoke quietly but even sharpe felt a shiver go through him torrance his cocked hat held beneath his left arm was sweating i i he said too nervous to speak properly but then he took a deep breath i was ill sir and unable to supervise properly and my clerk failed to issue the chitties it was a most regrettable occurrence sir and i can assure you it will not happen again the general stared at torrance in silence for a few seconds colonel wallace gave you ensign sharpe as an assistant did sharpe also fail to obey your orders i had sent mister sharpe ahead sir torrance said the sweat was now pouring down his face and dripping from his chin so why did the clerk fail in his duties treachery sir torrance said the answer surprised wellesley as it was meant to he tapped his pencil on the tables edge treachery he asked in a low voice it seemed the clerk was in league with a merchant sir and had been selling him supplies and this morning sir when he should have been issuing the chitties he was employed on his own business and you were too ill to detect his treachery yes sir torrance said almost pleadingly at first sir yes sir wellesley gazed at torrance for a few silent seconds and the captain had the uncomfortable feeling that the blue eyes saw right into his soul so where is this treacherous clerk now captain wellesley asked at last we hanged him sir torrance said and sharpe who had not heard of dilips death stared at him in astonishment the general slapped the table making torrance jump in alarm you seem very fond of hanging captain torrance a necessary remedy for theft sir as you have made plain i sir i the generals voice when he became angry did not become louder but more precise and therefore more chilling the general order mandating summary death by hanging for thievery captain applies to men in uniform kings and company men only it does not apply to civilians does the dead man have family no sir torrance said he did not really know the answer but decided it was better to say no than to prevaricate if he does captain wellesley said softly and if they complain then i shall have no choice but to put you on trial and depend upon it sir that trial will be in the civilian courts i apologize sir torrance said stiffly for my overzealousness the general stayed silent for a few seconds supplies were missing he said after a while yes sir torrance agreed weakly yet you never reported the thefts wellesley said i did not believe you wished to be troubled by every mishap sir torrance said mishap wellesley snapped muskets are stolen and you call that a mishap such mishaps captain torrance lose wars in future you will inform my staff when such depredations are made he stared at torrance for a few seconds then looked at sharpe colonel huddlestone tells me it was you sharpe who discovered the missing supplies all but the muskets sir theyre still missing how did you know where to look captain torrances clerk told me where to buy supplies sir sharpe shrugged i guessed they were the missing items sir wellesley grunted sharpes answer appeared to confirm torrances accusations and the captain gave sharpe a grateful glance wellesley saw the glance and rapped the table demanding torrances attention it is a pity captain that we could not have questioned the merchant before you so summarily executed him may i presume you did interrogate the clerk my sergeant did sir and the wretch confessed to having sold items to naig torrance blushed as he told the lie but it was so hot in the tent and he was sweating so heavily that the blush went unnoticed your sergeant wellesley asked you mean your havildar sergeant sir torrance said i inherited him from captain mackay sir sergeant hakeswill hakeswill the general said in astonishment whats he still doing here he should be back with his regiment he stayed on sir torrance said with two of his men his other two died sir fever and he had no alternative orders sir and he was too useful to let go sir useful wellesley said he had been the commanding officer of the rd hakeswills regiment and he knew the sergeant well he shook his head if you find him useful torrance then he can stay till gawilghurs fallen but then he returns to his regiment youll make sure of that campbell yes sir the aide said but i believe some of the rd are on their way here sir so the sergeant can return with them the rd coming here wellesley asked in surprise i ordered no such thing just a company sir campbell explained i believe headquarters detailed them to escort a convoy doubtless we can make use of them the general said grudgingly is it awkward for you sharpe serving with hakeswill officers who were promoted from the ranks were never expected to serve with their old regiments and wellesley was plainly wondering whether sharpe found his old comrades an embarrassment i daresay youll get by the general said not waiting for an answer you usually do wallace tells me hes recommended you for the rifles yes sir that could suit you sharpe suit you very well in the meantime the more you learn about supplies the better the cold eyes looked back to torrance though it appeared the general was still talking to sharpe there is a misapprehension in this army that supplies are of small importance whereas wars are won by efficient supply more than they are won by acts of gallantry which is why i want no more delays there will be none sir torrance said hastily and if there are wellesley said there will be a court martial you may depend upon that captain major elliott the general spoke to the engineer who until now had been a spectator of torrances discomfiture tell me what you need to build our road major a hundred bullocks elliott said sourly and none of your spavined beasts torrance i want a hundred prime mysore oxen to carry timber and road stone ill need rice every day for a halfbattalion of sepoys and an equivalent number of pioneers of course sir torrance said and ill take him elliott stabbed a finger at sharpe because i need someone in charge of the bullocks who knows what hes doing torrance opened his mouth to protest then sensibly shut it wellesley glanced at isharpe youll attach yourself to major elliott sharpe be with him at dawn tomorrow with the bullocks and you captain torrance will ensure the daily supplies go up the road every dawn and i want no more summary hangings of course not sir torrartce relieved to be let off so lightly ducked his head in an awkward bow good day to you both the general said sourly then watched as the two officers left the tent he rubbed his eyes and stifled a yawn how long to drive the road elliott two weeks the major suggested youve got one week one week the general forestalled elliotts protest good day to you elliott the engineer grumbled as he ducked out into the fading light wellesley grimaced is torrance to be trusted he asked comes from a good family sir blackiston said so did nero as i recall wellesley retorted but at least torrance has got sharpe and even if sharpe wont make a good officer hes got the makings of a decent sergeant he did well to find those supplies very well sir campbell said warmly wellesley leaned back in his chair a flicker of distaste showed on his face as he recalled the terrible moment when he had been unhorsed at assaye he did not remember much of the incident for he had been dazed but he did recall watching sharpe kill with a savagery that had astonished him he disliked being beholden to such a man but the general knew he would not be alive if sharpe had not risked his own life i should never have given sharpe a commission he said ruefully a man like that would have been quite content with a fiscal reward a fungible reward thats what our men want campbell something that can be turned into rum or arrack he appears to be a sober man sir campbell said probably because he cant afford the drink officers messes are damned expensive places campbell as you well know i reward sharpe by plunging him into debt eh and god knows if the rifles are any cheaper i cant imagine they will be he needs something fungible campbell something fungible wellesley turned and rummaged in the saddlebags that were piled behind his chair he brought out the new telescope with the shallow eyepiece that had been a gift from the merchants of madras find a goldsmith in the camp followers campbell and see if the fellow can replace that brass plate with what sir nothing too flowery the general thought because the glass was only going to be pawned to pay mess bills or buy gin in gratitude aw he said and add the date of assaye then give it to sharpe with my compliments its very generous of you sir campbell said taking the glass but perhaps it would be better if you presented it to him maybe maybe blackiston where do we site guns the general unrolled the sketches candles he ordered for the light was fading fast the shadows stretched and joined and turned to night around the british camp candles were lit lanterns hung from ridgepoles and fires fed with bullock dung the picquets stared at shadows in the darkness but some lifting their gaze saw that high above them the tops of the cliffs were still in daylight and there like the home of the gods the walls of a fortress showed deadly black where gawilghur waited their coming chapter the first part of the road was easy enough to build for the existing track wound up the gender slopes of the foothills but even on the first day major elliott was filled with gloom cant do it in a week the engineer grumbled mans mad expects miracles jacobs ladder thats what he wants he cast a morbid eye over sharpes bullocks all of them prime mysore beasts with brightly painted horns from which tassels and small bells hung never did like working with oxen elliott complained bring any elephants i can ask for them sir nothing like an elephant right sharpe load the beasts with small stones and keep following the track till you catch up with me got that elliott hauled himself onto his horse and settled his feet in the stirrups bloody miracles thats what he wants the major growled then spurred onto the track elliott major simons who commanded the halfbattalion of sepoys who guarded the pioneers building the road called in alarm i havent reconnoitred beyond the small hillock the one with the two trees cant wait for your fellows to wake up simons got a road to build in a week cant be done of course but we must look willing pinckney i need a havildar and some stout fellows to carry pegs tell em to follow me captain pinckney the officer in charge of the east india company pioneers spat onto the verge waste of bloody time what is sharpe asked pegging out the route we follow the footpath of course bloody natives have been scurrying up and down these hills for centuries he turned and shouted at a havildar to organize a party to follow elliott up the hill then set the rest of his men to loading the oxens panniers with small stones the road made good progress despite elliotts misgivings and three days after they had begun the pioneers cleared a space among the trees to establish a makeshift artillery park where the siege guns could wait while the rest of the road was forged sharpe was busy and because of that happy he liked simons and pinckney and even elliott proved affable the major had taken wellesleys demands that the road be made in a week as a challenge and he pressed the pioneers hard the enemy seemed to be asleep elliott would ride far ahead to reconnoitre the route and never once saw a mahratta stupid fools elliott said one night beside the fire they could hold us here for months you still shouldnt ride so far ahead of my picquets simons reproved the major stop fussing man elliott said and next morning as usual he rode out in front to survey the days work sharpe was again bringing stones up the road that morning he was walking at the head of his ox train on the wooded stretch above the newly made artillery park the days heat was growing and there was little wind in the thick woods of teak and cork trees that covered the low hills groups of pioneers felled trees where they might obstruct a gun carriages progress and here and there sharpe saw a whitewashed peg showing where elliott had marked the track shots sounded ahead but sharpe took no notice the upland valleys had become a favourite hunting ground for the shikarees who used nets snares and ancient matchlocks to kill hares wild pigs deer quail and partridge that they sold to the officers and sharpe assumed a party of the hunters was close to the track but after a few seconds the firing intensified the musketry was muffled by the thick leaves but for a moment the sound was constant almost at battle pitch before as suddenly as it had erupted it stopped his bullock drivers had halted made nervous by the firing come on sharpe encouraged them none of them spoke english and sharpe had no idea which language they did speak but they were goodnatured men eager to please and they prodded their heavily laden bullocks onwards ahmed had unslung his musket and was peering ahead he suddenly raised the gun to his shoulder and sharpe pushed it down before the boy could pull the trigger theyre ours he told the lad sepoys a dozen sepoys hurried back through the trees major simons was with them and as they came closer sharpe saw the men were carrying a makeshift stretcher made from tree branches and jackets its elliott simons paused by sharpe as his men hurried ahead bloody fool got a chest wound he wont live stupid man was too far forward i told him not to get ahead of the picquets simons took a ragged red handkerchief from his sleeve and wiped the sweat from his face one less engineer sharpe peered at elliott who was blessedly unconscious his face had gone pale and pinkish blood was bubbling at his lips with every laboured breath he wont last the day simons said brutally but i suppose we should get him back to the surgeons where are the enemy sharpe asked they ran simons said half a dozen of the bastards were waiting in ambush they shot elliott took his weapons but ran off when they saw us three shikarees died that afternoon ambushed in the high woods and that night when the roadbuilders camped in one of the grassy upland valleys some shots were fired from a neighbouring wood the bullets hissed overhead but none found a target the picquets blazed back until a havildar shouted at them to hold their fire captain pinckthey shook his head i thought it was too good to last he said gloomily itll be slow work now he poked the fire around which a halfdozen officers were sitting major simons grinned if i was the enemy he said id attack mister sharpes oxen instead of attacking engineers if they cut our supply line theyd do some real damage theres no point in shooting engineers pinckney agreed we dont need royal engineers anyway weve been making roads for years the fellows in the blue coats just get in the way mind you theyll still send us another if there are any left sharpe said the campaign had been fatal for the engineers two had died blowing up the enemy guns at assaye another three were fevered and now elliott was either dying or already dead theyll find one pinckney grumbled if theres something the kings army doesnt need then you can be sure theyve got a healthy supply of it the company armys better sharpe asked it is major simons said we work for a sterner master than you sharpe its called bookkeeping you fight for victories we fight for profits leadenhall street wont pay for fancy engineers in blue coats not when they can hire plain men like us at half the cost they could afford me sharpe said cheap as they come i am next morning simons threw a strong picquet line ahead of the work parties but no mahrattas opposed the pioneers who were now widening the track where it twisted up a bare and steep slope that was littered with rocks the track was ancient worn into the hills by generations of travellers but it had never been used by wagons let alone by heavy guns merchants who wanted to carry their goods up the escarpment had used the road leading directly to the fortresss southern gate while this track which looped miles to the east of gawilghur was little more than a series of paths connecting the upland valleys where small farms had been hacked from the jungle it was supposed to be tiger country but sharpe saw none of the beasts at dawn he had returned to deogaum to collect rice for the sepoys and then spent the next four hours climbing back to where the pioneers were working he was nervous at first both of tigers and of an enemy ambush but the worst he suffered was a series of drenching rainstorms that swept up the mountains the rain stopped when he reached the working parties who were driving the road through a small ridge pinckney was setting a charge of gunpowder that would loosen the rock and let him cut out a mile of looping track his servant brought a mug of tea that sharpe drank sitting on a rock he stared southwards watching the veils of grey rain sweep across the plain did wellesley say anything about sending a new engineer major simons asked him i just collected the rice sir sharpe said i didnt see the general i thought you were supposed to be a friend of his simons observed sourly everyone thinks that sharpe said except him and me but you saved his life sharpe shrugged i reckon so either that or stopped him getting captured and killed a few men doing it i hear sharpe looked at the tall simons with some surprise for he had not realized that his exploit had become common knowledge dont remember much about it i suppose not still simons said a feather in your cap i dont think wellesley thinks that sharpe said youre a kings officer now sharpe simons said enviously as an east india company officer he was trapped in the companys cumbersome system of promotion if wellesley thrives hell remember you sharpe laughed i doubt it sir he aint the sort he turned southwards again because ahmed had called a warning in arabic the boy was pointing downhill and sharpe stood to see over the crown of the slope far beneath him where the road passed through one of the lush valleys a small party of horsemen was approaching and one of the riders was in a blue coat friends ahmed he called looks like the new engineer sharpe said to simons pinckney will be delighted simons said sarcastically pinckney came back to inspect the approaching party through a telescope and spat when he saw the blue coat of the royal engineers another interfering bastard to teach me how to suck eggs he said so lets blow the charge before he gets here otherwise hell tell us were doing it all wrong a crowd of grinning sepoys waited expectantly about the end of the fuse pinckney struck a light put it to the quick match then watched the sparks smoke their way towards the distant charge the smoke trail vanished in grass and it seemed to sharpe that it must have extinguished itself but then there was a violent coughing sound and the small ridge heaved upwards soil and stone flew outwards in a cloud of filthy smoke the sepoys cheered the explosion had seemed small to sharpe but when the smoke and dust cleared he could see that the ridge now had a deep notch through which the road could climb to the next high valley the pioneers went to shovel the loosened earth away and sharpe sat again ahmed squatted beside him what am i going to do with you sharpe asked i go to england ahmed said carefully you wont like it there cold as buggery cold freezing sharpe mimicked a shiver but plainly it meant nothing to the arab boy i go to england ahmed insisted a halfhour later the new engineer appeared just beneath sharpe he wore a widebrimmed straw hat rode a grey horse and was trailed by three servants who led pack mules laden with luggage amongst which sharpe could see a tripod a surveyors level and a vast leather tube that he guessed held a telescope the engineer took off his hat and fanned his face as he rounded the last bend pon my soul he said cheerfully but thank god the horse does the climbing and not me pinckney had come back to greet the engineer and held out his hand as the bluecoated major slid from his saddle captain pinckney sir he introduced himself pinckney eh the whitehaired engineer said cheerfully i knew a pinckney in hertfordshire he made plough shares and damn fine ones too my uncle joshua sir then you must be hughs boy yes an honour he shook pinckneys hand vigorously major john stokes at your service though i dont suppose you need me do you you must have built more roads than i ever did major stokes looked towards sharpe who had stood and was now smiling good god in his blessed heaven stokes said it cant be but it is my dear sharpe my dear mister sharpe i heard all about your commission couldnt be more pleased my dear sharpe an officer eh sharpe smiled broadly onj an ensign sir every ladder has a first rung sharpe stokes said in gentle reproof of sharpes modesty then held out his hand we shall be mess mates as they say in the navy well i never mess mates indeed and with a pinckney too hugh pinckney forges mill gears sharpe never seen a man make bettertoothed wheels in all my life he clasped sharpes hand in both of his they grubbed me out of seringapatam sharpe can you believe that told me all the other engineers had the pox and summoned me here just in time to discover that poor elliotts dead i suppose i shouldnt complain its awfully good for my promotion prospects he let go of sharpes hand oh and by the way i travelled north with some of your old comrades captain charles morris and his company not the most charming creature is he not one of my favourites sir sharpe admitted good god bloody morris was here first hakeswill then morris he didnt want to come stokes said but higher powers deemed that i had to be protected from the ungodly so they insisted on an infantry escort he turned as a rattle of gunfire sounded higher up the escarpment bless my soul is that musketry ticquet line sir pinckney explained the enemy harasses us but theyre not thrusting home they should they should a battalion of skirmishers in these hills could keep us at bay for a month well i never sharpe an ensign the major turned back to pinckney sharpe and i ran the armoury at seringapatam for four years you ran it sir sharpe said i was just your sergeant best sergeant i ever had stokes told pinckney enthusiastically and its not sir he turned to sharpe but john he grinned at sharpe they were four good years eh best well ever have i daresay and here you are now an officer my dear fellow i couldnt be more overjoyed he sniffed the air been blowing things up pinckney cutting through that ridge sir i trust you dont mind that we didnt wait for you mind why should i mind you go ahead dear fellow im sure you know your business better than i do god knows why they need an engineer here at all probably to be decorative eh still ill make myself useful i thought i might map the escarpment hasnt been done you see of course pinckney if you need advice just ask away but ill probably be at sixes and sevens groping for an answer he beamed at the delighted pinckney then looked at the rough country through which the road led this is fine landscape isnt it such a relief after the plains it reminds me of scotland there are tigers here major sharpe said and theres all kinds of fierce things in scotland too sharpe i was once posted to fort william and might as well have been in darkest china it was worse than newfoundland and speaking of america sharpe that young lady you sent me has travelled there extraordinary thing to do i thought and i advised her to abandon the whole wretched idea there are bears i told her fierce bears but she wouldnt be persuaded simone sir sharpe asked at first not believing his ears then feeling a dreadful premonition a charming creature i thought and to be widowed so young stokes tutted and shook his head she went to a fortune teller one of those naked fellows who make funny faces in the alley by the hindu temple and says she was advised to go to a new world whatever next eh i thought she was waiting for me sir sharpe said waiting for you good lord no gone to louisiana she says she stayed in my house for a week i moved out of course to stop any scandal and then she travelled to madras with mrs pennington remember charlotte pennington the clergymans widow i cant think the two of them will get along but your friend said the fortune teller was adamant and so she chose to go the major was eager to give sharpe the rest of the news from seringapatam the armoury was closing down he said now that the frontier of the britishheld territory was so much farther north but stokes had kept himself busy dismantling the towns inner fortifications very ill made sharpe disgraceful work quite disgraceful walls crumbled to the touch but sharpe was not listening he was thinking of simone she had gone by now she was probably in madras and maybe already on board a ship and she had taken his jewels only a few of them true but enough he touched the seam of his jacket where a good many of the tippoos other jewels were hidden did madame joubert leave any message he asked stokes when the major paused to draw breath what did he hope sharpe wondered that simone would want him to join her in america a message none sharpe too busy to write i daresay shes a remarkably wealthy woman did you know she bought half the raw silk in town hired a score of bearers and off she went every officer in town was leaving a card for her but she didnt have the time of day for any of them off to louisiana stokes suddenly frowned what is the matter sharpe you look as if youve seen a ghost youre not sickening are you no no its just i thought she might have written oh i see you were sweet on her stokes shook his head i feel for you sharpe pon my soul i do but what hope could you have a woman with her sort of fortune doesnt look at fellows like us pon my soul no shes rich shell marry high sharpe or as high as a woman can in french america her sort of fortune indeed simone had no fortune she had been penniless when sharpe met her but he had trusted her god damn the frog bitch stolen a small fortune it doesnt matter he told stokes but somehow it did simones betrayal was like a stab to the belly it was not so much the jewels for he had kept the greater part of the plunder but the broken promises he felt anger and pity and above all a fool a great fool he turned away from stokes and stared down the track to where a dozen oxen escorted by two companies of sepoys were trudging towards him ive got work coming he said not wanting to discuss simone any further i passed those fellows on my way stokes said carrying powder i think i do like blowing things up so just what do you do here sharpe i keep the pioneers supplied with material sir and sign in all the convoys hope it leaves you time to help me sharpe you and me together again eh itll be like the old days thatd be good sir sharpe said with as much enthusiasm as he could muster then he walked down the track and pointed to where the oxdrivers should drop their barrels of gunpowder the men crowded about him with their chitties and he pulled out a pencil and scrawled his initials in the corner of each one thus confirming that they had completed and were owed for one journey the last man also handed sharpe a sealed paper with his name written in a fine copperplate hand from the clerk sahib the man said the phrase plainly much practised for he spoke no other english sharpe tore the seal off as he walked back up the hill the letter was not from the clerk at all but from torrance bloody hell he cursed what is it stokes asked a man called torrance sharpe complained hes in charge of the bullocks he wants me back at deogaum because he reckons there are forged chitties in the camp in the far south of india stokes said they call them shits sharpe blinked at the major sorry sir you mustnt call me sir sharpe pon my soul yes i had a tamil servant who was forever asking me to sign his shits had me all in a dither at first i can tell you sharpe crumpled torrances note into a ball why the hell cant torrance sort out his own shits he asked angrily but he knew why torrance was scared of another meeting with wellesley which meant the captain would now follow the rules to the letter it wont take long stokes said not if you take my horse but keep her to a steady walk richard because shes tired and have her rubbed down and watered while youre sorting out the shits sharpe was touched by stokess generosity are you sure what are friends for go on richard on horseback youll be home for supper ill have my cook brew up one of those mussallas you like so much sharpe left his pack with stokess baggage the big ruby and a score of other stones were in the pack and sharpe was half tempted to carry it to deogaum and back but if he could not trust stokes who could he trust he tried to persuade ahmed to stay behind and keep an eye on the baggage but the boy refused to be parted from sharpe and insisted on trotting along behind the horse stokes wont hurt you sharpe told ahmed im your havildar ahmed insisted hefting his musket and peering about the deserted landscape for enemies there was none in sight but ahmeds gesture reminded sharpe of elliotts death and he wondered if he should have waited for the ox convoy to return to deogaum for the convoys all had escorts of sepoys or mercenary horsemen he was tempted to kick the horse into a trot but he resisted the impulse the danger was more acutc once he reached the lower hills for mahratta horsemen were forever probing the perimeter of the british camp and being chased away by cavalry patrols twice he saw horsemen in the distance but neither group took any notice of sharpe who was ready to haul ahmed up onto the horse and then ride for his life if he was threatened he did not relax until he met a patrol of madrassi cavalry under the command of a company lieutenant who escorted him safely to the encampment deogaum was now surrounded by a great spread of tents and make shift booths homes to soldiers and camp followers a dancing bear was performing for a crowd of infantrymen and the animal reminded sharpe of major stokess words about america simone it was his own damn fault he should never have trusted the woman the thought of his own foolishness plunged sharpe into a black mood that was not helped by the sight of two redcoat privates lounging on a bench outside torrances quarters neither man moved as sharpe slid from the horse he gave the reins to ahmed and mimed that the boy should rub the grey mare down with straw and then water her the two redcoats shifted slightly as if acknowledging sharpes presence but neither man stood he knew both of them indeed not so very long ago he had marched in the same ranks as these two men whose coats had the red facings of the rd kendrick and lowry they were called and two worse characters it would have been hard to find in any light company both were cronies of hakeswills and both had been among the small party hakeswill had brought north in his failed attempt to arrest sharpe on your feet sharpe said kendrick glanced at lowry who looked back at kendrick and the two made faces at each other as though they were surprised by sharpes demands they hesitated just long enough to make their insolence plain but not quite long enough to make it punishable then stood to attention is that your orse mister sharpe kendrick asked stressing the mister sharpe ignored the question and pushed into the house to find a new clerk sitting behind the table he was a young goodlooking indian with oiled hair and a very white robe he wore an apron to protect the robe from ink spots you have business sahib he asked brusquely with captain torrance the captain is ill the indian whose english was very good smiled hes always bloody ill sharpe said and walked past the protesting clerk to push open the inner door torrance was in his hammock smoking his hookah and dressed in an indian gown embroidered with dragons while sergeant hakeswill was sitting at a small table counting a pile of coins sharpe torrance sounded surprised hakeswill looking equally surprised sullenly stood to attention wasnt expecting you till this evening torrance said im here sharpe said unnecessarily so it is apparent unless youre a spectre sharpe had no time for small talk youve got a problem with chitties he asked abruptly tiresome isnt it torrance seemed uncomfortable very tiresome sergeant you have business elsewhere ive got duties sir hakeswill snapped attend to them dear fellow sir hakeswill stiffened turned to the right then marched from the room so how are you sharpe keeping busy torrance had swung himself off the hammock and now scooped the coins into a leather bag i hear poor elliott died shot sir torrance shuddered as if the news was personal so very sad he sighed then retied the belt of his elaborate gown i never did thank you sharpe for being so supportive with sir arthur sharpe had not thought he had been supportive at all i just told the truth sir my father would be proud of you and im deeply grateful to you it seems dilip was in league with naig he was torrance heard the disbelief in sharpes voice no other explanation is there he said curtly someone must have been telling naig which convoys carried the vital supplies and it had to be dilip i must say i thought wellesley was damned obtuse there really is no point in having scruples about hanging natives there isnt exactly a shortage of them is there he smiled theres something wrong with the chitties sharpe demanded rudely so there is sharpe so there is our new clerk discovered the discrepancies hes a smart young fellow sajit the young clerk came into the room clasped his hands and offered torrance a slight bow sahib this is ensign sharpe sajit hes by way of being my deputy and thus as much your sahib as i am sajit offered sharpe a bow i am honoured sahib perhaps you could show mister sharpe the problematical chitties sajit torrance suggested sajit went back to the outer room and returned a moment later with a pile of the grubby paper slips he placed them on the table then invited sharpe to inspect them all the chitties had sharpes initials in the bottom righthand corner most of them in pencil but some had been initialled in ink and sharpe set those aside i didnt sign any of those he said confidently i dont have a pen and ink you were right sajit torrance said you honour me sahib sajit said and every chitty is a stolen anna torrance said so we have to discover which bullock men gave us the false ones thats the problem sharpe theyve got names on them sharpe said pointing at the slips of paper you hardly needed to drag me down here to tell you who they were issued to please dont be tedious sharpe torrance said plaintively ever since the general put a shot across our bows i am forced to be particular and the names mean nothing nothing look he scooped up the chit ties at least a dozen are assigned to ram whoever ram is there are probably a dozen rams out there what i want you to do sharpe is go round the encampment with sajit and point out which men have visited the road sajit can then identify which bullock men are submitting false claims sharpe frowned why doesnt sajit just identify which men were ordered up the mountain they must have got their chitties from him i want to be sure sharpe i want to be sure torrance pleaded my testimony sahib would not be believed sajit put in but no one would doubt the word of an english officer bloody hell sharpe said the last thing he felt like doing was wandering about the bullock camp identifying drivers he was not sure he could do it anyway so why not summon the bullock men here he demanded the bad ones would run away sahib rather than come sajit said best to ambush them in their encampment sharpe torrance said ill do my best sharpe grunted i knew you would torrance seemed relieved do it now sharpe and perhaps you could join me for a late dinner say at half past one sharpe nodded then went back into the sunlight to wait for sajit kendrick and lowry had vanished presumably with hakeswill ahmed had found a bucket of water and stokess mare was drinking greedily you can stay here ahmed sharpe said but the boy shook his head youre my bleeding shadow sharpe grumbled shadow sharpe pointed to his own shadow shadow ahmed grinned all white teeth in a grubby face he liked the word sharpes shadow he said sajit emerged from the house with a pink silk parasol that he offered to sharpe sharpe refused and the clerk who had discarded his apron gratefully shaded himself from the fierce midday sun i am sorry to be troublesome to you sahib he said humbly no trouble sharpe said dourly following the clerk ahmed came behind leading the majors mare the boy need not come sajit insisted glancing behind at the horse which seemed to alarm him you tell him that sharpe said but dont blame me if he shoots you hes very fond of shooting people sajit hurried on i think i know sahib which is the bad man who is cheating us he is a fellow from mysore he gave me many chitties and swore you signed them in front of him if you would be so kind as to confirm or deny his story we shall be finished then lets find the bugger and be done with it sajit led sharpe through the bullock lines where the wealthier herdsmen had erected vast dark and sagging tents women slapped bread dough beside small oxdung fires and more piles of the fuel dried in the sun beside each tent entrance sharpe looked for naigs big green tents but he could not see them and he assumed that whoever had inherited naigs business had packed up and gone there sahib that is the bad mans tent sajit nervously led sharpe towards a brown tent that stood slightly apart from the others he stopped a few paces from the entrance and lowered his voice he is called ranjit sahib so fetch the bugger sharpe said and ill tell you if hes lying or not sajit seemed nervous of confronting ranjit for he hesitated but then plucked up his courage collapsed the parasol and dropped to the ground to crawl into the tent which sagged so deeply that the doorway was scarce higher than a mans knee sharpe heard the murmur of voices then sajit backed hurriedly out of the low fringed entrance he slapped at the dust on his white robes then looked at sharpe with a face close to tears he is a bad man sahib he will not come out i told him a sahib was here to see him but he used rude words ill take a look at the bastard sharpe said thats all you need isnt it for me to say whether ive seen him or not please sahib sajit said and gestured at the tents entrance sharpe took off his hat so it would not tangle with the canvas hoisted the tents entrance as high as he could then ducked low under the heavy brown cloth and knew instantly that it was a trap and understood almost in the same instant that he could do nothing about it the first blow struck his forehead and his vision exploded in streaks of lightning and shuddering stars he fell backwards out into the sunlight and someone instantly grabbed one of his ankles and began pulling him into the deep shadow he tried to kick tried to push himself against the tents sides but another hand seized his second leg another blow hammered the side of his skull and mercifully he knew nothing more hes got a thick skull our sharpie hakeswill said with a grin he prodded sharpes prone body and got no reaction fast asleep he is the sergeants face twitched he had hit sharpe with the heavy brassbound butt of a musket and he was amazed that sharpes skull was not broken there was plenty of blood in his black hair and he would have a bruise the size of a mango by nightfall but his skull seemed to have taken the two blows without splintering he always was a thickheaded bugger hakeswill said now strip him strip him kendrick asked when his body is found hakeswill explained patiently if it is found and you cant rely on bleeding blackamoors to do a proper job and hide it we dont want no one seeing hes a british officer do we not that he is an officer hes just a jumpedup bit of muck so strip him then tie his hands and feet and cover his eyeballs kendrick and lowry jerked and tugged sharpes coat free then handed the garment to hakeswill who ran his fingers along the hems got it he exulted when he felt the lumps in the cloth he took out h a knife slit the coat and the two privates stared in awe as he eased the glittering jewels out of the tightly sewn seam it was dark in the shadowed tent but the stones gleamed bright get on with it hakeswill said the rest of his clothes off what are you doing sajit had sidled into the tent and now stared at the jewels none of your bleeding business hakeswill said you have jewels sajit asked hakeswill slid out his bayonet and stabbed it at sajit checking the lunge a fraction before the blade would have punctured the clerks neck the jewels aint your business sajit the jewels are my business your business is sharpie got it i agreed to give him to your bleeding uncle but i gets what he carries my uncle will pay well for good stones sajit said your uncle jamas a bleeding monkey whod cheat me soon as fart at me so forget the bleeding stones theyre mine hakeswill thrust the first handful into a pocket and started searching the rest of sharpes clothes he slit open all the seams then cut sharpes boots apart to discover a score of rubies hidden in the folded boottops they were small rubies scarce bigger than peas and hakeswill was looking for one large ruby i saw it i did the bloody tippoo had it on his hat large as life look in his hair kendrick obediently ran his fingers through sharpes bloodencrusted hair nothing there sarge turn the bugger over and have a look you know where not me dont be so bloody squeamish and tie his hands fast now you dont want the sod waking up do you the clothes and boots yielded sixtythree stones there were rubies emeralds sapphires and four small diamonds but no large ruby hakeswill frowned surely sharpe would not have sold the ruby still he consoled himself there was a fortune here and he could not resist putting all the stones together on a mat and staring at them i do like a bit of glitter he breathed as his fingers greedily touched the jewels he put ten of the smaller stones in one pile another ten in a second and pushed the two piles towards kendrick and lowry thats your cut boys keep you in whores for the rest of your lives that will perhaps i will tell my uncle about your stones sajit said staring at the jewels i expect you will hakeswill said and so bleeding what i aint as dozy as sharpie you wont catch me then maybe i shall tell captain torrance sajit had positioned himself close to the entrance so that he could flee if hakeswill attacked him captain torrance likes wealth likes it too much hakeswill thought and if torrance knew about the stones he would make hakeswills life hell until he yielded a share the sergeants face juddered in a series of uncontrollable twitches youre a bright lad sajit aint you he said you might be nothing but a bleeding heathen blackamoor but youve got more than bullock dung for brains aint you here he tossed sajit three of the stones that keeps your tongue quiet and if it dont ill cut it out and have a feed on it partial to a plate of tongue i am nice piece of tongue knob of butter and some gravy proper food that he pushed the rest of the stones into his pocket then stared broodingly at sharpes naked trussed body he had more hakeswill said with a frown i know he had more the sergeant suddenly clicked his fingers what about his pack what pack lowry asked the bleeding pack he carries which he shouldnt being an officer which he aint wheres his pack the privates shrugged sajit frowned he had no pack when he came to the captains house youre sure he came on a horse lowry said helpfully it were a grey horse and he didnt have no pack so wheres the horse hakeswill demanded angrily we should look in its saddlebags lowry frowned trying to remember a bleeding kid had it he said at last so wheres the kid he ran off sajit said ran off hakeswill said threateningly why he saw you hit him sajit said i saw it he fell out of the tent there was blood on his face you shouldnt have hit him till he was right inside the tent kendrick said chidingly shut your bloody face hakeswill said then frowned so where did the kid run away sajit said i chased him but he climbed onto the horse kid dont speak english kendrick said helpfully how the hell do you know that cos i talked to him and whos going to believe a heathen black kid what dont speak english lowry asked hakeswills face was racked by a quick series of twitches he suspected he was safe lowry was right who would believe the kid even so the sergeant wished that jamas men were coming earlier to fetch sharpe jama himself had gone away from the camp reckoning that if he was going to murder a british officer then it was best done a long way from the british army hakeswill had warned jama not to expect sharpe until the evening and now he had to guard him until dusk i told you to put a bandage on his eyes hakeswill snapped dont want him to see us it dont matter if he does kendrick said he aint going to see the dawn is he got more lives than a basketful of bleeding cats that one hakeswill said if i had any sense id slit his throat now no sajit said he was promised to my uncle and your uncles paying us yes that too is agreed sajit said hakeswill stood and walked to sharpes unconscious body i put those stripes on his back he said proudly lied through my teeth i did and had sharpie flogged now ill have him killed he remembered how sharpe had flung him among the tigers and his face twitched as he recalled the elephant trying to crush him to death and in his sudden rage he kicked at sharpe and went on kicking until kendrick hauled him away if you kill him sarge kendrick said then the blackies wont pay us will they hakeswill let himself be pulled away so how will your uncle kill him he asked sajit his jet tis will do it ive seen them bastards at work hakeswill said in a tone of admiration just make it slow make it slow and make it bleeding painful it will be slow sajit promised and very painful my uncle is not a merciful man but i am hakeswill said i am because im letting another man have the pleasure of killing sharpie he spat at sharpe dead by dawn sharpie youll be down with old nick where you ought to be he settled against one of the tent poles and trickled jewels from one palm to the other flies crawled among the crusting blood in sharpes hair the ensign would be dead by dawn and hakeswill was a rich man revenge the sergeant decided was sweet as honey ahmed saw sharpe fall back from the tent entrance saw blood bright on his forehead then watched as hands seized sharpe and dragged him into the deep shadows then sajit the clerk with the pink umbrella turned towards him boy he snapped come here ahmed pretended not to understand though he understood well enough that he was a witness to something deeply wrong he backed away tugging major stokess mare with him he let the musket slip down from his shoulder and sajit seeing the threat suddenly rushed at him but ahmed was even faster he jumped up to sprawl across the saddle and without bothering to seat himself properly kicked the horse into motion the startled mare leaped away as ahmed hauled himself onto her back the stirrups were too long for him but ahmed had been raised with horses and could have ridden the mare bareback blindfolded and back to front he swerved southwards galloping between tents fires and grazing bullocks and leaving sajit far behind a woman shouted a protest as he nearly galloped over her children he slowed the mare as he reached the edge of the encampment and looked back to see that he had left sajit far behind what the hell should he do he knew no one in the british camp he looked up at the high summit where gawilghur just showed he supposed his old comrades in manu bappoos lions of allah were up there but his uncle with whom he had travelled from arabia was dead and buried in argaums black earth he knew other soldiers in the regiment but he also feared them those other soldiers wanted ahmed to be their servant and not just to cook for them and clean their weapons sharpe alone had shown him friendliness and sharpe now needed help but ahmed did not know how to provide it he thought about the problem as he knotted the stirrup leathers the plump redfaced and whitehaired man in the hills had been friendly but how was ahmed to talk to him he decided he ought to try and so he turned the horse planning to ride her all about the camp perimeter and then back up the road into the hills but an officer of the camp picquets saw him the man was riding a horse and he spurred it close to ahmed and noted the british saddle cloth what are you doing boy he asked the officer presumed ahmed was exercising the horse but ahmed took fright at the challenge and kicked back thief the officer shouted and gave chase stop thief a sepoy turned with his musket and ahmed nudged the horse so that she ran the man down there was a group of houses close by and ahmed turned towards them jumped a garden wall thumped through some beds of vegetables jumped another wall ducked under some fruit trees jumped a hedge and splashed through a muddy pond before kicking the horse up a bank and into some trees the officer had not dared follow him through the gardens but ahmed could hear the hue and cry beyond the houses he patted the mares neck as she threaded through the trees then curbed her at the woods edge there was about a halfmile of open country then more thick woods that promised safety if only the tired mare could make the distance without faltering if allah wills it ahmed said then kicked the horse into a gallop his pursuers were well behind but they saw him break cover and now a dozen horsemen were chasing him someone fired at him he heard the musket shot but the ball went nowhere near him he leaned over the mane and just let the horse run he looked back once and saw the pursuers bunching in his path and then he was in the trees and he twisted northwards cut back west then went north again going ever deeper into the woods until at last he slowed the blowing horse so that the sound of her thumping hooves would not betray him he listened he could hear other horses blundering through the leaves but they were not coming any closer and then he began to wonder if it would not be better to let himself be caught after all for surely someone among the british would speak his language maybe if he went all the way to where the men were making the road in the hills he would be too late to help sharpe he felt miserable utterly unsure what he should do and then he decided he must go back and find help within the encampment and so he turned the horse back towards his pursuers and saw a musket pointing straight at his throat the man holding the musket was an indian and had one of the spiralling brass helmets that the mahrattas wore he was a cavalryman but he had picketed his horse a few yards away and had crept up on ahmed on foot the man grinned ahmed wondered if he should just kick the tired mare and risk his luck but then another mahratta stepped from the leaves and this one held a curved tulwar a third man appeared and then more men came all mounted to surround him and ahmed who knew he had panicked and failed wept it seemed to dodd that prince manu bappoos policy of rewarding freebooters with cash for weapons captured from the british was failing miserably so far they had fetched in three ancient matchlocks that must have belonged to shikarees a broken musket of local manufacture and a fine pistol and sword that had been taken from an engineer officer no scabbard for the sword of course but the two trophies so far as dodd was concerned were the only evidence that the mahrattas had tried to stop the british approach he pestered manu bappoo pleading to be allowed to take his cobras down to where the pioneers were driving the road but the rajahs brother adamantly refused to let dodds men leave the fortress dodd himself was allowed to leave but only to exercise his horse which he did each day by riding west along the brink of the plateau he did not go far there was a tempting price on his head and though no enemy cavalry had been seen on the plateau since the engineer had made his reconnaissance dodd still feared that he might be captured and so he only rode until he could see the british works far beneath him then protected by a handful of bappoos horsemen he would stare through a telescope at the antlike figures labouring so far below he watched the road widen and lengthen and one morning he saw that two battalions of infantry had camped in one of the high valleys and next day he saw the beginnings of an artillery park three guns a forage cart a spare wheel wagon and four ammunition limbers he cursed bappoo knowing that his cobras could destroy that small park and hurl the british into dazed confusion yet the prince was content to let the enemy climb the escarpment unopposed the road was being remade yet even so it was still steep enough in places to need a hundred men to haul one gun yet day by day dodd saw the number of guns increase in the artillery park then inch up the hill and he knew it would not be long before the british reached the plateau and their besieging forces would seal off the narrow isthmus of rock that led from the cliffs to the great fortress and still manu bappoo made no proper effort to harry the redcoats we shall stop them here the prince told dodd here and he would gesture at gawilghurs walls but william dodd was not so sure that the redcoats would be stopped so easily bappoo might be convinced of the fortresss strength but bappoo knew nothing of modern siege craft each morning as he returned from his excursion along the cliff top dodd would dismount as he reached the isthmus and give his horse to one of his escort so that he could walk the attackers route he tried to see the fortress as the redcoats would see it tried to anticipate where their attack would come and how it would be made it was he had to admit a brutal place to attack two great walls protected the outer fort and though the british could undoubtedly breach those walls with cannon fire the two ramparts stood on a steep slope so that the attackers would need to fight their way uphill to where the defenders would be waiting among the ruins of the breaches and those breaches would be flanked by the massive round bastions that were too big to be collapsed by the twelve or eighteenpounder guns dodd expected the british to deploy the bastions would spit round shot musket balls and rockets down into the british who would be struggling towards the nearer breach their approach route getting ever narrower until it was finally constricted by the vast tank of water that blocked most of the approach dodd walked the route obsessively and could almost feel sorry for the men who would have to do it under fire a hundred paces from the fort where the defenders fire would be most lethal the attackers would be squeezed between the reservoir and the cliff edge compressed into a space just twenty paces wide dodd stood in that space each day and stared up at the double walls and counted the artillery pieces twentytwo cannon were pointing at him and when the redcoats came those barrels would be loaded with canister and besides those heavy guns there was a mass of smaller weapons the murderers and spitfires that could be held by one man and which could blast out a fistful of stone scraps or pistol balls true the british would have destroyed some of the larger guns but the barrels could be mounted on new carriages and re sited behind the vast bastions so that the attackers if they even succeeded in climbing up to the breach would be enfiladed by cannon fire and to reach that far they would need to fight uphill against bappoos arabs and against the massed musketry of the garrison it was a prospect so daunting that prince manu bappoo expected most of the attackers would sheer away from the breaches and run to the delhi gate the outer forts northern entrance that gate would undoubtedly have been shattered by british cannon fire but once inside its arch the attackers would find themselves in a trap the road inside the gate curled up beside the wall with another great wall outside it so that anyone on the cobbles was dwarfed by the stone ramparts on either side and those would be lined with men firing down or else throwing the great rocks that bappoo had ordered piled onto the fire steps inch by bloody inch the redcoats would fight their way up the narrow road between the walls only to turn the corner to see an even greater gate standing in front of them and one moreover that could not be reached by the besiegers cannon fire thus bappoo reckoned the british assault would be thwarted dodd was not so sure the prince was right in thinking that there was no way in through the delhi gate but dodd suspected the breaches would be less formidable he had begun to see weaknesses in the ancient walls old cracks that were half hidden by weeds and lichen and he knew the skill of the british gunners the wall would break easily and that meant the breaches would be big and wide and dodd reckoned the british would fight their way through it might be a hard fight but they would win it and that meant the british would capture the outer fort but dodd did not express that opinion to bappoo nor did he urge the prince to build an earthen glacis outside the wall to soak up the fire of the breaching batteries such a glacis would delay the british for days even weeks but dodd encouraged the prince to believe that the outer fort was impregnable for in that misapprehension lay dodds opportunity manu bappoo had once told dodd that the outer fort was a trap an enemy if they captured the outer fort would think their battle won but then they would come to gawilghurs central ravine and find a second even greater fort waiting on its far side but for dodd the outer fort was manu bappoos trap if manu bappoo lost the outer fort then he like the enemy would have to cross the ravine and climb to the inner fort and it was there that dodd commanded and try as dodd might he could see no weaknesses in the inner forts de fences neither manu bappoo nor the british could ever cross the ravine not if dodd opposed them the inner fort was quite separate from the outer no wall joined them only a track that dropped steeply to the bed of the ravine and then climbed even more steeply to the intricate gateway of the inner fort dodd used that track each day and he tried to imagine himself as an attacker twenty more guns faced him from the inner forts single wall as he descended the ravine and none of those guns would have been dismounted by cannon fire muskets would be pouring their shot down into the rocky ravine and rockets would be slashing bloodily through the british ranks the redcoats would die here like rats being pounded in a bucket and even if some did survive to climb the track towards the gate they would only reach gawilghurs last horror that horror was the entrance where four vast gates barred the inner fort four gates set one after another in a steep passage that was flanked by towering walls there was no other way in even if the british breached the inner forts wall it would not help for the wall was built on top of the precipice which formed the southern side of the ravine and no man could climb that slope and hope to survive the only way in was through the gate and wellesley dodd had learned did not like lengthy sieges he had escaladed ahmednuggur surprising its defenders by sending men with ladders against the unbreached walls and dodd was certain that wellesley would similarly try to rush the inner fort he could not approach the wall perched on its cliff so he would be forced to send his men into the ghastly entrance that twisted as it climbed and for every steep step of the way between each of the four great gates they would be pounded by muskets crushed by stones blasted by cannon and savaged by rockets dropped from the parapets it could not be done dodds cobras would be on the fire steps and the redcoats would be beneath them and the redcoats would die like cat de dodd had no great opinion of indian rockets but he had stockpiled more than a thousand above the inner forts murderous entrance for within the close confines of the walled road the weapons would prove lethal the rockets were made of hammered tin each one about sixteen inches long and four or five inches in diameter with a bamboo stick the height of a man attached to each tin cylinder that was crammed with powder dodd had experimented with the weapon and found that a lit rocket tossed down into the gate passage would sear and bounce from wall to wall and even when it finally stopped careering madly about the roadway it went on belching out a torch of flame that would scorch trapped men terribly a dozen rockets dropped between two of the gates might kill a score of men and burn another score half to death just let them come dodd prayed as he climbed each morning towards the inner fort let them come let them come and let them take the outer fort for then manu bappoo must die and the british would then come to dodd and die like the prince and afterwards the fugitives of their beaten army would be pursued south across the deccan plain their bodies would rot in the heat and their bones whiten in the sun and the british power in india would be broken and dodd would be lord of gawilghur just let the bastards come that evening sergeant hakeswill pushed aside the folds of muslin to enter captain torrances quarters the captain was lying naked in his hammock where he was being fanned by a bamboo punk ah that had been rigged to a ceiling beam his native servant kept the punk ah moving by tugging on a string while clare wall trimmed the captains fingernails not too close brick torrance said leave me enough to scratch with theres a good girl he raised his eyes to hakeswill did you knock sergeant twice sir hakeswill lied loud and clear sir brick will have to ream out my ears say good evening to the sergeant brick where are our manners tonight clare lifted her eyes briefly to acknowledge hakeswills presence and mumbled something barely audible hakeswill snatched off his hat pleasure to see you mrs wall he said eagerly a proper pleasure my jewel he bobbed his head to her and winked at torrance who flinched brick torrance said the sergeant and i have military matters to discuss so take yourself to the garden he patted her hand and watched her leave and no listening at the window he added archly he waited until clare had sidled past the muslin that hung over the kitchen entrance then leaned precariously from the hammock to pick up a green silk robe that he draped over his crotch i would hate to shock you sergeant beyond shock sir me sir aint nothing living i aint seen naked sir all of em naked as needles and never once was i shocked sir ever since they strung me up by the neck ive been beyond shock sir and beyond sense too torrance thought but he suppressed the comment has brick left the kitchen hakeswill peered past the muslin shes gone sir shes not at the window hakeswill checked the window on the far side of the yard sir like a good girl i trust youve brought me news better than news sir better than news the sergeant crossed to the table and emptied his pocket your notes to jama sir all of them ten thousand rupees and all paid off youre out of debt sir out of debt relief seared through torrance debt was a terrible thing a dreadful thing yet seemingly inescapable if a man was to live to the full twelve hundred guineas how could he ever have gambled that much away it had been madness yet now it was paid and paid in full burn the notes he ordered hakeswill hakeswill held the notes into a candle flame one by one then let them shrivel and burn on the table the draught from the punk ah disturbed the smoke and scattered the little scraps of black ash that rose from the small fires and jama sir being a gentleman despite being an heathen bastard blackamoor added a thankee hakeswill said putting some gold coins on the table how much seven hundred rupees there sir he gave us more i know that youre cheating me sergeant sir hakeswill straightened indignantly on my life sir and i speak as a christian i aint ever cheated a soul in my life sir not unless they deserved it in which case they gets it right and proper sir like it says in the scriptures torrance stared at hakeswill jama will be back in the camp in a day or two i can ask him and you will find sir that i have treated you foursquare and straight sir on the nail sir on the drumhead as one soldier to another hakeswill sniffed im hurt sir torrance yawned you have my sincerest deepest and most fervent apologies sergeant so tell me about sharpe hakeswill glanced at the punk ah boy does that heathen speak english sir of course not sharpies no more sir hakeswills face twitched as he remembered the pleasure of kicking his enemy stripped the bastard naked sir gave him a headache he wont ever forget not that hes got long to remember anything now on account of him being on his way to meet his executioner and i kept him trussed up till jamas men came to fetch him which they did sir so now hes gone sir gone for bleeding ever just as he deserves you stripped him torrance asked puzzled didnt want the bastards dropping off a body all dressed up in an officers coat sir even though the little bleeder should never have worn one him being nothing more than a jumpedup dribble of dried toad spittle sir so we stripped him and burned the uniform sir and nothing went wrong hakeswills face twitched as he shrugged his boy got away but he didnt make no trouble just vanished probably went back to his mummy torrance smiled all was done all was solved even better he could resume his trade with jama though perhaps with a little more circumspection than in the past did sajit go with sharpe he asked knowing he would need an efficient clerk if he was to hide the treacherous transactions in the ledger no sir hes with me sir outside sir hakeswill jerked his head towards the front room he wanted to go sir but i gave him a thumping on account of us needing him here sir and after that he was as good as gold sir even if he is an heathen bit of scum torrance smiled i am vastly in your debt sergeant hakeswill he said just doing my duty sir hakeswills face twitched as he grinned and gestured towards the garden window and hoping for a soldiers reward sir brick you mean torrance asked me hearts desire sir hakeswill said hoarsely her and me sir made for each other says so in the scriptures then the fruition of the prophecy must wait a while torrance said because i need brick to look after me and your duty sergeant is to assume mister sharpes responsibilities we shall wait till someone notices that hes missing then claim that he must have been ambushed by mahrattas while on his way here then youll go up the mountain to help the engineers me sir hakeswill sounded alarmed at the prospect of having to do some real work up the mountain someone has to be there you cant expect me to do it torrance said indignantly someone must stay here and shoulder the heavier responsibilities it wont be for long sergeant not for long and once the campaign is over i can assure you that your hearts desires will be fully met but not he decided before hakeswill paid him the money clare owed for her passage out from england that money could come from the cash that jama had given hakeswill this night which torrance was sure was a great deal more than the sergeant had admitted make yourself ready sergeant torrance ordered doubtless you will be needed up the road tomorrow yes sir hakeswill said sullenly well done good and faithful hakeswill torrance said grandly dont let any moths in as you leave hakeswill went he had three thousand three hundred rupees in his pocket and a fortune in precious stones hidden in his cartridge box he would have liked to have celebrated with clare wall but he did not doubt that his chance would come and so for the moment he was a satisfied man he looked at the first stars pricking the sky above gawilghurs plateau and reflected that he had rarely been more content he had taken his revenge he had become wealthy and thus all was well in obadiah hakeswills world chapter sharpe knew he was in an ox cart he could tell that from the jolting motion and from the terrible squeal of the ungreased axles the ox carts that followed the army made a noise like the shrieking of souls in perdition he was naked bruised and in pain it hurt even to breathe his mouth was gagged and his hands and feet were tied but even if they had been free he doubted he could have moved for he was wrapped in a thick dusty carpet hakeswill the bastard had ambushed him stripped him and robbed him he knew it was hakeswill for sharpe had heard the sergeants hoarse voice as he was rolled into the rug then he had been carried out of the tent and slung into the cart and he was not sure how long ago that had been because he was in too much pain and he kept slipping in and out of a dreamlike daze a nightmare daze there was blood in his mouth a tooth was loose a rib was probably cracked and the rest of him simply ached or hurt his head throbbed he wanted to be sick but knew he would choke on his vomit because of the gag and so he willed his belly to be calm calm the only blessing was that he was alive and he suspected that was no blessing at all why had hakeswill not killed him not out of mercy that was for sure so presumably he was to be killed somewhere else though why hakeswill had run the terrible risk of having a british officer tied hand and foot and smuggled past the picquet line sharpe could not tell it made no sense all he did know was that by now obadiah hakeswill would have teased sharpes gems from their hiding places god damn it all to hell first simone now hakeswill and hakeswill sharpe realized could never have trapped sharpe if torrance had not helped but knowing his enemies would not help sharpe now he knew he had as much hope of living as those dogs who were hurled onto the mud flats beside the thames in london with stones tied to their necks the children used to laugh as they watched the dogs struggle some of the dogs had come from wealthy homes they used to be snatched and if their owners did not produce the ransom money within a couple of days the dogs were thrown to the river usually the ransom was paid brought by a nervous footman to a sordid public house near the docks but no one would ransom sharpe who would care dust from the rug was thick in his nose just let the end be quick he prayed he could hear almost nothing through the rug the axle squealing was the loudest noise and once he heard a thump on the carts side and thought he heard a man laugh it was nighttime he was not sure how he knew that except that it would make sense for no one would try to smuggle a british officer out in daylight and he knew he had lain in the tent for a long time after hakeswill had hit him he remembered ducking under the tents canvas remembered a glimpse of the brassbound musket butt and then it was nothing but a jumble of pain and oblivion a weight pressed on his waist and he guessed after a while that a man was resting his feet on the rug sharpe tested the assumption by trying to move and the man kicked him he lay still again one dog had escaped he remembered it had somehow slipped the rope over its neck and had paddled away downstream with the children shrieking along the bank and hurling stones at the frightened head did the dog die sharpe could not remember god he thought but he had been a wild child wild as a hawk they had tried to beat the wildness out of him beat him till the blood ran then told him he would come to a bad end they had prophesied that he would be strung up by the neck at tyburn hill dick sharpe dangling pissing down his legs while the rope burned into his gullet but it had not happened he was an officer a gentleman and he was still alive and he pulled at the tether about his wrists but it would not shift was hakeswill riding in the cart that seemed possible and suggested the sergeant wanted somewhere safe and private to kill sharpe but how quick with a knife that was a forlorn wish for hakeswill was not merciful perhaps he planned to repay sharpe by putting him beneath an elephants foot and he would scream and writhe until the great weight would not let him scream ever again and his bones would crack and splinter like eggshells be sure your sin will find you out how many times had he heard those words from the bible usually thumped into him at the foundling home with a blow across the skull for every syllable and the blows would keep coming as they chanted the reference the book of numbers chapter thirtytwo verse twentythree syllable by syllable blow by blow and now his sin was finding him out and he was to be punished for all the unpunished of fences so die well he told himself dont cry out whatever was about to happen could not be worse than the flogging he had taken because of hakeswills lies that had hurt hurt like buggery but he had not cried out so take the pain and go like a man what had sergeant major bywaters said as he had thrust the leather gag into sharpes mouth be brave boy dont let the regiment down so he would be brave and die well and then what hell he supposed and an eternity of torment at the hands of a legion of hakeswills just like the army really the cart stopped he heard feet thump on the wagon boards the murmur of voices then hands seized the rug and dragged him off he banged hard down onto the ground then the rug was picked up and carried die well he told himself die well but that was easier said than done not all men died well sharpe had seen strong men reduced to shuddering despair as they waited for the cart to be run out from under the gallows just as he had seen others go into eternity with a defiance so brittle and hard that it had silenced the watching crowd yet all men the brave and the cowardly danced the gallows dance in the end jerking from a length of bridport hemp and the crowd would laugh at their twitching antics best puppet show in london they said there was no good way to die except in bed asleep unknowing or maybe in battle at the cannons mouth blown to kingdom come in an instant of oblivion he heard the footsteps of the men who carried him slap on stone then heard a loud murmur of voices there were a lot of voices all apparently talking at once and all excited and he felt the rug being jostled by a crowd and then he seemed to be carried down some steps and the crowd was gone and he was thrown onto a hard floor the voices seemed louder now as if he was indoors and he was suddenly possessed by the absurd notion that he had been brought into a cockfighting arena like the one off vinegar street where as a child he had earned farthings by carrying pots of porter to spectators who were alternatively morose or maniacally excited he lay for a long time he could hear the voices even sometimes a burst of laughter he remembered the fat man in vinegar street whose trade ratcatching took him to the great houses in west london that he reconnoitred for his thieving friends youd make a good snaffler dicky hed say to sharpe then he would clutch sharpes arm and point to the cockerels waiting to fight which onell win lad which one and sharpe would make a haphazard choice and as often as not the bird did win hes a lucky boy the ratcatcher would boast to his friends as he tossed sharpe a farthing nippers got the luck of the devil but not tonight sharpe thought and suddenly the rug was seized unwound and sharpe was spilt naked onto hard stones a cheer greeted his appearance light flared in sharpes eyes dazzling him but after a while he saw he was in a great stone courtyard lit by the flames of torches mounted on pillars that surrounded the yard two whiterobed men seized him dragged him upright and pushed him onto a stone bench where to his surprise his hands and feet were loosed and the gag taken from his mouth he sat flexing his fingers and gasping deep breaths of humid air he could see no sign of hakeswill he could see now that he was in a temple a kind of cloister ran around the courtyard and because the cloister was raised three or four feet it made the stonepaved floor into a natural arena he had not been so wrong about the cockfighting pit though vinegar street had never aspired to ornately carved stone arches smothered with writhing gods and snarling beasts the raised cloister was packed with men who were in obvious good humour there were hundreds of them all anticipating a nights rare entertainment sharpe touched his swollen lip and winced at the pain he was thirsty and with every deep breath his bruised or broken ribs hurt there was a swelling on his forehead that was thick with dried blood he looked about the crowd seeking one friendly face and finding none he just saw indian peasants with dark eyes that reflected the flame light they must have come from every village within ten miles to witness whatever was about to happen in the centre of the courtyard was a small stone building fantastically carved with elephants and dancing girls and crowned by a stepped tower that had been sculpted with yet more gods and animals painted red yellow green and black the crowds noise subsided as a man showed at the doorway of the small shrine and raised his arms as a signal for silence sharpe recognized the man he was the tall thin limping man in the green and black striped robe who had pleaded with torrance for naigs life and behind him came a pair ofjettis so that was the sum of it revenge for naig and sharpe realized that hakeswill had never intended to kill him only deliver him to these men a murmur ran through the spectators as they admired the jet tis vast brutes they were who dedicated their extraordinary strength to some strange indian god although sharpe had met jet tis before and had killed some in seringapatam he did not fancy his chances against these two bearded brutes he was too weak too thirsty too bruised too hurt while these two fanatics were tall and hugely muscled their bronze skin had been oiled so that it gleamed in the flame light their long hair was coiled about their skulls and one had red lines painted on his face while the other who was slightly shorter carried a long spear each man wore a loincloth and nothing else they glanced at sharpe then the taller man prostrated himself before a small shrine a dozen guards came from the courtyards rear and lined its edge they carried muskets tipped with bayonets the tall man in the striped robe clapped his hands to silence the crowds last murmurs it took a while for still more spectators were pushing into the temple and there was scarce room in the cloister somewhere outside a horse neighed men shouted protests as the newcomers shoved their way inside but at last the commotion ended and the tall man stepped to the edge of the stone platform on which the small shrine stood he spoke for a long time and every few moments his words would provoke a growl of agreement and then the crowd would look at sharpe and some would spit at him sharpe stared sullenly back at them they were getting a rare nights amusement he reckoned a captured englishman was to be killed in front of them and sharpe could not blame them for relishing the prospect but he was damned if he would die easy he could do some damage he reckoned maybe not much but enough so that the jet tis remembered the night they were given a redcoat to kill the tall man finished his speech then limped down the short flight of steps and approached sharpe he carried himself with dignity like a man who knows his own worth to be high he stopped a few paces from sharpe and his face showed derision as he stared at the englishmans sorry state my name he said in english is jama sharpe said nothing you killed my brother jama said ive killed a lot of men sharpe said his voice hoarse so that it scarcely carried the few paces that separated the two men he spat to clear his throat ive killed a lot of men he said again and naig was one jama said he deserved to die sharpe said jama sneered at that answer if my brother deserved to die then so did the british who traded with him that was probably true sharpe thought but he said nothing he could see some pointed helmets at the back of the crowd and he guessed that some of the mahratta horsemen who still roamed the deccan plain had come to see his death maybe the same mahrattas who had bought the two thousand missing muskets muskets that hakeswill had supplied and torrance had lied about to conceal the theft so now you will die jama said simply sharpe shrugged run to the right he was thinking and grab the nearest musket but he knew he would be slowed by the pain besides the men on the cloister would jump down to overpower him but he had to do something anything a man could not just be killed like a dog you will die slowly jama said to satisfy the debt of blood that is owed to my family you want a death sharpe asked to balance your brothers death exactly so jama said gravely then kill a rat sharpe said or strangle a toad your brother deserved to die he was a thief and you english have come to steal all india jama said equably he looked again at sharpes wounds and seemed to get satisfaction from them you will soon be pleading for my mercy he said do you know what jet tis are i know sharpe said prithviraj jama said gesturing towards the taller jetti who was bowing before the small altar has castrated a man with his bare hands he will do that to you and more for tonight i have promised these people they will see the death of a hundred parts you will be torn to pieces englishman but you will live as your body is divided for that is a jettfs skill to kill a man slowly without weapons tearing him piece by piece and only when your screams have assuaged the pain of my brothers death will i show you mercy jama gave sharpe one last look of disdain then turned and walked back to the shrines steps prithviraj leaned forward and rang a tiny hand bell to draw the gods attention then put his hands together and bowed his head a last time the second jetti the one with the spear watched sharpe with an expressionless face sharpe forced himself to stand his back ached and his legs were weak so that he tottered making the crowd laugh at him he took a step to his right but the closest guard just edged away a carved stool had been fetched from the shrine and jama was now sitting at the top of the steps a huge bat flickered in and out of the torchlight sharpe walked forward testing his legs and was amazed he could stand at all the crowd jeered his faltering gait and the sound made prithviraj turn from his devotions he saw that sharpe posed no danger and so turned back to the god sharpe staggered he did it deliberately making himself look weaker than he really was he swayed pretending that he was about to fall then took some slurred sideways steps to get close to one of the guards seize a musket he told himself then ram its muzzle into jamas face he swayed sideways again and the closest guard just stepped back and levelled the bayonet at sharpe the dozen sentries plainly had orders to keep sharpe inside thejettfs killing ground sharpe measured the distance wondering if he could get past the bayonet to seize the musket but a second guard came to reinforce the first then prithviraj stood he was a bloody giant snarpe thought a giant with an oiled skin and upper arms as thick as most mens thighs the crowd murmured in admiration again and then prithviraj undid his loincloth and let it fall so that he was naked like sharpe the gesture seemed to imply that he sought no advantage over his opponent though as the huge man came down from the shrine the second jetti took care to stay close beside him two against one and the second had a spear and sharpe had nothing he glanced at the burning torches wondering if he could seize one and brandish it as a weapon but they were mounted too high christ he thought but do something anything panic began to close in on him fluttering like the bat which swooped into the flame light again he backed away from the jet tis and the crowd jeered him he did not care he was watching prithviraj a slowmoving man too musclebound to be quick and sharpe guessed that was why the second jetti was present his job would be to herd sharpe with the glittering spear and afterwards to hold him still as prithviraj tore off fingers toes and ears so take the spearman first sharpe told himself put the bastard down and take his weapon he edged to his left circling the courtyard to try and position himself closer to the spearcarrying jetti the crowd sighed as he moved enjoying the thought that the englishman would put up a fight the spear followed sharpes movements he would have to be quick sharpe thought desperately quick and he doubted he could do it hakeswilps kicking had slowed him but he had to try and so he kept on circling then abruptly charged in to attack the spearman but the weapon was jabbed towards him and prithviraj was much faster than sharpe had expected and leaped to catch him and sharpe had to twist awkwardly away the crowd laughed at his clumsiness accept your death jama called a servant was fanning the merchants face sweat poured down sharpes cheeks he had been forced towards that part of the courtyard nearest the temples entrance where there were two stone flights of stairs leading up to the cloister the steps jutting into the yard formed a bay in which sharpe suddenly realized he was trapped he moved sideways but the spearcarrying jetti covered him the two men knew he was cornered now and came slowly towards him and sharpe could only back away until his spine touched the cloisters edge one of the spectators kicked him but with more malice than force the jet tis came on slowly wary in case he suddenly broke to right or left prithviraj was flexing his huge fingers making them supple for the nights work scraps of smouldering ash whirled away from the torches one settling on sharpes shoulder he brushed it off sahib a voice hissed from behind sharpe sahib prithviraj looked calm and confident no bloody wonder sharpe thought so kick the naked bugger in the crotch he reckoned that was his last chance one good kick and hope that prithviraj doubled over either that or run onto the spear and hope the blade killed him quickly sahib the voice hissed again prithviraj was turning sideways so that he would not expose his groin to sharpe then he beckoned for the other jetti to close in on the englishman and drive him out from the wall with his spear you bugger the voice said impatiently sharpe turned to see that ahmed was on hands and knees among the legs of the spectators and what was more the child was pushing forward the hilt of the tulwar he had captured at deogaum sharpe leaned on the cloister edge and the crowd seeing him rest against the stone believed he had given up some groaned for they had been anticipating more of a fight but most of the watching men just jeered at him for being a weakling sharpe winked at ahmed then reached for the tulwar he seized the handle pushed away from the stone and turned dragging the blade from the scabbard that was still in ahmeds grasp he turned fast as a striking snake the curved steel silverred in the courtyards flame light and the jet tis thinking he was a beaten man were not prepared the man with the spear was closest and the curved blade slashed across his face springing blood and he instinctively clutched his eyes and let the spear drop sharpe moved to the right scooped up the fallen spear and prithviraj at last looked worried the guards raised their muskets sharpe heard the clicks as the dog heads were hauled back so let them shoot him he thought for that was a quicker death than being dismembered and gelded by a naked giant jama was standing one hand in the air reluctant to let his guards shoot sharpe before he had suffered pain the wounded jetti was on his knees his hands clutched to his face which was streaming blood then a musket fired its sound unnaturally loud in the confines of the courtyards carved walls one of the guards flinched as the musket ball whipped past his head to chip a flake of stone from one of the decorated arches then a voice shouted from the cloister by the temple entrance the man spoke in an indian language and he spoke to jama who was staring appalled as a group of armed men pushed their way to the very front of the crowd it was syud sevajee who had fired and who had spoken to jama and who now grinned down at sharpe ive told him it must be a fair fight ensign me against him sharpe jerked his chin at prithviraj we came for entertainment syud sevajee said the least you can do is provide us with some why dont you just shoot the bugger and have done with it sevajee smiled this crowd will accept the result of a fair fight ensign they might not like it if i simply rescue you besides you dont want to be in my debt do you im in your debt already sharpe said up to my bloody eyeballs he turned and looked at prithviraj who was waiting for a sign from jama hey goliath sharpe shouted here he threw the tulwar at the man keeping the spear you want a fair fight so youve got a weapon now the pain seemed to have vanished and even the thirst had gone away it was like that moment at assaye when he had been surrounded by enemies and suddenly the world had seemed a calm clearcut place full of delicious opportunity he had a chance now he had more than a chance he was going to put the big bastard down it was a fair fight and sharpe had grown up fighting he had been bred to it from the gutter driven to it by poverty and inured to it by desperation he was nothing if he was not a fighter and now the crowd would get the bloody sport they wanted he hefted the spear so come on you bastard prithviraj stooped and picked up the tulwar he swung it in a clumsy arc then looked again at jama dont look at him you great ox look at me sharpe went forward the spear low then he raised the blade and lunged towards the big mans belly and prithviraj made a clumsy parry that rang against the spear blade youll have to put more strength into it than that sharpe said pulling back the spear and standing still to tempt thejetti forward prithviraj stepped towards him swung the blade and sharpe stepped back so that the tulwars tip slashed inches from his chest you have to be quick sharpe said and he feinted right spun away and walked back to the left leaving prithviraj off balance sharpe turned and lunged with the spear pricking the big mans back and leaving a trickle of blood aint the same is it when the other fellows got a weapon he smiled at the jetti so come on you daft pudding come on the crowd was silent now prithviraj seemed puzzled he had not expected to fight not with a weapon and it was plain he was not accustomed to a tulwar you can give up sharpe said you can kneel down and give up i wont kill you if you do that but if you stay on your feet ill pick you apart like a joint of bloody meat prithviraj did not understand a word but he knew sharpe was dangerous and he was trying to work out how best to kill him he glanced at the spear wishing he had that weapon instead of the tulwar but sharpe knew the point should always beat the edge which was why he had kept the spear you want it quick or slow sevajee sharpe called whichever you prefer ensign sevajee said smiling it is not for the audience to tell the actors how the play should go then ill make it quick sharpe said and he pointed at prithviraj with his free hand and motioned that thejetti could kneel down just kneel he said and ill spare you tell him that sevajee sevajee called out in an indian language and prithviraj must have decided the offer was an insult for he suddenly ran forward tulwar swinging and sharpe had to step quickly aside and parry one of the cuts with the spears staff the blade cut a sliver of wood from the shaft but went nowhere near sharpe no good doing that sharpe said youre not making hay you great pudding youre trying to stay alive prithviraj attacked again but all he could think to do was make great swings with the blade any one of which might have slit sharpe into two but the attacks were clumsy and sharpe backed away always circling around to the middle of the courtyard so that he was not trapped against its edges the crowd sensing that prithviraj might win began to urge him on but some noticed that the englishman was not even trying to fight yet he was taunting thejetti he was evading him and he was keeping his spear low i thought you said it would be quick sevajee said you want it over sharpe asked he crouched raising the spear blade and the motion checked prithviraj who stared at him warily what im going to do sharpe said is cut your belly open then slit your throat are you ready he went forward jabbing the spear still low and prithviraj backed away trying to parry the small lunges but sharpe dragged the spear back each time before the parry could connect and prithviraj frowned he seemed hypnotized by the shining blade that flickered like a snakes tongue and behind it sharpe was grinning at him and taunting him and prithviraj tried to counterattack once but the spear slashed up to within an inch of his face and he went on stepping backwards then he backed into the blinded jettt who still crouched on the flagstones and prithviraj staggered as he lost his balance sharpe came up from the crouch the spear lancing forward and the wild parry came far too late and suddenly the blade was punching and tearing through the skin and muscle of the jettfs stomach sharpe twisted the leafshaped steel so that it did not get trapped in the flesh and then he ripped it out and blood washed across the temple floor and prithviraj was bending forward as if he could seal the pain in his belly by folding over and then the spear sliced from the side to slash across his throat the crowd sighed prithviraj was on the stones now curled up with blood bubbling from his sliced belly and pulsing from his neck sharpe kicked the tulwar from the jettts unresisting hand then turned and looked at jama you and your brother did business with captain torrance jama said nothing sharpe walked towards the shrine the guards moved to stop him but sevajees men raised their muskets and some grinning jumped down into the courtyard ahmed also jumped down and snatched the tulwar from the flagstones prithviraj was on his side now dying jama stood as sharpe reached the steps but he could not move fast with his limp and suddenly the spear was at his belly i asked you a question sharpe said jama still said nothing you want to live sharpe asked jama looked down at the spear blade that was thick with blood was it torrance who gave me to you sharpe asked yes jama said if i see you again sharpe said ill kill you if you go back to the british camp ill hang you like your brother and if you so much as send a message to torrance ill follow you to the last corner on gods earth and ill castrate you with my bare hands he jabbed the spear just enough to prick jamas belly then turned away the crowd was silent cowed by sevajees men and by the ferocity they had witnessed in the temple courtyard sharpe tossed away the spear pulled ahmed towards him and patted the boys head youre a good lad ahmed a bloody good lad and i need a drink by christ im thirsty but he was also alive which meant some other men would soon be dead because sharpe was more than alive he was angry angry as hell and wanting revenge sharpe borrowed a cloak from one of sevajees men then pulled himself up behind ahmed onto major stokess horse they rode slowly away from the village where the torches guttered in the temple towards the smear of red light that betrayed where the british encampment lay some miles to the west sevajee talked as they rode telling sharpe how ahmed had fled straight into the arms of his men luckily for you ensign the indian said i recognized him which is why you sent for help isnt it sharpe asked sarcastically its why you fetched some redcoats to get me out of that bloody tent your gratitude touches me deeply sevajee said with a smile it took us a long time to make sense of what your boy was saying and i confess we didnt wholly believe him even then and by the time we thought to take him seriously you were already being carried away so we followed i thought we might fetch some entertainment from the evening and so we did glad to be of service sahib sharpe said i knew you could beat ajetti in a fair fight i beat three at once in seringapatam sharpe said but i dont know as it was a fair fight im not much in favour of fair fights i like them to be unfair fair fights are for gentlemen who dont know any better which is why you gave the sword to the jetti sevajee observed drily i knew hed make a bollocks of it sharpe said he was tired suddenly and all the aches and throbs and agony had come back above him the sky was brilliant with stars while a thin sickle moon hung just above the faraway fortress dodd was up there sharpe thought another life to take dodd and torrance hakeswill and his two men a debt to be paid by sending all the bastards to hell where shall i take you sevajee asked take me you want to go to the general christ no sharpe could not imagine complaining to wellesley the cold bugger would probably blame sharpe for getting into trouble stokes maybe or the cavalry sergeant lockhart would doubtless welcome him but then he had a better idea take me to wherever youre camped he told sevajee and in the morning youve got a new recruit sharpe said im one of your men for now sevajee looked amused why why do you think i want to hide but why sharpe sighed dyou think wellesley will believe me if i go to wellesley hell think ive got sunstroke or hell reckon im drunk and torrance will stand there with a plum in his bloody mouth and deny everything or else hell blame hakeswill hakeswill sevajee asked a bastard im going to kill sharpe said and itll be easier if he doesnt know im still alive and this time sharpe vowed he would make sure of the bastard my only worry he told sevajee is major stokess horse hes a good man stokes that horse sevajee asked nodding at the grey mare you reckon a couple of your fellows could return it to him in the morning of course tell him i got thrown from the saddle and snatched up by the enemy sharpe said let him think im a prisoner in gawilghur and meanwhile youll be one of us sevajee asked ive just become a mahratta sharpe said welcome said sevajee and what you need now sharpe is some rest ive had plenty of rest sharpe said what i need now are some clothes and some darkness you need food too sevajee insisted he glanced up at the sliver of moon above the fort it was waning tomorrow night will be darker he promised and sharpe nodded he wanted a deep darkness a shadowed blackness in which a living ghost could hunt major stokes was grateful for the return of his horse but saddened over sharpes fate captured he told sir arthur wellesley and my own fault too cant see how that can be stokes i should never have let him ride off on his own should have made him wait till a group went back wont be the first prison cell hes seen wellesley said and i daresay it wont be the last i shall miss him stokes said miss him deeply a good man wellesley grunted he had ridden up the improved road to judge its progress for himself and he was impressed though he took care not to show his approval the road now snaked up into the hills and one more days work would see it reach the edge of the escarpment half the necessary siege guns were already high on the road parked in an upland meadow while bullocks were trudging up the lower slopes with their heavy burdens of round shot that would be needed to break open gawilghurs walls the mahrattas had virtually ceased their raids on the roadmakers ever since wellesley had sent two battalions of sepoys up into the hills to hunt the enemy down every once in a while a musket shot would be fired from a long distance but the balls were usually spent before they reached a target your work wont end with the road wellesley told stokes as the general and his staff followed the engineer on foot towards some higher ground from where they could inspect the fortress i doubted it would sir you know stevenson ive dined with the colonel im sending him up here his troops will make the assault my men will stay below and climb the two roads wellesley spoke curtly almost offhandedly he was proposing to divide his army into two again just as it had been split for most of the war against the mahrattas stevensons part of the army would climb to the plateau and make the main assault on the fortress that attack would swarm across the narrow neck of land to climb the breaches but to stop the enemy from throwing all their strength into the defence of the broken wall wellesley proposed sending two columns of his own men up the steep tracks that led directly to the fortress those men would have to approach unbroken walls up slopes too steep to permit artillery to be deployed and wellesley knew those columns could never hope to break into gawilghur their job was to spread the defenders thin and to block off the garrisons escape routes while colonel stevensons men did the bloody work youll have to establish stevensons batteries wellesley told stokes major blackistons seen the ground he indicated his aide and he reckons two eighteens and three iron twelves should suffice major blackiston of course will give you whatever advice he can no glacis stokes directed the question to blackiston not when i was there blackiston said though of course they could have made one since i just saw curtain walls with a few bastions ancient work by the look of it fifteenthcentury work wellesley put in and when he saw that the two engineers were impressed by his knowledge he shrugged syud sevajee claims as much anyway old walls break fastest stokes said cheerfully the two big guns with the three smaller cannon would batter the wall head on to crumble the ancient stone that was probably unprotected by a glacis of embanked earth to soak up the force of the bombardment and the major had yet to find a fortress wall in india that could resist the strike of an eighteenpounder shot travelling half a mile every two seconds but youll want some enfilading fire he warned wellesley ill send you some more twelves wellesley promised a battery of twelves and an howitzer stokes suggested id like to drop some nasties over the wall theres nothing like an howitzer for spreading gloom ill send an howitzer wellesley promised the enfilading batteries would fire at an angle through the growing breaches to keep the enemy from making repairs and the howitzer which fired high in the air so that its shells dropped steeply down could bombard the repair parties behind the fortress ramparts and i want the batteries established quickly wellesley said no dallying major im not a man to dally sir arthur stokes said cheerfully the major was leading the general and his staff up a particularly steep patch of road where an elephant supplemented by over sixty sweating sepoys forced an eighteenpounder gun up the twisting road the officers dodged the sepoys then climbed a knoll from where they could stare across at gawilghur by now they were nearly as high as the stronghold itself and the profile of the twin forts stood clear against the bright sky beyond it formed a double hump the narrow neck of land led from the plateau to the first lower hump on which the outer fortress stood it was that fortress which would receive stokess breaching fire and that fortress which would be assailed by stevensons men but beyond it the ground dropped into a deep ravine then climbed steeply to the much larger second hump on which the inner fortress with its palace and its lakes and its houses stood sir arthur spent a long time staring through his glass but said nothing ill warrant i can get you into the smaller fortress stokes said but how do you cross the central ravine into the main stronghold it was that question that wellesley had yet to answer in his own mind and he suspected there was no simple solution he hoped that the attackers would simply surge across the ravine and flood up the second slope like an irresistible wave that had broken through one barrier and would now overcome everything in its path but he dared not admit to such impractical optimism he dared not confess that he was condemning his men to an attack on an inner fortress that would have unbreached walls and wellprepared defenders if we cant take it by escalade he said curtly collapsing his glass well have to dig breaching batteries in the outer fortress and do it the hard way in other words stokes thought sir arthur had no idea how it was to be done only that it must be done by escalade or by breach and by gods mercy if they were lucky for once they were into the central ravine the attackers would be in the devils hands it was a hot december day but stokes shivered for he feared for the men who must go up against gawilghur captain torrance had enjoyed a remarkably lucky evening jama had still not returned to the camp and his big green tents with their varied delights stood empty but there were plenty of other diversions in the british camp a group of scottish officers augmented by a sergeant who played the flute gave a concert and though torrance had no great taste for chamber music he found the melodies were in tune with his jaunty mood sharpe was gone torrances debts were paid he had survived and he had strolled on from the concert to the cavalry lines where he knew he would find a game of whist torrance had succeeded in taking fiftythree guineas from an irascible major and another twelve from a wheycheeked ensign who kept scratching his groin if youve got the pox the major had finally said then get the hell to a surgeon its lice sir then for christs sake stop wriggling youre distracting me scratch on torrance had said laying down a winning hand he had yawned scooped up the coins and bid his partners a good night its devilish early the major had grumbled wanting a chance to win his money back duty torrance had said vaguely then he had strolled to the merchant encampment and inspected the women who fanned themselves in the torrid night heat an hour later well pleased with himself he had returned to his quarters his servant squatted on the porch but he waved the man away sajit was still at his candlelit desk unclogging his pen of the soggy paper scraps that collected on the nib he stood touched his inky hands together and bowed as torrance entered sahib all well all is well sahib tomorrows chitties he pushed a pile of papers across the desk im sure theyre in order torrance said quite confident that he spoke true sajit was proving to be an excellent clerk he went to the door of his quarters then turned with a frown your uncle hasnt come back tomorrow sahib im sure tell him id like a word but not if he comes tonight i dont want to be disturbed tonight of course not sahib sajit offered another bow as torrance negotiated the door and the muslin screen the captain shot the iron bolt then chased down the few moths that had managed to get past the muslin he lit a second lamp piled the nights winnings on the table then called for clare she came sleepy eyed from the kitchen arrack brick torrance ordered then peeled off his coat while clare un stoppered a fresh jar of the fierce spirit she kept her eyes averted as torrance stripped himself naked and lay back in his hammock you could light me a hookah brick he suggested then sponge me down is there a clean shirt for the morning of course sir not the darned one no sir he turned his head to stare at the coins which glittered so prettily in the smoky lamplight in funds again winning perhaps his luck had turned it seemed so he had lost so much money at cards in the last month that he had thought nothing but ruin awaited him but now the goddess of fortune had turned her other cheek rule of halves he told himself as he sucked on the hookah save half gamble the other half halve the winnings and save half again simple really and now that sharpe was gone he could begin some careful trading once more though how the market would hold up once the mahrattas were defeated he could not tell still with a slice of luck he might make sufficient money to set himself up in a comfortable civilian life in madras a carriage a dozen horses and as many women servants he would have an harem he smiled at the thought imagining his fathers disgust an harem a courtyard with a fountain a wine cellar deep beneath his house that should be built close to the sea so that cooling breezes could waft through its windows he would need to spend an hour or two at the office each week but certainly not more for there were always indians to do the real work the buggers would cheat him of course but there seemed plenty of money to go around so long as a man did not gamble it away rule of halves he told himself again the golden rule of life the sound of singing came from the camp beyond the village torrance did not recognize the tune which was probably some scottish song the sound drifted him back to his childhood when he had sung in the cathedral choir he grimaced remembering the frosty mornings when he had run in the dark across the close and pushed open the cathedrals great side door to be greeted by a clout over the ear because he was late the choristers cloudy breath had mingled with the smoke of the guttering candles lice under the robes he remembered he had caught his first lice off a countertenor who had held him against a wall behind a bishops tomb and hoisted his robe i hope the bastards dead he thought sajit yelped quiet torrance shouted resenting being jarred from his reverie there was silence again and torrance sucked on the hookah he could hear clare pouring water in the yard and he smiled as he anticipated the soothing touch of the sponge someone it had to be sajit tried to open the door from the front room go away torrance called but then something hit the door a massive blow the bolt held though dust sifted from crevices in the plaster wall either side of the frame torrance stared in shock then twitched with alarm as another huge bang shook the door and this time a chunk of plaster the size of a dinner plate fell from the wall torrance swung his bare legs out of the hammock where the devil were his pistols a third blow reverberated round the room and this time the bracket holding the bolt was wrenched out of the wall and the door swung in onto the muslin screen torrance saw a robed figure sweep the screen aside then he threw himself over the room and pawed through his discarded clothes to find his guns a hand gripped his wrist you wont need that sir a familiar voice said and torrance turned wincing at the strength of the mans grip he saw a figure dressed in bloodspattered indian robes with a tulwar scabbarded at his waist and a face shrouded by a head cloth but torrance recognized his visitor and blanched reporting for duty sir sharpe said taking the pistol from torrances unresisting griptorrance gaped he could have sworn that the blood on the robe was fresh for it gleamed wetly there was more blood on a shortbladed knife in sharpes hand it dripped onto the floor and torrance gave a small pitiful mew its sajits blood sharpe said his penknife too he tossed the wet blade onto the table beside the gold coins lost your tongue sir sharpe hes dead sir sharpe is sharpe said he was sold to jama remember sir is that the blood money sharpe glanced at the rupees on the table sharpe torrance said again somehow incapable of saying anything else im his ghost sir sharpe said and torrance did indeed look as though a spectre had just broken through his door sharpe tutted and shook his head in selfreproof im not supposed to call you sir am i sir on account of me being a fellow officer and a gentleman wheres sergeant hakeswill sharpe torrance said once more collapsing onto a chair we heard youd been captured so i was sir but not by the enemy leastwise not by any proper enemy sharpe examined the pistol this aint loaded what were you hoping to do sir beat me to death with the barrel my robe sharpe please torrance said gesturing to where the silk robe hung on a wooden peg so where is hakeswill sir sharpe asked he had pushed back his head cloth and now opened the pistols friz zen and blew dust off the pan before scraping at the layer of caked powder with a fingernail hes on the road torrance said ah took over from me did he you should keep this pistol clean sir theres rust on the spring see shame to keep an expensive gun so shabbily are you sitting on your cartridge box torrance meekly raised his bottom to take out his leather pouch which held the powder and bullets for his pistols he gave the bag to sharpe thought about fetching the robe himself then decided that any untoward move might upset his visitor im delighted to see youre alive sharpe he said are you sir sharpe asked of course then why did you sell me to jama sell you dont be ridiculous sharpe no the cry came as the pistol barrel whipped towards him and it turned into a moan as the barrel slashed across his cheek torrance touched his face and winced at the blood on his fingers sharpe he began shut it sir sharpe said nastily he perched on the table and poured some powder into the pistol barrel i talked to jama last night he tried to have me killed by a couple ofjettis you know what jet tis are sir religious strongmen sir but they must have been praying to the wrong god for i cut ones throat and left the other bugger blinded he paused to select a bullet from the pouch and i had a chat with jama when id killed his thugs and he told me lots of interesting things like that you traded with him and his brother youre a traitor torrance sharpe i said shut it sharpe snapped he pushed the bullet into the pistols muzzle then drew out the short ramrod and shoved it down the barrel the thing is torrance he went on in a calmer tone i know the truth all of it about you and hakeswill and about you and jama and about you and naig he smiled at torrance then slotted the short ramrod back into its hoops i used to think officers were above that sort of crime i knew the men were crooked because i was crooked but you dont have much choice do you when youve got nothing but you sir you had everything you wanted rich parents proper schooling sharpe shook his head you dont understand sharpe but i do sir now look at me my ma was a whore and not a very good one by all accounts and she went and died and left me with nothing bloody nothing and the thing is sir that when i go to general wellesley and i tells him about you selling muskets to the enemy whos he going to believe you with your proper education or me with a dead frow as a mother sharpe looked at torrance as though he expected an answer but none came hes going to believe you sir isnt he hed never believe me on account of me not being a proper gentleman who knows his latin and you know what that means sir sharpe it means justice wont be done sir but on the other hand youre a gentleman so you knows your duty dont you sharpe edged off the table and gave the pistol butt first to torrance hold it just in front of your ear he advised torrance or else put it in your mouth makes more mess that way but its surer sharpe torrance said and found he had nothing to say the pistol felt heavy in his hand it wont hurt sir sharpe said comfortingly youll be dead in the blink of an eyelid he began scooping the coins off the table into torrances pouch he heard the heavy click as the pistol was cocked then glanced round to see that the muzzle was pointing at his face he frowned and shook his head in disappointment and i thought you were a gentleman sir im not a fool sharpe torrance said vengefully he stood and took a pace closer to the ensign and im worth ten of you up from the ranks you know what that makes you sharpe it makes you a brute a lucky brute but it dont make you a real officer youre not going to be welcome anywhere sharpe youll be endured sharpe because officers have manners but they wont welcome you because you aint a proper officer you werent born to it sharpe torrance laughed at the look of horrified outrage on sharpes face christ i despise you he said savagely youre like a dressedup monkey sharpe only you cant even wear clothes properly i could give you lace and braid and youd still look like a peasant because thats what you are sharpe officers should have style they should have wit and all you can do is grunt you know what you are sharpe youre an embarrassment youre he paused trying to find the right insult and shook his head in frustration as the words would not come youre a lump sharpe thats what you are a lump and the kindest thing is to finish you off torrance smiled goodbye mister sharpe he pulled the trigger the flint smashed down on the steel and the spark flashed into the empty pan sharpe reached out in the silence and took the pistol from torrances hand i loaded it sir but i didnt prime it on account of the fact that i might be a lump but i aint any kind of fool he pushed torrance back into the chair and torrance could only watch as sharpe dropped a pinch of powder into the pan he flinched as sharpe closed the friz zen then shuddered as sharpe walked towards him no sharpe no sharpe stood behind torrance you tried to have me killed sir and i dont like that he pressed the pistol into the side of the captains head sharpe torrance pleaded he was shaking but he seemed powerless to offer any resistance then the muslin curtain from the kitchen was swept aside and clare wall came into the room she stopped and stared with huge eyes at sharpe clare torrance pleaded fetch help quickly now clare did not move fetch help my dear torrance said shell be a witness against you sharpe torrance had turned to look at sharpe and was babbling now so the best thing you can do is to put the gun down ill say nothing about this nothing just a touch of fever in you i expect its all a misunderstanding and we shall forget it ever happened maybe we could share a bottle of arrack clare my dear maybe you could find a bottle clare stepped towards sharpe and held out her hand fetch help my dear torrance said hes not going to give you the gun he is sharpe said and he gave clare the pistol torrance breathed a great sigh of relief then clare clumsily turned the gun and pointed it at torrances head the captain just stared at her eyes front captain sharpe said and turned torrances head so that the bullet would enter from the side just as it might if torrance had committed suicide are you sure he asked clare god help me she said but ive dreamed of doing this she straightened her arm so that the pistols muzzle touched torrances temple no he called no please no but she could not pull the trigger sharpe could see she wanted to but her finger would not tighten and so sharpe took the gun from her edged her gently aside then pushed the barrel into torrances oiled hair no please the captain appealed he was weeping i beg you sharpe please sharpe pulled the trigger stepping back as a gush of blood spouted from the shattered skull the sound of the pistol had been hugely loud in the small room that was now hazed with smoke sharpe knelt and pushed the pistol into torrances dead hand then picked up the pouch with its gold and thrust it into clares hands were going he told her right now she understood the haste and without bothering to fetch any of her belongings followed him back into the outer room where sajits body lay slumped over the table his blood had soaked the chitties clare whimpered when she saw the blood i didnt really mean to kill him sharpe explained then realized hed be a witness if i didnt he saw the fear on clares face i trust you love you and me were the same arent we so come on lets get the hell out of here sharpe had already taken the three jewels from sajit and he added those to the pouch of gold then went to the porch where ahmed stood guard no one seemed to have been alarmed by the shot but it was not wise to linger ive got you some gold ahmed sharpe said gold you know that word you little bugger dont you sharpe grinned then took clares hand and led her into the shadows a dog barked briefly a horse whinnied from the cavalry lines and afterwards there was silence chapter dodd needed to practise with the rifle and so on the day that the british reached the top of the high escarpment he settled himself in some rocks at the top of the cliff and gauged the range to the party of sepoys who were levelling the last few yards of the road unlike a musket the rifle had proper sights and he set the range at two hundred yards then propped the barrel in a stone cleft and aimed at a bluecoated engineer who was standing just beneath the sweating sepoys a gust of wind swept up the cliffs driving some circling buzzards high up into the air dodd waited until the wind settled then squeezed the trigger the rifle slammed into his shoulder with surprising force the smoke blotted his view instantly but another billow of wind carried it away and he was rewarded by the sight of the engineer bent double he thought he must have hit the man but then saw the engineer had been picking up his straw hat that must have fallen as he reacted to the close passage of the spinning bullet the engineer beat dust from the hat against his thigh and stared up at the drifting patch of smoke dodd wriggled back out of view and reloaded the rifle it was hard work the barrel of a rifle unlike a musket had spiralling grooves cast into the barrel to spin the bullet the spin made the weapon extraordinarily accurate but the grooves resisted the rammer and the resistance was made worse because the bullet if it was to be spun by the grooves had to fit the barrel tightly dodd wrapped a bullet in one of the small greased leather patches that gave the barrel purchase then grunted as he shoved the ramrod hard down one of the mahratta cavalrymen who escorted dodd on his daily rides shouted a warning and dodd peered over the rock to see that a company of sepoy infantry was scrambling to the top of the slope the first of them were already on the plateau and coming towards him he primed the rifle settled it on the makeshift fire step again and reckoned that he had not allowed for the effect of the wind on the last bullet he aimed at the sepoys officer a man whose small round spectacles reflected the sun and letting the barrel edge slightly windwards he fired again the rifle hammered back onto his shoulder smoke billowed as dodd ran to his horse and clambered into the saddle he slung the rifle turned the horse and saw that the redcoated officer was on the ground with two of his men kneeling beside him he grinned two hundred paces a wild volley of musketry followed the mahratta horsemen as they rode westwards towards gawilghur the balls rattled on rocks or whistled overhead but none of the cavalrymen was touched after half a mile dodd stopped dismounted and reloaded the rifle a troop of sepoy cavalry was climbing the last few yards of the road the men walking as they led their horses around the final steep bend dodd found another place to rest the rifle then waited for the cavalry to approach along the cliffs edge he kept the sights at two hundred yards he knew that was very long range even for a rifle but if he could hit at two hundred yards then he was confident of killing at a hundred or at fifty sahib the commander of his escort was worried by the more numerous sepoy cavalry who had now mounted and were trotting towards them in a minute dodd called back he picked his target another officer and waited for the man to ride into the rifles sights the wind was fitful it gusted blowing dust into dodds right eye and making him blink sweat trickled down his face the approaching cavalry had sabres drawn and the blades glittered in the sun one man carried a dusty pennant on a short staff they came raggedly twisting between the rocks and low bushes their horses kept their heads low tired after the effort of climbing the steep hill the officer curbed his horse to let his men catch up the wind died to nothing and dodd squeezed the trigger and flinched as the heavy stock slammed into his bruised shoulder sahib were going dodd said and he put his left foot into the stirrup and heaved himself into the saddle a glance behind showed a riderless horse and a score of men spurring forward to take revenge dodd laughed slung the rifle and kicked his horse into a canter he heard a shout behind as the sepoy cavalry were urged into the pursuit but dodd and his escort were mounted on fresh horses and easily outstripped the sepoys dodd curbed his horse on the neck of rocky land that led to gawilghurs outer fort the walls were thick with men who watched the enemys approach and the sight of those spectators gave dodd an idea he threw the rifle to the commander of his escort hold it for me he ordered then turned his horse to face the pursuing horsemen he waved his escort on towards the fortress and drew his sword it was a beautiful weapon european made then sent to india where craftsmen had given it a hilt of gold shaped like an elephants head the escort commander charged with protecting dodds life wanted to stay but dodd insisted he ride on ill join you in five minutes he promised dodd barred the road he glanced behind him once just to check that the outer forts ramparts were crowded with men then he looked back to the approaching cavalry they slowed as they reached the rock isthmus they could have kept galloping and dodd would then have turned his horse and outrun them but instead they curbed their sweating horses and just stood watching him from a hundred paces away they knew what he wanted but dodd saluted them with his sword just to make certain they understood his challenge a havildar urged his horse forward but then an english voice summoned him back and the man reluctantly turned the english officer drew his sabre he had lost his hat in the gallop along the edge of the cliff and had long fair hair that was matted with sweat and dirt he wore a black and scarlet jacket and was mounted on a tall bay gelding that was white with sweat he saluted dodd by holding his sabre up hilt before his face then he touched the geldings flanks with the tips of his spurs and the horse walked forward dodd spurred his own horse and the two slowly closed the englishman went into a trot then clapped his heels to drive his horse into a canter and dodd saw the puffs of dust spurting from the geldings hooves he kept his horse at a walk only touching it into a trot at the very last second as the englishman stood in his stirrups to deliver a scything cut with the sabre dodd tweaked the rein and his horse swerved to the left then he was turning it back right turning it all the way and the sabre had missed his head by a scant two inches and he had not even bothered to parry with his sword now he spurred the horse on following the officer who was trying to turn back and the englishman was still half turned still tugging on the reins as dodd attacked the sabre made an awkward parry that just managed to deflect the swords thrust dodd hacked back as he passed felt the blade thump home then he hauled on the reins and was turning again and the englishman was also turning so that the two horses seemed to curl around each other nose to tail and the sabre and sword rang together dodd was taller than his opponent but the young englishman who was a lieutenant and scarce looked a day over eighteen was strong and dodds blow had hardly broken the weave of his coat he gritted his teeth as he hacked at dodd and dodd parried parried again and the two blades locked hilt against hilt and dodd heaved to try and throw the young man off balance youre dodd arent you the lieutenant said seven hundred guineas to you boy traitor the young englishman spat dodd heaved then kicked the lieutenants horse so that it moved forward and he tried to slash back with his disengaged sword but the lieutenant turned the horse in again the men were too close to fight properly close enough to smell each others breath the lieutenants stank of tobacco they could hit their opponent with their sword hilts but not use the blades lengths if either horse had been properly schooled they could have been walked sideways away from the impasse but the horses would only go forward and dodd was the first to take the risk by using his spurs he used them savagely startling his horse so that it leaped ahead and even so he flinched from the expected slash as the sabre whipped towards his spine but the lieutenant was slow and the blow missed dodd rode twenty paces up the track towards the watching sepoys then turned again the lieutenant was gaining confidence and he grinned as the tall man charged at him he lowered the sabre using its point like a spearhead and urged his weary gelding into a trot dodd also had his sword at the lunge elbow locked and the two horses closed at frightening speed and then at the very last second dodd hauled on his rein and his horse went right to the lieutenants unguarded side and he brought the sword back across his body and then cut it forward in one fluid motion so that the blade raked across the lieutenants throat the sabre was still coming across to the parry when the blood spurted the lieutenant faltered and his horse stopped the young mans sword arm fell and dodd was turning he came alongside his opponent whose jacket was now dark with blood and he rammed the sword into the lieutenants neck a second time this time point first and the young man seemed to shake like a rat in a terriers jaws dodd hauled his sword free then scabbarded it he leaned over and took the sabre from the dying mans unresisting hand then pushed the lieutenant so that he toppled from the horse one of his feet was trapped in a stirrup but as dodd seized the geldings rein and hauled it round towards the fortress the boot fell free and the young man was left sprawling amidst his blood on the dusty road as dodd led his trophy homewards the indians on the ramparts cheered the sepoys spurred forward and dodd hurried ahead of them but the madrassi cavalrymen only rode as far as their officers body where they dismounted dodd rode on waving the captured sabre aloft a gun fired from the fort and the ball screamed over the rocky isthmus to crash home among the cavalrymen gathered about their officer a second gun fired and suddenly the british cavalry and their riderless horses were running away and the cheers on the wall redoubled manu bappoo was on the big buttress close to the gatehouse and he first pointed an admonitory finger at dodd chiding him for taking such a risk then he touched his hands together in thanks for dodds victory and finally raised his arms above his head to salute the hero dodd laughed and bowed his head in acknowledgement and saw to his surprise that his white coat was red with the lieutenants blood who would have thought the young man had so much blood in him he asked the leader of his escort at the fortress gate sahib the man answered puzzled never mind dodd took the rifle back then spurred his horse into gawilghurs delhi gate the men on the ramparts that edged the paved entranceway cheered him home he did not pause to speak to manu bappoo but instead rode through the outer fortress and out of its southern gate then led his captured horse down the steep path which slanted across the face of the ravine at the bottom the path turned sharply to the left before climbing to the inner forts massive gateway the four heavy gates that barred the entranceway were all opened for him and the hooves of his two horses echoed from the high walls as he clattered up the winding passage one by one the gates crashed shut behind and the thick locking bars were dropped into their brackets his groom waited beyond the last gate dodd swung down from his horse and gave both reins to the man ordering him to water the captured horse before he rubbed it down he handed his sword to his servant and told him to clean the blood from the blade and only then did he turn to face beny singh who had come waddling from the palace garden the killadar was dressed in a green silk robe and was attended by two servants one to hold a parasol above beny singhs perfumed head and the other clasping the killadars small white lap dog the cheering beny singh asked anxiously what was it the guns were firing he stared in horror at the blood soaked into dodds coat youre wounded colonel there was a fight dodd said and waited while one of the servants translated for the killadar dodd spoke a crude marathi but it was easier to use interpreters the djinns are here beny singh wailed the dog whimpered and the two servants looked nervous i killed a djinn dodd snarled he reached out and took hold of beny singhs plump hand and forced it against his wet coat it isnt my blood but it is fresh he rubbed the killadars hand into the gory patch then raised the plump fingers to his mouth keeping his eyes on beny singhs eyes he licked the blood from the killadars hand i am a djinn killadar dodd said letting go of the hand and i lap the blood of my enemies beny singh recoiled from the clammy touch of the blood he shuddered then wiped his hand on his silk robe when will they assault a week dodd guessed and then they will be defeated but what if they get in beny singh asked anxiously then they will kill you dodd said and afterwards rape your wife your concubines and your daughters theyll line up for the pleasure killadar theyll rut like hogs and dodd grunted like a pig and jerked his groin forward driving beny singh back they wont the killadar declared because they wont get in dodd said because some of us are men and we will fight i have poison beny singh said not comprehending dodds last words if they look like winning colonel youll send me word dodd smiled you have my promise sahib he said with a pretended humility better my women should die beny singh insisted better that you should die dodd said unless you want to be forced to watch the white djinns take their pleasure on your dying women they wouldnt what else do they want in here dodd asked have they not heard of the beauty of your women each night they talk of them around their fires and every day they dream of their thighs and their breasts they cant wait killadar the pleasures of your women pull the redcoats towards us beny singh fled from the horrid words and dodd smiled he had come to realize that only one man could command here beny singh was the fortress commander and though he was a despicable coward he was also a friend of the rajahs and that friendship ensured the loyalty of much of gawilghurs standing garrison the rest of the fortress defenders were divided into two camps there were manu bappoos soldiers led by the remnants of the lions of allah and loyal to the prince and dodds cobras but if only one of the three leaders was left then that man would rule gawilghur and whoever ruled gawilghur could rule all india dodd touched the stock of the rifle that would help and beny singhs abject terror would render the killadar harmless dodd smiled and climbed to the ramparts from where with a telescope he watched the british heave the first gun up to the edge of the plateau a week he thought maybe a day more and then the british would come to his slaughter and make his wildly ambitious dreams come true the fellow was using a rifle major stokes said in wonderment i do declare a rifle cant have been anything else at that range two hundred paces if it was an inch and he fanned my head a much underestimated weapon the rifle dont you think a toy captain morris said nothing will replace muskets but the accuracy stokes declared soldiers cant use rifles morris said it would be like giving knives and forks to hogs he twisted in the camp chair and gestured at his men the rds light company look at them half of them cant work out which end of a musket is which useless buggers might as well arm the bastards with pikes if you say so stokes said disapprovingly his road had reached the plateau and now he had to begin the construction of the breaching batteries and the rds light company which had escorted stokes north from mysore had been charged with the job of protecting the sappers who would build the batteries captain morris had been unhappy with the orders for he would have much preferred to have been sent back south rather than be camped by the rock isthmus that promised to be such a lively place in these next few days there was a chance that gawilghurs garrison might sally out to destroy the batteries and even if that danger did not materialize it was a certainty that the mahratta gunners on the outer forts walls would try to break down the new works with cannon fire sergeant hakeswill approached stokess tent he looked distracted so much so that his salute was perfunctory you heard the news sir he spoke to morris morris squinted up at the sergeant news he said heavily news cant say i have sergeant the enemy has surrendered perhaps nothing so good sir nothing so good you look pale man stokes said are you sickening heartsick sir thats what i am in my own self sir heartsick sergeant hakeswill sniffed heavily and even cuffed at a nonexistent tear on his twitching cheek captain torrance he announced is dead sir the sergeant took off his shako and held it against his breast dead sir dead stokes said lightly he had not met torrance took his own life sir thats what they do say he killed his clerk with a knife then turned his pistol on himself the sergeant demonstrated the action by pretending to point a pistol at his own head and pulling the trigger he sniffed again and he was as good an officer as ever i did meet and ive known many in my time officers and gentlemen like your own good self sir he said to morris morris as unmoved by torrances death as stokes smirked killed his clerk eh thatll teach the bugger to keep a tidy ledger they do say sir hakeswill lowered his voice that he must have been unnatural unnatural stokes asked with his clerk sir pardon me for breathing such a filthy thing him and the clerk sir cos he was naked see the captain was and the clerk was a handsome boy even if he was a blackamoor he washed a lot and the captain liked that are you suggesting it was a lovers tiff morris asked then laughed no sir hakeswill said turning to stare across the plateaus edge into the immense sky above the deccan plain because it werent the captain werent ever unnatural not like that it werent a lovers tiff sir not even if he was naked as a needle the captain sir he liked to go naked kept him cool he said and kept his clothes clean but there werent nothing strange in it not in him and he werent a man to be filthy and unnatural he liked the bibb is he did he was a christian a christian gentleman thats what he was and he didnt kill himself i knows who killed him i do morris gave stokes a shrug as if hakeswills maunderings were beyond understanding but the nub of the thing is sir hakeswill turned back to face morris and stood to attention that i aint with the bullocks no more sir ive got orders sir to be back with you where i belongs sir seeing as some other officer has got captain torrances duties and he didnt want me no more on account of having his own sergeant he replaced his shako then saluted morris under orders sir with privates kendrick and lowry sir others have taken over our bullocking duties sir and we is back with you like we always wanted to be sir welcome back sergeant morris said laconically im sure the company will be overjoyed at your return i knows they will sir hakeswill said im like a father to them sir i am hakeswill added to stokes stokes frowned who do you think killed captain torrance sergeant he asked and when hakeswill said nothing but just stood with his face twitching the major became insistent if you know man you must speak this is a crime you have a duty to speak hakeswills face wrenched itself it were him sir the sergeants eyes widened it were sharpie sir stokes laughed dont be so absurd man poor sharpe is a prisoner hes locked away in the fortress ive no doubt thats what we all hear sir hakeswill said but i knows better a touch of the sun morris explained to stokes then waved the sergeant away put your kit with the company sergeant and im glad youre back touched by your words sir hakeswill said fervently and im glad to be home sir back in me own kind where i belong he saluted again then swivelled on his heel and marched away salt of the earth morris said major stokes from his brief acquaintance with hakeswill was not sure of that verdict but he said nothing instead he wandered a few paces northwards to watch the sappers who were busy scraping at the plateaus thin soil to fill gabions that had been newly woven from green bamboo the gab ions great wicker baskets stuffed with earth would be stacked as a screen to soak up the enemy gunfire while the battery sites were being levelled stokes had already decided to do the initial work at night for the vulnerable time for making batteries close to a fortress was the first few hours and at night the enemy gunfire was likely to be inaccurate the major was making four batteries two the breaching ones would be constructed far down the isthmus among an outcrop of great black boulders that lay less than a quartermile from the fortress the rocks with the gab ions would provide the gunners some protection from the fortresss counterfire sappers hidden from the fort by the lie of the land were already driving a road to the proposed site of the breaching guns two other batteries would be constructed to the east of the isthmus on the edge of the plateau and those guns would enfilade the growing breaches there would be three breaches that decision had been made when stokes early in the dawn had crept as close to the fortress as he had dared and hidden among the tumbled rocks above the halffilled tank had examined the outer forts wall through his telescope he had stared a long time counting the gun embrasures and trying to estimate how many men were stationed on the bastions and fire steps those were details that did not really concern him for stokess business was confined to breaking the walls but what he saw encouraged him there were two walls both built on the steep slope which faced the plateau the slope was so steep that the base of the inner wall showed high above the parapet of the outer wall and that was excellent news for making a breach depended on being able to batter the base of a wall these walls built so long ago had never been designed to stop artillery but to deter men stokes knew he could lay his guns so that they would hammer both walls at once and that when the ancient stonework crumbled the rubble would spill forward down the slope to make natural ramps up which the attackers could climb the masonry seemed to have stayed largely unrepaired since it had been built stokes could tell that for the dark stones were covered with grey lichen and thick with weeds growing from the gaps between the blocks the walls looked formidable for they were high and well provided with massive bastions that would let the defenders provide flanking fire but stokes knew that the dressed stone of the two walls outer faces merely disguised a thick heart of piled rubble and once the facing masonry was shattered the rubble would spill out a few shots would then suffice to break the inner faces two days work he reckoned two days of hard gunnery should bring the walls tumbling down stokes had not made his reconnaissance alone but had been accompanied by lieutenant colonel william kenny of the east india company who would lead the assault on the breaches kenny a lantern jawed and taciturn man had lain beside stokes well he had finally asked after stokes had spent a silent five minutes examining the walls two days work sir stokes said if the mahrattas had taken the trouble to build a glacis it would have been two weeks work but such was their confidence that they had not bothered to protect the base of the outer wall kenny grunted if its that easy then give me two holes in the inner wall not the outer stokes asked one will serve me there kenny said putting an eye to his own telescope a good wide gap in the nearer wall stokes but not too near the main gate we shall avoid that the major said the main gate lay to the left so that the approach to the fortress was faced by high walls and bastions rather than by a gate vulnerable to artillery fire however this gate was massively defended by bastions and towers which suggested it would be thick with defenders straight up the middle kenny said wriggling back from his viewpoint give me a breach to the right of that main bastion and two on either side of it through the inner wall and well do the rest it would be easy enough to break down the walls but stokes still feared for kennys men their approach was limited by the existence of the great reservoir that lay on the right of the isthmus the water level was low and scummed green but the tank still constricted the assault route so that kennys men would be squeezed between the water and the sheer drop to the left that slender space scarce more than fifty feet at its narrowest would be furious with gunfire much of it coming from the fire steps above and around the main gate that flanked the approach stokes had already determined that his enfilading batteries should spare some shot for that gate in an attempt to unseat its cannon and unsettle its defenders now under the midday sun the major wandered among the sappers filling the gab ions he tested each one making certain that the sepoys i were ramming the earth hard into the wicker baskets for a loosely filled gabion was no use the finished gab ions were being stacked on ox carts while other carts piled with powder and shot waited nearby all was being done properly and the major stared out across the plateau where the newly arrived troops were making their camp the closest tents ragged and makeshift belonged to a troop of mahratta j horsemen who had allied themselves with the british stokes watching i the robed guards who sat close to the tents decided it would be best if he locked his valuables away and made sure his servant kept an eye on the trunk the rest of the mahratta horsemen had trotted northwards going to seek springs or wells for it was dry up here on the plateau dry and cooler than on the plain though it was still damned hot dust devils whirled between the farther tent rows where muskets were stacked in neat tripods some shirt sleeved officers presumably from the east india company battalions were playing cricket on a smoother stretch of turf watched by bemused sepoys and men from the scotch brigade not their game sir is it sir hakeswills voice disturbed stokes the major turned eh cricket sir too complicated for blackamoors and scotchmen sir on account of it being a game that needs brains sir do you play sergeant me sir no sir no time for frittering sir being as im a soldier back to front sir it does a man good to have a pastime stokes said your colonel now he plays the violin sir arthur does sir hakeswill said plainly not believing stokes hes never done it near me sir i assure you he does stokes said he was irritated by hakeswills presence he disliked the man intensely even though hakeswill had spent only a short time as sharpes substitute so what is it sergeant hakeswills face twitched come to be of use to you sir the reply puzzled stokes i thought youd been returned to company duties that i am sir and not before time but i was thinking of poor sharpie sir as you tell me he languishes in the heathens jail sir which i did not know sir until you told me stokes shrugged hes probably being fairly treated the mahrattas arent renowned for being unduly cruel to prisoners i was wondering if he left his pack with you sir why would he do that stokes asked i was just wondering sir officers dont like carrying their baggage everywhere sir not if they want to keep their dignity and if he did leave his pack with you sir then i thought as how we might relieve you of the responsibility sir seeing as how mister sharpe was a comrade of ours for so long thats what i was thinking sir stokes bridled but was not certain why it isnt a heavy responsibility sergeant never thought it was sir but it might be a nuisance to you sir seeing as how youre charged with other duties and i would relieve you of the responsibility sir stokes shook his head as it happens sergeant mister sharpe did leave his pack with me and i promised him i would keep it safe and im not a man to break promises sergeant i shall keep it as you chooses sir hakeswill said sourly just thought it was a christian act sir he turned and marched away stokes watched him then shook his head and turned back to gaze at the growing encampment tonight he thought tonight we shall make the batteries and tomorrow the big guns will be hauled forward another day to fill the magazines with powder and shot and then the stonebreaking could begin two days of battering of dust and rubble and smoke and then the cricketers could lead the charge across the isthmus poor men stokes thought poor men i hate night actions captain morris complained to hakeswill because of serryapatam sir a right dogs mess that was the battalion had attacked a wood outside seringapatam by night and the companies had become separated some became lost and the enemy had punished them morris attached his scabbard to its slings and pulled his hat on it was dark outside and soon the oxen would drag the gab ions forward to the position stokes had chosen for the breaching batteries it would be a prime moment for the enemy to sally out of the fortress so morris and his company must form a picquet line ahead of the proposed batteries they must watch the fortress and if an attack was made they must resist it then slowly fall back protecting the sappers until the reserve troops a battalion of sepoys could be brought forward from the plateau with any luck morris fervently hoped the enemy would stay in bed evening morris major stokes was indecently cheerful your lads are ready they are sir stokes led morris a few yards from his tent and stared towards the fortress that was nothing but a dark shape in the night beyond the closer blackness of the rocks the thing is stokes said that theyre bound to see our lanterns and must hear the carts so theyre liable to unleash a pretty furious artillery barrage maybe rockets as well but take no heed of it your only job is to watch for infantry coming from the gate i know sir so dont use your muskets i hear musket fire captain and i think infantry then i send for the madrassi lads and the next moment the whole place is swarming with redcoats who cant tell whos who in the dark so no firing you understand unless you see enemy infantry then send a message to me fight the good fight and wait for support morris grunted he had been told this twice already and did not need the instructions a third time but he still turned to the company which was paraded and ready no ones to fire without my express permission you understand they understands sir hakeswill answered for the company one musket shot without permission and the culprits earned himself a skinned back sir morris took the company forward following the old road that led directly to the gateway of the outer fort the night was horribly dark and within a few paces of leaving the engineers encampment morris could hardly see the road at all his mens boots scuffed loud on the hardpacked stones they went slowly feeling their way and using what small light came from the merest sliver of moon that hung like a silver blade above gawilghur permission to speak sir hakeswills hoarse voice sounded close to morris not too loud sergeant like a mouse sir quiet i will be but sir if were here does that mean well be joining the assault on the fort sir god no morris said fervently hakeswill chuckled i thought i should ask sir on account of making a will a will morris asked you need a will i have some wealth hakeswill said defensively and soon he reckoned he would have even more for he had cleverly confirmed his surmise that sharpes missing pack was in major stokess keeping you have some wealth do you morris asked sarcastically and who the hell will you leave it to your own self sir if youll forgive me sir no family apart from the army sir which is mothers milk to me by all means make your will morris said connors can draw one up for you connors was the company clerk i trust of course that the document proves redundant whatever that means sir i hopes the same the two men fell silent the dark loom of the fortress was much closer now and morris was nervous what was the point of this futile exercise anyway he would be damned if he would be able to see any enemy infantrymen not in this pitch black unless the fools decided to carry a lantern some lights showed in gawilghur there was a glow above the outer fort that must have been cast by the fires and lights in the inner fort while closer morris could see a couple of flickering patches where fires or torches burned inside the nearer de fences but those scattered lights would not help him see an enemy force debouching from the gate far enough he called he was not really sure if he had gone close enough to the fort but he had no fancy to go further and so he stopped and hissed at hakeswill to spread the men westwards across the isthmus five paces between each pair of men sergeant five paces it is sir if anyone sees or hears anything theyre to pass the message back here to me theyll do so sir and no fools to light a pipe you hear me dont want the enemy spraying us with canister because some blockhead needs tobacco your orders is noted sir and where would you want me sir far end of the line sergeant morris was the sole officer with the company for both his lieutenant and ensign had the fever and so had stayed in mysore but hakeswill he reckoned was as good as any lieutenant you can order men to fire if youre certain you see the enemy but god help you if youre wrong very good sir hakeswill said then hissed at the men to spread out they vanished into the blackness for a moment there was the sound of boots the thump of musket stocks hitting rocks and the grunts as the redcoats settled but then there was silence or near silence the wind sighed at the cliffs edge while from the fort there drifted a plangent and discordant music that rose and fell with the winds vagaries worse than bagpipes morris thought sourly the first axle squeals sounded as the oxen dragged the gab ions forward the noise would be continuous now and sooner or later the enemy must react by opening fire and what chance would he have of seeing anything then morris wondered the gun flashes would blind him the first he would see of an enemy would be the glint of starlight on a blade he spat waste of time morris a voice hissed from the dark captain morris here he turned towards the voice which had come from behind him on the road back to the plateau here colonel kenny the voice said still in a sibilant whisper dont mind me prowling around of course not sir morris did not like the idea of a senior officer coming to the picquet line but he could hardly send the man away honoured to have you sir he said then hissed a warning to his men senior officer present dont be startled pass the word on morris heard kennys footsteps fade to his right there was the low murmur of a brief conversation then silence again except for the demonic squeal of the oxcart axles a moment later a lantern light showed from behind the rocks where stokes was making one of his main batteries morris braced himself for the enemy reaction but the fortress stayed silent the noise grew louder as the sappers heaved the gab ions from the carts and manhandled them up onto the rocks to form the thick bastion a man swore others grunted and the great baskets thumped on stone another lantern was unmasked and this time the man carrying it stepped up onto the rocks to see where the gab ions were being laid a voice ordered him to get down the fort at last woke up morris could hear footsteps hurrying along the nearer fire step and he saw a brief glow as a linstock was plucked from a barrel and blown into red life jesus he said under his breath and a moment later the first gun fired the flame stabbed bright as a lance from the walls its glare momentarily lighting all the rocky isthmus and the greenscummed surface of the tank before it was blotted out by the rolling smoke the round shot screamed overhead struck a rock and ricocheted wildly up into the sky a second gun fired its flame lighting the first smoke cloud from within so that it seemed as if the wall of the fort was edged with a brief vaporous luminance the ball struck a gabion breaking it apart in a spray of earth a man groaned dogs were barking in the british camp and inside the fortress morris stared towards the dark gateway he could see nothing because the guns flames had robbed him of his night vision or rather he could see wraithlike shapes which he knew were more likely to be his imagination than the approach of some savage enemy the guns were firing steadily now aiming at the small patch of lantern light but then more lights brighter ones appeared to the west of the isthmus and some of the gunners switched their aim not knowing that stokes had unveiled the second lights as a feint then the first rockets were fired and they were even more dazzling than the guns the fiery trails seemed to limp up from the forts bastions seething smoke and sparks then they leaped up into the air wobbling in their flight to sear over morriss head and slash north towards the camp none went near their targets but their sound and the flaming exhausts were nerveracking the first shells were fired and they added to the nights din as they cracked apart among the rocks to whistle shards of shattered casing over the struggling sappers the firing was deliberate as the gun captains took care to lay their pieces before firing but still there were six or seven shots every minute while the rockets were more constant morris tried to use the brightness of the rocket trails to see the ground between his hiding place and the fort but there was too much smoke the shadows flickered wildly and his imagination made movement where there was none he held his fire reckoning he would hear the gate open or the sound of enemy footsteps he could hear the defenders shouting on the wall either calling insults to the enemy hidden in the dark or else encouraging each other hakeswill at the very righthand end of the line cowered among the rocks he had been sheltering with kendrick and lowry but the enemy cannonade had driven him still further right to where there was a deep cleft he knew he was safe there but even so every screaming rocket made him flinch while the sound of the shells exploding and the round shots cracking against stone made him draw his knees up into his chest he knew there was a senior officer visiting the picquet line because the message telling of the colonels presence had been passed down the line kennys visit struck hakeswill as a daft thing for any man with gold braid on his coat to do but when the colonel hissed his name aloud he kept silent at least he assumed it was the visiting officer for the summons was insistent and authoritative but hakeswill ignored it he did not want to draw attention to himself in case the heathen blackamoor gunners aimed their cannon at him let the officer hiss away he decided and a moment later the man went away who are you a low voice asked private kendrick just a few yards from hakeswills hiding place kendrick sir to me private i need your help kendrick slipped back towards the voice bastard interfering officer he thought but he had to obey where are you sir he asked here man hurry now hurry kendrick slipped on a slanting stone and sat down with a bump a rocket slashed overhead spewing fire and sparks and in its brief light he saw a shadow above him then felt a blade at his throat one noise the voice hissed and youre dead kendrick went very still he did not make any noise at all but he still died a lucky shell struck a pair of oxen disembowelling the beasts that lowed pitifully as they collapsed onto the road get them out of the way a voice roared and sepoys struggled with the massive animals cutting their harnesses and pulling the dying beasts into the rocks other men ran the empty cart back to the encampment making way for the next wagon to drag more gab ions forward kill them the officer ordered use your bayonets no musket fire the sepoys finished off the oxen stabbing again and again into their thick necks while the bloody hooves thrashed violently another shell landed nearby slicing its fragments among the rocks the road was slippery with spilled guts over which the next cart rolled impassively its axle screeching like a demon all well soldier a voice asked private lowry yes sir im colonel kenny the man said dropping down beside lowry yes sir lowry acknowledged nervously see anything nothing sir lowry said then gasped as he felt a blade at his throat wheres hakeswill the voice hissed in his ear and lowry suddenly knew this was not colonel kenny who had him in a tight grip dunno sir lowry said then began to cry out but the cry was cut off as the blade sawed deep into his gullet a ball fired low struck plumb on the great boulder that sheltered hakeswill and the sergeant whimpered as he tried to wriggle deeper into the cleft a rocket landed thirty paces behind him and began to chase its tail whirling about on the turf scattering sparks until it finally lodged against a rock and burned itself out in a display of small blue flames another round shot hammered into the gab ions but now they were well stacked and the balls impact was soaked up by the tight packed soil a whistle blew from the battery site then blew twice more morris relieved by the sound called to the men to his right back to the road pass it on back to the road thank god the worst of the ordeal was over now he was supposed to withdraw to the battery ready to protect it through the remaining hours of the dark night but morris knew he would feel a good deal safer once he was behind the gab ions just as he knew that the cessation of the work would probably persuade the mahrattas to cease fire close on me he called to his company hurry the message was passed along the picquet line and the men ran at a crouch back to where morris waited they bumped into each other as they gathered then squatted as morris called for hakeswill not here sir sergeant green finally decided count the men sergeant morris ordered sergeant green numbered the men off three missing sir he reported hakeswill lowry and kendrick damn them morris said a rocket hissed up from the gatehouse twisted in the night to leave a crazy trail of flameedged smoke then dived down to the left far down plunging into the ravine that edged the isthmus the light of the exhaust flashed down the steep cliffs finally vanishing a thousand feet below morris two guns fired together their balls hammering towards the fake lanterns the battery lanterns had vanished evidence that the sappers had finished their work take the men to the battery morris ordered green garrard you stay with me morris did not want to do anything heroic but he knew he could not report that he had simply lost three men so he took private tom garrard west across the tumbled ground where the picquet line had been stretched they called out the names of the missing men but no reply came it was garrard who stumbled over the first body dont know who it is sir but hes dead bloody mess he is morris swore and crouched beside the body a rockets bright passage showed him a slit throat and a spill of blood it also revealed that the man had been stripped of his coat which lay discarded beside the corpse the sight of the gaping throat made morris gag theres another here sir garrard called from a few paces away jesus morris twisted aside willing himself not to throw up but the bile was sour in his throat he shuddered then managed to take a deep breath were going you want me to look for the other fellow sir garrard asked come on morris fled not wanting to stay in this dark charnel house garrard followed the gunfire died a last rocket stitched sparks across the stars then gawilghur was silent again hakeswill cowered in his hiding place shuddering as the occasional flare of an exploding shell or passing rocket cast lurid shadows into the narrow cleft he thought he heard lowry call aloud but the sound was so unexpected and so quickly over he decided it was his nerves then blessedly he heard the whistle that signalled that the sappers were done with their work and a moment later he heard the message being called along the line back to the road back to the road the rockets and guns were still battering the night so hakeswill stayed where he was until he sensed that the fury of the fire was diminishing then he crept out of his cleft and still keeping low scuttled eastwards hakeswill a voice called nearby he froze hakeswill the voice was insistent some instinct told the sergeant that there was mischief in the dark and so hakeswill crouched lower still he heard something moving in the night the scrape of leather on stone the sound of breathing but the man did not come close to hakeswill who petrified edged on another pace his hand feeling the ground ahead of him suddenly found something wet and sticky he flinched brought his fingers to his nose and smelt blood jesus he swore under his breath he groped again and this time found a corpse his hands explored the face the open mouth then found the gaping wound in the neck he jerked his hand back it had to be lowry or kendrick for this was about where he had left the two privates and if they were dead or even if only one of them was dead then it meant that captain torrances death had been no lovers tiff not that hakeswill had ever believed it was he knew who it was bloody sharpe was alive bloody sharpe was hunting his enemies and three maybe four were already dead and hakeswill knew he would be next hakeswill the voice hissed but farther away now a gun fired from the fort and in its flash hakeswill saw a cloaked shape to his north the man was crossing the skyline not far from hakeswill but at least he was going away sharpe it had to be sharpe and a terror grew in hakeswill so that his face twitched and his hands shook think you bugger he told himself think and the answer came a sweet answer so obvious that he wondered why he had taken so long to find it sharpe was alive he was not a prisoner in gawilghur but haunting the british camp which meant that there was one place that would be utterly safe for hakeswill to go he could go to the fortress and sharpe would never reach him there for the rumour in the camp was that the assault on gawilghur was likely to be a desperate and bloody business likely to fail some men said and even if it did not hakeswill could always pretend he had been taken prisoner all he wanted at this moment was to be away from sharpe and so he sidled southwards down the hill and once he reached the flatter ground he ran towards the now dark walls of the fort through the drifting skeins of foulsmelling powder smoke he ran past the tank along the approach road and round to the left where the great gatehouse loomed above him in the dark and once there he pounded on the massive ironstudded doors no one responded he pounded again using the butt of his musket scared witless that the sound would bring an avenging horror from the dark behind and suddenly a small wicket gate in the larger door was pulled open to flood flame light into the night im a deserter hakeswill hissed im on your side hands seized him and pulled him through the small doorway a smoking torch burned high on the wall to show hakeswill the long narrow entranceway the dark ramparts and the dark faces of the men who had him prisoner im on your side he shouted as the gate was closed behind him and his musket was snatched away im on your side a tall hawkfaced man strode down the stone road who are you he asked in english im someone willing to fight for you sir willing and able sir old soldier sir my name is manu bappoo the man said in a sibilant voice and i command here very good sir sahib i mean very good hakeswill bobbed his head hakeswill sir is my name sergeant obadiah hakeswill manu bappoo stared at the redcoat he disliked deserters a man who deserted his flag could not be trusted under any other flag but the news that a white soldier had run from the enemy ranks could only hearten his garrison better he decided to leave this man alive as a witness to the enemys crumbling morale than shoot him out of hand take him to colonel dodd he ordered one of his men give him back his firelock hes on our side so hakeswill was inside gawilghur and among the enemy but he was safe from the terror that had turned his life to sudden nightmare he was safe from sharpe chapter the sappers who had em placed the gab ions were too excited to go to sleep and instead were milling about a pair of smoky fires their laughter rose and fell on the night wind major stokes pleased with their work had produced three jars of arrack as a reward and the jugs were being passed from hand to hand sharpe watched the small celebration and then keeping to the shadows among syud sevajees encampment he went to a small tent where he stripped off his borrowed indian robes before crawling under the flap in the dark he blundered into clare who kept awake by the sound of the bombardment and then by the voices of the sappers put up a hand and felt bare flesh youre undressed she sounded alarmed not quite sharpe said then understood her fear my clothes were soaking he explained so i took them off didnt want to wet the bed eh and ive still got my shirt on is it raining i didnt hear it it was blood he said then rummaged under the blanket he had borrowed from syud sevajee and found torrances pouch clare heard the rattle of stones what is it just stones he said pebbles he put the twenty jewels he had retrieved from kendrick and lowry into the pouch stowed it safe under the blanket then lay down he doubted he had found every stone but he reckoned he had retrieved most of them they had been loose in the two privates pockets not even hidden away in their coat seams god he felt tired and his body had still not recovered from hakeswills kicking it hurt to breathe the bruises were tender and a tooth was still loose what happened out there clare asked the engineers put the gab ions in place when its light theyll scrape the gun platform and make the magazines and tomorrow night theyll bring up the guns what happened to you clare amended her question sharpe was silent for a while i looked up some old friends he said but he had missed hakeswill damn it and hakeswill would be doubly alert now still a chance would come he grinned as he remembered morriss scared voice the captain was a bully to his men and a to adie to his superiors did you kill someone clare asked two men he admitted but it should have been three why he sighed because they were bad men he said simply then reflected it was a true answer and because they tried to kill me he added and they robbed me you knew them he went on kendrick and lowry they were horrid clare said softly they used to stare at me cant blame them for that love she was silent for a while the laughter of the sappers was subsiding as men drifted towards their tents the wind gusted at the tents entrance and brought the smell of burnt powder from the rocky isthmus where patches of grass still flamed around the exhausted rocket tubes everythings gone wrong hasnt it clare said its being put right sharpe replied for you she said again she was silent and sharpe suspected she was crying ill get you home to madras he said and whatll happen to me there youll be all right lass ill give you a pair of my magic pebbles what i want she said softly is to go home but i cant afford it marry a soldier sharpe said and be carried home with him he thought of eli lockhart who had been admiring clare from a distance they would suit each other sharpe thought she was crying very softly torrance said hed pay my way home when id paid off the debt she said why would he make you work for one passage then give you another sharpe asked he was a lying bastard he seemed so kind at first were all like that sharpe said soft as lights when you first meet a woman then you get what you want and it changes i dont know maybe not every time charlie wasnt like that clare said charlie your husband he was always good to me sharpe lay back the light of the dying fires nickered in the tents loose weave if it rained he thought the cloth would leak like a pepper pot there are good men and bad he said what are you clare asked i think im good he said but i dont know all the time i get into trouble and i only know one way out i can fight i can do that all right is that what you want to fight god knows what i want he laughed softly i wanted to be an officer more than id wanted anything in my life i dreamed of it i did i wanted it so bad that it hurt and then the dream came true and it woke me up and i wondered why id wanted it so much he paused syud sevajees horses stamped their feet softly behind the tent some buggers are trying to persuade me to leave the army sell the commission see they dont want me why not because i piss in their soup lass so will you leave he shrugged dont want to he thought about it its like a club a society they dont really want me so they chuck me out and then i have to fight my way back in but why do i do it if they dont want me i dont know maybe itll be different in the rifles ill try em anyway and see if theyre different you want to go on fighting clare asked its what im good at sharpe said and i do enjoy it i mean i know you shouldnt but there aint any other excitement like it none well one he grinned in the dark there was a long silence and he thought clare had fallen asleep but then she spoke again how about your french widow shes gone sharpe said flatly gone she buggered off love took some money of mine and went gone to america im told clare lay in silence again dont you worry about being alone she asked after a while no i do he turned towards her propped himself on an elbow and stroked her hair she stiffened as he touched her then relaxed to the gentle pressure of his hand you aint alone lass sharpe said or only if you want to be you got trapped thats all it happens to everyone but youre out now youre free he stroked her hair down to her neck and felt warm bare skin under his hand she did not move and he softly stroked farther down youre undressed he said i was warm she said in a small voice whats worse sharpe asked being warm or being lonely he thought she smiled he could not tell in the dark but he thought she smiled being lonely she said very softly we can look after that he said lifting the thin blanket and moving to her side she had stopped crying somewhere outside a cock crowed and the eastern cliffs were touched with the first gold of the day the fires on the rocky neck of land flickered and died their smoke drifting like patches of thin mist bugles called from the main encampment summoning the redcoats to the morning parade the night picquets were relieved as the sun rose to flood the world with light where sharpe and clare slept you abandoned the dead men wellesley growled captain morris blinked as a gust of wind blew dust into one of his eyes i tried to bring the bodies in he lied but it was dark sir very dark colonel kenny can vouch for that sir he visited us i visited you kenny lean tall and irascible was standing beside the general i visited you he asked again his inflection rising to outrage last night sir morris answered in plaintive indignation on the picquet line i did no such thing suns gone to your head kenny glowered at morris then took a snuff box from a pocket and placed a pinch on his hand who the devil are you anyway he added morris sir rd i thought we had nothing but scots and sepoys here kenny said to wellesley captain morriss company escorted a convoy here wellesley answered a light company eh kenny said glancing at morriss epaulettes you might even be useful i could do with another company in the assault party he snorted the snuff stopping one nostril at a time it cheers my boys up he added seeing white men killed kenny commanded the first battalion of the tenth madrassi regiment whats in your assault unit now wellesley asked nine companies kenny said the grenadiers and two others from the scotch brigade the flankers from my regiment and four others good boys all of them but i daresay they wont mind sharing the honours with an english light company and ive no doubt youll welcome a chance to assault a breach morris wellesley asked drily of course sir morris said cursing kenny inwardly but in the meantime wellesley went on coldly bring your mens bodies in yes sir do it now sergeant green took a halfdozen men down the neck of land but they only found two bodies they were expecting three but sergeant hakeswill was missing the enemy seeing the redcoats among the rocks above the reservoir opened fire and the musket balls smacked into stones and ricocheted up into the air green took a bullet in the heel of his boot it did not break the skin of his foot but the blow hurt and he hopped on the short dry grass just grab the buggers and drag them away he said he wondered why the enemy did not fire their cannon and just then a gun discharged a barrel of canister at his squad the balls hissed all about the men but miraculously none was hit as the soldiers seized kendrick and lowry by their feet and ran back towards the halfcompleted battery where captain morris waited both the dead men had slit throats once safe behind the gab ions the corpses were treated more decorously by being placed on makeshift stretchers colonel kenny intercepted the stretcherbearers to examine the corpses which were already smelling foul they must have sent a dozen cutthroats out of the fort he reckoned you say theres a sergeant missing yes sir morris answered poor fellow must be a prisoner be careful tonight captain theyll probably try again and i assure you captain if i decide to take a stroll this evening it wont be to your picquet line that night the rds light company again formed a screen in front of the new batteries this time to protect the men dragging up the guns it was a nervous night for the company was expecting throatslitting mahrattas to come silently through the darkness but nothing stirred the fortress stayed silent and dark not a gun fired and not a rocket flew as the british cannon were hauled to their new emplacements and as powder charges and round shot were stacked in the newly made ready magazines then the gunners waited the first sign of dawn was a grey lightening of the east followed by the flare of reflected sun as the first rays lanced over the worlds rim to touch the summit of the eastern cliffs the fortress walls showed grey black still the gunners waited a solitary cloud glowed livid pink on the horizon smoke rose from the cooking fires inside the fortress where the flags hung limp in the windless air bugles roused the british camp which lay a halfmile behind the batteries where officers trained telescopes on gawilghurs northern wall major stokess job was almost finished he had made the batteries and now the gunners must unmake the walls but first stokes wanted to be certain that the outermost breach would be made in the right place he had fixed a telescope to a tripod and now he edged it from side to side searching the lichencovered stones just to the right of a bastion in the centre of the wall the wall sloped back slightly but he was sure he could see a place where the old stones bulged out of alignment and he watched that spot as the sun rose and cast a hint of shadow where the stones were not quite true finally he screwed the telescopes mount tight shut so that the tube could not move then summoned the gun captain of the batterys eighteenpounder a major actually commanded this battery but he insisted that his sergeant go to the spyglass thats your target stokes told the sergeant the sergeant stooped to the telescope then straightened to see over the glass then stooped again he was chewing a wad of tobacco and had no lower front teeth so that the yellow spittle ran down his chin in a continuous dribble he straightened then stooped a third time the telescope was powerful and all he could see in the glass circle was a vertical joint between two great stones the joint was some four feet above the walls base and when it gave way the wall would spill forward down the slope to make the ramp up which the attackers could swarm smack on the joint sir the sergeant asked in a northumbrian accent so pronounced that stokes did not at first understand him low on the joint stokes said low it is sir the sergeant said and stooped to squint through the glass once more the joint gapes a bit dont it it does stokes said the sergeant grunted for a while he reckoned the battering would drive the stones in sealing the gap but there was pressure there and the wall must eventually give way as the battered stones weakened that buggerll burst like an abscess the sergeant said happily straightening from the telescope he returned to his gun and barked at his men to make some minute adjustments to its trail he himself heaved on the elevating screw though as yet the gun was still masked by some half filled gab ions that blocked the embrasure every few seconds the sergeant climbed onto the trail to see over the gab ions then he would demand that the gun was shifted a halfinch left or a fingers breadth to the right as he made another finicky adjustment to the screw he tossed grass in the air to gauge the wind then twisted the elevation again to raise the barrel a tiny amount stone cold shot he explained to stokes so im pointing her a bit high maybe a half turn more he hammered the screw with the heel of his hand perfect he said the pucka lees were bringing water which they poured into great wooden tubs the water was not just to slake the gunners thirst and soak the sponges that cleaned out the barrels between shots but was also intended to cool the great weapons the sun was climbing it promised to be a searing hot day and if the huge guns were not drenched intermittently with water they could overheat and explode the powder charges prematurely the sergeant was choosing his shot now rolling two eighteenpounder balls up and down a stretch of bare earth to judge which was the more perfect sphere that one he said spitting tobacco juice onto his chosen missile morriss light company trailed back up the road going to the camp where they would sleep stokes watched them pass and thought of sharpe poor sharpe but at least from wherever he was imprisoned inside the fortress he would hear the siege guns and know that the redcoats were coming if they got through the breach stokes thought gloomily or if they ever managed to cross the fortresss central ravine he tried to suppress his pessimism telling himself that his job was simply to make the breach not win the whole victory the chosen shot was rolled into the guns muzzle then rammed down onto the canvas bags of powder the sergeant took a length of wire that hung looped on his belt and rammed it through the cannons touchhole piercing the canvas bag beneath then selected a priming tube a reed filled with finely milled powder and slid it down into the powder charge but leaving a halfinch of the reed protruding above the touchhole ready when you are sir he told the major commanding the battery who in turn looked at stokes stokes shrugged i imagine we wait for colonel stevensons permission the gunners in the second breaching battery which lay fifty yards west of the first had trained their telescopes over the gab ions to watch where the first shot fell the scar it left in the wall would be their aiming mark the two enfilading batteries also watched their work would begin properly when the first of the three breaches was made but till then their twelvepounders would be aimed at the cannon mounted on gawilghurs ramparts trying to dismount them or tumble their embrasures into rubble that wall wont last long the battery major whose name was plummer opined he was staring at the wall through stokess telescope well have it opened up today stokes agreed thank god there aint a glacis plummer said thank god indeed stokes echoed piously but he had been thinking about that lack and was not so sure now that it was a blessing perhaps the mahrattas understood that their real defence was the great central ravine and so were offering nothing but a token defence of the outer fort and how was that ravine to be crossed stokes feared that he would be asked for an engineering solution but what could he do fill the thing with soil that would take months stokess gloomy presentiments were interrupted by an aide who had been sent by colonel stevenson to enquire why the batteries were silent i suspect those are your orders to open fire plummer stokes said unmask plummer shouted four gunners clambered up onto the bastion and manhandled the halffilled gab ions out of the cannons way the sergeant squinted down the barrel a last time nodded to himself then stepped aside the other gunners had their hands over their ears you can fire ned plummer called to the sergeant who took a glowing linstock from a protective barrel reached across the guns high wheel and touched the fire to the reed the cannon hammered back a full five yards as the battery filled with acrid smoke the ball screamed low across the stony neck of land to crack against the forts wall there was a pause defenders were running along the ramparts stokes was peering through the glass waiting for the smoke to thin it took a full minute but then he saw that a slab of stone about the size of a soup plate had been chipped from the wall two inches to the right sergeant he called chidingly must have been a puff of wind sir the sergeant said puff of bloody wind cos there werent a thing wrong with guns laying begging your pardon sir you did well stokes said with a smile very well he cupped his hands and shouted at the second breaching battery you have your mark fire on a billow of smoke erupted from the fortress wall followed by the bang of a gun and a howl as a round shot whipped overhead stokes jumped down into the battery clutching his hat it seems weve woken them up he remarked as a dozen more mahratta guns fired the enemys shots smacked into the gab ions or ricocheted wildly along the rocky ground the second british battery fired the noise of its guns echoing off the cliff face to tell the camp far beneath that the siege of gawilghur had properly begun private tom garrard of the rds light company had wandered to the edge of the cliff to watch the bombardment of the fortress not that there was much to see other than the constantly replenished cloud of smoke that shrouded the rocky neck of land between the batteries and the fortress but every now and then a large piece of stone would fall from gawilghurs wall the fire from the de fences was furious but it seemed to garrard that it was ill aimed many of the shots bounced over the batteries or else buried themselves in the great piles of protective gab ions the british fire on the other hand was slow and sure the eighteenpound round shots gnawed at the wall and not one was wasted the sky was cloudless the sun rising ever higher and the guns were heating so that after every second shot the gunners poured buckets of water on the long barrels the metal hissed and steamed and sweating puckakes hurried up the battery road with yet more skins of water to replenish the great vats garrard was sitting by himself but he had noticed a ragged indian was watching him he ignored the man hoping he would go away but the indian edged closer garrard picked up a fistsized stone and tossed it up and down in his right hand as a hint that the man should go away but the threat of the stone only made the indian edge closer sahib the indian hissed bugger off garrard growled sahib please ive got nothing worth stealing i dont want to buy anything and i dont want to roger your sister ill roger your sister instead sahib the indian said and garrard twisted round the stone drawn back ready to throw then he saw that the dirty robed man had pushed back his grubby white head cloth and was grinning at him you aint supposed to chuck rocks at officers tom sharpe said mind you i always wanted to so i cant blame you bloody hell garrard dropped the stone and held out his right hand dick sharpe he suddenly checked his outstretched hand do i have to call you sir of course you dont sharpe said taking garrards hand you and me friends from way back eh red sash wont change that tom how are you been worse yourself been better garrard frowned didnt i hear that youd been captured got away i did aint a bugger born who can hold me tom nor you sharpe sat next to his friend a man with whom he had marched in the ranks for six years here he gave garrard a strip of dried meat what is it goat tastes all right though the two sat and watched the gunners at work the closest guns were in the two enfilading batteries and the gunners were using their twelve pounders to systematically bring down the parapets of the ramparts above gawilghurs gate they had already unseated a pair of enemy guns and were now working on the next two embrasures an oxdrawn limber had just delivered more ammunition but on leaving the battery the limbers wheel had loosened and five men were now standing about the canted wheel arguing how best to mend it garrard pulled a piece of stringy meat from between his teeth pull the broken wheel off and put on a new one he said scornfully it dont take a major and two lieutenants to work that out theyre officers tom sharpe said chidingly only half brained you should know garrard grinned buggers make an inviting target though he pointed across the plunging chasm which separated the plateau from the inner fort theres a bloody great gun over there size of a bloody hay wain it is buggers have been fussing about it for a halfhour now sharpe stared past the beleaguered outer fort to the distant cliffs he thought he could see a wall where a gun might be mounted but he was not sure i need a bloody telescope you need a bloody uniform im doing something about that sharpe said mysteriously garrard slapped at a fly whats it like then whats what like being a jackpudding sharpe shrugged thought for a while then shrugged again dont seem real well it does i dunno he sighed i mean i wanted it tom i wanted it real bad but i should have known the bastards wouldnt want me some are all right major stokes hes a fine fellow and there are others but most of them god knows they dont like me anyway you got em worried thats why garrard said if you can become an officer so can others he saw the unhappiness on sharpes face wishing youd stayed a sergeant are you no sharpe said and surprised himself by saying it so firmly i can do the job tom what jobs that for christs sake sitting around while we do all the bloody work having a servant to clean your boots and scrub your arse no sharpe said and he pointed across the shadowed chasm to the inner fort when we go in there tom were going to need fellows who know what the hell theyre doing thats the job its beating hell out of the other side and keeping your own men alive and i can do that garrard looked sceptical if they let you aye if they let me sharpe agreed he sat in silence for a while watching the far gun emplacement he could see men there but was not sure what they were doing wheres hakeswill he asked i looked for him yesterday and the bugger wasnt on parade with the rest of you captured garrard said captured thats what morris says me i think the bugger ran either ways hes in the fort now you think he ran we had two fellows murdered the other night morris says it were the enemy but i didnt see any of the buggers but there was some fellow creeping round saying he was a company colonel only he werent garrard stared at sharpe and a slow grin came to his face it were you dick me sharpe asked straightfaced i was captured tom only escaped yesterday and im the king of bloody persia lowry and kendrick were meant to arrest you werent they it was them who died sharpe asked innocently garrard laughed serve them bloody right bastards both of them an enormous blossom of smoke showed at the distant wall on the top of the cliffs two seconds later the sound of the great gun bellowed all around sharpe and garrard while the massive round shot struck the stalled limber just behind the enfilading battery the wooden vehicle shattered into splinters and all five men were hurled to the ground where they jerked bloodily for a few seconds and then were still fragments of stone and wood hissed past sharpe bloody hell garrard said admiringly five men with one shot thatll teach em to keep their heads down sharpe said the sound of the enormous gun had drawn men from their tents towards the plateaus edge sharpe looked round and saw that captain morris was among them the captain was in his shirtsleeves staring at the great cloud of smoke through a telescope im going to stand up in a minute sharpe said and youre going to hit me im going to do what garrard asked youre going to thump me then im going to run and youre going to chase me but youre not to catch me garrard offered his friend a puzzled look what are you up to dick sharpe grinned dont ask tom just do it you are a bloody officer arent you garrard said grinning back dont ask just do it are you ready sharpe asked ive always wanted to clobber an officer on your feet then they stood so hit me sharpe said ive tried to pinch some cartridges off you right so give me a thump in the belly bloody hell garrard said go on do it garrard gave sharpe a halfhearted punch and sharpe shoved him back making him fall then he turned and ran along the cliffs edge garrard shouted scrambled to his feet and began to pursue some of the men who had gone to fetch the five bodies moved to intercept sharpe but he dodged to his left and disappeared among some bushes the rest of the rds light company was whooping and shouting in pursuit but sharpe had a long lead on them and he twisted in and out of the shrubs to where he had picketed one of syud sevajees horses he pulled the peg loose hauled himself into the saddle and kicked back his heels someone yelled an insult at him but he was clear of the camp now and there were no mounted picquets to pursue him a halfhour later sharpe returned trotting with a group of native horsemen coming back from a reconnaissance he peeled away from them and dismounted by his tent where ahmed waited for him while sharpe and garrard had made the diversion the boy had been thieving and he grinned broadly as sharpe ducked into the hot tent i have every things ahmed said proudly he had taken captain morriss red coat his sash and his swordbelt with its sabre youre a good lad sharpe said he needed a red coat for colonel stevenson had given orders that every man who went into gawilghur with the attackers must be in uniform so that they were not mistaken for the enemy syud sevajees men who planned to hunt down beny singh had been issued with some threadbare old sepoys jackets some of them still stained with the blood of their previous owners but none of the jackets had fitted sharpe even morriss coat would be a tight fit but at least he had a uniform now no trouble sharpe asked ahmed no bugger saw me the boy said proudly his english was improving every day though sharpe worried that it was not quite the kings english ahmed grinned again as sharpe gave him a coin that he stuffed into his robes sharpe folded the jacket over his arm and stooped out of the tent he was looking for clare and saw her a hundred paces away walking with a tall soldier who was dressed in a shirt black trousers and spurred boots she was deep in conversation and sharpe felt a curious pang of jealousy as he approached but then the soldier turned round frowned at sharpes ragged appearance then recognized the man under the head cloth he grinned mister sharpe he said eli lockhart sharpe said what the hell are the cavalry doing here he jerked his thumb towards the fort that was edged with white smoke as the defenders tried to hammer the british batteries this is a job for real soldiers our colonel persuaded the general that mister dodd might make a run for it he reckoned a dozen cavalrymen could head him off dodd wont run sharpe said he wont have space to get a horse out so well go in with you lockhart said weve got a quarrel with mister dodd remember clare was looking shy and alarmed and sharpe reckoned she did not want sergeant lockhart to know that she had spent time with ensign sharpe i was looking for mrs wall he explained to lockhart if you can spare me a few minutes maam clare shot sharpe a look of gratitude of course mister sharpe its this jacket see he held out morriss coat its got red facings and turn backs and i need white ones he took off his head cloth i wondered if you could use this i know its a bit filthy and i hate to trouble you maam but i dont reckon my sewings up to making turn backs cuffs and collars you could take that captains badge off while youre about it love lockhart suggested to clare and the skirmishers wings dont reckon mister sharpe wants that coats real owner to recognize it id rather he didnt sharpe admitted clare took the coat gave sharpe another grateful look then hurried towards sevajees tents lockhart watched her go been wanting a chance to talk to her for three years he said wonderingly so you found it eh lockhart still watched her a rarelooking woman that is she i hadnt really noticed sharpe lied she said youd been kind to her lockhart said well i tried to help you know how it is sharpe said awkwardly that bloody man torrance killed himself and she had nowhere to go and you found her eh most officers would try to take advantage of a woman like that lockhart said im not a proper officer am i sharpe replied he had seen the way that clare looked at the tall cavalryman and how lockhart had stared at her and sharpe reckoned that it was best to stand aside i had a wife lockhart said only she died on the voyage out good little woman she was im sorry sharpe said and mrs wall lockhart went on lost her husband widow meets widower any minute now sharpe thought and the word fate would be used its destiny lockhart said in a tone of wonderment so what are you going to do about her sharpe asked she says she aint got a proper home now lockhart said except the tent you lent her and my colonel wont mind me taking a wife have you asked her more or less lockhart said blushing and she said yes more or less lockhart said again blushing more deeply bloody hell sharpe said admiringly thats quick real soldiers dont wait lockhart said then frowned i heard a rumour youd been snaffled by the enemy got away sharpe said vaguely buggers were careless he turned and watched as an errant rocket from the fort soared up into the cloudless sky to leave a thickening pile of smoke through which eventually it tumbled harmlessly to earth are you really joining the attack he asked lockhart not in the front rank lockhart said i aint a fool but colonel huddlestone says we can go in and look for dodd so well wait for you boys to do the hard work then follow ill look out for you and well keep an eye on you lockhart promised but in the meantime ill go and see if someone needs a needle threaded you do that sharpe said he watched the cavalryman walk away and saw at the same time that ahmed had been evicted from clares tent with sharpes few belongings the boy looked indignant but sharpe guessed their exile from the tent would not last long for clare would surely move to the cavalrymans quarters before nightfall ding dong he thought wedding bells he took the pouch with its jewels from ahmed then while his uniform was being tailored he went to watch the guns gnaw and batter at the fort the young horseman who presented himself at the gate of gawilghurs inner fort was tall arrogant and selfassured he was dressed in a white silk robe that was tied at the waist with a red leather belt from which a goldenhilted tulwar hung in a gemencrusted scabbard and he did not request that the gates be opened but rather demanded it there was in truth no good reason to deny his orders for men were constantly traversing the ravine between the two forts and dodds cobras were accustomed to opening and closing the gates a score of times each day but there was something in the young mans demeanour that annoyed gopal so he sent for colonel dodd dodd arrived a few moments later with the twitching english sergeant at his side the horseman rounded on dodd shouting at him to punish gopal but dodd just spat then turned to hakeswill why would a man be riding a horse out of this gate wouldnt know sir hakeswill said the sergeant was now dressed in a white coat that was crossed with a black sash as a sign of rank though quite what rank the sash denoted was uncertain theres nowhere to exercise a horse dodd said not unless he plans to ride through the outer fort into the english camp ask him his business gopal the young man refused to answer dodd shrugged drew his pistol and aimed it at the horsemans head he cocked the gun and the sound of the hammer engaging echoed loudly from the ramparts the young man blanched and shouted at gopal he says sahib that he is on an errand for the killadar gopal explained to dodd what errand dodd demanded the young man plainly did not want to answer but dodds grim face and the levelled pistol persuaded him to take a sealed packet from the pouch that hung from his belt he showed dodd the killadars seal but dodd was not impressed by the red wax with its impression of a snake curled about a knife blade who is it addressed to he demanded gesturing that the young man turn the package over the horseman obeyed and dodd saw that the packet was addressed to the commanding officer of the british camp it must have been written by a clerk who was unfamiliar with the english language for it was atrociously spelt but the words were unmistakable and dodd stepped forward and seized the horses bridle haul him out of the saddle gopal dodd ordered hold him in the guardroom and send a man to fetch manu bappoo the young man attempted a momentary resistance even half drawing his tulwar from its precious scabbard but a dozen of dodds men easily overpowered him dodd himself turned away and climbed the steps to the rampart motioning hakeswill to follow him its obvious what the killadar is doing dodd growled hes trying to make peace i thought we couldnt be defeated here sir hakeswill said in some alarm we cant dodd said but beny singh is a coward he thinks life should be nothing but women music and games which sounded just splendid to obadiah hakeswill but he said nothing he had presented himself to dodd as an aggrieved british soldier who believed the war against the mahrattas was unfair we aint got no business here sir he had said not in heathen land it belongs to the blackamoors dont it and there aint nothing here for a redcoat dodd had not believed a word of it he suspected hakeswill had fled the british army to avoid trouble but he could hardly blame the sergeant for that dodd himself had done the same and dodd did not care about hakeswills motives only that the sergeant was willing to fight and dodd believed his men fought better when white men gave them orders theres a steadiness about the english sergeant he had told hakeswill and it gives the natives bottom it gives them what sir hakeswill had asked dodd had frowned at the sergeants obtuseness you aint scotch are you christ no sir i aint a bleeding scotchman nor a welshman english sir i am through and through sir his face twitched english sir and proud of it so dodd had given hakeswill a white jacket and a black sash then put him in charge of a company of his cobras fight well for me here sergeant he told hakeswill when the two men reached the top of the rampart and ill make you an officer i shall fight sir never you mind sir fight like a demon i will and dodd believed him for if hakeswill did not fight then he risked being captured by the british and god alone knew what trouble he would then face though in truth dodd did not see how the british could penetrate the inner fort he expected them to take the outer fort for there they had a flat approach and their guns were already blasting down the breaches but they would have a far greater problem in capturing the inner fort he showed that problem now to hakeswill theres only one way in sergeant and thats through this gate they cant assault the walls because the slope of the ravine is too steep see hakeswill looked to his left and saw that the wall of the inner fort was built on an almost sheer slope no man could climb that and hope to assail a wall even a breached wall which meant that dodd was right and the attackers would have to try and batter down the four gates that barred the entranceway and those gates were defended by dodds cobras and my men have never known defeat sergeant dodd said theyve watched other men beaten but theyve not been outfought themselves and here the enemy will have to beat us have to but they cant they cant he fell silent his clenched fists resting on the fire step the sound of the guns was constant but the only sign of the bombardment was the misting smoke that hung over the far side of the outer fort manu bappoo who commanded there was now hurrying back towards the inner fort and dodd watched the prince climb the steep path to the gates the hinges squealed as one after the other the gates were opened to let bappoo and his aides in dodd smiled as the last gate was unbarred lets go and make some mischief he said turning back to the steps manu bappoo had already opened the letter that gopal had given to him he looked up as dodd approached read it he said simply thrusting the folded paper towards the colonel he wants to surrender dodd asked taking the letter just read it bappoo said grimly the letter was clumsily written but intelligible beny singh as killadar of the rajah of berars fortress of gawilghur was offering to yield the fort to the british on the sole condition that the lives of all the garrison and their dependants were spared none was to be hurt none was to be imprisoned the british were welcome to confiscate all the weaponry in the fort but they were to allow gawilghurs inhabitants to leave with such personal property as could be carried away on foot or horseback of course the british will accept manu bappoo said they dont want to die in the breaches has beny singh the authority to send this dodd asked bappoo shrugged hes killadar youre the general of the army and the rajahs brother bappoo stared up at the sky between the high walls of the entranceway one can never tell with my brother he said maybe he wants to surrender but he hasnt told me maybe if we lose he can blame me saying he always wanted to yield but you wont yield we can win here bappoo said fiercely then turned towards the palace as gopal announced that the killadar himself was approaching beny singh must have been watching his messengers progress from the palace for now he hurried down the path and behind him came his wives concubines and daughters bappoo walked towards him followed by dodd and a score of his whitecoated soldiers the killadar must have reckoned that the sight of the women would soften bappoos heart but the princes face just became harder if you want to surrender he shouted at beny singh then talk to me first i have authority here beny singh squeaked his little lap dog was in his arms its small tongue hanging out as it panted in the heat you have nothing bappoo retorted the women pretty in their silk and cotton huddled together as the two men met beside the snake pit the british are making their breaches beny singh protested and tomorrow or the day after theyll come through we shall all be killed he wailed the prophecy my daughters will be their playthings and my wives their servants the women shuddered the british will die in the breaches bappoo retorted they cannot be stopped beny singh insisted they are djinns bappoo suddenly shoved beny singh back towards the rock pit where the snakes were kept the killadar cried aloud as he tripped and fell backwards but bappoo had kept hold of beny singhs yellow silk robe and now he held on tight so that the killadar did not fall hakeswill sidled to the pits edge and saw the monkey bones then he saw a curving nickering shape slither across the pits shadowed floor and he quickly stepped back beny singh whimpered i am the killadar i am trying to save lives youre supposed to be a soldier bappoo said in his hissing voice and your job is to kill my brothers enemies the women screamed expecting to see their man fall to the pits floor but manu bappoo kept a firm grip on the silk and when the british die in the breaches he said to beny singh and when their survivors are harried south across the plain who do you think will get the credit for the victory the killadar of the fort that is who and you would throw that glory away they are djinns beny singh said and he looked sideways at obadiah hakeswill whose face was twitching and he screamed they are djinnsl they are men as feeble as other men bappoo said he reached out with his free hand and took hold of the white dog by the scruff of its neck beny singh whimpered but did not resist the dog struggled in manu bappoos grip if you try to surrender the fortress again manu bappoo said then this will be your fate he let the dog drop it yelped as it fell into the pit then howled piteously as it struck the rock floor there was a hiss a scrabble of paws a last howl then silence beny singh uttered a shriek of pity for his dog before babbling that he would rather give his women poison to drink than risk that they should become prey to the terrible besiegers manu bappoo shook the hapless killadar do you understand me he demanded i understand beny singh said desperately manu bappoo hauled the killadar safely back from the pits edge you will go to the palace beny singh he ordered and you will stay there and you will send no more messages to the enemy he pushed the killadar away then turned his back on him colonel dodd sahib a dozen of your men will make certain that the killadar sends no messages from the palace if he does you may kill the messenger dodd smiled of course sahib bappoo went back to the beleaguered outer fort while the killadar slunk back to the hilltop palace above its greenscummed lake dodd detailed a dozen men to guard the palaces entrance then went back to the rampart to brood over the ravine hakeswill followed him there whys the killadar so scared sir does he know something we dont hes a coward sergeant but beny singhs fear had infected hakeswill who imagined a vengeful sharpe come back from the dead to pursue him through the nightmare of a fortress fallen the bastards cant get in sir can they he asked anxiously dodd recognized hakeswills fear the same fear he felt himself the fear of the ignominy and shame of being recaptured by the british and then condemned by a merciless court he smiled they will probably take the outer fort sergeant because theyre very good and because our old comrades do indeed fight like djinns but they cannot cross the ravine not if all the powers of darkness help them not if they besiege us for a year not if they batter down all these walls and destroy the gates and flatten the palace by gunfire because they will still have to cross the ravine and it cannot be done it cannot be done and who rules gawilghur dodd thought reigns in india and within a week he would be rajah here gawilghurs walls as stokes had guessed were rotten the first breach in the outer wall took less than a day to make in midafternoon the wall had still been standing though a cave had been excavated into the dusty rubble where stokes had pointed the guns but quite suddenly the whole rampart collapsed it slid down the brief slope in a cloud of dust which slowly settled to reveal a steep ramp of jumbled stone leading into the space between the two walls a low stub of the walls rear face still survived but an hours work served to throw that remnant down the gunners changed their aim starting the two breaches in the higher inner wall while the enfilading batteries which had been gnawing at the embrasures to dismount the enemys guns began firing slantwise into the first breach to dissuade the defenders from building obstacles at the head of the ramp the enemy guns those which survived redoubled their efforts to disable the british batteries but their shots were wasted in the gab ions or overhead the big gun which had inflicted such slaughter fired three times more but its balls cracked uselessly into the cliff face after which the mahratta gunners mysteriously gave up next day the two inner breaches were made and now the big guns concentrated on widening all three gaps in the walls the eighteen pounder shots slammed into rotten stone gouging out the walls fill to add to the ramps by evening the breaches were clearly big enough and now the gunners aimed their pieces at the enemys remaining cannon one by one they were unseated or their embrasures shattered a constant shroud of smoke hung over the rocky neck of land it hung thick and pungent twitching every time a shot whipped through the enfilading twelvepounders fired shells into the breaches while the howitzer lobbed more shells over the walls the british guns fired deep into dusk and minute by minute the enemy response grew feebler as their guns were wrecked or thrown off the fire steps only as black night dropped did the besiegers hot guns cease fire but even now there would be no respite for the enemy it was at night that the defenders could turn the breaches into deathtraps they could bury mines in the stony ramps or dig wide trenches across the breach summits or make new walls behind the raw new openings but the british kept one heavy gun firing throughout the darkness they loaded the eighteenpounder with canister and three times an hour sprayed the area of the breaches with a cloud of musket balls to deter any mahratta from risking his life on the rub bled slopes few slept well that night the cough of the gun seemed unnaturally loud and even in the british camp men could hear the rattle as the musket balls whipped against gawilghurs wounded walls and in the morning the soldiers knew they would be asked to go to those walls and climb the tumbled ramps and fight their way through the shattered stones and what would wait for them at the very least they suspected the enemy would have mounted guns athwart the breaches to fire across the attack route they expected blood and pain and death ive never been into a breach garrard told sharpe the two men met at syud sevajees tents and sharpe had given his old friend a bottle of arrack nor me sharpe said they say its bad they do sharpe agreed bleakly it was supposedly the worst ordeal that any soldier could face garrard drank from the stone bottle wiped its lip then handed it to sharpe he admired sharpes coat in the light of the small campfire smart bit of cloth mister sharpe the coat had been given new white turn backs and cuffs by clare wall and sharpe had done his best to make the jacket wrinkled and dusty but it still looked expensive just an old coat tom he said dismissively funny isnt it mister morris lost a coat did he sharpe asked he should be more careful he gave garrard the bottle then climbed to his feet ive got an errand tom he held out his hand ill look for you tomorrow ill look out for you dick sharpe led ahmed through the camp some men sang around their fires others obsessively honed bayonets that were already razor sharp a cavalryman had set up a grinding stone and a succession of officers servants brought swords and sabres to be given a wicked edge sparks whipped off the stone the sappers were doing their last job making ladders from bamboo that had been carried up from the plain major stokes supervised the job and his eyes widened in joy as he saw sharpe approaching through the firelight richard is it you dear me it is well i never and i thought you were locked up in the enemys dungeons you escaped sharpe shook stokess hand i never got taken to gawilghur i was held by some horsemen he lied but they didnt seem to know what to do with me so the buggers just let me go im delighted delighted sharpe turned and looked at the ladders i didnt think we were making an escalade tomorrow were not stokes said but you never know what obstacles have to be overcome inside a fortress sensible to carry ladders he peered at ahmed who was now dressed in one of the sepoys coats that had been given to syud sevajee the boy wore the red jacket proudly even though it was a poor threadbare and bloodstained thing i say stokes admired the boy but you do look like a proper soldier dont he just ahmed stood to attention shouldered his musket and made a smart aboutturn major stokes applauded well done lad im afraid youve missed all the excitement sharpe excitement your captain torrance died shot himself by the look of things terrible way to go i feel sorry for his father hes a cleric did you know poor man poor man would you like some tea sharpe or do you need to sleep id like some tea sir well go to my tent stokes said leading the way ive still got your pack by the way you can take it with you id rather you kept it another day sharpe said ill be busy tomorrow busy stokes asked im going in with kennys troops sir dear god stokes said he stopped and frowned ive no doubt well get through the breaches richard for theyre good breaches a bit steep perhaps but we should get through but god only knows what waits beyond and i fear that the inner fort may be a much bigger obstacle than any of us have anticipated he shook his head i aint sanguine sharpe i truly aint sharpe had no idea what sanguine meant though he did not doubt that stokess lack of it did not augur well for the attack i have to go into the fort sir i have to but i wondered if youd keep an eye on ahmed here he took hold of the boys shoulder and pulled him forward the little bugger will insist on coming with me sharpe said but if you keep him out of trouble then he might survive another day he can be my assistant stokes said happily but richard cant i persuade you to the same employment are you ordered to accompany kenny im not ordered sir but i have to go its personal business it will be bloody in there stokes warned he walked on to his tent and shouted for his servant sharpe pushed ahmed towards stokess tent you stay here ahmed you hear me you stay here i come with you ahmed insisted you bloody well stay sharpe said he twitched ahmeds red coat youre a soldier now that means you take orders understand you obey and im ordering you to stay here the boy scowled but he seemed to accept the orders and stokes showed him a place where he could sleep afterwards the two men talked or rather sharpe listened as stokes enthused about some fine quartz he had discovered in rocks broken open by the enemys counter battery fire eventually the major began yawning sharpe finished his tea said his good night and then making certain that ahmed did not see him go he slipped away into the dark he still could not sleep he wished clare had not gone to eli lockhart although he was glad for the cavalryman that she had but her absence made sharpe feel lonely he walked to the cliffs edge and he stood staring across the great gulf towards the fortress a few lights showed in gawilghur and every twenty minutes or so the rocky isthmus would be lit by the monstrous flame of the eighteenpounder gun the balls would rattle against stone then there would be silence except for the distant sound of singing the crackle of insects and the soft sigh of the wind against the cliffs once when the great gun fired sharpe distinctly saw the three ragged holes in the two walls and why he wondered was he so intent on going into those deathtraps was it revenge just to find hakeswill and dodd he could wait for the attackers to do their work then stroll into the fort unopposed but he knew he would not choose that easy path he would go with kennys men and he would fight his way into gawilghur for no other reason than pride he was failing as an officer the th had rejected him the rifles did not yet know him so sharpe must take a reputation back to england if he was to stand any chance of success so tomorrow he must fight or else he must sell his commission and leave the army he had thought about that but he wanted to stay in uniform he enjoyed the army he even suspected he was good at the armys business of fighting the kings enemies so tomorrow he would do it again and thus demonstrate that he deserved the red sash and the sword so in the morning when the drums beat and the enemy guns beat even harder sharpe would go into gawilghur chapter at dawn there was a mist in deogaum a mist that sifted through the rain trees and pooled in the valleys and beaded on the tents a touch of winter dont you think sir arthur wellesley commented to his aide campbell the thermometers showing seventyeight degrees sir the young scotsman answered drily only a touch of winter campbell only a touch the general said he was standing outside his tent a cup and saucer in one hand staring up through the wisps of mist to where the rising sun threw a brilliant light on gawilghurs soaring cliffs a servant stood behind with wellesleys coat hat and sword a second servant held his horse while a third waited to take the cup and saucer hows harness the general asked campbell i believe he now sleeps most of the time sir campbell replied colonel harness had been relieved of the command of his brigade he had been found ranting in the camp demanding that his highlanders form fours and follow him southwards to fight against dragons papists and whigs sleeps the general asked what are the doctors doing pouring rum down his gullet i believe it is tincture of opium sir but most likely flavoured with rum poor harness wellesley grunted then sipped his tea from high above him there came the sound of a pair of twelvepounder guns that had been hauled to the summit of the conical hill that reared just south of the fortress wellesley knew those guns were doing no good but he had stubbornly insisted that they fire at the fortress gate that looked out across the vast plain the gunners had warned the general that the weapons would be ineffective that they would be firing too far and too high above them but wellesley had wanted the fortress to know that an assault might come from the south as well as across the rocky isthmus to the north and so he had ordered the sappers to drag the two weapons up through the entangling jungle and to make a battery on the hill top the guns firing at their maximum elevation were just able to throw their missiles to gawilghurs southern entrance but by the time the round shot reached the gate it was spent of all force and simply bounced back down the steep slope but that was not the point the point was to keep some of the garrison looking southwards so that not every man could be thrown against the assault on the breaches that assault would not start for five hours yet for before lieutenant colonel kenny led his men against the breaches wellesley wanted his other attackers to be in place those were two columns of redcoats that were even now climbing the two steep roads that twisted up the great cliffs colonel wallace with his own th and a battalion of sepoys would approach the southern gate while the th and another native battalion would climb the road which led to the ravine between the forts both columns could expect to come under heavy artillery fire and neither could hope to break into the fortress but their job was only to distract the defenders while kennys men made for the breaches wellesley drained the tea made a wry face at its bitter taste and held out the cup and saucer for the servant time to go campbell yes sir wellesley had thought about riding to the plateau and entering the fortress behind kenny but he guessed his presence would merely distract men who had enough problems to face without worrying about their commanders approval instead he would ride the steep southern road and join wallace and the th all those men could hope for was that the other attackers got inside the inner fort and opened the southern gate or else they would have to march ignominiously back down the hill to their encampment it was all or nothing wellesley thought victory or disgrace he mounted waited for his aides to assemble then touched his horses flank with his spurs god help us now he prayed god help us now lieutenant colonel kenny examined the breaches through a telescope that he had propped on a rock close to one of the breaching batteries the guns were firing but he ignored the vast noise as he gazed at the stone ramps which his men must climb theyre steep man he grumbled damned steep the walls are built on a slope major stokes pointed out so the breaches are steep of necessity damned hard to climb though kenny said theyre practical stokes declared he knew the breaches were steep and that was why the guns were still firing there was no hope of making the breaches less steep the slope of the hill saw to that but at least the continued bombardment gave the attacking infantry the impression that the gunners were attempting to alleviate the difficulties youve made holes in the walls kenny said ill grant you that youve made holes but that dont make them practical holes stokes theyre damned steep of necessity stokes repeated patiently we aint monkeys you know kenny complained i think youll find them practical sir stokes said emolliently he knew and kenny knew that the breaches could not be improved and must therefore be attempted kennys grumbling stokes suspected was a disguise for nerves and stokes could not blame the man he would not have wanted to carry a sword or musket up those rugged stone slopes to whatever horrors the enemy had prepared on the other side kenny grunted i suppose theyll have to suffice he said grudgingly snapping his telescope shut he flinched as one of the eighteen pounders roared and billowed smoke all about the battery then he strode into the acrid cloud shouting for major plummer the gunner officer plummer powderstained and sweating loomed out of the smoke sir youll keep your pieces firing till were well on the breaches i will sir that should keep their damned heads down kenny said then fished a watch from his fob i make it ten minutes after nine eight minutes after plummer said exactly nine oclock stokes said tapping his watch to see if the hands were stuck well use my timepiece kenny decreed and well move forward on the strike of ten oclock and remember plummer keep firing till were there dont be chary man dont stop just because were close to the summit batter the bastards batter the bastards he frowned at ahmed who was staying close to stokes the boy was wearing his red coat which was far too big for him and kenny seemed on the point of demanding an explanation for the boys odd garb then abruptly shrugged and walked away he went to where his men crouched on the track that led to the fortress gate they were sheltered from the defenders by the lie of the land but the moment they advanced over a small rocky rise they would become targets they then had three hundred yards of open ground to cross and as they neared the broken walls they would be squeezed into the narrow space between the tank and the precipice where they could expect the fire of the defenders to be at its fiercest after that it was a climb to the breaches and to whatever horrors waited out of sight the men sat trying to find what small shade was offered by bushes or rocks many were half drunk for their officers had issued extra rations of arrack and rum none carried a pack they had only their muskets their ammunition and bayonets a few not many prayed an officer of the scotch brigade knelt bareheaded amongst a group of his men and kenny intrigued by the sight swerved towards the kneeling soldiers to hear them softly repeating the twentythird psalm most men just sat heads low consumed by their thoughts the officers forced conversation behind kennys thousand men was a second assault force also composed of sepoys and scotsmen which would follow kenny into the breach if kenny failed then the second storming party would try to go farther but if kenny succeeded they would secure the outer fort while kennys troops went on to assault the inner small groups of gunners were included in both assault groups their orders were to find whatever serviceable cannon still existed in the outer fort and turn them against the defenders beyond the ravine an officer wearing the white facings of the th picked his way up the track between the waiting troops the man had a cheap indian sabre at his waist and unusually for an officer was carrying a musket and cartridge box kenny hailed him who the devil are you sharpe sir the name rang a bell in kennys mind wellesleys man dont know about that sir kenny scowled at the evasion you were at assaye yes yes sir sharpe admitted kennys expression softened he knew of sharpe and he admired a brave man so what the devil are you doing here sharpe your regiment is miles away theyre climbing the road from deogaum i was stranded here sir sharpe said deciding there was no point in trying to deliver a longer explanation and there wasnt time to join the th sir so i was hoping to go with my old company thats captain morriss men sir he nodded up the track to where the rds light company was gathered among some boulders with your permission of course sir no doubt morris will be glad of your help sharpe kenny said as will i he was impressed by sharpes appearance for the ensign was tall evidently strong and had a roguish fierceness about his face in the breach the colonel knew victory or defeat as often as not came down to a mans skill and strength and sharpe looked as if he knew how to use his weapons good luck to you sharpe and the best to you sir sharpe said warmly he walked on his borrowed musket heavy on his shoulder eli lockhart and syud sevajee were waiting with their men among the third group the soldiers who would occupy the fort after the assault troops had done their work if indeed the leading two thousand men managed to get through the walls a rumour was spreading that the breaches were too steep and that no one could carry a weapon and climb the ramps at the same time the men believed they would need to use their hands to scramble up the stony piles and so they would be easy targets for any defenders at the top of the breaches the gunners they grumbled should have brought down more of the wall if not all of it and the proof of that assertion was the guns continual firing why would the guns go on gnawing at the wall if the breaches were already practical they could hear the strike of round shot on stone hear the occasional tumble of rubble but what they could not hear was any fire from the fortress the bastards were saving their fire for the assault sharpe edged among sepoys who were carrying one of major stokess bamboo ladders the dark faces grinned at him and one man offered sharpe a canteen which proved to contain a strongly spiced arrack sharpe took a small sip then amused the sepoys by pretending to be astonished by the liquors fierceness thats rare stuff lads sharpe said then walked on towards his old comrades they watched his approach with a mixture of surprise welcome and apprehension when the rds light company had last seen sharpe he had been a sergeant and not long before that he had been a private strapped to the punishment triangle now he wore a sword and sash although officers promoted from the ranks were not supposed to serve with their old units sharpe had friends among these men and if he was to climb the steep rubble of gawilghurs breaches then he would rather do it among friends captain morris was no friend and he watched sharpes approach with foreboding sharpe headed straight for his old company commander good to see you charles he said knowing that his use of the christian name would irritate morris nice morning eh morris looked left and right as though seeking someone who could help him confront this upstart from his past morris had never liked sharpe indeed he had conspired with obadiah hakeswill to have sharpe flogged in the hope that the punishment would end in death but sharpe had survived and had been commissioned now the bastard was being familiar and there was nothing morris could do about it sharpe he managed to say thought id join you charles sharpe said airily ive been stranded up here and kenny reckoned i might be useful to you of course morris said conscious of his mens gaze morris would have liked to tell sharpe to bugger a long way off but he could not commit such impolite ness to a fellow officer in front of his men i never congratulated you he forced himself to say no time like the present sharpe said morris blushed congratulations thank you charles sharpe said then turned and looked at the company most grinned at him but a few men avoided his gaze no sergeant hakeswill sharpe asked guilelessly he was captured by the enemy morris said the captain was staring at sharpes coat which was not quite big enough and looked somehow familiar sharpe saw morris frowning at the jacket you like the coat he asked what morris asked confused by his suspicions and by sharpes easy manner morris himself was wearing an old coat that was disfigured by brown cloth patches i bought the coat after assaye sharpe said you werent there were you no nor at argaum no morris said stiffening slightly he resented the fact that sharpe had survived those battles and was now suggesting however delicately that the experience gave him an advantage the truth was that it did but morris could not admit that any more than he could admit his jealousy of sharpes reputation so what are our orders today sharpe asked morris could not accustom himself to this confident sharpe who treated him as an equal and he was tempted not to answer but the question was reasonable and sharpe was undoubtedly an officer if merely an ensign once were through the first wall morris answered unhappily kennys going to attack the lefthand upper breach and he wants us to seal off the right upper breach sounds like a decent mornings work sharpe said happily then raised a hand to garrard how are you tom pleased youre here sir couldnt let you babies go into a breach without some help sharpe said then held out his hand to sergeant green good to see you sergeant grand to see you too sir green said shaking sharpes hand i heard youd been commissioned and i hardly dared believe it you know what they say about scum sergeant sharpe said always floats to the top eh some of the men laughed especially when sharpe glanced at morris who had indeed expressed that very opinion not long before others scowled for there were plenty in the company who resented sharpes good fortune one of them a darkfaced man called growley spat you always were a lucky bastard sharpie sharpe seemed to ignore the remark as he stepped through the seated company and greeted more of his old friends but when he was behind crowley he turned abruptly and pushed out the butt of his slung musket so that the heavy stock thumped into the privates head crowley let out a yelp and turned to see sharpe standing above him the word crowley sharpe said menacingly is sir crowley met sharpes gaze but could not hold it yes sir he said meekly im sorry i was careless with the musket crowley sharpe said there was another burst of laughter making morris scowl but he was quite uncertain of how to deal with sharpe and so he said nothing watson a welsh private who had joined the regiment rather than face an assize court jerked a thumb towards the fort they say the breaches are too steep mister sharpe nothing to what you welsh boys climb every day in the mountains sharpe said he had borrowed major stokess telescope shortly after dawn and stared at the breaches and he had not much liked what he had seen but this was no time to tell the truth were going to give the buggers a right bloody thrashing lads he said instead ive fought these mahrattas twice now and they dont stand they look good but press home on the bastards and they turn and run like jack rabbits just keep going boys keep fighting and the buggersll give up it was the speech morris should have made to them and sharpe had not even known he was going to make any kind of speech when he opened his mouth but somehow the words had come and he was glad for the men looked relieved at his confidence then some of them looked nervous again as they watched a sepoy coming up the track with a british flag in his hands colonel kenny and his aides walked behind the man all with drawn swords captain morris drank deep from his canteen and the smell of rum wafted to sharpe the guns fired on crumbling the breaches shoulders and filling the air with smoke and dust as they tried to make the rough way smooth soldiers sensing that the order to advance was about to be given stood and hefted their weapons some touched rabbits feet hidden in pockets or whatever other small token gave them a finger hold on life one man vomited another trembled sweat poured down their faces four ranks morris said into ranks quick now sergeant green snapped an howitzer shell arced overhead then plummeted towards the fort trailing its wisp of fuse smoke sharpe heard the shell explode then watched another shell follow a man dashed out of the ranks into the rocks lowered his trousers and emptied his bowels everyone pretended not to notice until the smell struck them then they jeered as the embarrassed man went back to his place thats enough green said a sepoy drummer with an oldfashioned mitred shako on his head gave his drum a couple of taps while a piper from the scotch brigade filled his bag then settled the instrument under his elbow colonel kenny was looking at his watch the guns fired on their smoke drifting down to the waiting men the sepoy with the flag was at the front of the forming column and sharpe guessed the enemy must be able to see the bright tip of the colour above the rocky crest sharpe took the bayonet from his belt and slotted it onto the musket he was not wearing the sabre that ahmed had stolen from morris for he knew the weapon would be identifiable and so he had a tulwar that he had borrowed from syud sevajee he did not trust the weapon he had seen too many indian blades break in combat besides he was used to a musket and bayonet fix bayonets morris ordered prompted by the sight of sharpes blade and save your fire till youre hard in the breach sharpe added youve got one shot lads so dont waste it you wont have time to reload till youre through both walls morris scowled at this unaskedfor advice but the men seemed grateful for it just as they were grateful that they were not in the front ranks of kennys force that honour had gone to the grenadier company of the th who thus formed the forlorn hope usually the hope that group of men who went first into a breach to spring the enemy traps and fight down the immediate defenders was composed of volunteers but kenny had decided to do without a proper forlorn hope he wanted to fill the breaches quickly and so overwhelm the de fences by numbers and thus hard behind the scotch brigades grenadiers were two more companies of scots then came the sepoys and morriss men hard and fast kenny had told them hard and fast leave the wounded behind you he had ordered and just get up the damned breaches and start killing the colonel looked at his watch a last time then snapped its lid shut and put it into a pocket he took a breath hefted his sword then shouted one word now and the flag went forward across the crest and behind it came a wave of men who hurried towards the walls for a few seconds the fortress was silent then the first rocket was fired it seared towards the advancing troops trailing its plume of thick smoke then abruptly twisted and climbed into the clear sky then the guns began colonel william dodd saw the errant rocket twist into the sky falter amidst a growing tumult of its own smoke then fall manu bappoos guns began to fire and dodd knew though he could not see over the loom of the outer fort that the british attack was coming gopal he called to his second in command sahib close the gates sahib gopal frowned at the colonel it had been agreed with manu bappoo that the four gates that barred the entranceway to the inner fort would be left open so that the defenders of the outer fort could retreat swiftly if it was necessary dodd had even posted a company to guard the outermost gate to make sure that no british pursuers could get in behind manu bappoos men yet now he was suggesting that the gates should be shut you want me to close them sahib gopal asked wondering if he had misheard close them bar them and forget them dodd said happily and pull the platoon back inside the fort i have another job for them but sahib if you heard me jemadar move gopal ran to do dodds bidding while the colonel himself walked along the fire step that edged the entranceway to make certain that his orders were being obeyed he watched satisfied as the troops guarding the outer gate were brought back into the fortress and then as one by one the four vast gates were pushed shut the great locking bars each as thick as a mans thigh were dropped into their metal brackets the outer fort was now isolated if manu bappoo repelled the british then it would be a simple matter to open the gates again but if he lost and if he fled then he would find himself trapped between dodds cobras and the advancing british dodd walked to the centre of the fire step and there climbed onto an embrasure so that he could talk to as many of his men as possible you will see that i have shut the gates he shouted and they will stay shut they will not be opened except by my express permission not if all the maharajahs of india stand out there and demand entrance the gates stay shut do you understand the whitecoated soldiers or at least those few who spoke some english nodded while the rest had dodds orders translated none showed much interest in the decision they trusted their colonel and if he wanted the gates kept closed then so be it dodd watched the smoke thicken on the far side of the outer fort a grim struggle was being waged there but it was nothing to do with him he would only begin to fight when the british attacked across the ravine but their attacks would achieve nothing the only way into the inner fort was through the gates and that was impossible the british might batter down the first gate with cannon fire but once through the arch they would discover that the entranceway turned sharply to the left so their gun could not fire through the passage to batter down the three other doors they would have to fight their way up the narrow passage try to destroy the successive gates with axes and all the while his men would be pouring slaughter on them from the flanking walls sahib gopal called and dodd turned to see that the jemadar was pointing up the path that led to the palace beny singh had appeared on the path flanked by a servant carrying a parasol to protect the killadar from the hot sun send him up here jemadar dodd shouted back dodd felt a quiet exaltation at the neatness of his tactics manu bappoo was already cut off from safety and only beny singh was now left as a rival to dodds supremacy dodd was tempted to cut the killadar down here and now but the murder would have been witnessed by members of the garrison who were still loyal to beny singh and so instead dodd greeted the killadar with a respectful bow whats happening beny singh demanded he was breathing hard from the effort of climbing to the fire step then he cried out in dismay because the guns on the southern wall of the outer fort those guns that overlooked the ravine had suddenly opened fire to pump gouts of grey white smoke i fear sahib dodd said that the enemy are overwhelming the fort theyre doing what the killadar who was dressed for battle in a clean white robe girdled by a red cummerbund and hung with a jewelled scabbard looked horrified he watched the smoke spread across the ravine he was puzzled because it was not at all clear what the nearer guns were firing at but the enemy cant get in here there are other british soldiers approaching sahib dodd said and he pointed to the smoke cloud above the ravine the guns on the near side of the outer fort most of them small three and fivepounder cannon were aiming their pieces westwards which meant that british troops must be approaching up the steep road which led from the plain those troops were still out of dodds sight but the gunnery from the outer fort was eloquent proof of their presence there must be redcoats coming towards the ravine dodd explained and we never foresaw that the british might assault in more than one place dodd told the lie smoothly i have no doubt they have men coming up the southern road too they do the killadar confirmed dodd shuddered as though the news overwhelmed him with despair we shall do our best he promised but i cannot defend everything at once i fear the british will gain the victory this day he bowed to the killadar again i am so very sorry sahib but you can gain an immortal reputation by joining the fight we might lose todays battle but in years to come men will sing songs about the defiance of beny singh and how better for a soldier to die sahib than with a sword in his hand and his enemies dead about his feet beny singh blanched at the thought my daughters he croaked alas dodd said gravely they will become soldiers toys but you should not worry sahib in my experience the prettiest girls usually find a soldier to defend them he is usually a big man crude and forceful but he stops the other men from raping his woman except his friends of course who will be allowed some liberties i am sure your wives and daughters will find men eager to protect them beny singh fled from dodds reassurances dodd smiled as the killadar ran then turned and walked towards hakeswill who was posted in the bastion above the innermost gate the sergeant had been issued with a sword to accompany his black sash he slammed to attention as dodd approached him stand easy mister hakeswill dodd said hakeswill relaxed slightly he liked being called mister it somehow seemed appropriate if that little bastard sharpe could be a mister and wear a sword then so could he i shall have a job for you in a few minutes mister hakeswill dodd said i shall be honoured sir hakeswill replied dodd watched the killadar hurry up the path towards the palace our honoured commander he said sarcastically is taking some bad news to the palace we must give the news time to take root there bad news sir he thinks were going to lose dodd explained i pray not sir as do i mister hakeswill as do i fervently dodd turned to watch the gunners in the outer fort and he saw how puny their small cannon were and he reckoned that such fire would not hold up the redcoats for long the british would be in the ravine in half an hour maybe less in ten minutes mister hakeswill you will lead your company to the palace and you will order the arab guards to come and defend the walls hakeswills face twitched dont speak their heathen language sir begging your pardon sir you dont need their language youve got a musket use it and if anyone questions your authority mister hakeswill you have my permission to shoot them shoot them sir yes sir with pleasure sir anyone at all mister hakeswill hakeswills face twitched again that fat little bugger sir him what was just here with the curly moustache the killadar if he questions you i shoot the bugger sir exactly dodd smiled he had seen into hakeswills soul and discovered it was black as filth and perfect for his purposes do it for me mister hakeswill and i shall gazette you as a captain in the cobras your havildar speaks some english doesnt he a kind of english sir hakeswill said make sure he understands you the palace guards are to be despatched to the walls they will sir or else theyll be dead uns very good dodd said but wait ten minutes i shall sir and good day to you sir hakeswill saluted about turned and marched down the ramparts dodd turned back to the outer fort rockets seared out of the smoke cloud above which manu bappoos flag still hung faintly very faintly dodd could hear men shouting but the sound was being drowned by the roar of the guns which unsettled the silvergrey monkeys in the ravine the beasts turned puzzled black faces up towards the men on the inner forts walls as though they could find an answer to the noise and stink that was consuming the day a day which to dodds way of thinking was going perfectly the rds light company had been waiting a little to the side of the track and captain morris deliberately stayed there allowing almost all of kennys assault troops to go past before he led his men out of the rocks he thus ensured that he was at the rear of the assault a place which offered the greatest measure of safety once morris moved his men onto the forts approach road he deliberately fell in behind a sepoy ladder party so that his progress was impeded he walked at the head of his men but turned repeatedly keep in files sergeant he snapped at green more than once sharpe walked alongside the company curbing his long stride to the slow pace set by morris it took a moment to reach the small crest in the road but then they were in sight of the fortress and sharpe could only stare in awe at the weight of fire that seemed to pour from the battered walls the mahrattas bigger guns had been unseated but they possessed a myriad of smaller cannon some little larger than blunderbusses and those weapons now roared and coughed and spat their flames towards the advancing troops so that the black walls were half obscured behind the patchwork of smoke that vented from every embrasure rockets added to the confusion some hissed up into the sky but others seared into the advancing men to slice fiery passages through the ranks the leading company had not yet reached the outer breach but was hurrying into the narrow space between the precipice to the east and the tank to the west they jostled as their files were compressed and then the gunfire seemed to concentrate on those men and sharpe had an impression of blood misting the air as the round shot slammed home at a range of a mere hundred paces there were big round bastions on either flank of the breach and their summits were edged with perpetual flame as the defenders took turns to blast muskets down into the mass of attackers the british guns were still firing their shots exploding bursts of dust and stone from the breach or else hammering into the embrasures in an effort to dull the enemys fire an aide came running back down the path hurry he called hurry morris made no effort to hasten his pace the leading scots were past the tank now and climbing the gentle slope towards the walls but that slope became ever steeper as it neared the breach the man with the flag was in front then he was engulfed by highlanders racing to reach the stones kenny led them sword in hand muskets suddenly flamed from the breach summit obscuring it with smoke and then an eighteenpounder shot churned up the smoke and threw up a barrow load of broken stone amidst which an enemy musket wheeled sharpe quickened his pace he could feel a kind of rage inside and he wondered if that was fear but there was an excitement too and an anxiety that he would miss the fight he could see the fight clearly enough for the breach was high above the approach road and the scots scrambling up using their hands were clearly visible the british gunners were still firing hammering round shot just inches over the scotsmens heads to keep the summit of the breach clear of the enemy and then abruptly the guns stopped and the redcoats climbed into the dust that hung thick above the shattered stones a mass of arabs climbed the breachs inner slope coming to oppose the scots and scimitars rang against bayonets the red coats of the attackers were turned pink by the stone dust colonel kenny was in the front rank straddling a chunk of masonry as he parried a scimitar he lunged piercing an enemys throat then stepped forward downwards knowing he was across the summit and oblivious of the muskets that flamed above him from the upper wall the british gunners their weapons re laid started to fire at the upper wall driving the defenders away from the fire step the scots rammed their bayonets forward kicked the dead off the blades stepped over the corpses and followed kenny down to the space inside the walls this way kenny shouted this way he led the rush of men to the left to where the inner breach waited its slope twitching as the round shot slammed home some arabs fleeing the scotsmens snarling rage died as they tried to climb the inner breach and were struck by the cannonballs blood spattered across the inner wall smeared the ramp then was whitened by the dust kenny glanced behind to make sure that the column was close behind him keep them coming he shouted to an aide who stood on the summit of the first breach keep them coming kenny spat a mouthful of dust then shouted at the scots to start the ascent of the second breach hurry hurry kennys aides who were still outside the walls urged on the column the rearmost ranks of the colonels assault party were stringing out and the second storming group was not far behind close up the aides urged the laggards close up morris reluctantly quickened the sepoys carrying the ladders were running down the slight slope which led to the narrow space beside the tank where the enemys guns were aimed all along gawilghurs walls the smoke jetted the flames spat and the rockets blasted out in gouts of smoke and streams of sparks even arrows were being fired one clattered on a rock near sharpe then spun into the grass the scots were climbing the inner breach now and a stream of men was vanishing over the rocky summit of the outer breach no mines had awaited the attackers and no cannon had been placed athwart the breach to blast them as they flooded through the wall sepoys scrambled up the stones hurry the aides shouted hurry sharpe ran down the slope towards the tank his canteen and haversack thumped on his waist and sweat poured down his face slow down morris shouted at him but sharpe ignored the call the company was breaking apart as the more eager of the men hurried to catch up with sharpe and the others dallied with morris slow down damn you morris called to sharpe again keep going kennys aides shouted two of them had been posted beside the tank and they gestured the men on the round shot of the breaching batteries hammered above their heads making a noise like great barrels rolling across floorboards then cracked into the smoke rimmed upper wall a green and red flag waved there sharpe saw an arab aim a musket then smoke obscured the sight a small cannonball struck a sepoy throwing him back and smearing the stony road with blood and guts sharpe leaped the sprawling body and saw he had reached the reservoir the water was low and scummed green two scots and a sepoy lay on the sunbaked mud their blood seeping into the cracks that crazed the bank a musket ball hammered into the mud then a small round shot lashed into the rear of morriss company and bowled over two men leave them an aide shouted just leave them a rocket smashed close by sharpes head enveloping him in smoke and sparks a wounded man crawled back beside the road trailing a shattered leg another blood oozing from his belly collapsed on the mud and lapped at the filthy water sharpe half choked on the thick smoke as he stumbled up the rising ground big black round shot lay here left from the cannonade that had made the first breach two redcoat bodies had been heaved aside three others twitched and called for help but kenny had posted another aide here to keep the troops moving dust spurted where musket balls lashed into the ground then sharpe was on the breach itself half lost his balance as he climbed the ramp and then was pushed from behind men jostled up the stones clambered up hauled themselves up with one hand while the other gripped their musket sharpe put his hand on a smear of blood the dusty rubble was almost too hot to touch and the ramp was much longer than sharpe had anticipated men shouted hoarsely as they climbed and still the bullets thudded down an arrow struck and quivered in a musket stock a rocket crashed into the flood of men parting it momentarily as the carcass flamed madly where it had lodged between a boulder and a cannonball someone unceremoniously dumped a dead scotsman on top of the hissing rocket and the press of men clambered on up over the corpse once at the summit the attackers turned to their left and ran down the inside of the breach to the dry grass that separated the two walls a fight was going on in the lefthand breach and men were bunching behind it but sharpe could see the scots were gradually inching up the slope by god he thought but they were almost in the british guns had ceased firing for fear of hitting their own men sharpe turned right going to the second inner breach that morriss company was supposed to seal off high above him from the fire step of the inner wall defenders leaned over to fire down into the space between the ramparts sharpe seemed to be running through a hail of bullets that magically did not touch him smoke wreathed about him then he saw the broken stones of the breach in front and he leaped onto them and clambered upwards im with you dick tom garrard shouted just behind then a man appeared in the smoke above sharpe and heaved down a baulk of wood the timber struck sharpe on the chest throwing him back onto garrard who clutched at him as the two men fell on the stones sharpe swore as a fusillade of musket fire came down from the breach summit a handful of men was with him maybe six or seven but none seemed to be hit they crouched behind him waiting for orders no farther morris shouted no farther bugger him sharpe said and he picked up his musket just then the british guns seeing that the righthand breach was still occupied by the mahrattas opened fire again and the balls hammered into the stones just a few feet over sharpes head one defender was caught smack in the belly by an eighteenpounder shot and it seemed to sharpe that the man simply disintegrated in a red shower sharpe ducked as the blood poured down the stones trickling past him and garrard in small torrents jesus sharpe said another round shot slammed into the breach the sound of the balls strike as loud as thunder shards of stone whipped past sharpe and he seemed to be breathing nothing but hot dust no farther morris said here to me rally rally he was crouched under the inner wall safe from the defenders on the breach though high above him on the undamaged fire step arab soldiers still leaned out to fire straight down sharpe come here morris ordered come on sharpe shouted bugger morris and bugger all the other officers who said you could put a racing saddle on a cart horse but the beast would not go quick come on he shouted again as he clambered up the stones and suddenly there were more men to his right but they were scots and he saw that the leading men of the second assault group had reached the fortress a redhaired lieutenant led them a claymore in his hand the lieutenant was climbing the centre of the breach while sharpe was trying to clamber up the steeper flank the highlanders went past sharpe screaming at the enemy and the sight of their red coats made the british gunners cease fire and immediately the breach summit filled with robed men who carried curved swords with blades as thick as cleavers swords clashed muskets crashed and the redhaired lieutenant shook like a gaffed eel as a scimitar sliced into his belly he turned and fell towards sharpe dropping his claymore a line of defenders was now firing down the breach while a huge arab who looked seven feet tall to sharpe stood in the centre with a reddened scimitar and dared any man to challenge him two did and both he threw back in a shower of blood light company sharpe shouted give those bastards fire fire some muskets banged behind him and the row of defenders seemed to stagger back but they closed up again rallied by the huge man with the bloodstained scimitar sharpe had his left hand on the broken shoulder of the wall and he used it to haul himself up then twisted aside as the closest arabs turned and fired at him the balls whiplashed past as a naming lump of wadding struck sharpe on the cheek he let go of the wall and fell backwards as a grinning man tried to stab him with a bayonet dear god but the breach was steep his cheek was burnt and his new coat scorched the scots tried again surging up the centre of the breach to be met by a line of arab blades more arabs came from inside the fortress and poured a volley of musket fire down the face of the ramp sharpe aimed his musket at the tall arab and pulled the trigger the gun hammered into his shoulder but when the smoke cleared the big man was still standing and still fighting the arabs were winning here they were pressing down the face of the breach and chanting a bloodcurdling war cry as they killed a man rammed a bayonet at sharpe he parried it with his own but then an enemy grasped sharpes musket by the muzzle and tugged it upwards sharpe cursed but held on then saw a scimitar slashing towards him and so he let go of the musket and fell back again bastards he swore then saw the dead scottish lieutenants claymore lying on the stones he picked it up and swept it at the ankles of the arabs above him and the blade bit home and threw one man down and the scots were charging up the breach again climbing over their own dead and screaming a raw shout of hate that was matched by the arabs cries of victory sharpe climbed again he balanced on the steep stones and hacked with the claymore driving the enemy back he scrambled up two more feet wreathed in bitter smoke and reached the spot where he could grip the wall at the edge of the breach all he could do now was hold onto the stone with his left hand and thrust and swing with the sword he drove men back but then the big arab saw him and came across the breach bellowing at his comrades to leave the redcoats death to his scimitar he raised the sword high over his head like an executioner taking aim and sharpe was off balance push me tom he shouted and garrard put a hand on sharpes arse and shoved him hard upwards just as the scimitar started downwards but sharpe had let go of the wall and reached out to hook his left hand behind the tall mans ankle he tugged hard and the man shouted in alarm as his feet slid out from under him and as he bumped down the breachs flank now kill him sharpe bellowed and a halfdozen redcoats attacked the fallen man with bayonets as sharpe hacked at the arabs coming to the big mans rescue his claymore clashed with scimitars the blades ringing like blacksmiths hammers on anvils the big man was twisting and twitching as the bayonets stabbed again and again through his robes the scots were back thrusting and snarling up the centre and sharpe forced himself up another step garrard was beside him now and the two were only a step from the summit of the breach bastards bastards sharpe was panting as he hacked and lunged but the arabs robes seemed to soak up the blows then suddenly almost miraculously they backed away from him a musket fired from inside the fortress and one of the arabs crumpled down onto the breachs inner ramp and sharpe realized that the men who had fought their way through the lefthand breach must have turned and come to attack this breach from the inside come on he roared and he was on the summit at last and there were scots and light company men all about him as they spilt down into the outer fortress where a company of the scotch brigade waited to welcome them the defenders were fleeing to the southern gate which would lead them to the refuge of the inner fort jesus tom garrard said leaning over to catch his breath are you hurt sharpe asked garrard shook his head jesus he said again some enemy gunners who had stayed with their weapons till the last minute jumped down from the fire step dodged past the tired redcoats scattered inside the wall and fled southwards most of the scots and sepoys were too breathless to pursue them and contented themselves with some musket shots a dog barked madly until a sepoy kicked the beast into silence sharpe stopped it seemed suddenly quiet for the big guns were silent at last and the only muskets firing were from the mahrattas defending the gatehouse a few small cannon were firing to the south but sharpe could not see them nor guess what their target was the highest part of the fort lay to his right and there was nothing on the low summit but dry grassland and a few thorny trees no defenders gathered there to his left he could see kennys men assaulting the gatehouse they were storming the steps to the parapet where a handful of arabs were making a stand though they stood no chance for over a hundred redcoats now gathered under the wall and were firing up at the fire step the defenders robes turned red they were trapped now between the musket balls and the bayonets of the men climbing the steps and though some tried to surrender they were all killed the other mahrattas had fled gone over the high ground in the centre of the outer fort to the ravine and to the larger fort beyond a vat stood in an embrasure of the wall and sharpe heaved himself up and found as he had hoped that the barrel contained water for the abandoned guns they were very small cannon mostly mounted on iron tripods but they had inflicted a hard punishment on the men crammed along the forts approach the dead and wounded had been pushed aside to make way for the stream of men approaching the breaches major stokes was among them ahmed at his side and sharpe waved to them though they did not see him he dipped his hands in the water slung it over his face and hair then stooped and drank it was filthy stuff stagnant and bitter with powder debris but he was desperately thirsty a cheer sounded as colonel kennys men hoisted the british flag above the captured delhi gate manu bappoos flag was being folded by an aide to be carried back to britain a squad of scotsmen unbarred the big inner gate then the outer one to let even more redcoats into the fort that had fallen so quickly exhausted men slumped in the walls shade but kennys officers were shouting at them to find their units to load their muskets and move on south i think our orders are to guard the breach morris suggested as sharpe jumped down from the fire step we go on sharpe said savagely we we go on sir sharpe said investing the sir with a savage scorn move move move a major shouted at morris the job aint done yet move on he waved southwards sergeant green morris said reluct andy gather the men sharpe walked up the hill going to the high spot in the fort and once there he stared southwards beneath him the ground fell away gently at first then steeply until it disappeared in a rocky ravine that was deep in shadow but the far slope was sunlit and that slope was a precipitous climb to an unbreached wall and at the walls eastern end was a massive gatehouse far bigger than the one that had just been captured and that far gatehouse was thick with soldiers some had white coats and sharpe knew those men he had fought them before bloody hell he said softly what is it sharpe turned and saw garrard had followed him looks bloody nasty to me tom garrard stared at the inner fort from here he could see the palace the gardens and the de fences and suddenly those de fences were blotted out by smoke as the guns across the ravine opened fire on the redcoats who now spread across the outer fort the round shot screamed past sharpe and garrard bloody hell sharpe said again he had just fought his way through a breach to help capture a fort only to find that the days real work had scarcely begun manu bappoo had hoped to defend the breaches by concentrating his best fighters the lions of allah at their summits but that hope had been defeated by the british guns that had continued to fire at the breaches until the redcoats were almost at the top of the ramps no defender could stand in the breach and hope to live not until the guns ceased fire and by then the leading attackers were almost at the summit and so the lions of allah had been denied the advantage of higher ground the attackers and defenders had clashed amidst the dust and smoke at the top of the breach and there the greater height and strength of the scotsmen had prevailed manu bappoo had raged at his men he had fought in their front rank and taken a wound in his shoulder but his arabs had retreated they had gone back to the upper breaches and there the redcoats helped by their remorseless cannon had prevailed again and bappoo knew the outer fort was lost in itself that was no great loss nothing precious was stored in the outer fort it was merely an elaborate defence to slow an attacker as he approached the ravine but bappoo was galled by the swiftness of the british victory for a while he swore at the redcoats and tried to rally his men to defend the gatehouse but the british were now swarming over the breaches the gunners on the walls were abandoning their weapons and bappoo knew it was time to pull back into the stronghold of the inner fort go back he shouted go back his white tunic was soaked in his own blood but the wound was to his left shoulder and he could still wield the goldhilted tulwar that had been a gift from his brother go back the defenders retreated swiftly and the attackers seemed too spent to pursue bappoo waited until the last and then he walked backwards facing the enemy and daring them to come and kill him but they simply watched him go in a moment he knew they would reorganize themselves and advance to the ravine but by then he and his troops would be safely locked within the greater fortress the last sight bappoo had of the delhi gate was of an enemy flag being hauled to the top of the pole that had held his own flag then he dropped down the steep slope and was hustled through the south gate by his bodyguard the path now ran obliquely down the steep side of the ravine before turning a hairpin bend to climb to the inner fort the first of his men were already scrambling up that farther path the gunners on the southern wall who had been trying to stop the redcoats approaching on the road from the plain now abandoned their small cannon and joined the retreat bappoo could only follow them with tears in his eyes it did not matter that the battle was not lost that the inner fort still stood and was likely to stand through all eternity he had been humiliated by the swiftness of the defeat hurry sahib one of his aides said the british arent following bappoo said tiredly not yet those british the aide said and pointed west to where the road from the plain climbed to the ravine and there at the bend where the road disappeared about the flank of the steep slope was a company of redcoats they wore kilts and bappoo remembered them from argaum if those men hurried they might cut off bappoos retreat and so he quickened his pace it was not till he reached the bottom of the ravine that he realized something was wrong the leading groups of his men had reached the inner fort but instead of streaming into the gate they were milling about on the slope beneath whats happening he asked the gates are shut sahib his aide said in wonderment theyll open any minute bappoo said and turned as a musket bullet whistled down from the slope behind him the british who had captured the outer fort had at last advanced to the edge of the ravine and beneath them they saw the mass of retreating enemy so they began to fire down hurry bappoo shouted and his men pushed on up the hill but still the gates did not open the british fire became heavier redcoats were lining the hilltop now and pouring musket fire into the ravine bullets ricocheted from the stone sides and flicked down into the press of men panic began to infect them and bappoo shouted at them to be calm and return the fire while he pushed through the throng to discover why the inner forts gates were closed dodd he shouted as he came close dodd colonel dodds face appeared above the rampart he looked quite calm though he said nothing open the gate bappoo shouted angrily dodds response was to raise the rifle to his shoulder bappoo stared up into the muzzle he knew he should run or twist away but the horror of fate kept him rooted to the path dodd he said in puzzlement and then the rifle was blotted out by the smoke of its discharge the bullet struck bappoo on the breastbone shattering it and driving scraps of bone deep into his heart the prince took two shuddering breaths and then was dead his men gave a great wail as the news of their princes death spread and then unable to endure the plunging fire from the outer fort and denied entrance to the inner they fled west towards the road which dropped to the plain but the road was blocked the highlanders of the th were nearing its summit and they now saw a great panicked mass surging towards them the scotsmen had endured the artillery fire of the outer fort during their long climb but now those guns had been abandoned to their right the cliffs soared up to the inner fort while to their left was a precipice above a dizzying gorge there was only room for twelve men to stand abreast on the road but colonel chalmers who led the th knew that was space enough he formed his leading halfcompany into three ranks with the front row kneeling youll fire by ranks he said quietly the panicked defenders ran towards the kilted highlanders who waited until every shot could kill front rank fire chalmers said the muskets started and one by one the three ranks fired and the steady fusillade tore into the approaching fugitives some tried to turn and retreat but the press behind was too great and still the relentless fire ripped into them while behind them redcoats came down from the outer fort to attack their rear the first men jumped off the cliff and their terrible screams faded as they plunged down to the rocks far beneath the road was thick with bodies and running with blood advance twenty paces chalmers ordered the highlanders marched halted knelt and began firing again bappoos survivors betrayed by dodd were trapped between two forces they were stranded in a hell above emptiness a slaughter in the high hills there were screams as men tumbled to their deaths far beneath and still the fire kept coming it kept coming until there was nothing left but quivering men crouching in terror on a road that was rank with the stench of blood and then the redcoats moved forward with bayonets the outer fort had fallen and its garrison had been massacred and william dodd renegade was lord of gawilghur chapter mister hakeswill was not sure whether he was a lieutenant in william dodds eyes but he knew he was a mister and he dimly apprehended that he could be much more william dodd was going to win and his victory would make him ruler of gawilghur and tyrant of all the wide land that could be seen from its soaring battlements mister hakeswill was therefore well placed as dodds only white officer to profit from the victory and as he approached the palace on gawilghurs summit hakeswill was already imagining a future that was limited only by the bounds of his fancy he could be a rajah he decided i shall have an harem he said aloud earning a worried look from his havildar an harem ill have all of me own bibbis in silk but only when its cold eh rest of the time theyll have to be naked as needles he laughed scratched at the lice in his crotch then lunged with his sword at one of the peacocks that decorated the palace gardens bad luck them birds hakeswill told the havildar as the bird fled in a flurry of bright severed feathers bad luck they are got the evil eye they do know what you should do with a peacock roast the bugger roast it and serve it with taters very nice that yes sahib the havildar said nervously he was not certain he liked this new white officer whose face twitched so compulsively but colonel dodd had appointed him and the colonel could do no wrong as far as the havildar was concerned havent tasted a tater in months hakeswill said wistfully christian food that see makes us white yes sahib and i wont be sahib will i your highness thats what ill be your bleeding highness with a bedful of bare bibb is his face twitched as a bright idea occurred to him i could have sharpie as a servant cut off his goo lies first though snip snip he bounded enthusiastically up a stone staircase oblivious of the sound of gunfire that had erupted in the ravine just north of the inner fort two arab guards moved to bar the way but hakeswill shouted at them off to the walls you scum no more shirking you aint guarding the royal pisspot any longer but has to be soldiers so piss off the havildar ordered the two men away and though they were reluctant to abandon their post they were overawed by the number of bayonets that faced them so just like the guards who had stood at the garden gate they fled so now we look for the little fat man hakeswill said and give him a bloodletting we must hurry sahib the havildar said glancing back at the wall above the ravine where the gunners were suddenly at work gods work cant be hurried hakeswill answered pulling at one of the latticed doors that led into the palace and colonel dodd will die of old age on that wall sonny aint a man alive who can get through that gate and certainly not a pack of bleeding scotchmen bugger this door he raised his right foot and battered down the locked lattice with his boot hakeswill had expected a palace dripping with gold festooned with silk and paved with polished marble but gawilghur had only ever been a summer refuge and berar had never been as wealthy as other indian states and so the floors were common stone the walls were painted in lime wash and the curtains were of cotton some fine furniture of ebony inlaid with ivory stood in the hallway but hakeswill had no eye for such chairs only for jewels and he saw none two bronze jars and an iron cuspidor stood by the walls where lizards waited motionless while a brass poker tongs and fire shovel cast in birmingham mounted on a stand and long bereft of any hearth had pride of place in a niche the hallway had no guards indeed no one was in sight and the palace seemed silent except for a faint sound of choking and moaning that came from a curtained doorway at the far end of the hall the noise of the guns was muffled hakeswill hefted his sword and edged towards the curtain his men followed slowly bayonets ready eyes peering into every shadow hakeswill swept the curtain aside with the blade and gasped the killadar with a tulwar slung at his side and a small round shield strapped to his left arm stared at hakeswill above the bodies of his wives concubines and daughters eighteen women were on the floor most were motionless but some still writhed as the slow pain of the poison worked its horrors the killadar was in tears i could not leave them for the english he said what did he say hakeswill demanded he preferred they should die than be dishonoured the havildar translated bleeding hell hakeswill commented he stepped down into the sunken floor where the women lay the dead had greenish dribbles coming from their mouths and their glassy eyes stared up at the lotuses painted on the ceiling while the living jerked spasmodically the cups from which they had drunk the poison lay on the tiled floor some nice bibb is here hakeswill said ruefully a waste he stared at a child no more than six or seven there was a jewel about her neck and hakeswill stooped grasped the pendant and snapped the chain bleeding waste he said in disgust then used his sword blade to lift the said of a dying woman he raised the silk to her waist then shook his head look at that he said just look at that what a bleeding waste the killadar roared in anger drew his tulwar and ran down the steps to drive hakeswill from his women hakeswill alarmed backed away then remembered he was to be a rajah and could not show timidity in front of the havildar and his men so he stepped forward again and thrust the sword forward in a clumsy lunge it might have been clumsy but it was also lucky for the killadar had stumbled on a body and was lurching forward his tulwar flailing as he sought his balance and the tip of hakeswills blade ripped into his throat so that a spray of blood pulsed onto the dead and the dying the killadar gasped as he fell his legs twitched as he tried to bring the tulwar round to strike at hakeswill but his strength was going and the englishman was above him now youre a djinnl the killadar said hoarsely the sword stabbed into beny singhs neck i aint drunk you bastard hakeswill said indignantly aint seen a drop of mothers milk in three years he twisted the sword blade fascinated by the way the blood pulsed past the steel he watched until the blood finally died to a trickle then jerked the blade free thats him gone hakeswill said another bloody heathen gone down to hell eh the havildar stared in horror at beny singh and at the corpses drenched with his blood dont just stand there you great pudding hakeswill snapped get back to the walls the walls sahib hurry theres a battle being fought or aint you noticed go on off with you take the company and report to colonel dodd as how the fat little buggers dead tell him ill be back in a minute or two now off with you quick the havildar obeyed taking his men back through the hallway and out into the sunlight that was being hazed by the smoke rising from the ravine hakeswill left alone in the palace stooped to his work all the dead wore jewellery they were not great jewels not like the massive ruby that the tippoo sultan had worn on his hat but there were pearls and emeralds sapphires and small diamonds all mounted in gold and hakeswill busied himself delving through the bloodied silks to retrieve the scraps of wealth he crammed the stones into his pockets where they joined the gems he had taken from sharpe and then when the corpses were stripped and searched he roamed the palace snarling at servants and threatening scullions as he ransacked the smaller rooms the rest of the defenders could fight mister hakeswill was getting rich the fight in the ravine was now a merciless massacre the garrison of the outer fort was trapped between the soldiers who had captured their stronghold and the kilted highlanders advancing up the narrow road and there was no escape except over the precipice and those who jumped or were pushed by the panicking mass fell onto the shadowed rocks far below colonel chalmerss men advanced with bayonets herding the fugitives towards kennys men who greeted them with more bayonets a thousand men had garrisoned the outer fort and those men were now dead or doomed but seven thousand more defenders waited within the inner fort and colonel kenny was eager to attack them he tried to order men into ranks tugging them away from the slaughter and shouting for gunners to find an enemy cannon that could be fetched from the captured ramparts and dragged to face the massive gate of the inner fort but the redcoats had an easier target in the huddled fugitives and they enthusiastically killed the helpless enemy and all the while the guns of the inner fort fired down at the redcoats while rockets slammed into the ravine to add to the choking fog of powder smoke the slaughter could not endure the beaten defenders threw down their guns and fell to their knees and gradually the british officers called off the massacre chalmerss highlanders advanced up the road that was now slippery with blood driving the few prisoners in front of them wounded arabs crawled or limped the survivors were stripped of their remaining weapons and sent under sepoy guard back up to the outer fort and for every step of their way they suffered from the fire that flamed and crackled from the inner fort finally exhausted they were taken out through the delhi gate and told to wait beside the tank the parched prisoners threw themselves at the greenscummed water and some seeing that the sepoy guards were few in number slipped away northwards they went without weapons master less fugitives who posed no threat to the british camp which was guarded by a half battalion of madrassi sepoys the northern face of the ravine which looked towards the unconquered inner fort was now crowded with some three thousand redcoats most of whom did nothing but sit in whatever small shade they could find and grumble that the pucka lees had not fetched water once in a while a man would fire a musket across the ravine but the balls were wild at that long range and the enemy fire which had been heavy during the massacre on the western road gradually eased off as both sides waited for the real struggle to begin sharpe was halfway down the ravine seated beneath a stunted tree on which the remnants of some red blossom hung dry and faded a tribe of blackfaced silverfurred monkeys had fled the irruption of men into the rocky gorge and those beasts now gathered behind sharpe where they gibbered and screamed tom garrard and a dozen men of the rds light company had gathered around sharpe while the rest of the company was lower down the ravine among some rocks what happens now garrard asked some poor bastards have to get through that gate sharpe said not you kenny will call us when he needs us sharpe said nodding towards the lean colonel who had at last organized an assault party at the bottom of the track which slanted up towards the gate and he bloody will tom it aint going to be easy getting through that gate he touched the scorch mark on his cheek that bloody hurts tut some butter on it garrard said and where do i get bleeding butter here sharpe asked he shaded his eyes and peered at the complex ramparts above the big gate trying to spot either dodd or hakeswill but although he could see the white jackets of the cobras he could not see a white man on the ramparts its going to be a long fight tom he said the british gunners had succeeded in bringing an enemy five pounder cannon to the edge of the ravine the sight of the gun provoked a flurry of fire from the inner fort wreathing its gatehouse in smoke as the round shot screamed across the ravine to plunge all around the threatening gun somehow it survived the gunners rammed it aimed it then fired a shot that bounced just beneath the gate ricocheted up into the woodwork but fell back the defenders kept firing but their smoke obscured their aim and the small captured cannon had been positioned behind a large low rock that served as a makeshift breastwork the gunners elevated the barrel a trifle and their next shot struck plumb on the gates breaking a timber each successive shot splintered more wood and was greeted by an ironic cheer from the redcoats who watched from across the ravine the gate was being demolished board by board and at last a round shot cracked into its locking bar and the halfshattered timbers sagged on their hinges colonel kenny was gathering his assault troops at the foot of the ravine they were the same men who had gone first into the breaches of the outer fort and their faces were stained with powder burns with dust and sweat they watched the destruction of the outer gate of the inner fort and they knew they must climb the path into the enemys fire as soon as the gun had done its work kenny summoned an aide you know plummer he asked the man gunner major sir find him kenny said or any gunner officer tell them we might need a light piece up in the gateway he pointed with a reddened sword at the inner forts gatehouse the passage aint straight he explained to the aide get through the gate and we turn hard left if our axe men cant deal with the other gates well need a gun to blow them in the aide climbed back up to the outer fort looking for a gunner kenny talked to his men explaining that once they were through the shattered gate they would find themselves faced by another and that the infantry were to fire up at the flanking fire steps to protect the axe men who would try to hack their way through the successive obstacles if we put up enough fire kenny said the enemyll take shelter it wont take long he looked at his axe men all of them huge sappers all carrying vastbladed axes that had been sharpened to wicked edges kenny turned and watched the effect of the fivepounder shots the gates locking bar had been struck plumb but the gate still held a badly aimed shot cracked into the stone beside the gate starting up dust then a correction to the gun sent a ball hammering into the bar again and the thick timber broke and the remnants of the gates fell inwards forward kenny shouted forward four hundred redcoats followed the colonel up the narrow track that led to the inner fort they could not run to the assault for the hill was too steep they could only trudge into the fury of dodds fusillade cannon rockets and muskets blasted down the hill to tear gaps in kennys ranks give them fire an officer on the ravines northern side shouted at the watching redcoats and the men loaded their muskets and fired at the smokemasked gatehouse if nothing else the wild fire might keep the defenders heads down another cannon had been fetched from the outer fort and now added its small round shots to the fury that beat audibly on the gatehouse ramparts those ramparts were thick with the powder smoke gouted by the defenders cannon and muskets and it was that smoke which protected kennys men as they hurried up the last few yards to the broken gate protect the sappers kenny shouted and then his sword in his hand he clambered over the broken timbers and led his attackers into the entrance passage facing kenny was a stone wall he had expected it but even so he was astonished by the narrowness of the passage that turned sharply to his left and then climbed steeply to the second unbroken gate there it is he shouted and led a surge of men up the cobbled road towards the ironstudded timbers and hell was loosed the fire steps above the gateway passage were protected by the outer walls high rampart and dodds men though they could hear the musket balls beating against the stones were safe from the wild fire that lashed across the deep ravine but the redcoats beneath them the men following colonel kenny into the passage had no protection musket fire stones and rockets slashed into a narrow space just twentyfive paces long and eight wide the leading axe men were among the first to die beaten down by bullets their blood splashed high on the walls colonel kenny somehow survived the opening salvo then he was struck on the shoulder by a lump of stone and driven to the ground a rocket slashed past his face scorching his cheek but he picked himself up and sword in numbed hand shouted at his men to keep going no one could hear him the narrow space was filled with noise choking with smoke in which men died and rockets flared a musket ball struck kenny in the hip and he twisted half fell but forced himself to stand and with blood pouring down his white breeches limped on then another musket ball scored down his back and threw him forward he crawled on bloodslicked stones sword still in his hand and shuddered as a third ball hit him in the back he still managed to reach the second gate and reared up to strike it with his sword and then a last musket ball split his skull and left him dead at the head of his men more bullets plucked at his corpse kennys surviving men tried to brave the fire they tried to climb the slope to the second gate but the murderous fire did not cease and the dead made a barrier to the living some men attempted to fire up at their tormentors on the fire step but the sun was high now and they aimed into a blinding glare and soon the redcoats began to back down the passage the weltering fire from above did not let up it flayed the scotsmen ricocheted between the walls struck dead and dying and living while the rockets lit and tossed down seared like great comets between the stone walls and filled the space with a sickening smoke the dead were burned by rocket flames which exploded their cartridge boxes to pulse gouts of blood against the black walls but the smoke hid the survivors who under its cover stumbled back to the hill outside the fortress they left a stonewalled passage filled with the dying and the dead trickling with blood foul with smoke and echoing with the moans of the wounded cease fire colonel dodd shouted cease fire the smoke cleared slowly and dodd stared down at a pit of carnage in which a few bodies twitched theyll come again soon dodd warned his cobras fetch more stones make sure your muskets are loaded more rockets he patted his men on the shoulders congratulating them they grinned at him pleased with their work it was like killing rats in a barrel not one cobra had been hit the first enemy assault had failed and the others dodd was certain would end in just the same way the lord of gawilghur was winning his first victory major stokes had found sharpe shortly before kenny made his assault and the two men had been joined first by syud sevajee and his followers then by the dozen cavalrymen who accompanied eli lockhart all of them stokes sevajee and lockhart had entered the outer fort after the fight for the breaches was finished and now they stood watching the failure of kennys assault the survivors of the attack were crouching just yards from the broken entrance that boiled with smoke and sharpe knew they were summoning the courage to charge again poor bastards he said no choice in the matter stokes said bleakly no other way in that aint a way in sir sharpe said dourly thats a fast road to a shallow grave overwhelm them stokes said thats the way to do it overwhelm them send more men to be killed sharpe asked angrily get a gun over that side stokes suggested and blast the gates down one after the other only way to prise the place open sharpe the covering fire that had blazed across the ravine died when it was obvious the first attack had failed and the lull encouraged the defenders to come to the outer embrasures and fire down at the stalled attackers give them fire an officer shouted from the bed of the ravine and again the muskets flared across the gorge and the balls spattered against the walls major stokes had levelled his telescope at the gate where the thick smoke had at last dissipated it aint good he admitted it opens onto a blank wall it does what sir eli lockhart asked the cavalry sergeant was looking aghast at the horror across the ravine grateful perhaps that the cavalry was never asked to break into such deathtraps the passage turns stokes said we cant fire straight up the entranceway theyll have to drag a gun right into the archway theyll never make it sharpe said any gun positioned in the outer arch would get the full fury of the defensive fire and those defenders were protected by the big outer wall the only way sharpe could see of getting into the fortress was by battering the whole gatehouse flat and that would take days of heavy cannon fire the gates of hell stokes said softly staring through his glass at the bodies left inside the arch can i borrow the telescope sir sharpe asked of course stokes cleaned the eyepiece on the hem of his jacket it aint a pretty sight though sharpe took the glass and aimed it across the ravine he gave the gatehouse a cursory glance then edged the lens along the wall which led westwards from the besieged gate the wall was not very high perhaps only twelve or fifteen feet much lower than the great ramparts about the gatehouse and its embrasures did not appear to be heavily manned but that was hardly a surprise for the wall stood atop a precipice the de fences straight ahead were not the wall and its handful of defenders but the stony cliff which fell down into the ravine stokes saw where sharpe was aiming the glass no way in there richard sharpe said nothing he was staring at a place where weeds and small shrubs twisted up the cliff he tracked the telescope from the bed of the ravine to the base of the wall searching every inch and he reckoned it could be climbed it would be hard for it was perilously steep but if there was space for bushes to find lodgement then a man could follow and at the top of the cliff there was a brief area of grass between the precipice and the wall he took the telescope from his eye has anyone seen a ladder back up there it was ahmed who answered where lad up there the arab boy pointed to the outer fort on the ground he said sharpe twisted and looked at lockhart can you boys fetch me a ladder what are you thinking of lockhart asked a way in sharpe said a bloody way in he gave the telescope to stokes get me a ladder sergeant he said and ill fix those buggers properly ahrned show sergeant lockhart where you saw the ladder i stay with you the boy said stubbornly you bloody dont sharpe patted the boy on the head wondering what ahmed made of the slaughter that had been inflicted on his countrymen in the ravine but the boy seemed blessedly unaffected go and help the sergeant he told ahmed ahmed led the cavalrymen uphill what are you doing richard stokes asked we can climb up to the wall sharpe said pointing to where the trail of weeds and bushes snaked up the other side of the ravine not you sir but a light company can do it go up the ravine send a ladder up and cross the wall stokes trained the telescope and stared at the opposing cliff for a long while you might get up he said dubiously but then what sharpe grinned we attack the gatehouse from the back sir one company where one company can go sir another can follow once they see were up there other men will come he still held the great claymore which was too big to fit into the scabbard of his borrowed sword but now he discarded that scabbard and shoved the claymore into his belt he liked the sword it was heavy straightbladed and brutal not a weapon for delicate work but a killer something to give a man confidence you stay here sir he told stokes and look after ahmed for me the little bugger would love to get in a fight but he aint got the sense of a louse when it comes to a scrap and hes bound to get killed tom he called to garrard then beckoned that he and the rest of the rds light company should follow him down to where morris sheltered among the rocks when eli gets here with the ladder sir he added to stokes send him down sharpe ran down the ravines steep side into the smokereeking shadows where morris was seated under a tree making a meal out of bread salt beef and whatever liquor was left in his canteen dont have enough food for you sharpe he said not hungry sharpe lied youre sweating man morris complained why dont you find yourself some shade theres nothing we can do until the gunners knock that bloody gatehouse flat there is sharpe said morris cocked a sceptical eye up at sharpe ive had no orders ensign he said i want you and the light company sir sharpe said respectfully theres a way up the side of the ravine sir and if we can get a ladder to the top then we can cross the wall and go at the bastards from the back morris tipped the canteen to his mouth drank then wiped his lips if you twenty like you and the archangel gabriel and all the bloody saints asked me to climb the ravine sharpe i would still say no now for christs sake man stop trying to be a bloody hero leave it to the poor bastards who are under orders and go away he waved a hand sir sharpe pleaded we can do it ive sent for a ladder no morris interrupted loudly attracting the attention of the rest of the company i am not giving you my company sharpe for gods sake youre not even a proper officer youre just a bumpedup sergeant a bloody ensign too big for your boots and allow me to remind you mister sharpe forbidden by army regulations to serve in this regiment now go away and leave me in peace i thought youd say that charles sharpe said ruefully and stop calling me charles morris exploded we are not friends you and i and kindly obey my order to leave me in peace or had you not noticed that i outrank you i had noticed sorry sir sharpe said humbly and he started to turn away but suddenly whipped back and seized morriss coat he dragged the captain back into the rocks going so fast that morris was momentarily incapable of resistance once among the rocks sharpe let go of the patched coat and thumped morris in the belly thats for the flogging you gave me you bastard he said what the hell do you think youre doing sharpe morris asked scrambling away on his bottom sharpe kicked him in the chest leaned down hauled him up and thumped him on the jaw morris squealed with pain then gasped as sharpe backhanded him across the cheek then struck him again a group of men had followed and were watching wideeyed morris turned to appeal to them but sharpe hit him yet again and the cap tains eyes turned glassy as he swayed and collapsed sharpe bent over him you might outrank me he said but youre a piece of shit charlie and you always were now can i take the company no morris said through the blood on his lips thank you sir sharpe said and stamped his boot hard down on morriss head driving it onto a rock morris gasped choked then lay immobile as the breath scraped in his throat sharpe kicked morriss head again just for the hell of it then turned smiling wheres sergeant green here sir green looking anxious pushed through the watching men im here sir he said staring with astonishment at the immobile morris captain morris has eaten something that disagreed with him sharpe said but before he was taken ill he expressed the wish that i should temporarily take command of the company sergeant green looked at the battered bleeding captain then back to sharpe something he ate sir are you a doctor sergeant wear a black plume on your hat do you no sir then stop questioning my statements have the company paraded muskets loaded no bayonets fixed green hesitated do it sergeant sharpe roared startling the watching men yes sir green said hurriedly backing away sharpe waited until the company was in its four ranks many of them looked at him suspiciously but they were powerless to challenge his authority not while sergeant green had accepted it youre a light company sharpe said and that means you can go where other soldiers cant it makes you an elite you know what that means it means youre the best in the bloody army and right now the army needs its best men it needs you so in a minute well be climbing up there he pointed to the ravine crossing the wall and carrying the fight to the enemy itll be hard work for a bit but not beyond a decent light company he looked to his left and saw eli lockhart leading his men down the side of the ravine with one of the discarded bamboo ladders ill go first he told the company and sergeant green will go last if any man refuses to climb sergeant youre to shoot the bugger i am sir green asked nervously in the head sharpe said major stokes had followed lockhart and now came up to sharpe ill arrange for some covering fire sharpe he said thatll be a help sir not that these men need much help theyre the rds light company best in the army im sure they are stokes said smiling at the seventy men who seeing a major with sharpe supposed that the ensign really did have the authority to do what he was proposing lockhart in his blue and yellow coat waited with the ladder where do you want it mister sharpe over here sharpe said just pass it up when weve reached the top sergeant green send the men in ranks front rank first he walked to the side of the ravine and stared up his chosen route it looked steeper from here and much higher than it had seemed when he was staring through the telescope but he still reckoned it was climbable he could not see the inner forts wall but that was good for neither could the defenders see him all the same it was bloody steep steep enough to give a mountain goat pause yet if he failed now then he would be on a charge for striking a superior officer so he really had no choice but to play the hero so he spat on his bruised hands looked up one last time then started to climb the second assault on the inner forts gatehouse fared no better than the first a howling mass of men charged through the wreckage of the shattered gate stumbled on the dead and dying as they turned up the passage but then the killing began again as a shower of missiles rockets and musket fire turned the narrow steep passage into a charnel house an axe man succeeded in reaching the second gate and he stood above colonel kennys scorched body to sink his blade deep into the timber but he was immediately struck by three musket balls and dropped back leaving the axe embedded in the dark ironstudded wood no one else went close to the gate and a major appalled at the slaughter called the men back next time he shouted at them we designate firing parties to give cover sergeant i want two dozen men we need a cannon sir the sergeant answered with brutal honesty they say ones coming the aide whom kenny had sent to fetch a cannon had returned to the assault party they say itll take time though he added without explaining that the gunner officer had declared it would take at least two hours to manhandle a gun and ammunition across the ravine the major shook his head well try without the gun he said god help us the sergeant said under his breath colonel dodd had watched the attackers limp away he could not help smiling this was so very simple just as he had foreseen manu bappoo was dead and the havildar had returned from the palace with the welcome news of beny singhs murder which meant that gawilghur had a new commander he looked down at the dead and dying redcoats who lay among the small flickering blue flames of the spent rockets theyve learned their lesson gopal he told his jemadar so next time theyll try to keep us quiet by firing bigger volleys up at the fire steps toss down rockets thatll spoil their aim rockets sahib lots of rockets dodd said he patted his men on their backs their faces were singed by the explosions of the powder in their muskets pans they were thirsty and hot but they were winning and they knew it they were his cobras as well trained as any troops in india and they would be at the heart of the army that dodd would unleash from this fortress to dominate the lands the british must relinquish when their southern army was broken why dont they give up gopal asked dodd a sentry on the wall had reported that the bloodied attackers were forming to charge again because theyre brave men jemadar dodd said but also stupid the furious musket fire had started again from across the ravine a sign that a new attack would soon come into the bloodslick gateway dodd drew his pistol checked it was loaded and walked back to watch the next failure let them come he thought for the more who died here the fewer would remain to trouble him as he pursued the beaten remnant south across the deccan plain get ready he called slow matches burned on the fire step and his men crouched beside them with rockets waiting to light the fuses and toss the terrible weapons down into the killing place a defiant cheer sounded and the redcoats came again to the slaughter the cliff face was far steeper than sharpe had anticipated though it was not sheer rock but rather a series of cracks in which plants had taken root and he found that he could pull himself up by using stony outcrops and the thick stalks of the bigger shrubs he needed both hands tom garrard came behind and more than once sharpe trod on his friends hands sorry tom just keep going garrard panted it became easier after the first ten feet for the face now sloped away and there was even room for two or three men to stand together on a weedcovered ledge sharpe called for the ladder and it was pushed up to him by the cavalrymen the bamboo was light and he hooked the top rung over his right shoulder and climbed on upwards following a jagged line of rocks and bushes that gave easy footing a line of redcoats trailed him muskets slung there were more bushes to sharpes left shielding him from the ramparts but after he had climbed twenty feet those bushes ended and he prayed that the defenders would all be staring at the beleaguered gatehouse rather than at the precipice below he pulled himself up the last few feet cursing the ladder that seemed to get caught on every protrusion the sun beat off the stone and the sweat poured down him he was panting when he reached the top and now there was nothing but steep open ground between him and the walls base fifty feet of rough grass to cross and then he would be at the wall he crouched at the edge of the cliff waiting for the men to catch up still no one had seen him from the walls tom garrard dropped beside him when we go tom sharpe said we run like bloody hell straight to the wall ladder up climb like rats and jump over the bloody top tell the lads to get over fast bastards on the other side are going to try and kill us before we can get reinforced so were going to need plenty of muskets to fend the buggers off garrard peered up at the embrasures theres no one there theres a few there sharpe said but they aint taking much notice dozy they are he added and thank god for that he thought for a handful of defenders with loaded muskets could stop him dead and dead is what he had better be after striking morris unless he could cross the ramparts and open the gates he peered up at the battlements as more men hauled themselves over the edge of the cliff he guessed the wall was lightly manned by little more than a picquet line for no one would have anticipated that the cliff could be climbed but he also guessed that once the redcoats appeared the defenders would quickly reinforce the threatened spot garrard grinned at sharpe did you thump morris what else could i do hell have you courtmartialed not if we win here sharpe said if we get those gates open tom well be bloody heroes and if we dont well be dead sharpe said curtly then turned to see eli lockhart scrambling onto the grass what the hell are you doing here sharpe demanded i got lost lockhart said and hefted a musket he had taken from a soldier below some of your boys aint too keen on being heroes so me and my boys are making up the numbers and it was not just lockharts cavalrymen who were climbing but some kilted highlanders and sepoys who had seen the light company scrambling up the cliff and decided to join in too the more the merrier sharpe decided he counted heads and saw he had thirty men and more were coming it was time to go for the enemy would not stay asleep for long we have to get over the wall fast he told them all and once were over we form two ranks he stood and hefted the ladder high over his head holding it with both hands then ran up the steep grass his boots which were syud sevajees castoffs had smooth soles and slipped on the grass but he stumbled on and went even faster when he heard an aggrieved shout from high above him he knew what was coming next and he was still thirty feet from the walls a sitting target and then he heard the bang of the musket and saw the grass flatten ahead of him as the gases from the barrel lashed downwards smoke eddied around him but the ball had thumped into one of the ladders thick uprights and then another musket fired and he saw a fleck of turf dance up give them fire major stokes roared from the bottom of the ravine give them fire a hundred redcoats and sepoys blasted up at the walls sharpe heard the musket shots clatter on the stone and then he was hard under the rampart and he dropped the leading end of the ladder and rammed it into the turf and swung the other end up and over a bloody escalade he thought a breach and an escalade all in one day and he pulled the claymore out from his belt and pushed garrard away from the foot of the ladder me first he growled and began to climb the rungs were springy and he had the terrible thought that maybe they would break after the first few men had used the ladder and then a handful of soldiers would be trapped inside the fortress where they would be cut down by the mahrattas but there was no time to dwell on that fear just to keep climbing the musket balls raided the stones to left and right in a torrent of fire that had driven the defenders back from the parapet but at any second sharpe would be alone up there he roared a shout of defiance reached the top of the ladder and extended his free hand to grip the stone he hauled himself through the embrasure he paused trying to get a sense of what lay beyond but garrard shoved him and he had no option but to spring through the embrasure there was no fire step jesus he thought and jumped it was not a long jump down maybe eight or ten feet for the ground was higher on the inner side of the wall he sprawled on the turf and a musket bullet whipped over his back he rolled got to his feet and saw that the defenders had low wooden platforms that they had been using to peer over the top of the wall those defenders were running towards him now but they were few very few and already sharpe had five redcoats on his side of the wall and more were coming but so was the enemy some from the west and more from the east tom look after those men sharpe pointed westwards then he turned the other way and dragged three men into a crude rank present he called the muskets went up into their shoulders aim low boys he said fire the muskets coughed out smoke a mahratta slid on the grass the others turned and ran appalled at the stream of men now crossing the wall it was a curious mix of english skirmishers highland infantry sepoys cavalrymen and even some of syud sevajees followers in their borrowed red jackets two ranks sharpe shouted quick now two ranks tom whats happening behind me buggers have gone sir two ranks sharpe shouted again he could not see the gatehouse from here because the hill inside the wall bulged outwards and hid the great ramparts from him but the enemy was forming two hundred paces eastwards the walls defenders in brown jackets were joining a company of whitecoated cobras who must have been in reserve and those men would have to be defeated before sharpe could hope to advance on the gatehouse he glanced up the hill and saw nothing there except a building half hidden by trees in which monkeys gibbered no defenders there thank god so he could ignore his right flank a scottish sergeant had shoved and tugged the men into two ranks load sharpe said though most of the men were already loaded sergeant sir advance along the wall no ones to fire till i give the word sergeant green sharpe called waited sergeant green green had evidently not crossed the wall yet or maybe he had not even climbed the cliff sergeant green sharpe bellowed again why do you need him a voice called it was a scottish captain christ sharpe thought but he was outranked to bring the next group on ill do it the scotsman said you go advance sharpe shouted by the centre the sergeant shouted march it was a ragged advance the men had no fileclosers and they spread out but sharpe did not much care the thing was to close on the enemy that had always been mccandlesss advice get close and start killing because theres bugger all you can do at long range though the scottish colonel would never have used that word this is for you mccandless sharpe thought this ones for you and it struck him that this was the first time he had ever taken troops into formal battle line against line muskets against muskets he was nervous and made even more nervous by the fact that he was leading a makeshift company in full view of the thousands of redcoats on the ravines northern slope it was like being trapped on stage in a full theatre lose here he thought and all the army would know he watched the enemy officer a tall man with a dark face and a large moustache he looked calm and his men marched in three tight ranks well trained sharpe thought but then no one had ever said william dodd could not whip troops into shape the cobras stopped when the two units were a hundred paces apart they levelled their muskets and sharpe saw his men falter keep going he ordered keep going you heard the man the scottish sergeant bellowed keep going sharpe was at the righthand flank of his line he glanced behind to see more men running to catch up their equipment flapping as they stumbled over the uneven ground christ sharpe thought but im inside were in and then the cobras fired and sharpe ensign and bullock driver had a battle on his hands the redcoats stormed the gatehouse a third time this attempt led by two squads who hugged the walls either side of the passage and then turned their muskets up to blast the defenders on the opposite fire step the tactic seemed to work for they ripped off their first volley and under its cover a third squad comprised of axe men charged over the dead and dying and scrambled up the steep stone path towards the second gate then the lit rockets began to drop from on high they struck the bodies and then flamed into life and ricocheted madly about the confined space they tore into the two musket squads flamed among the axe men choked men with their smoke burned them with flame and exploded to strew the carnage with more blood and guts the axe men never even reached the gate they died under the musket fire that followed the rockets or else wounded they tried to crawl back through the thick smoke rocks hurtled down from the flanking fire steps pulping the dead and the living into horror the survivors fled defeated again enough colonel dodd shouted at his men enough he peered down into the stone chamber it looked like something from hell a place where broken things twitched in blood beneath a reeking pall of smoke the rocket carcasses still burned the wounded cried for help that was not coming and dodd felt an elation sear through him it was even easier than he had dared to hope sahib gopal said urgently sahib what sahib look gopal was pointing westwards there was smoke and the crackling sound of a musket fight the noise and smoke were coming from just beyond the curve of the hill so dodd could not see what was happening but the sound was enough to convince him that a considerable fight had broken out a quartermile away and that might not have mattered except that the smoke and the noise came from inside the wall jesus dodd swore find out whats happening gopal quick he could not lose he must not lose wheres mister hakeswill he shouted wanting the deserter to take over gopals responsibilities on the fire step but the twitching sergeant had vanished the musketry went on but beneath dodd there were only moans and the smell of burning flesh he stared westwards if the damned redcoats had crossed the wall then he would need more infantry to drive them out and seal whatever place they had found to penetrate the inner fort havildar he summoned the man who had accompanied hakeswill to the palace go to the southern gate and tell them to send a battalion here quick sahib the man said and ran dodd found that he was shaking slightly it was just a small tremor in his right hand which he stilled by gripping the gold elephantshaped hilt of his sword there was no need to panic he told himself everything was under control but he could not rid himself of the thought that there would be no escape from this place in every other fight since he had defected from british service he had made certain of a route along which he could retreat but from this high fortress on its soaring bluff there was no way out he must win or else he must die he watched the smoke to the west the firing was constant now suggesting that the enemy was inside the fort in force his hand twitched but this time he did not notice as for the first time in weeks the lord of gawilghur began to fear defeat the volley from the company of whitecoated cobras hammered towards sharpes men but because they were spread more widely than usual many of the balls wasted themselves in the gaps between the files some men went down and the rest instinctively checked but sharpe shouted at them to keep marching the enemy was hidden in smoke but sharpe knew they would be reloading close the files sergeant he shouted close up close up the scots sergeant called he glanced at sharpe suspecting that he was taking the small company too close to the enemy the range was already down to sixty yards sharpe could just see one of the indians through the smoke the man was the left flanker of the front rank a small man and he had bitten off his cartridge and was pouring the powder down the muzzle of his musket sharpe watched the bullet go in and the ramrod come up ready to plunge down into the barrel halt he called halt the sergeant echoed present the muskets came up into the mens shoulders sharpe reckoned he had about sixty men in the two ranks fewer than the enemys three ranks but enough more men were running up from the ladder all the time aim low he said fire the volley slammed into the cobras who were still loading sharpes men began to reload themselves working fast nervous of the enemys next volley sharpe watched the enemy bring their muskets up his men were half hidden by their own musket smoke drop he shouted he had not known he was going to give the order until he heard himself shout it but it suddenly seemed the sensible thing to do flat on the ground he shouted quick he dropped himself though only to one knee and a heartbeat later the enemy fired and their volley whistled over the prostrate company sharpe had slowed his mens loading process but he had kept them alive and now it was time to go for the kill load he shouted and his men climbed to their feet this time sharpe did not watch the enemy for he did not want to be affected by their timing he hefted the claymore comforted by the blades heaviness prepare to charge he shouted his men were pushing their ramrods back into their musket hoops and now they pulled out their bayonets and twisted them onto blackened muzzles eli lockharts cavalrymen some of whom only had pistols drew their sabres present sharpe called and the muskets went up into the shoulders again now he did look at the enemy and saw that most of them were still ramming fire the muskets flamed and the scraps of wadding spat out after the bullets to flicker their small flames in the grass charge sharpe shouted and he led the way from the right flank the claymore in his hand charge he shouted again and his small company sensing that they had only seconds before the enemys muskets were loaded ran with him then a blast of musketry sounded to sharpes right and he saw that the scottish captain had formed a score of men on the flank and had poured in a volley that struck the cobras just before sharpes charge closed the gap kill them sharpe raged fear was whipping inside him the fear that he had mistimed this charge and that the enemy would have a volley ready just yards before the redcoats struck home but he was committed now and he ran as hard as he could to break into the whitecoated ranks before the volley came the havildar commanding the cobra company had been appalled to see the redcoats charging he should have fired but instead he ordered his men to fix their own bayonets and so the enemy was still twisting the blades onto their muskets when the leading redcoats burst through the smoke sharpe hacked his heavy sword at the front rank felt it bite and slide against bone twisted it free lunged kicked at a man and suddenly eli lockhart was beside him his sabre slashing down and two highlanders were stabbing with bayonets sharpe hacked with the sword twohanded fighting in a red rage that had come from the nervousness that had assailed him during the charge a sepoy trapped the cobras havildar feinted with the bayonet parried the tulwars counterlunge then stabbed the enemy in the belly the white coats were running now fleeing back towards the smoke that boiled up from the gatehouse which lay beyond the bulge of the hill tom garrard his bayonet bloodied to the hilt kicked at a wounded man who was trying to aim his musket other men stooped to search the dead and dying the scottish captain came in from the flank he had the winged epaulettes of a light company i didnt know the th were up here he greeted sharpe or is it the rd he peered at sharpes coat and sharpe saw that clares newly sewn facings had been torn in the climb revealing the old red material beneath im a lost sheep sir sharpe said a very welcome lost sheep the captain said holding out his hand archibald campbell scotch brigade brought my company up here just in case they got bored richard sharpe th sharpe said shaking campbells hand and bloody glad to see you sir sharpe suddenly wanted to laugh his force which had pierced the inner forts de fences was a ragged mix of indians and british cavalrymen and infantry there were kilted highlanders from the th some of campbells men from the th maybe half of the rds light company and a good number of sepoys campbell had climbed one of the low timber platforms that had let the defenders peer over the fire step and from its vantage point he stared at the gatehouse which lay a quartermile eastwards are you thinking what im thinking mister sharpe he asked im thinking we should take the gatehouse sharpe said and open the gates me too he shifted to make room for sharpe on the small platform theyll no doubt be trying to evict us soon eh wed best make haste sharpe stared at the gatehouse where a great smear of smoke showed above the ramparts that were thick with whitecoated cobras a shallow flight of stone stairs led from inside the fortress to the fire step and the gates could not be opened until that fire step was cleared of the enemy if i take the fire step he suggested to campbell you can open the gates that seems a fair division of labour campbell said jumping down from the platform he had lost his hat and a shock of curly black hair hung over his narrow face he grinned at sharpe ill take my company and you can have the rest eh campbell strode up the hill shouting for his own light company to form in a column of three ranks sharpe followed campbell off the platform and summoned the remaining men into line captain campbells going to open the gates from the inside he told them and were going to make it possible by clearing the parapets of the bastards its a fair distance to the gate but weve got to get there fast and when we get there the first thing we do is fire a volley up at the fire step clean some of the buggers off before we go up there load your muskets now sergeant green green redfaced from the effort of climbing up the ravine and running to join sharpe stepped forward im here sir and sir number off twenty men green sharpe ordered the panting sergeant youll stay down below and provide covering fire while we climb the steps understand twenty men sir yes sir i will sir only its mister morris sir green sounded embarrassed what about him sharpe asked hes recovered sir his tummy sir it got better green managed to keep a straight face as he delivered that news and he said no one else was to climb the cliff sir and he sent me to fetch the men what had climbed it back down again thats why im here sir no youre not sharpe said youre here to number off twenty men wholl give the rest of us covering fire green hesitated looked at sharpes face then nodded right you are sir twenty men covering fire thank you sergeant sharpe said so morris was conscious again and probably already making trouble but sharpe could not worry about that he looked at his men they numbered seventy or eighty now and still more scotsmen and sepoys were coming up the cliff and crossing the wall he waited until they all had loaded muskets and their ramrods were back in their hoops just follow me lads and when we get there kill the bastards now he turned and faced east come on at the double campbell called to his company forward the fox was in the henhouse feathers would fly chapter the th climbing the road that led from the plain to gawilghurs southern gate could hear the distant musketry sounding like a burning thorn grove it crackled flared up to a crescendo then faded again at times it seemed as though it would die altogether and then just as sweating men decided the battle must be over it rattled loud and furious once more there was nothing the th could do to help they were still three hundred feet beneath the fortress and from now on they would be within killing range of the guns mounted on gawilghurs southfacing ramparts those guns had been firing at the th for over an hour now but the range had been long and the downward angle steep so that not a ball had struck home if the th had had their own artillery they could have fired back but the slope was too steep for any gun to fire effectively the gunners would have had to site their cannon on a steep upwards ramp and every shot would have threatened to turn the guns over the th could go no farther not without taking needless casualties and so wellesley halted them if the defenders on the southern wall looked few he might contemplate an escalade but the sepoys carrying the ladders had fallen far behind the leading troops so no such attack could be contemplated yet nor did the general truly expect to try such an assault for the ths task had always been to keep some of the forts defenders pinned to their southern walls while the real attack came from the north that purpose at least was being accomplished for the walls facing the steep southern slope looked thick with defenders sir arthur wellesley dismounted from his horse and climbed to a vantage point from which he could stare at the fortress colonel wallace and a handful of aides followed and the officers settled by some rocks from where they tried to work out what the noise of the battle meant no guns wellesley said after cocking his head to the distant sound no guns sir an aide asked theres no sound of cannon fire colonel wallace explained which surely means the outer fort is taken but not the inner the aide asked sir arthur did not even bother to reply of course the inner fort was not taken otherwise the sound of fighting would have died away altogether and fugitives would be streaming from the southern gate towards the muskets of the th and somehow despite his misgivings wellesley had dared to hope that kennys assault would wash over both sets of ramparts and that by the time the th reached the roads summit the great southern gate would already have been opened by triumphant redcoats instead a green and gold flag hung from the gate tower which bristled with the muskets of its defenders wellesley now wished that he had ridden to the plateau and followed kennys men through the breaches what the hell was happening he had no way of reaching the plateau except to ride all the way down to the plain and then back up the newly cut road a distance of over twenty miles he could only wait and hope youll advance your skirmishers colonel he suggested to wallace the ths skirmishers could not hope to achieve much but at least their presence would confirm the threat to the southern walls and so pin those defenders down but spread them out wellesley advised spread them well out by scattering the light company across the hot hillside he would protect them from cannon fire beyond the southern ramparts far beyond a pillar of smoke smeared the sky grey the sound of firing rose and fell muted by the hot air that shimmered over the forts black walls wellesley fidgeted and hoped to god his gamble would pay off and that his redcoats god alone knew how had found a way into the fort that had never before fallen give them fire major stokes roared at the men on the ravines northern side give them fire other officers took up the call and the men who had been watching the fight across the ravine loaded their fire locks and began peppering the gatehouse with musket balls stokes had climbed back up the northern side of the ravine so that he could see across the farther wall and he now watched as the two small groups of redcoats advanced raggedly over the hillside a column was farthest away while the nearer men were in a line and both advanced on the strongly garrisoned gatehouse which had just repelled yet another british attack through the broken gate those defenders would now turn their muskets on the new attackers and so stokes roared at men to fire across the ravine the range was terribly long but any distraction would help the gunners who had smashed down the gate fired at the parapets their shots chipping at stone go man go stokes urged sharpe go captain morris his mouth swollen and bleeding and with a bruise blackening one eye and another disfiguring his forehead staggered up the hillside major stokes he called petulantly major stokes stokes turned to him his first reaction was that morris must have been wounded trying to cross the wall and he decided he must have misjudged the man who was not after all such a coward you need a surgeon captain that bloody man sharpe he hit me hit me stole my company i want charges levelled hit you stokes asked bemused stole my company morris said in outrage i ordered him to go away and he hit me im telling you sir because youre a senior officer you can talk to some of my men sir and hear their story some of them witnessed the assault and i shall look for your support sir in the proceedings stokes wanted to laugh so that was how sharpe had found the men i think youd better forget bringing charges against mister sharpe the engineer said forget bringing charges morris exclaimed i will not ill break the bastard i doubt it stokes said he hit me morris protested he assaulted me nonsense stokes said brusquely you fell over i saw you do it tripped and tumbled and thats precisely what ill allege at any court martial not that therell be a court martial you simply fell over man and now youre suffering from delusions maybe its a touch of the sun captain you should be careful otherwise youll end up like poor harness we shall ship you home and youll end your days in bedlam with chains round your ankles sir i protest morris said you protest too much captain stokes said you tripped and thats what i shall testify if youre foolish enough to bring charges even my boy saw you trip aint that so ahmed stokes turned to get ahmeds agreement but he had vanished oh god stokes said and started down the hill to find the boy but sensed he was already too late the first hundred paces of sharpes advance were easy enough for the sunbaked ground was open and his men were still out of sight of the gatehouse the few defenders who had manned the wall above the ravine had fled but as soon as the redcoats breasted the slope of the hill to see the gatehouse ahead the enemy musketry began keep running sharpe shouted though it was hardly a run they staggered and stumbled their scabbards and haversacks banging and flapping and the sun burned down relentlessly and the dry ground spurted puffs of dust as enemy musket balls flicked home sharpe was dimly aware of a cacophony of musketry from his left the fire of the thousands of redcoats on the other side of the ravine but the gatehouse defenders were sheltered by the outer parapet a group of those defenders was manhandling a cannon round to face the new attack just keep going sharpe called the breath rasping in his throat christ but he was thirsty thirsty hungry and excited the gatehouse was fogged by smoke as its defenders fired their muskets at the unexpected attack that was coming out of the west off to his right sharpe could see more defenders but they were not firing indeed they were not even formed in ranks instead they bunched beside a low wall that seemed to edge some gardens and supinely watched the confrontation a building reared up beyond that half obscured by trees the place was huge hilltop after hilltop lay within the vast ring of gawilghurs inner fort and there had to be a thousand places for the enemy to assemble a force to attack sharpes open right flank but he dared not worry about that possibility all that mattered now was to reach the gatehouse and kill its defenders and so let a torrent of redcoats through the entrance the cannon fired from the gatehouse the ball struck the dry ground fifty yards ahead of sharpe and bounced clean over his head the smoke of the gun spread in front of the parapet spoiling the aim of the defenders and sharpe blessed the gunners and prayed that the smoke would linger he had a stitch in his side and his ribs still hurt like hell from the kicking that hakeswill had given him but he knew they had surprised this enemy and an enemy surprised was already half beaten the smoke thinned and the muskets flamed from the wall again making more smoke sharpe turned to shout at his men come on hurry he was crossing a stretch of ground where some of the garrison had made pathetic little lodges of thin branches propped against half dead trees and covered with sacking ash showed where fires had burned it was a dumping ground there was a rusting iron cannon carriage a stone trough that had split in two and the remains of an ancient windlass made of wood that had been sunwhitened to the colour of bone a small brown snake twisted away from him a woman thin as the snake and clutching a baby fled from one of the shelters a cat hissed at him from another sharpe dodged between the small trees kicking up dust breathing dust a musket ball flicked up a puff of fire ash another clanged off the rusting gun carriage he blinked through the sweat that stung his eyes to see that the gate passages inner wall was lined with whitecoated soldiers the wall was a good hundred paces long and its fire step was reached by climbing the flight of stone steps that led up beside the innermost gate campbell and his men were running towards that gate and sharpe was now alongside them he would have to fight his way up the stairs and he knew that it would be impossible that there were too many defenders and he flinched as the cannon fired again only this time it belched a barrelful of canister that threw up a storm of dust devils all about sharpes leading men stop he shouted stop form line he was close to the wall damned close not more than forty paces present he shouted and his men raised their muskets to aim at the top of the wall smoke still hid half the rampart though the other half was clear and the defenders were firing fast a scotsman staggered backwards and a sepoy folded over silently and clutched his bleeding belly a small dog yapped at the soldiers the smoke was clearing from the mouth of the cannon youve got one volley sharpe called then we charge sergeant green i dont want your men to fire now wait till we reach the top of the steps then give us covering fire sharpe wanted to lash out with his boot at the damned dog but he forced himself to show calm as he paced down the front of the line aim well boys aim well i want that wall cleared he stepped into a space between two files fire the single volley flamed towards the top of the wall and sharpe immediately ran at the steps without waiting to see the effect of the fire campbell was already at the innermost gate lifting its heavy bar he had a dozen men ready to enter the passageway while the rest of his company faced back into the forts interior to fight off any of the garrison who might come down from the buildings on the hill sharpe took the steps two at a time this is bloody madness he thought suicide in a hot place should have stayed in the ravine the sun beat off the stones so that it was like being in an oven there were men with him though he could not see who they were for he was only aware of the top of the stairs and of the men in white who were turning to face him with bayonets and then greens first volley slammed into them and one of the men spun sideways spurting a spray of blood from his scalp and the others instinctively twitched away from the volley and sharpe was there the claymore slashing in a haymakers sweep that bounced off the wounded mans skull to drive a second man over the walls unprotected edge and into the passageway where the innermost gate was opening scraping on the stone and squealing on its huge hinges as campbells men heaved on the vast doors a bayonet lunged at sharpe catching his coat and he hammered the hilt of the claymore down onto the mans head then brought up his knee lockhart was beside him fighting with a coldblooded ferocity his sabre spattering drops of blood with every cut or lunge over there lockhart shouted to his men and a halfdozen of the cavalrymen ran across the top of the archway to challenge the defenders on the outer walkway tom garrard came up on sharpes right and plunged his bayonet forward in short disciplined strokes more men ran up the stairs and pushed at those in front so that sharpe lockhart and garrard were shoved forward against the enemy who had no space to use their bayonets the press of men also protected sharpe from the enemys muskets he beat down with the heavy sword using his height to dominate the indians who were keening a highpitched war cry a bayonet hit sharpe plumb on his hip bone and he felt the steel grind on bone and he slammed the claymores hilt down onto the mans head to crumple his shako then down again to beat the man to the ground the bayonet fell away and sharpe climbed over the stunned man to slash at another defender a musket banged close by him and he felt the scorch of the barrel flame on his burnt cheek the press of men was thick too thick to make progress even though he beat at them with the sword which he cut downwards with both hands throw them over the bloody side lockhart shouted and the tall cavalryman slashed his sabre just missing sharpe but the hissing blade drove the enemy frantically back and two of them caught on the edge of the fire step screamed and fell to where they were beaten to death by the musket butts of campbells highlanders campbell himself was running to the next gate two more gates to unbar and the way would be open but the cobras were thick on the walls and dodd was screaming at them to shoot into the press of men attackers and defenders alike and so throw back the impudent handful of redcoats who had turned his rear then the attackers outside the fort who had despaired of making another charge into the smoke and bloodstinking alley where so many had died heard the fight on the ramparts and so they came back flooding into the shadow of the arch and there aiming up at the fire steps the muskets hammered more men came and the cobras were assailed from in front and from below rockets dodd shouted and some of his men lit the missiles and tossed them down into the passageway but they were nervous of the attackers coming along the top of the rampart those attackers were big men crazed with battle slashing with swords and bayonets as they snarled their way along the wall sergeant greens men fired from below picking off defenders and forcing others to duck fire across fire across captain campbell down in the passageway had seen the defenders thickening in front of the men attacking along the tops of the walls and now he cupped his hands and shouted at the men behind the front ranks of the attackers fire across he pointed showing them that they should angle their fire over the passageway to strike the defenders on the opposite wall and the men understanding him loaded their muskets it took a few seconds but at last the crossfire began and the pressure in front of sharpe gave way he swung the huge sword backhanded half severing a mans head twisted the blade thrust it into a belly twisted it again and suddenly the cobras were backing away terrified of the bloody blades the second gate was opened campbell was the first man through and now there was only one gate left his sergeant had brought a score of men into the passageway and those scotsmen began to fire up at the walls and the cobras were crumbling now because there were redcoats below them on both sides and more were hacking their way along the rampart and the defenders were pinned in a small place with nowhere to go the only steps to the gateways fire step were in redcoat hands and dodds men could either jump or surrender a piper had started playing and the mad skirl of the music drove the attackers to a new fury as they closed on the remnants of dodds cobras the redcoats were screaming a terrible war cry that was a compound of rage madness and sheer terror sharpes tattered white facings were now so soaked in blood that it looked as if he wore the redtrimmed coat of the rd again his arm was tired his hip was a great aching sore and the wall was still not clear a musket ball snatched at his sleeve another fanned his bare head and then he snarled at an enemy cut again and campbell had the last bar out of its brackets and his men were heaving on the gate and the attackers who had come from outside the fort were pulling on it while beyond the outermost arch on the slope above the ravine an officer beckoned to all the troops waiting to the north a cheer sounded and a flood of redcoats ran down into the ravine and up the track towards the inner fort they smelt loot and women the gates were open the fortress in the sky had fallen dodd was the last man on sharpes wall he knew he was beaten but he was no coward and he came forward sword in hand then recognized the bloody man opposing him sergeant sharpe he said and raised his goldhilted sword in an ironic salute he had once tried to persuade sharpe to join him in the cobras and sharpe had been tempted but fate had kept him in his red coat and brought him to this last meeting on gawilghurs ramparts im mister sharpe now you bastard sharpe said and he waved lockhart and garrard back then jumped forward cutting with the claymore but dodd parried it easily and lunged at sharpe piercing his coat and glancing the sword point off a rib dodd stepped back nicked the claymore aside and lunged again and this time the blade cut into sharpes right cheek opening it clean up to the bone beside his eye marked for life dodd said though i fear it wont be a long life mister sharpe dodd thrust again and sharpe parried desperately deflecting the blade more by luck than skill and he knew he was a dead man because dodd was too good a swordsman mccandless had warned him of this dodd might be a traitor but he was a soldier and a good one dodd saw sharpes sudden caution and smiled they made an officer out of you did they i never knew the british army had that much sense he advanced again sword low inviting an attack from sharpe but then a redcoat ran past sharpe sabre swinging and dodd stepped fast back surprised by the sudden charge although he parried it with an instinctive skill the force of the parry knocked the redcoat off balance and dodd still with a smile lunged effortlessly to skewer the redcoats throat it was ahmed and sharpe recognizing the boy roared with rage and ran at dodd who flicked the sword back blood streaming from its tip and deflected the claymores savage cut turned his blade beneath it and was about to thrust the slim blade into sharpes belly when a pistol banged and dodd was thrown hard back blood showing on his right shoulder his sword arm numbed by the pistol bullet hung low sharpe walked up to him and saw the fear in dodds eyes this is for mccandless he said and kicked the renegade in the crotch dodd gasped and bent double and this is for ahmed sharpe said and swept the claymore up so that its heavy blade ripped into dodds throat and sharpe still holding the sword doublehanded pulled it hard back and the steel sawed through sinew and muscle and gullet so that the fire step was suddenly awash with blood as the tall dodd collapsed eli lockhart the long horse pistol still smoking in his hand edged sharpe aside to make certain dodd was dead sharpe was stooped by ahmed but the boy was dying blood bubbled at his throat as he tried to breathe his eyes looked up into sharpes face but there was no recognition there his small body heaved frantically then was still he had gone to his paradise you stupid bastard sharpe said tears trickling to dilute the blood pouring from his cheek you stupid little bastard lockhart used his sabre to cut the ropes holding the flag above the gatehouse and a roar of triumph sounded from the ravine as the flag came down then lockhart helped sharpe strip ahmed of his red jacket and lacking a british flag to hoist they pulled the faded blood reddened coat up to the top of the pole gawilghur had yielded sharpe cuffed tears and blood from his face lockhart was grinning at him and sharpe forced a smile in return we did it eli we bloody did lockhart held out a hand and sharpe gripped it thank you sharpe said fervently then he let go of the cavalrymans hand and kicked dodds corpse look after that body eli its worth a fortune thats dodd thats the bastard that corpse is worth seven hundred guineas to you and clare you and me sir lockhart said the sergeant looked as ragged and bloody as sharpe his blue jacket was torn and bloodstained well share the reward he said you and me sir no sharpe said hes all yours i just wanted to see the bastard dead thats reward enough for me blood was pouring from his cheek to add to the gore on his coat he turned to garrard who was leaning against the parapet gasping for air look after the boy for me tom garrard seeing that ahmed was dead frowned in puzzlement im going to give him a proper burial sharpe explained then he turned and walked down the wall where exhausted redcoats rested among the dead and dying cobras while beneath them in the passage that campbell had opened a stream of soldiers poured unopposed into the fort where are you going garrard shouted after sharpe sharpe did not answer he just walked on he had another enemy to hunt and an even richer reward to win the defenders were hunted down and killed even when they tried to surrender they were killed for their fortress had resisted and that was the fate of garrisons that showed defiance bloodmaddened redcoats fed on arrack and rum roamed the vast stronghold with bayonets and greed both sharpened there was little enough loot but plenty of women and so the screaming began some defenders knowing gawilghurs geography slipped to those parts of the perimeter where no wall faced outwards and dangerously narrow paths led down the cliffs they streamed like ants down the rock going to oblivion some hid knowing that the rage of the attackers would soon enough be exhausted those who could not escape or find a hiding place died flies buzzed in the palace where the dead were already stinking in the heat officers wandered the rooms marvelling at their poverty they had expected to find another mansion like the tippoo sultans palace a glittering trove of gems gold ivory and silk but the rajah of berar had never been rich some discovered the cellars and they noted the great armoury but were more interested in the barrels of cash though when they saw the coins were all of copper they spat in disgust a company of sepoys found some silver plate that they cut apart with their bayonets syud sevajee had found his enemy his fathers murderer but beny singh was already dead and sevajee could do little more than spit on his corpse beneath the palace redcoats splashed in the lake slaking their thirst some had discarded their red jackets hanging them from the trees and a ragged man who had slipped unseen from the palace stole one of the coats and pulled it on before limping towards the captured gatehouse he was a white man and wore a pair of dirty trousers and a ragged shirt while a white coat and a black sash were bundled under one arm his hair was lank his skin filthy and his face twitched as he shuffled along the path no one took any notice of him for he looked like any other redcoat who had found his small scrap of loot and so obadiah hakeswill slunk northwards with a fortune in jewels concealed in his shabby clothes he reckoned he had only to get through the gate and across the outer fort and then he would run where he did not know just run he was rich now but he would still need to steal a horse there would be plenty of officers horses in the camp and maybe he would be lucky and find a dead mans horse so that the loss would not be noticed for days then he would ride southwards south to madras and in madras he could sell the jewels buy proper clothes and become a gentleman obadiah hakeswill gent then he would go home home to england be a rich gentleman there he ignored the redcoats the buggers had won and it was not fair he could have been a rajah but at least he was as rich as any rajah and so he sidled down the dusty path and the gatehouse was not very far away now an officer was ahead standing with a drawn claymore beside the snake pit and staring down into its horror and then he turned and walked towards hakeswill the officer was hatless bloodyfaced and obadiah limped off the track praying that he would not be noticed the officer went safely past and hakeswill breathed a silent prayer of thanks and swerved back to the track only a trickle of men came through the gate now and most of them were too intent on joining the plundering to care about a single man limping the other way hakeswill grinned knowing he would get away he would be a gentleman then a sword point pricked his spine and hakeswill froze ive been looking for you for days obadiah a hated voice said and hakeswill turned to look up into sharpes face but the face was half hidden by blood which was why he had not recognized the officer standing beside the snake pit i was a prisoner hakeswill whined a prisoner youre a bloody liar for the love of god help me obadiah pretended not to recognize sharpe pretended to be mad he twitched and moaned let spittle dribble from his mouth and twisted his hands in submission locked me up he said the heathen bastards locked me up aint seen daylight in days sharpe leaned forward and snatched the coat that was bundled under hakeswills arm hakeswill stiffened and sharpe smiled as he saw the flash of anger in the sergeants eyes want the coat back obadiah so fight me for it i was a prisoner hakeswill insisted no longer moaning like a mad thing sharpe shook the coat open so whys the jacket white obadiah youre a bleeding liar he felt the coats pockets felt the hard lumps and knew his jewels were safe again hakeswills eyes glinted with a terrible and frustrated rage go on obadiah sharpe said fight me i was a prisoner hakeswill said and he glanced to his right hoping he could make a run for it for though he might have lost the jewels in the coat he had others in his trousers and sharpe he now saw had a wound in the hip perhaps sharpe could not run so run now he told himself and then the flat of the claymores blade struck him hard across the scalp he yelped then went still as the sword point pricked at his throat you sold me to jama didnt you sharpe said but that was a mistake obadiah because i beat his jet tis into pulp ill do that to you now but take your clothes off first you cant do this to me hakeswill shouted hoping to attract attention his face twitched you cant do this gainst regulations it is strip obadiah sharpe said there are rules regulations says so in the scriptures the claymores point jabbed at hakes wilts throat drawing blood from the scar that had been left when they had tried to hang the young obadiah the pain quietened the sergeant and sharpe smiled i half beat captain morris to death sergeant so do you think it worries me that there are rules which say i mustnt touch you now youve got a choice you can strip naked or you can let me strip your corpse naked i dont care which it is i dont care if they bloody hang me for your murder itd be worth it so shut the hell up and get your bloody clothes off hakeswill looked for help but there was none in sight and the sword point twisted in his broken skin and he gabbled that he was undressing himself and he scrabbled at the rope belt on his trousers and tore the buttons out of his shirt dont kill me he shouted i cant be killed i cant die he pulled off the shirt tugged off his boots and pulled down his trousers now the foot cloths sharpe said hakeswill sat and unwrapped the filthy strips and so was left white and naked under the terrible sun sharpe used the swords tip to pull the clothes into a pile he would search them extract the gems then leave them on your feet now obadiah he said encouraging the naked man with the swords reddened tip i cant die sharpie hakeswill pleaded his face racked by twitches i cant you tried the tigers wouldnt eat me and the elephant wouldnt kill me you know why because i cant die ive got an angel i do my own souls angel and she looks after me he shouted the words and all the while he was being pressed backwards by the sword tip and he danced on the rocks because they were so hot and his feet were bare you cant kill me the angel looks after me its mother sharpie thats who the angel is its mother all white and shiny no sharpie no i cant die and the sword stabbed at his belly and hakeswill jumped back and jumped back again when the tip slashed at his scrawny ribs they tried to hang me but they couldnt he declared i dangled and i danced and the rope wouldnt kill me and here i am i cannot die and then he screamed because the sword had stabbed one last time and hakeswill had stepped back to avoid the lunge only this time there was no rock behind him only a void and he screamed as he fell into the shadows of the snake pit he screamed again as he hit the stone floor with a thump i cant die he shouted triumphantly and stared up at the black shape of his enemy i cant die hakeswill called again then something sinuous and shadowy flickered to his left and he had no time to worry about sharpe he screamed because the snakes were staring at him with hard flat eyes sharpie he shouted sharpie but sharpe had gone to collect the pile of rags and hakeswill was alone with the serpents wellesley heard the distant cheers but could not tell whether it was his own men who celebrated or the enemy who was making the noise the smoke cloud that had hung so thick and constant beyond the fortress faded he waited the defenders on the south wall still fought they fired their cannon at the ths skirmish line which because it was well spread out and sheltered by the rocks on the steep hillside survived the sporadic cannonade the smoke of the guns hung by the walls wellesley looked at his watch four oclock if the fort had not fallen then it would soon be too late night would come and he would have to retreat ignominiously to the plain below the intermittent crackle of muskets from the north told him that something was still happening but whether it was men looting or the sound of the defenders firing at defeated attackers he could not tell then the guns on the south wall fell silent their smoke lingered then drifted away in the hot wind wellesley waited expecting the cannon to fire again but they remained quiet maybe theyve run he said the green and gold flag still hung over the gatetower but wellesley could see no defenders there if the fortress has fallen sir wallace pointed out then why arent they running out of this gate because they know were here wellesley said and took out his telescope by mistake he had brought the new glass the one he intended to give to sharpe which had been engraved with the date of assaye and he put it to his eye and examined the southern wall the embrasures were empty the guns were still there their blackened muzzles just showing but no men i think we shall advance wallace wellesley said snapping the glass shut it could be a trap sir we shall advance wellesley said firmly the th marched with colours flying drummers beating and pipers playing a battalion of sepoys followed and the two regiments made a brave sight as they climbed the last stretch of the steep road but still the great southern gate of gawilghur was closed before them wellesley spurred ahead half expecting the defenders to spring a surprise and appear on the ramparts but instead it was a redcoat who suddenly showed there and wellesleys heart leaped with relief he could sail home to england with another victory in his pocket the redcoat on the wall slashed at the flags halyard and wellesley watched as the green and gold banner fluttered down then the redcoat turned and shouted to someone inside the fortress wellesley spurred his horse just as he and his aides came into the shadow of the gatehouse the great gates began to open hauled back by dirtylooking redcoats with stained faces and broad grins an officer stood just beyond the arch and as the general rode into sight the officer brought his sword up in salute wellesley returned the salute the officer was drenched in blood and the general hoped that was not a reflection of the armys casualties then he recognized the man mister sharpe he sounded puzzled welcome to gawilghur sir sharpe said i thought youd been captured i escaped sir managed to join the attack so i see wellesley glanced ahead the fort seethed with jubilant redcoats and he knew it would take till nightfall to restore order you should see a surgeon mister sharpe i fear youre going to carry a scar on your face he remembered the telescope but decided he would give it to sharpe later and so with a curt nod he rode on sharpe stood and watched the th march in they had not wanted him because he was not a gentleman but by god he was a soldier and he had opened the fort for them he caught urquharts eye and urquhart looked at the blood on sharpes face and at the crusting scabs on sharpes sword then looked away good afternoon urquhart sharpe said loudly urquhart spurred his horse good afternoon sergeant colquhoun sharpe said colquhoun marched doggedly on sharpe smiled he had proved whatever he had set out to prove and what was that that he was a soldier but he had always known that he was a soldier and he would stay a soldier and if that meant wearing a green jacket instead of a red then so be it but he was a soldier and he had proved it in the heat and blood of gawilghur it was the fastness in the sky the stronghold that could not fall and now it was sharpes fortress historical note i have done the th sometimes known as the scotch brigade and their light company which was led by captain campbell a great disservice for it was they and not sharpe who found the route up the side of the ravine and then across the inner forts wall at gawilghur and who then assailed the gatehouse from the inside and by opening the succession of gates allowed the rest of the attacking force into the fortress fictional heroes steal other mens thunder and i trust the scots will forgive sharpe the captain campbell whose initiative broke gawilghurs defence was not the same campbell who was one of wellesleys aides the rds light company was not at gawilghur indeed the only british infantry there were scottish regiments the same scotsmen who shocked scindias army into rout at assaye and took the brunt of the arab attack at argaum wellesleys war against the mahrattas which ended in complete victory at gawilghur was thus won by madrassi sepoys and scottish highlanders and it was an extraordinary victory the battle of assaye described in sharpes triumph was the engagement which destroyed the cohesion of the mahratta confederation scindia the most powerful of the princes was so shocked by the defeat that he sued for peace while the rajah of berars troops deserted by their allies fought on undoubtedly their best strategy would have been an immediate retreat to gawilghur but manu bappoo must have decided that he could stop the british and so decided to make his stand at argaum the battle happened much as described in this novel it began with an apparent mahratta advantage when the sepoys on the right of wellesleys line panicked but the general calmed them brought them back then launched his line to victory the scots just as they had been at assaye were his shock troops and they destroyed the arab regiment that was the best of bappoos infantry there were no cobras in bappoos army and though william dodd existed and was a renegade fugitive from the east india company army there is no record of his having served berar the survivors of argaum retreated north to gawilghur gawilghur is still a mightily impressive fortress sprawling over its vast headland high above the deccan plain it is deserted now and was never again to be used as a stronghold after the storming on december the fort was returned to the mahrattas after they made peace with the british and they never repaired the breaches which are still there and though much overgrown capable of being climbed no such breaches remain in europe and it was instructive to discover just how steep they are and how difficult to negotiate even unencumbered by a musket or sword the great iron gun which killed five of the attackers with a single shot still lies on its emplacement in the inner fort though its carriage has long decayed and the barrel is disfigured with graffiti most of the buildings in the inner fort have vanished or else are so overgrown as to be invisible there is alas no snake pit there the major gatehouses are still intact without their gates and a visitor can only marvel at the suicidal bravery of the men who climbed from the ravine to enter the twisting deathtrap of the inner forts northern gate defeat would surely have been their reward had not campbell and his light company found a way up the side of the ravine and with the help of a ladder scaled the wall and so attacked the gates from the inside by then beny singh the killadar had already poisoned his wives lovers and daughters he died like manu bappoo with his sword in his hand manu bappoo almost certainly died in the breaches and not as the novel says in the ravine though that was where most of his men died trapped between the attackers who had captured the outer fort and the ysth who were climbing the road from the plain they should have found refuge within the inner fort and bolstered its de fences but for reasons that have never been explained the inner forts gates were fast shut against the survivors of the outer forts garrison elizabeth longford in wellington the years of the sword quotes the late jac weller as saying of gawilghur three reasonably effective troops of boy scouts armed with rocks could have kept out several times their number of professional soldiers it is difficult to disagree manu bappoo and beny singh made no effort to protect the outer forts walls with a glacis which was their primary mistake but their real stronghold was the inner fort and it fell far too swiftly the supposition is that the defenders were thoroughly demoralized and the few british casualties most of them killed or wounded in the assault on the gatehouse testify to the swiftness of the victory a hundred and fifty sounds like a small butchers bill and so it is but that should not hide the horror of the fight for the inner forts gatehouse where kenny died that fight occurred in a very small space and for a brief while must have been as ghastly as say the struggle for badajozs breaches nine years later campbells escalade up the precipice saved an enormous number of lives and cut a nasty fight blessedly short indeed the victory was so quick and so cheaply gained that a recent biography of the duke of wellington accords the siege less than three lines yet to the redcoat who was sweating up the hill to the plateau and who was expected to carry his firelock and bayonet across the rocky isthmus to the breaches in the double walls it was a significant place and his victory remarkable the real significance of gawilghur lay in the future sir arthur wellesley had now witnessed the assault of the breach at seringapatam had escaladed the walls of ahmednuggur and swept over the great de fences of gawilghur in portugal and spain confronted by even greater de fences manned by determined french soldiers it is claimed that he underestimated the difficulties of siege work having been lulled into complacency by the ease of his indian victories there may be truth in that and at ciudad rodrigo badajoz burgos and san sebastian he took dreadful casualties my own suspicion is that he did not so much underestimate the ability of de fences to withstand him as overestimate the capacity of british troops to get through those de fences and astonishingly they usually lived up to his expectations and it was scotsmen who gave him those high expectations the scots who used four ladders to capture a city at ahmednuggur and one ladder to bring down the great fortress of gawilghur their bravery helped disguise the fact that sieges were terrible work so terrible that the troops regardless of their commanders wishes regarded a captured stronghold as their own property to destroy and violate as they wished this was their revenge for the horrors that the defenders had inflicted on them and there was undoubtedly a vast slaughter inside gawilghur once the victory was gained many of the defenders must have escaped down the steep cliffs but perhaps half of the seven or eight thousand died in an orgy of revenge and then the place was forgotten the mahrattas were defeated and even more of india came under british rule or influence but sir arthur wellesley was done with india it was time to sail home and look for advancement against the more dangerous and nearer enemy france it will be four years before he sails from england to portugal and to the campaign that will raise him to a dukedom sharpe will also go home to a green instead of a red jacket and he too will sail to portugal and march from there into france but he has a snare or two waiting on his path before he reaches the peninsula so sharpe will march again
