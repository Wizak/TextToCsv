explanatory note it is now twenty years since the flashman papers the memoirs of the notorious rugby school bully who became a victorian hero were found in a leicestershire saleroom of the dozen or so packets of manuscript seven have so far been published in hook form they have covered four military campaigns and five episodes of less formal and generally reluctant active service piratehunting with brooke of sarawak as military adviser to queen ranavalona of madagascar as conspirator with bismarck in the schleswigholstein affair in the african slave trade and underground railroad and on the american frontier during the gold rush this eighth volume sees him returning to military service in the taiping rebellion and pekin expedition of not the least interesting feature of flashmans recollections to students of history is the light they cast on the early years of many famous victorians who are seen through the unsparing eyes of one who while a selfconfessed coward libertine and scoundrel was nevertheless a scrupulous reporter thus we have seen him fleeing the murderous wrath of the young politician bismarck viewing congressman lincoln with wary respect teaching the infant crazy horse how to wink admiring lola montez the aspiring novelty dancer and toadying to the young queen victoria herself in china he encounters two of the great mercenary captains a future empress the founding fathers of the modern british army and navy and those strange forgotten peasants who changed the face of a great empire it may be that he provides some new historical insights while again demonstrating the lengths to which perfidy impudence immorality and poltroon ery may be stretched in the enforced pursuit of fame riches and above all survival in accordance with the wishes of mr paget morrison owner of the flashman manuscripts i have confined my editing to correcting the old soldiers spelling checking the accuracy of the narrative and inserting the usual footnotes appendices and glossary gmf old professor flashys first law of economics is that the time to beware of a pretty woman is not when youre flush of cash but when youre short of the scratch and she offers to set you right because that aint natural and god knows what shes up to i learned this when i was fourteen and one lady geraldine a highspirited hebe ten years my senior lured me out in a punt with the promise of a crown if i minded her clothes while she went bathing in all innocence i accepted and i havent seen that five bob yet because the randy baggage had to shell out all her loose change to buy the silence of the grinning waterbailiff who caught us unawares in the reeds where she was teaching me natural history after her swim i had the presence of mind even at that tender age to clap my breeches over my face and so avoid recognition as i fled but you take the point i had been misled in my youthful simplicity by a designing female who played on my natural cupidity ever since when theyve dangled rich rewards before me ive taken fright if the case of mrs phoebe carpenter was an exception well she was a clergymans wife and you dont expect doubledealing from a wideeyed simperer who sings cometojesus in the choir i dont know why i bothered with her yes i do though shaped like an indian nautchdancer under her muslin blueeyed goldenhaired and with that pouting lower lip thats as good as a beckoning finger to chaps like me she reminded me rather of my darling wife whom i hadnt seen in more than three years and was getting uncommon hungry for so reading the invitation in mrs carpenters demure smile and having ten days to loaf in hong kong before my ship sailed for home i decided to have a cast at her it was a deadandalive hole in i can tell you and how else should a weary soldier pass his time so i attended morning and evening service hollering hosannas and nodding stern approval while her drone of a husband sermonised about temptation and the snares that satan spreads and gallantly helping her to gather up the hymnbooks afterwards i dined with them traded a text or two with the reverend joined them in evening prayers squired her along the queens road she was all for it of course but what was middling rum was that he was too it aint every middleaged vicar who cares to see his young bride escorted by a dashing lancer with balaclava whiskers i put it down to natural toadeating on his part for i was the lion of the hour in those days with my new knighthood and vc and all my mutiny heroics to add to the fame i had undeservedly won in crimea and afghanistan if youve read my earlier memoirs youll know all about it and how by shirking running diving into cover and shielding my quaking carcase behind better men i had emerged after four campaigns with tremendous credit a tidy sum in loot and a chestful of tinware i was a colonel of six years seniority at big bluff handsome flash harry quite a favourite with queen and consort well spoken of by palmerston and my chiefs married to the beauteous and wealthy daughter of a peer and only i knew that my fame was all a fraud and a sham there had been a time when i was sure it couldnt last and they were bound to find me out for the poltroon and scoundrel i was but id been devilish lucky and dye know theres nothing sticks like a good name provided you know how to carry your credit with a modest grin and a glad eye once let em call you a hero and theyll never leave off worshipping which is absolute nuts when the worshipper cuts a figure like the adoring mrs carpenters after three days of my society i reckoned she was ready to melt all that was needed was a stroll in the garden after dark a few wellchosen quotations from the song of solomon and shed play like one of those abandoned old testament queens her husband was forever reviling from the pulpit as a final rehearsal i took her out to picnic at the poke fullam bungalow which was the favoured resort in hong kong at that time we found a secluded spot spread a rug disposed of the cold prawns and a bottle of hock and settled down to exchange my murmured gallantries for her sighs and coy glances i didnt intend to board her that afternoon you understand too public and she wasnt even partdrunk as it happened id have been wasting my time for the innocent mrs carpenter had been working to a fixed end just as purposefully as i and such an end when i think back on it words fail me she led up to it by talking of her husbands ambition to build a church and hall over at kowloong even in those days it was the fashionable place so he would be quite top dog among the local gospelwallopers the difficulty says she sighing was money although even that would not have been insurmountable had it not been for the impending war when sir hope grant begins his campaign you see it is certain that there will be a cessation of all china trade even with canton says she and when that happens why there will be an end to all josiahs hopes and mine and she choked hack what sounded like a little sob id been paying no heed content to stroke her hand brotherlylike while she prattled but hearing her gulp i perked up get em weeping and youre halfway to climbing all over them i feigned concern and squeezed her hand begging her to explain what grants campaign could have to do with dear josiahs churchbuilding i knew as all the world did that grant was due in hong kong shortly with a fleet and army whose purpose would be to go upcountry and force our latest treaty down the chinese emperors throat but it wasnt liable to be much of a war show the flag to the chinks kick a few yellow backsides and home again with hardly a shot fired the kind of campaign that would have suited me if id been looking for one which i wasnt i could thank god id be homeward bound before grant arrived for he knew me from india and would certainly dragoon me into service if i were silly enough to be on hand you dont pass up the chance of employing the gallant flashy and he dont pass up the chance of making himself scarce but even a little war will put an end to traffic with the chinese merchants she lamented oh it is so hard when josiah and his friends have invested so wisely to be robbed of the deserved profit that would have fulfilled his dream it is too bad and she looked at me with trembling mouth and great blue eyes gad she was like elspeth even to the imbecile parting of those crimson lips and the quivering of her top hamper feeling slightly fogged i asked what investment had dear josiah made why opium of course he was so clever laying out papas legacy in two thousand chests of the very choicest patna says this fair flower of the vicarage and it would have fetched ever so much money at canton more than enough to build our dear little church but if war comes and he cannot sell his cargo she sniffed and looked woebegone dyou mean to tell me says i astonished that josiah is smuggling poppy i know the church is game for anything as a rule and hong kong only existed for the opium trade most everyone was in it but it dont go with dogcollars and sunday schools exactly gracious no dear sir harry how could you suppose such a thing why it is not smuggling at all nowadays she was all lovely earnestness as she explained and so help me these were her very words josiah says that the fifth supplementary clause of the new treaty removes all restrictions on the trade in opium cash pulse grain saltpetre oh i forget all the things but one of them is spelter whatever that may be it sounds very horrid it is true she admitted gravely that the treaty is not yet ratified but sir hope grant will see to that and josiah says there can be no illegality in profiting by anticipation so there josiahll end up in lambeth palace or dartmoor at this rate thinks i imagine a clergyman peddling the black smoke purely out of curiosity i asked didnt he have moral qualms she twitched her tits in impatience oh josiah says that is nonconformist missionary talk and that it is wellknown the natives of china use opium as a sedative rather than as a narcotic and that it does not onetenth of the harm that strong waters cause among our poorer classes at home gin and such things then she sighed again and they quivered in dejection but it is all by the way now if he cannot sell the cargo and he could have built our church and to spare too with enough over to start a couple of brothels no doubt the way josiah did business hold on says i why cant he sell it where is it by the way at macao josiah is gone over today to see it put aboard the last crabs and scrambling dragons not two years out of the schoolroom sink me and she was talking like a taipan well there you are he can send it up pearl river to the canton factories tomorrow and sell it to the hongs oh if it were so simple but you see sir harry with all the war talk there is word that the chinese merchants have been forbidden to buy from our people and and josiah and his friends have no influence to persuade them then get dent or jardine to run it in theyll persuade anybody and get a better price than josiah could dare say and take all our profit in commission they are the greediest persons you know says this tender child besides the price is settled josiah vows to take no less than eight pounds a chest jesus i mean dear me says i two thousand chests why thats near a ton isnt it sixteen thousand quid i was no expert but you couldnt be in hong kong five minutes without knowing the going figures phew well my dear hed better get it to canton somehow before the war starts stay though cant he put it in bond until things are more settled it is prepared chandoo not raw cake says the opium queen pathetically unless it goes directly it must spoil oh is it not wretchedly unlucky those who could run it will do so only on extortionate terms those who would for a fair consideration are not people who could deal with the chinese officials and merchants josiah has a skipper a mr ward but he cannot speak chinese even and it was then with another superb sigh that she turned those great misty eyes on me in undoubted appeal and said in a little voice it would be so easy for the right person you see she looked away downcast josiah says he would pay him ten per cent lady geraldine had been rather more subtle but she hadnt been offering sixteen hundred quid handsome pocket money if you like and easier to earn than falling off a log for whatever the pekin government said the hong merchants would cut confuciuss throat to buy a ton of chandoo whoever offered it and she was right all that was needed was someone with bold front and bearing who could brush aside inconvenient officials on the run upriver stick out his jaw at any chink jackintheoffice who threatened confiscation and see that josiahs ignorant skipper found his way safe to jackass point nothing in that mind you she had a hard bark asking a british army colonel to nursemaid her shipload of puggle yet why not here was i friendly disposed officer and gentleman knew the ropes spoke the lingo and just the chap to stare down any yellow officewallahs a week till my ship sailed ample time sixteen hundred mrs carpenter swooning with gratitudehm you must remember that these thoughts ran through my mind with those innocentwanton eyes fixed on mine and that excellent bosom heaving between us and if you think she was a froward piece or that i should have smelled a battalion of rats well it was a plausible tale and not even a scent of risk with our garrison at canton the pearl was as safe as the avon and there was no stigma well not to signify it was trade not opium that would have raised an eyebrow at horse guards and sixteen hundred for a jolly sail on the river we i should be so grateful she murmured and gave me a quick slantendicular you little goose says i indulgently if you want me to do it why not say so i gave her my sad flashy smile dont you know id do anything for you and with a light laugh i kissed her masterfully munching away and i dare say we might have done the business there and then if a gaggle of brats with a governess hadnt hove in view causing us to break clean and remark on the splendid view such a perfect day for picnicking we settled the details in the tonga back to town myself making light of it and pinching her palm she all flushed confusion and breathless gratitude how could she and dear josiah ever thank me well josiah could stump up the rhino on my return and she would certainly do the rest if i could judge by the light in her eye and the way she shivered when i squeezed her knee theyre all alike you know aye i should have remembered lady geraldine i dont know who ran the first chest of opium into china but he was a great man in his way it was as though some imaginary trader had put into the forth with a cargo of glenlivet to discover that the scots had never heard of whisky there was a natural appetite as you may say and while the chinks had been puffing themselves halfwitted long before the first foreign trader put his nose into the pearl river theres no doubt that our own john company had developed their taste for the drug back in the earlies and before long they couldnt get enough of it this didnt suit the ruling manchoos for while they were as partial to a pipe as the next heathen they saw that it was ruining the commonalty and who would hew the wood and draw the water then these manchoos you see were fierce warriors who had swept in from the north centuries earlier and dealt with china much as our english forebears did with ireland they established a manchoo ruling class took all the plum posts ran the country with a sloth inefficiency and waste that would have shocked a bengali babu treated the conquered chinese like dirt and sat back in complacent luxury growing their fingernails long cultivating the more rarefied arts galloping their concubines developing a taste for putrefied food preaching pure philosophy and practising abominable cruelties exalting the trivial and neglecting the essential having another romp at the concubines and generally priding themselves on being lords of creation which since they hardly admitted the existence of the world outside china is what they were so you can see they resented white interlopers who bade fair to undermine their empire with poppy drug and did their damnedest to stop the trade but couldnt to their chagrin they discovered that their godgiven superiority their highlyrefined taste in eggshell pottery and their limitless lines of ancestors availed nothing against any dundee pirate with a pistol on his hip and a sixpounder in his bows who was determined to run his opium in which made the manchoo mandarins wild with outraged pride and more highhanded towards foreigners than ever with the result that war broke out in being chinese and useless they lost and had to cede hong kong to us and open up treaty ports to european trade and the poppyrunning went on as before only more so youd have thought that would teach em manners but not a bit of it instead of realising that foreign trade had come to stay they convinced themselves that we were only there on sufferance and they could treat our traders and emissaries as dirt evilsmelling foreign savages that we were they knew china was the centre and master of the world and that everyone else was barbarian filth lurking on their outskirts plotting mischief and needing to be brought to heel like untrained curs what admit us as equals trade freely with us receive our ambassadors at pekin it was unthinkable you have to understand this chinese pride they truly believe they have dominion over us and that our rulers are mere slaves to their emperor havent i heard a redbutton mandarin a greasy old profligate so damned cultivated that his concubines had to feed him and even carry him to the commode to do his business because hed never learned how havent i heard him lisping about the barbarian vassal victoria as for the american president a mere coolie so even after wed licked them and gained a trade foothold in the treaty ports they continued as arrogant as ever and finally overstepped the mark in boarding the british ship arrow and arresting her chink crew because one of em was believed to be a pirate the usual chinese confusion you see and before you could say snooks we had bombarded canton and the local mandarin was offering thirty dollars for british heads i believe it might have blown over if the clown cobden abetted by gladstone and disraeli hadnt worked himself into a sweat in parliament saying it was all our fault and it was a scandal the way our opiumtraffickers abused the chinese who were the most saintly folk on record while british bounce and arrogance were a byword and we were just picking a quarrel more shame to us this had palmerston spitting his false teeth all over the shop he damned cobden and the chinks for rascals both said our honour had been flouted and anyway we had only bombarded canton with the utmost forbearance and was cobden aware that the manchoos had beheaded folk at canton in the past year and were guilty of vices that were a disgrace to human nature hey fine parliamentary stuff you see and when pam lost the vote and had to go to the country he won a thumping majority and the chinese war was on with a vengeance it was a scrappy business but after we took canton the chinks had to climb down and agree to a new treaty admitting us to inland trade with ambassadors at pekin but being still as arrogant as ever they dragged their heels about signing and when we sent a fleet up the peiho to persuade em damned if they didnt have a sudden burst of martial valour and handed us a splendid licking at the taku forts so now in the spring of with an uneasy truce between britain and china hope grant was coming with an army of british and frogs to convoy our ambassador to pekin and make the emperor sign you must bear with my historical lecture for i have to show you how things stood if you are to understand my tale for all the official coolness between pekin and ourselves commerce was still going on between our traders and canton but the carpenters were right to wonder how long it might continue with our invasion imminent which brings me back to the point where i agreed to escort their cargo of poppy up the pearl with the prospect of a jolly river cruise sixteen hundred sovs and a fine frolic with dear phoebe when i got back to hong kong mind you as i leaned on the rail of the lead lorcha bearing up beyond lintin island two days after our picnic with the rising sun rolling the fogbanks up the great estuary i could honestly say it wasnt either the cash or the lady that had made me turn opiumrunner no it was the fun of the thing the lure of sportwithoutdanger the seeking for fresh sights and amusements like this magnificent pearl river with that wondrous silver mist that i suppose gave it its name and its fairy islets beyond the tigers gate and the dawn breeze rippling the shining water and filling the sails of the stubby junks and lorchas and crazy fishercraft and the pugnosed grinning hong kong boat girl rolling her poonts on the thwart of a sampan and shouting hiya capn hiya you wanchee jiggee no wanchee jiggee you payee two hunner cash drinkee samshu jolleejollee who you dragon empress says i come aboard one hunner cash maybe allsame samshu theyre the jolliest wenches the hong kong boaters plump little sluts who swim like fish and couple like stoats she squealed with laughter and plunged in reached the lorcha in a few fast strokes and was hauled inboard all wet and shiny and giggling in her little loincloth anything less like an angel of providence you never saw but thats what she was if id guessed id ha treated her with more respect than i did slapping her rump and sending her aft for later for the moment i was content to muse at the rail enjoying the warm sunshine and the distant green prospect of lintin where the coolies could be seen languidly pursuing the only two occupations known to the chinese peasant to wit standing stockstill up to the knees in paddywater holding a bullock on a rope or shifting mud very slowly from one point to another deny them these employments and they would simply lie down and die which a good many of them seemed to do anyway im told that napoleon once said that china was a sleeping giant and when she awoke the world would be sorry he didnt say who was going to get the bastards out of bed i put this to ward the skipper commanding the two lorchas which made up our little convoy he was a brisk wiry brighteyed little yankee about ten years my junior and though he hadnt been in china more than a month or two you couldnt have wished for a smarter hand at the helm of a lorcha or a sharper tongue when it came to keeping the chinese boatmen up to the mark he was a young terrier and had learned his trade on american merchantmen with a mates ticket damnyoureyes which was fair going at his age for all that he had an odd soft streak when one of the chinks was knocked overside by a swinging boom and we lost way fishing him out i looked to see ward lay into him with a ropes end for his clumsiness or hang him from the rail to dry but he just laughed and cuffed the chinks head with a stream of pigeon and says lo me i fell overboard on my first voyage and what dye think i was doing chasing a butterfly so help me i was say i was a iot greener than that chink though cmon ye blushing chinese cherubs tailee on makee pull pullee i say tell ye what colonel it takes an awful lot o these beggars to do one mans work that was when i observed that the chinese were the idlest rascals in creation and he frowned and chuckled all together i reckon says he but they could be a fine people for all hat give em some one to lead em to drive em to show em how they got the prime country in creation here when they find out how to use it say and theyre smart you know they were civilised while we were still running around with paint on why they had paper an gunpowder centuries before we did which they use to make kites and fireworks says i it was plain he was an old china hand in the making and after a few weeks acquaintance too as for their civilisation its getting rottener and more corrupt and decadent by the minute look at their ramshackle government look at the taipings if you like cries he thats the new china mark my words theyll stand this whole country on its head fore theyre through see if they dont he took a big breath smoothing his long black hair with both hands in an odd nervous gesture his eyes were shining with excitement the new china boy im going to get me a section of that though know what colonel after this trip i might just take myself a long slant up the yangtse and join up with em taiping tiengkwow eh the kingdom of heavenly peace but cant they fight some i guess so and you may be sure theyre on the lookout for mercenaries why a goahead white man could go right to the top among em maybe make prince even with a button on his hat he laughed and slapped his fist full of ginger youre crazy says i but since they are too youll fit right in i dare say fred t ward fits in anywhere mister cries he and then he was away along the deck again chivvying the boatmen to trim the great mainsail yelling his bastard pigeon and laughing as he tailed on to the rope not only chinastruck but a wellfledged lunatic i could see of course he wasnt alone in having a bee in his bonnet about the taipings even the european powers were keeping an anxious eye on them wondering how far they might go in case you havent heard of them i must tell you that they were another of those incredible phenomena that made china the topsyturvey mess it was like some fantastic land from gulliver where everything was upside down and out of kilter talk about moonbeams from cucumbers the taipings were even dafter than that they began back in the s when a cantonese clerk failed his examinations and fell into a trance from which he emerged proclaiming that he was christs younger brother a ploy which im thankful to say i never tried on old arnold after making a hash of my greek construes at rugby anyway this clerk decided he had a godgiven mission to overthrow the manchoos and establish the taiping the kingdom of eternal peace or heavenly harmony or what you will he went about preaching a sort of bastard christianity which hed picked up from missionary tracts and in any normal country hed either have been knocked on the head or given a university chair but this being china his crusade had caught on against all sense and reason and within a few years hed built up an enormous army devastated several provinces thrashed various imperial generals captured dozens of cities including the old capital nanking and come within an ace of pekin itself getting madder by the minute mark you but among the millions of peasants whod rallied to him and swallowed his religious moonshine there were some likely lads who plotted the campaigns fought the battles and imposed his amazing notions of worship and discipline on a sizeable slice of the population this was the famous taiping rebellion the bloodiest war ever fought on earth and it was still going great guns in countless millions had already died in it but neither the imperials nor the rebels looked like winning just yet the imps were besieging nanking but not making much of it while various taiping armies were rampaging elsewhere spreading the gospel and piling up the corpses as not infrequently happens there was some sympathy for the taipings among those europeans who mistakenly thought they were real christians and a few enthusiasts as well as rascals and bootyhunters had enlisted with them meanwhile our government and the other foreign states who had some trade interest in china were watching uneasily afraid to intervene but devilish concerned about the outcome so there you are a manchoo government with an idiot emperor who thought the world was square fighting a lethargic war against rebels led by a lunatic and preparing to resist a francobritish invasion which wasnt to be a war exactly but rather a great armed procession to escort our ambassador to pekin and persuade the chinks to keep their treaty obligations which included legalising the opium traffic at that moment personified by h flashman and his band of yellow brothers and in case you think i was incautious heading upriver at such a time take a squint at the map and be aware that all the bloodshed and beastliness was a long way from canton youd not have caught me near the place otherwise we were into the bocca tigris where the estuary narrows to a broad river among islands before i started to earn my corn out from chuenpee fort comes an imperial patrol boat with some minor official riffraff aboard hollering to us to heave to ward cocked an eye at me but i shook my head and we swept past them without so much as good day they clamoured in our wake for a while beating gongs and waving wildly but gave up when they saw wed no intention of stopping ward whod been anxiously scanning the big forts on the high bluffs overlooking the channel shook his head with relief and grinned at me is it always so easy cries he and i told him not quite wed meet more determined inquiry farther on but i would talk our way past sure enough in late afternoon when we were clearing tiger island up popped a splendid galley all gold and scarlet with dragon banners and long ribbons fluttering from her upper works her twenty oars going like clockwork as she steered to intercept us she had three or four jingals in her bows and fifty men on her deck if there was one under a little canopy on her poop there was a mandarin in full fig of buttonhat and silk robe seated in state and flying a kite with a little lad to help him with the string even the most elderly and dignified chinese delight in kites you know and no city park is complete without a score of sober old buffers pottering about like contented buddhas with their airy toys fluttering and swooping overhead this was a fine birdkite a great silver stork so lifelike you expected it to spread its wings as it hovered hundreds of feet above us to complete this idyllic scene the galley carried on its bows a huge wooden cage crammed with about twenty wretched coolies so closepacked they could hardly stir criminals being carried to their place of punishment probably their wailing carried across the water as the galley feathered her oars and an officer bawled across demanding our business ruth and naomi lorchas from hong kong carrying opium to the factories shouts i in my best mandarin and he said he must come aboard and examine us i told ward to keep way on the lorchas and on no account to heave to if those thieving bastards once get on our deck theyll have the stoppings out of our teeth i told him but if we keep going theres nothing they can do about it suppose they fire on us says he eyeing the jingals and start another war i nodded at the union jack at our stern and hollered across the water our licence is in order your excellency and we are in great haste and must proceed to canton without delay so you can bugger off see this provoked a great screaming of instructions to heave to immediately but no one moved to the jingals so i jumped on the rail and pointed to our flag this is a british vessel and i am a close friend of pahsiaii wholl have your yellow hide if you get gay with us dye hear in fact id never met harry parkes who was our man at canton and pretty well lord and master of the place but i guessed the mention of his name might cause em to think sheer off damn you or well have half the oars out of you she was gliding in to head us off not thirty feet away and in a moment her oars would be crumpled against our hull it was a question of who gave way suddenly she veered on to a parallel course with the officer shrieking to us to heave to i made a rude gesture and he ran to the mandarin for instructions i was halfexpecting what came next there was a barked order and a dozen of the galleys crew ran forward and seized on the wooden cage in which the criminals were packed like so many herring on the order they heaved sliding the cage until it was poised on the lip of the bow platform her oars took the water again keeping her level with us and then they just looked across at us and the officer repeated his demand to us to heave to i turned away and told ward to keep her going he was gaping whitefaced the poor devils in the cage were squealing like things demented and struggling helplessly my god cries he are they going to drown them undoubtedly says i unless we heave to and allow ourselves to be boarded and plundered on some trumpedup excuse in which case theyll certainly drown em later just the same but theyre hoping we dont know that and that being softhearted foreign devils well spill our wind and come to its a special kind of chinese blackmail you see so just hold your course and pay em no heed i le gulped once but he was a cool hand he turned his back as had done and yelled to the helmsman to hold her steady there was dead silence on our deck only the creaking of the timbers and the swish of water along our side another yell to heave to from the galley silence a shrieked order an awful heartrending chorus of wails and screams and an almighty splash fine people with a prime country as you were saying says i and strolled over to the rail again the galley was still abreast but in her wake there was a great bubbling and boiling to mark where the cage was sinking to the bottom of the pearl ward came up beside me his teeth were gritted and there was great heads of sweat on his brow old china or new china says i its all the same young fred the goddam swine cries he the coldblooded yellow bastard look at him there with his goddam kite he hasnt even moved a muscle his face was working with rage goddam him goddam him to hell amen says i and watched the galley slowly falling astern before turning back towards the shore the silver storkkite hanging in the air far above her suddenly a brightlycoloured object went whirling up the string and then another gailypainted paper butterflies which were brought to a sudden halt by a twitch on the kitestring so that they fluttered in the breeze glinting and turning just below the stork would you have heaved to when they made to drown those poor beggars fred i asked he hesitated i guess says he and looked at me thats why youre aboard huh i nodded you see they darent offer us violence not after the arrow affair and theyve no real right to stop an opium boat but theyll use every trick they know to bluff you and once theyre aboard and you dont speak chinese and they outnumber you ten to one well they can sort of confiscate your cargo oh and release it later no doubt with apologies and lo and behold your chests of firstrate chandoo have been replaced hey presto by a ton of opium dross see bastards was all he said him an his goddam kite speaking of which see those butterflies somewhere up near the second bar an active little chink with a spyglass is taking note of em which means that round about the six flats well meet another deputation with a much more important mandarin on board it may be politic to present him with a couple of chests rather than risk any embarrassment hows that his voice was sharp give him some of our opium whats sixteen quid out of sixteen thousand i wondered he was silent for a moment i guess says he and then six flats is up beyond the first bar isnt it i said it was and that we ought to be there tomorrow noon and after a little more talk he said hed better take post on the second lorcha for the night as we had agreed so that both vessels were under proper control remember keep close up and dont stop for anything says i and he swore he wouldnt he didnt bother with a small boat but just dropped over the side and trod water until the second lorcha came by and he scrambled aboard a good boy that thinks i green but steady by gad i didnt know the half of him did i the boatmen were cooking their evening meal forward but id brought cold fowl and beef and after a capital meal and a bottle of moselle while the sun went down i was in splendid trim for my hong kong girl who was sitting by the sternrail singing highpitched and combing her long hair we went down to the tiny cabin and were buckled to in no time a fine fat little romp she was too taking a great pleasure in her work and giggling and squealing as we thrashed about but no great practitioner of the gentle art but you dont expect montez or lilly langtry for sixpence which was what i was paying her she was a crude healthy animal and when id played myself out with her she retired with a flask of the promised samshu and i settled down to my wellearned repose she was back at first light though crawling in beside me and grunting as she rubbed her boobies across my face which is better than an alarm clock any day i laid hold and was preparing to set about her when i realised that she was trembling violently and the pretty pug face was working with a strange ugly tic what the devils the matter says i still halfasleep and she twitched and sniffed at me wantee piecee pipe says she whimpering mass gimme piecee pipe oh lord says i get one from the boatmen cant you she wanted her opium and i could see shed be no fun until shed had it but the boatmen hadnt any or wouldnt give it apparently and she began to blubber and twitch worse than ever sobbing piecee pipe and pulling the pipe from her loincloth and shoving it at me i slapped her across the cabin and she lay there crying and shivering id have let her lie but her first awakening of me had put me in the mood for a gallop and it occurred to me that with a few puffs of black smoke inside her she might be stimulated to a more interesting performance than shed given the previous night it was only a step under the companion to where half a ton of the best chandoo was to be had josiah would never grudge a skewerful in such a good cause i was sure so i growled at her to get her lamp going and bring her pin and she came panting as i pushed through the chickscreen to the long main hold which ran the full length of the lorcha under its flush deck there were the chests and while she twitched and whined at my elbow i rummaged for a handspike and stuck it under the nearest lid she had her little lamp lit and was holding out the skewer in a trembling paw as i said before she was a most unlikelylooking guardian angel i levered the lid up with a splintering of cheap timber and pulled back the corner of the oilskin cover beneath and then as i recall i said holy god and came all over thoughtful as i contemplated the contents of the chest for if i hadnt had mrs phoebe carpenters word for it that those contents were highgrade prepared patna opium id have sworn that they were sharps carbines all neatly packed in grease too there was a time in my callow youth when the discovery that i was running not opium but guns would have had me bolting frantically for the nearest patch of timber protesting that it was nothing to do with me constable and the chap in charge would be along in a moment for opium into china was a commonplace if not entirely respectable commodity whereas firearms into anywhere are usually highly contraband and smuggling em is as often as not a capital offence but if twenty years of highly active service had taught me anything it was that there is a time to flee in blind panic and a time to stand fast and think given the leisure i daresay id have replaced that chest lid slapped the slut who was staring wildly at me and taken a turn on deck to reflect thus had mrs carpenter spun me a web of yarn and were she and dear josiah aware that their cargo consisted of the very latest repeating weapons undoubtedly josiah had supervised the loading of the chests and what he knew his wife knew too very good to whom should a godfearing british clergyman and his wife be smuggling guns in china not to any british recipient and certainly not to the manchoo imperials which left the taiping rebels utterly incredible until one reflected that there were taiping enthusiasts among our people and none warmer than those clergy who believed that the longhaired devils were devout christians fighting the good fight against the imperial heathen were carpenter and his wife sufficiently demented for that presumably if youre religious you can believe anything well then if they wanted to supply sharps carbines to the taipings why not ship em up the yangtse to nanking where the taipings were in force instead of to canton where there wasnt a taiping within a hundred miles simple nanking was under siege the yangtse was a damned dangerous river and theyd have had to run the stuff through shanghai where thered have been a far greater risk of detection but dammit how could they hope to smuggle guns into canton where our garrison and gunboats were thick as fleas and the chests would have to be opened at the factories that was plainly impossible so they didnt intend the lorchas ever to reach canton no if their skipper turned eastward into the web of tributaries and creeks short of the first bar to some predetermined rendezvous a taiping muletrain waiting on a deserted riverbank offload and away upcountry why it could be done as safe as sleep and poor old flashy whom theyd needed to keep meddling and acquisitive chinese officials at bay during the run past the forts and who had performed that service to admiration why hed be no trouble could he her majestys loyal servant go running to parkes at canton to confess that hed been instrumental in providing the taipings with enough small arms to keep em going until doomsday not half and that little snake ward must be up to the neck in it hadnt he announced himself a taipingworshipper only yesterday wait though hed also admitted that he would have hove to for the imperial galley which would have been fatal to him by gum had that been acting for my benefit yes because later when id remarked that we might have to part with a chest or two as squeeze to the mandarins hed been taken suddenly aback until hed reflected that the lorchas would never get that close to canton the lying dissimulating yankee snake that i say is how i would have reasoned given the leisure and id have been dead right too as it was no leisure was afforded me some of it went through my mind in a flash the bit about ward for instance but i hadnt had time to slam the chest cover down when i felt the lorcha swing violently off course her mainsail cracked like a cannon there was a yelling and scampering of bare feet overhead and i had flung the wench aside dived into the cabin grabbed my adams from beneath my pillow and was up the companion like a jackrabbit i emerged just in time to duck beneath the mainsail boom as it came swinging ponderously overhead with a couple of boatmen clinging on yelling bloody murder as they tried to secure it the others were at the rail pigtails flapping and chattering like monkeys staring forward by god the second lorcha was now ahead and there was ward at her helm we were close in by the east bank it must be the east for there was the sun gleaming dully through the morning mist the first rays turning the waters to gold around us but we were running south my lorcha was just completing her turn i spun round in bewilderment two of the boatmen had the filler jammed over as far as it would go and a furlong behind us its oars going like the cambridge crew as it raced down towards us was a dandy little launch rowed by fellows in white shirts and straw hats with a little chap in the sternsheets egging them on and half a mile beyond that emerging from a creek on the east bank was an undoubted navy sloop she was flying the union jack there are times as i said to run and times to think and by god i couldnt do either i know now that ward a stranger to the pearl and with only a clown of a boatman as pilot had missed his turning in the dark and run slap into one of our canton patrollers but in that moment i was aware only that the bluejackets were upon us and poor old flash was sitting on top of the damnedest load of contraband you ever saw i acted on blind instinct thank heaven the launch was closing in and there was only one thing for it ward you toad i bellowed take that and springing on to the rail to get a clear shot at him i let blaze with the adams he sprang away from the tiller of the other lorcha and i loosed off another shot which struck splinters from his rail his boat yawed crazily and in the crisis he behaved with admirable presence of mind he was over her rail like a porpoise taking the water clean and striking out like billyho for the bank not a hundred yards off i jumped down roaring and was about to send another ball after him when one of my helmsmen whipped out his kampilan and came at me screaming like a banshee i shot him pointblank and the force of it flung him back against the rail clutching his guts and pouring blood before his fellows could move i had my back to the rail flourishing the adams and bawling to them to stand off or id blow em to blazes for an instant they hesitated hands on hilts the ugly yellow faces contorted with rage and fear i banged a shot over their heads and the whole halfdozen scampered across beside their wounded mate behind me i heard a young voice shrill with excitement yelling in oars follow me the launch was bumping against our side and here was a young snotty waving a cutlass as big as himself and half a dozen tars at his heels jumping on to our deck come along you fellows cries i heartily youre just in time careful now these are desperate villains and i gave a final flourish of the adams at the boatmen who were crouched half naked and looking as piratical as sin beside their leaking comrade before turning to greet the gaping midshipman flashman colonel army intelligence says i briskly and held out my hand he took it in bewilderment goggling at me and at the boatmen just have your lads watch out for those rascals will you theyre gunrunners you know my stars says he and then gave a little start flashman did you say sir he was a sturdy snubnosed young halfpint with a bulldog chin and he was staring at me with disbelief not i mean colonel flashman well i dont suppose there was a soul in england not in the services leastways who hadnt heard of the gallant flashy and no doubt he was recognising me from the illustrations hed seen in the press i grinned at him thats right youngster here youd best put some of your fellows aboard that other lorcha why blast it the brutes getting clear away and i pointed over the rail to the near shore where the figure of ward was floundering ashore in the shallows even as we watched he disappeared into the tall reeds and i sighed with inward relief that was the star witness safely out of the way i damned him and turned away laughing ruefully and the snotty came out of his trance like a good un jenkins smith cover those fellows bland take the launch to that other lorcha and make her safe the other lorcha i was pleased to see was floundering about with her crew at sixes and sevens as his tars jumped to it the snotty turned back to me i dont understand sir gunrunners did you say as ever was my son whats your name fisher sir says he jack fisher midshipman come along jackie says i clapping him on the shoulder like the cheery soul i was no side you see and ill show you the wickedness of the world i took him below and he gaped at the sight of the hong kong girl who was crouched shivering and baretitted but he gaped even wider when i showed him the contents of the opium chests my stars says he again what does it mean guns for the taiping rebels my boy says i grimly you arrived just in time you see another halfhour and id have had to tackle these scoundrels singlehanded your captain got my message i suppose i dunno sir says he owleyed we saw your lorchas turning tail and i was sent to investigate wed no notion so wards guilty conscience had been his undoing if hed held his course the navy would never have looked at him and if they had why he was just carrying opium and had the famous flashy to vouch for him for he wasnt to know id sniffed out his real cargo gad though if that slut hadnt begged for a pipe of chandoo id have been in a pretty fix with ward panicking the navys suspicions aroused and myself flatfooted when they came aboard and started rummaging thanks to her id had those few minutes to plot my course mr fisher says i i think its time i had a word with your skipper what perhaps youd be good enough to take me aboard you see of course what i was about it was the ploy id used on the slaveship balliol college in when the yankee navy caught us off cape san antonio and to save my skin id welcomed our captors with open arms and let on that id only been with the slavers to spy on them then id had admiralty papers to prove my false identity but here i had something infinitely better my fame and reputation for who boarding a gunrunner and finding valiant old flashy holding the miscreants at bay singlehanded would suspect that he was one of the gang heroes who have led the light brigade and braved the heathen hordes at cawnpore and kabul are above suspicion master fisher might well be fogged as to what i was doing there exactly but it never crossed his innocent young mind that i was anything but what id announced myself an army officer apprehending villainous foreign smugglers and since i was from intelligence no doubt there was some splendid mystery behind it and explanations would follow quite nor did the prospect of explaining trouble me much after all i was flashy and it was wellknown officially that id been up to my ears in secret affairs in india and central asia and here they would think was more of the same once id determined what tale to tell it was simply a matter of carrying it off with modest assurance and a pinch of mystery to make em feel confidential and cosy and theyd swallow whatever i told em nem con there wouldnt be a soul to give me the lie and some of it would be true anyway so when i was aboard the sloop and its young commander had listened to little fishers report and my own terse embellishments and whistled softly at the sight of the lorchas cargo i was perfectly prepared for the inevitable question asked with respectful bewilderment but how came you to be aboard of them sir i looked him in the eye with just a touch of tightlipped smile i think commander says i that id best report direct to mr parkes at canton least said what you received no message from him about and i nodded at the lorchas just so perhaps he was right well ill be obliged if youll carry me to him as soon as may be in the meantime i permitted myself a wry grin take good care of these chinese villains wont you ive been after em too long to want to lose em now oh and by the way that boy fisher shapes well he couldnt get me to canton fast enough we were in the whampoa channel by noon and two hours later dropped anchor off jackass point opposite the old factories then there was a delay while the lorchas and their crews were taken in charge and the commander went to make his report to his chief and to parkes i didnt mind since it gave me time to polish the tale i was going to tell and it wasnt until the following morning that i was escorted through the english garden to the office and residence of harry parkes esq hm commissioner at canton and our chief man in china from all id heard he was formidable he knew the country better than any foreigner living they said for though he wasnt thirty hed been out since childhood served through the opium wars been on cuttingout expeditions as a schoolboy done all manner of secret work and diplomatic ruffianing since and carried things with a high hand against the chinese whose language he spoke rather better than the emperor he greeted me with brisk formality stiff and upright behind his official desk not a hair out of place on the sleek dark head energy was in every line of him from the sharp prominent nose to the firm capable hands setting his papers just so he was all business at once in a clear hard voice and suddenly convincing him didnt seem quite so easy this is a singular business sir harry whats behind it not much says i hoping i was right clever and easy i dont mind im that way myself but clever and brusque unsettles me i handed him the requested and required note palmerston had given me when i went to india the usual secret passport but pretty faded now you had no message from me i did not know you were in china until yesterday he glanced up sharply from the passport this is more than three years old when i left england what ive been doing since will have to stay under the rose im afraid he gave a little barking laugh not altogether i fancy says he with what he probably imagined was a smile your knighthood and victoria cross are hardly state secrets i meant since then this past year it has nothing to do with this affair anyway thats a tale thats soon told i breathed an inward prayer meeting the steady grey eyes in that lean lawyer face im due home on the princess charlotte sailing on the eleventh in three days grant is due on the thirteenth i beg your pardon pray continue aye well two nights ago i was over in macao looking up an old chum from borneo when i was with brooke no harm in dropping in that glorious acquaintance i thought i neednt mention his name its of no importance but hes a downy bird chinese with an eye in every bush an old white lily society man you know the sort his name might be valuable says parkes and his hand went ever so casually to a vase of flowers on his desk he lifted it with three fingers round the stem and set it down again clever bastard exactly says i and ran my thumb over three fingertips just to show him well we talked shop and by way of gossip he let fall that a shipment of arms was going upriver to the taipings shihtakais people he thought which was nothing to me until he mentioned that they were british boughtandpaidfor though he didnt know who not strictly my indaba you may say but it struck me that if it got about that british arms were going to the longhaired devils it might cause us some embarrassment with pekin you know i looked for a nod but he just sat there with his fingers laced on the blotter before him id a feeling that if youd fired a gun in his ear he wouldnt have taken his eyes from mine so i thought i should have a look nothing official to be done on portuguese territory of course but my friend knew where the lorchas were preparing to weigh and there they were sure enough ostensibly loaded with opium if you please on the spur of the moment i approached the skipper that would be ward it was like a kick in the throat i couldnt help staring and had to improvise swiftly to explain my obvious astonishment ward you say he told me his name was foster the sweat was cold on my spine you knew about him and the shipment only his name my agents in hong kong and macao send notice of all opium shipments vessels owners and skippers he lifted a list from his desk lorchas ruth and naomi owned by yang fang and co shanghai commander f t ward no suggestion of course that he carried anything but opium he laid it down and waited well on impulse i asked him for a lift to canton by gum hed shaken me for a second but if that was the extent of his knowledge i was still safe but was it this was a foxy one and on instinct i did the riskiest thing a liar can do i decided to change my story id been about to tell him id stowed away full of duty and holy zeal and come thundering out at the critical moment to prevent the rascals escaping when our sloop hove in sight suddenly i knew it wouldnt do not with this cold clam ive been lying all my life and i know when in doubt get as close to the truth as you can and hang on like grim death i asked him for a lift to canton and if you ask what was in my mind i cant tell you i knew it was my duty to stop those guns and placed as i was without authority in a foreign port that meant staying with em somehow and taking whatever chance offered you might he interrupted have informed the portuguese i might but i didnt and i doubt if you would either i gave him just a touch of the colonel there anyway he refused me mighty curt i offered passage money but he wouldnt budge which settled it for me for any honest trader would have agreed i was going off wondering what to do next when he suddenly called me back and asked did i know the river and did i speak chinese i said i did he chewed it over and then offered to take me if id act as interpreter on the voyage i had only a moment aside to tell my chinese friend to get word to you or hong kong of what was forward but youve had no word from him none sir harry and not a flicker of expression i could have brained the man theres nothing more discouraging than lying to a poker face when what you need is gasps and whistles and cries of ill be damned and what happened then to whet your prevarications aye well i cant say im surprised hell talk to a pal but hes leery of official circles blast him well we sailed and what i needed of course was a squint at the cargo but they never left me alone for a moment foster i changed the name just in time and the chinks were always on hand so i must bide my time i stayed awake the first night but no chance offered the second night im afraid i just caulked out a shrug and rueful flashy smile followed by an eager glint in the eye but then i had a splendid stroke of luck just before dawn a native girl of the crew a cook or some such thing i suppose woke me begging for a pipe of opium would you believe it there was no one about and here was a heavensent chance to open a chest with a ready explanation if i were detected so i did and there were the sharps god it sounded lame especially the true parts which i thought was damned hard i waited if the man were human he must say something he did you must have formed some plan by this time what did you hope to do alone against so many he sounded impatient and downright curious for the life of me mr parkes i wasnt sure i grinned him straight in the eye bluff honest harry tackle the crew with my revolver try to scuttle her i dont know sir by the grace of god the sloop hove in sight just then and i did tackle em and the rest you know he sat for a moment and i braced myself for the incredulous questions the outright disbelief and then he gave his sudden bark of a laugh and struck the bell at his elbow some coffee sir harry im sure you deserve it that sir says he shaking his head is the most damned unlikely tale i ever heard and what id say to it if i didnt know it for true i cannot imagine well it is unlikely youll own he chuckled again and it seemed to me an indignant frown was in order so i gave one but it was wasted since he was talking to the bearer with the coffeetray relief and bewilderment filled me hed swallowed it he knew it was true what the deuce speaking in my official capacity i have to say that your actions were entirely irregular says he handing me a cup and might have had serious results for yourself you risked your life you know and your honour he looked hard at me a senior officer found aboard an armssmuggler without authority even with your distinguished name well he stirred his own cup and then smiled and dye know i realised he was just twentynine and not the fiftyodd hed sounded between ourselves it was a damned cool bit of work and im obliged to you but for you they might have given us the slip theyd certainly have made some sort of fight of it my congratulations sir i beg your pardon more sugar well this was sunday in brighton all of a sudden wasnt it though id hoped for acceptance with or without the doubtful glances that have followed me round the world for eighty erratic years but hardly for this it didnt make sense even for it was a damned unlikely tale as hed said saving my poor veracity says i you say you know its true flashy aint just bluff and manly you see hes sharp too and i was playing my character may i know how id not deny myself the pleasure of enlightening you says he briskly we have known for some time that arms shipments provided by a syndicate of british and american sympathisers have been going up the pearl to the taipings shihtakai as your chinese friend said who these sympathisers are we dont know that was good news too since the work was entirely overseen by a most skilful chinese a former pirate who brought the arms to macao shipped them up the pearl in lorchas and passed them to the taipings where to be brief we smoked the pirate out a week ago and he met with an accident he set down his cup that forced the syndicates hand they needed a new man and they chose ward heaven knows why since he knew nothing of the pearl or of china but hes a good seaman they say and from what we know devoted to the taiping cause the idiot and at the last moment when he must have been wondering how the deuce he was going to find his way upriver without a word of chinese in his head and rendezvous with the taipings you dropped into his lap we may guess says he what your fate must have been if he had reached his destination but im sure you weighed that i gave an offhand shrug and when wed picked the shattered remnants of my cup from the floor he pinged his bell again fortunately we now had mr ward and his convoy under observation at macao and our sloops were waiting for him beyond the second bar come in cries he and the door opened to admit the prettiest little chinese girl in a flowered robe and high block shoes a manchoo by her coiled hair and unbound feet she smiled and bobbed to parkes and glanced sidelong in my direction anyatheh snaps parkes and she turned and bobbed at me i could only nod back mystified and then my heart lurched she was washed and dressed and painted up like a mandarins daughter but there was no mistaking she was the hong kong boat girl thank you anyatheh says parkes and she bobbed again shot me another slantendicular look and pittipittied out anyatheh says parkes drily is a most capable and i fear most immoral young woman she is also the best spy on the pearl river for the past week she has been keeping close watch on frederick townsend ward she saw his lorchas sail from macao and followed in a sampan manned by other of our agents she would have contrived to get aboard the lorchas he went on impassively even if you had not been there for it was her task to see where the cargo was landed in the event that ward had eluded our patrols she was surprised to learn from eavesdropping on the crew that you were apparently unaware of the true nature of the cargo for of course the smugglers were not to know that you already had their secret and spoke of you as a dupe to be disposed of when you had served your purpose she was pleased she tells me to discover that you were not one of the smugglers in some ways she is a naive affectionate girl and seems to have formed an attachment to you whether this was accompanied by a leer a frown or nothing at all i cant say knowing parkes probably the last i was in too much mental turmoil to notice by god the luck for it fitted my tale to parkes corroborated exactly what she must have told him of the voyage but if id given him the stowaway yarn it didnt bear thinking about i put it by and listened to the brisk impersonal voice she is as i said a resourceful young woman when the sloop was sighted she determined to draw your attention to the cargo in the hope that when you saw how you had been deceived you might cause some disturbance and hinder their escape as indeed you did having no english but pigeon and doubting her ability to make you understand cantonese she hit on the novel plan of persuading you to open a chest by pleading with you for opium i sat quiet for a moment and if you want to know what i was thinking it wasnt what an almighty narrow shave id had or of prayers of thanksgiving or anything of that sort no i was asking myself when if ever id been so confoundedly fooled by two different women in the space of four days mrs phoebe carpenter and anyatheh bless em white or yellow they were a hazardous breed in china that was plain parkes with the satisfied air of a rooster who has done crowing was regarding me expectantly well shes a brave girl says i smart too and you sir are to be congratulated on the efficiency of your secret service oh we get about says he im sorry that rascal foster ward did you say got clear away i scowled flashylike ive a score to settle with that one not in china sir harry if you please he was all commissioner again he served you a scurvy trick no doubt but the less that is heard of this business the better i shall require your word on that and he gave me his stiffcollar look it has all been quite unofficial you see no british law has been broken the gunrunning offence took place within the imperial chinese governments jurisdiction we had no legal right to detain or hinder ward and his fellows but he gave another of his sour smiles we do have the gunboats and since her majestys government is strictly neutral as between the imperials and the taipings it is certainly not in our interest that british citizens should be arming the rebels a thought which prompted your own action you remember no he squared off his pencils in columns of threes we must consider the incident happily and in your case fortunately concluded that of course was the main thing i was clear by the grace of god and dear little anyatheh there would be no inconvenient inquiries which might have led back to the conniving mrs carpenter who it occurred to me might well be blackmailed to bed before i sailed for home as for ward id not have gone near the dangerous brute i gave parkes my word with feigned reluctance he may not be such a rascal you know parkes frowned as though it irritated him to admit it he has courage and his devotion to the rebel cause if misguided may well be sincere there are times when i would be glad to be rid of the manchoos myself but that is not our concern he sniffed for the moment not my concern at any time old lad thinks i now that i was apparently out from under i was in a fret to get away from this omniscient satrap while the going was good so i shuffled and began to thank him bluff and manly and hope that i hadnt been too great a nuisance eh to him and his gang of busybodies when he stopped me with a knowing look and pulled a portent of doom from his desk there is another matter sir harry one which i fancy you will consider an amend for your recent adventure eyeing that packet i suddenly doubted it you recall that i said i was unaware of your presence in china until yesterday listen if you please he took a sheet from the packet yes here we are it is thought that colonel flashman may be en route through china in that event you are to require him to proceed forthwith to shanghai and there place himself at the disposal of hm minister and superintendent of trade id known that packet was damned bad news as soon as i saw it what the hell did they want me for and on the eve of my sailing for home too whatever it was by god they werent coming between me and my wellearned idleness id send in my papers first id parkes was speaking with that sharp smug smile on his infernal face i was at a loss to know how to comply when the sloop brought you here so unexpectedly opportune indeed we should thank mr ward for had you remained in hong kong it is odds that you would have sailed for england before i had time to inquire for you there our chinese despatches can be infernally slow in other words if that bitch carpenter hadnt hocussed me up the pearl with her lies id have been safe and away and now the army had me again well wed see about that but for the moment i must choke back my fury until i knew what was what how extraordinary says i well what a fortunate chance what can it mean why they want you for the pekin business to be sure cries the bloody knowall the despatch is confidential of course but i think i may be forgiven if i tell you that lord elgin whose embassy to china will be made public shortly has asked that you be attached to the intelligence staff i think too and he was positively jocular rot his boots that we may see the hand of lord palmerston here my dear sir harry allow me to congratulate you at the beginning of this memoir i gave you my first law of economics if i have one for adversity it is that once your essentials are properly trapped in the mangle theres nothing for it but to holler with a good grace and wait until they roll you out again not that hollering does any good but it relieves the feelings and mine were in sore need of release after my interview with parkes i vented them in a twoday spree in canton taking out my evil temper on tarts and underlings and sleeping off the effects on the mailboat down to hong kong for there was nothing to be done you see after three years of truly dreadful service in which id been halfkilled starved hunted stretched on a rack almost eaten by crocodiles assaulted with shot and sabre partstrangled by thugs and damned near blown from a cannon id been on the very point of escaping to all that made life worth living elspeth with her superb charms and splendid fortune ease comfort admiration and debauchery and through my own folly id thrown it away it was too bad i aint a religious man but if i had been i swear id have turned atheist but there it was so i must take stock and consider there was no question of sending in my papers and going home although it had passed through my mind my future content rested too much on the enjoyment of my heroic reputation which would have been dimmed just a trifle if id been seen to be shirking my duty a lesser man could have done it and naught said but not sir harry flashman vc kb people would have talked the queen would have been astonished palmerston would have damned my eyes and done me dirt too and when all was said it wasnt liable to be much of a campaign two or three months perhaps in which id be well clear of any danger that was going boozing on the staff frowning at maps looking tired and interesting and moving paper about with my hair becomingly ruffled oh i knew my intelligence work never fear so i rolled down to hong kong savouring the revenge i would take on la belle phoebe and what dyou think she and the gunrunning josiah had cleared out to singapore ostensibly to join some missionary society at short notice a likely tale give em three months and theyd be running the tongs but their sudden departure was hardly noticed in a new sensation sir hope grant had arrived with the advance guard of the fleet and army which was to go upcountry defend old englands rights and honour and teach the chinks to sing rule britannia from pittans wharf you could see the little white lines of tents where the camp was being laid out on kowloong so i decided to tool over and let them see how dam lucky they were going to be in their intelligence department there were advance parties from all the regiments the first thing i saw was sikh riders in the red puggarees of fanes horse and the blue of probyns tentpegging on the beach with white troopers cheering em on and to my astonishment they were dragoon guards god help you if it rains my lads thinks i for with twentyone stone in each saddle youll be up to your bellies in the paddymud in no time it was firstrate mixed cavalry for all that i watched a bearded greycoated sowar eyes glaring whip out a peg and wheel away to yells and cheering and was glad i wasnt a manchoo tartar it was the infantry coats i wanted to see though for i know what matters when the guns havent come up and your cavalrys checked by close country or tuttiputti and youre waiting in the hot dusty hush for the faint rumble of impi or harka over the skyline and know theyre twenty to your one well thats when you realise that it all hangs on that double line of yokels and town scruff with their fifty rounds a man and an enfield bayonet kitchener himself may have placed em just so with disraelis sanction the times blessing and the queen waving em goodbye but now its their grip on the stock and their eye at the backsight and if they break youre done havent i stood shivering behind em often enough wishing i could steal a horse from somewhere aye and if im still here its because they seldom broke in my time so it was with some satisfaction that i noted facings and markers the old th royal americans the buffs a fatigue party of the th i felt a cold shudder at the memory of the bloody snow by gandamack the starved handful of survivors and soutar with the colours of this same th wrapped round his waist as the ghazis closed in for the kill well wed have a few ghazis on our side this time there were whiskered pathans chattering round a campkettle so i took a chapatti and a handful of chilis gave the time of day to a naik with the sobraon medal and passed on drawn by the distant pigsqueal of pipes which always makes my dear wife burst into tears ah weve our own homegrown savages in tow have we thinks i but they werent highlanders just the royals theirs wasnt the only music on kowloong neither i loafed up to the big tent with the flag whence came the most hideous droning booming din there was a staffwalloper climbing aboard his water a couple of maharatta sentries on the fly and a slim young fellow with a fair moustache sitting on a campstool sketching i came up on his blind side just for devilment and he started round angrily how often have i told you never to he was beginning and then his good eye opened wide in amazement flashman my dear fellow wherever did you spring from here and there joe says i the mad musician is within what here i say you cant go in just now you know hes composing decomposing by the sound of it says i and stuck my head in at the fly sure enough there was the lean gaunt figure in its shirtsleeves sawing away like a thing demented at a great bull fiddle glaring at a sheet of music which he was marking between scrapes and tugging at his bristling grey whiskers to stimulate the muse no doubt i flipped a coin into a glass on the table move on to the next street my good man will you says i youre disturbing the peace being a sensitive artist and a majorgeneral he should have gone up three feet and come down spluttering but this one had no nerves to begin with and more mastery of himself than a yogi he didnt so much as twitch for a second i wondered if he hadnt heard me and then he played another chord jotted it on his manuscript and spoke without turning his head flashman another chord and he put his fiddle by and turned to fix me with those wild pale eyes that i hadnt seen since allahabad when campbell pinned the cross on me very good wolseley says he to joe who was fidgeting behind me he took my hand in his bony grip nodded me to a stool and then he stood and looked at me for two solid minutes without saying a word now i tell you that in detail to show you what kind of a man was majorgeneral sir james hope grant you dont hear much of him nowadays wolseley the boy who was sketching at the door has ten times the name and fame but in my time grant was a man apart he wasnt much of a general it was notorious hed never read a line outside the bible he was so inarticulate he could barely utter any order but charge his notions of discipline were to flog anything that moved the only genius he possessed was for his bull fiddle he could barely read a map and the only spark of originality hed ever shown was to get himself six months in close tack for calling his colonel a drunkard but none of this mattered in the least because you see hope grant was the best fighting man in the world im no heroworshipper as you may have gathered and my view of the military virtues is that the best thing you can do with em is to hang them on the wall in bedlam but i know cold fact when i see it with sword lance or any kind of sidearm he was the most expert deadly practitioner that ever breathed as a leader of irregular cavalry he left stuart hodson custer and the rest at the gate in the mutiny he had simply fought the whole damned time with a continuous fury that was the talk of an army containing the likes of sam browne john nicholson and my vaunted but unworthy self worshipped by the rank and file naturally he was a kindly soul for all they called him the provostmarshal and even charming if you dont mind tenminute silences but as a handtohand bloodspiller it was eclipse first and the rest nowhere he thought i was another of the same never having seen me in action but believing what he was told and wed got on pretty well considering my natural levity and insolence he couldnt make this out at all and id been told on good authority that he thought i was insane the pot calling the kettle grimy arse if you ask me but it meant that he treated me as a wild halfwitted child and grinned at my jokes in a wary sort of way so now he asked me how i did pushed coffee and biscuits at me and without any preamble gave me his views on the forthcoming campaign this was what id come for twenty words from grant were worth twenty thousand from another i knew the rough of it twelve thousand of ourselves and five thousand french to escort elgin and the frog envoy gros to pekin in the teeth of frenzied chinese diplomatic opposition grant was fairly garrulous for him shared command montauban and i day about lamentable pause supply difficult forage all imported no horses to he had brought our own from india not the french have to buy em japan ponies vicious beasts die like flies another pause french disturb me no experience great campaigns peninsula crimea deplorable no small wars delays cross purposes better by ourselves hope montauban speaks english that would make one of you thinks i would the chinese tight i asked and a long silence fell possibly pause once believe it or not i could see he was in capital spirits in his careful way no nonsense about beating these fellows out of sight or being in pekin next week which youd have got from some of our firebrand commanders his doubts about the french and supply transport were small ones he would get elgin and gros to pekin without a shot fired if he could contrive it but god help the manchoos if they showed fight bar campbell there wasnt a general id have chosen in his place i asked him what was the worst of it delay says he chinese talk cant have it drive on dont give em time to scheme treacherous fellows i asked him the best of it too and he grinned elgin couldnt be better clever good sense goodbye flashman god bless you perhaps he said more than that but dye know i doubt it i can see him yet bolt upright on his campstool the lean muscular arms folded across his long body the grizzled whiskers like a furzebush chewing each word slowly before he let it out the light eyes straying ever and anon to his beloved bull fiddle as wolseley strolled with me down to the jetty we heard it again like a ruptured frog calling to its mate the paddyfield concerto with armstrong gun accompaniment says he grinning perhaps hell have it finished by the time we get to pekin i had learned all they could tell me and since hong kong is a splendid place to get out of i caught the packet up to shanghai to present myself to bruce as directed it was like going into another world not that shanghai was much less of a hellhole than hong kong but it was china you understand down in the colony it was england peopled by yellow faces and british law and the opium trade and all thoughts turning to the campaign shanghai was the great treaty port where the foreign devil trade missions were british french german american scowegian russian and all but it was still the emperors city where we were tolerated and detested and once you poked your nose out of the consulate gate you realised you were living on the dragons lip with his fiery eyes staring down on you and even the fog that hung over the great sprawling native city was like smoke from his spiky nostrils the model settlement was much finer than hong kong with the splendid houses of the taipans and the bund with its carriages and strollers and consulate buildings that might have come from delhi or singapore with gardens highwalled to keep out the view and then you ventured into the native town stinking and filthy and gorged with humanity with its choked alleys and dungheaps and baskets of human heads hung at streetcorners to remind you that this was a barbarous perilous land of abominable cruelty where if they havent got manacles or cords to secure a suspected petty thief why theyll nail his hands together you see until they get him to the hoosegow where theyll keep him safe by hanging him up by his wrists behind his back and that is if hes merely suspected once hes convicted then his head goes into the basket if hes lucky if the magistrate feels liverish they may flog him to death or put the wire jacket on him or fry him on a bed of redhot chains or dismember him or let him crawl about the streets with a huge wooden collar on his neck until he starves or tattoo him to death this may surprise you if youve heard about the fiendish ingenuity of chinese punishment the fact is that its fiendish but not at all ingenious just beastly like the penal code of my dear old friends in madagascar and for all their vaunted civilisation they could teach queen ranavalona some tricks of judicial procedure which she never heard of in madagascar one way of determining guilt is to poison you and see if you spew i can taste that vile tanguin yet in china i witnessed the trial of a fellow whod caught his wife performing with the lodger and done for them both with an axe they tried him for murder by throwing the victims heads into a tub of water and stirring it the two heads ended up floating face to face which proved the adulterers affection so the prisoner was acquitted and given a reward for being a virtuous husband that was as i recall the only chinese trial i attended where the magistrate and witnesses had not been bribed so much for the lighter side of chinese life which im far from exaggerating indeed it was commonplace after a while you hardly noticed the dead beggars in the gutters and cesspits or the caged criminals left to starve and rot or even the endless flow of headless corpses into the chowchow water of the yangtse estuary off paoshan a perpetual reminder that only a short way upriver no farther than liverpool is from london the imperials and taipings were tearing each other to pieces in the great struggle for nanking imp gunboats were blockading the yangtse within fifty miles and shanghai was full of rumours that soon the dreaded changmaos the longhaired taiping devils would be marching on the treaty port itself theyd sacked it once years ago and now the chinese merchants were in terror sending away their goods and families and our consular people were wondering what the deuce to do for trade would soon be in a desperate fix and trade profit was all we were in china for they could only wait and wonder what was happening beyond the misty wooded flats and waterways of the yangtse valley in that huge rich squalid wartorn empire sinking in a welter of rebellion banditry corruption and wholesale slaughter while the manchoo emperor and his governing nobles luxuriated in blissful oblivion in the summer palace far away at pekin the chief hope must be that our army can reach pekin in time to bring the emperor to his senses bruce told me when i reported at his office in the consulate once the treatys ratified trade revived and our position secure the country can be made stable soon enough the rebellion will be ended one way or tother but if before then the rebels were to take shanghai well it might be the last straw that brought down the manchoo empire our position would be delicate and it would hardly be worth going to pekin through a country in chaos to treat with a government that no longer existed he was a cool knowledgable hand was bruce for all the smooth cheeks and fluffy hair that made him look like a halfwitted cherub he might have been discussing sayerss chances against heenan rather than the possible slaughter of himself and every white soul on the peninsula he was brother to elgin who was coming out as ambassador but unlike most younger sons he didnt feel bound to stand on his dignity he was easy and pleasant and when i asked him if there was a serious possibility that the taipings might attack shanghai he shrugged and said there was no way of telling theyve always wanted a major port says he it would strengthen their cause immensely to have access to the outside world but they dont want to attack shanghai if they can help it for fear of offending us and the other powers so loyal prince lee the ablest of the rebel generals writes me a letter urging us to admit his armies peacefully to shanghai and then join him in toppling the manchoos he argues that the taipings are christians like ourselves and that the british people are famous for their sympathy to popular risings against tyrannical rulers where he got that singular notion i cant think maybe hes been reading byron what about that slater think he reads byron not in the original certainly says the secretary no well he also extols the enlightened nature of taiping democracy and assures us of the close friendship of the taiping government when it comes to power bruce sighed its a dam good letter i darent even acknowledge it for the life of me i couldnt see why not a taiping china couldnt help but be better than the rotten manchoo empire whose friendship was doubtful to say the least and if we backed them theyd whip the manchoos in no time which would mean the pekin expedition was unnecessary and hope grant and flashy and the lads could all go home but bruce shook his head you dont lightly overthrow an empire thats lasted since the flood to let in an untried and damned unpromising rabble of peasants god knows the manchoos are awkward treacherous brutes but at least theyre the devil we know oh i know the bishop of victoria sees the finger of divine providence in the taiping rebellion and our missionaries call them coreligionists which i strongly suspect theyre not even if they were ive known some damned odd christians eh slater south america what says slater looking glum besides could such people govern theyre led by a visionary and their chief men are pawnbrokers clerks and blacksmiths talk about jack cade and wat tyler lees the best of em and hung jenkans civilised by all accounts but the rest are bloodyminded savages who rule their conquered provinces by terror and enslavement which is no way to win a war id say theyd be entirely unpredictable with their lunatic king liable to have a divine revelation telling him to pitch out all foreign devils or declare war on japan but suppose i ventured the taipings win in the end you mean says bruce looking more cherubic than ever suppose they look likely to win well hmg would no doubt wish to review the position but while its all to play for we remain entirely neutral respecting the celestial emperor as the established government of china i saw that but wondered if in view of the possible taiping threat to shanghai it mightnt be politic to jolly along this general lee with fair words lie to him like no the powers agree that all such overtures as lees letter must be ignored if i acknowledged it and word reached pekin heaven knows what might happen to our forthcoming negotiations with the imperial government they might assume we were treating with the rebels and grant might even have a real war on his hands we may have to talk to the taipings sometime unofficially says he thoughtfully but it will be at a time and place of our choosing not theirs all of which was of passing interest to me what mattered was that elgin wasnt due out until june and as his personal intelligence aide i could kick my heels pleasantly until then sampling the delights of shanghai diplomatic society and the more robust amusements to be found in the better class native singsongs and haunts of illrepute which i did and all the time china was stropping its dragon claws and eyeing me hungrily pleasuring apart the time hung heavy enough for me to do some light work with the politicals of the consulate for we maintained an extensive intelligencegathering bandobast and it behoved me to know about it it consisted mostly of strange little coolies coming to the back door at night with bits of bazaar gossip or itinerant bagmen with news from upriver the occasional missionarys helper whod been through the lines at nanking and endless numbers of young chinese who might have been students or clerks or pimps all reporting briefly or at length to swell the files of the intelligence department it was the most trivial wearisome rubbish for the most part there wasnt alas an anyatheh among the spies to cheer things up and devilish dull for the collators who passed it on for sifting and summary by the two chinese supervisors whose names i swear to god were mr fat and mr lin by the time theyd pieced and deduced and remembered well its surprising what can emerge from even the most mundane scraps of information for example it was the strangest thing that enabled us to foresee the end of the great siege of nanking in april the imperialists had huge entrenchments circling the city and the river blockaded on both sides but couldnt breach the rebel defences the taipings hemmed within the city had various forces loose in the countryside but nothing apparently strong enough to raise the siege it was such a stalemate that a great fair had actually been established between the imp lines and the city walls where both sides used to meet and fraternise and the imps sold all manner of goods to the taipings they brought food opium women even arms and powder which the taipings bought with the silver theyd found in nanking when they captured it back in a ludicrous state of affairs even for china it took my fancy and when one of our spies sent down particulars of the market trading i happened to glance through it and noted an item which seemed a trifle odd i aint given to browsing over such things you may be sure and i wish to heaven id never seen this one for what i noticed proved to be a vital clue and set bruce thinking earlier than he need have done with the most ghastly consequences to myself heres a rum thing mr fat says i why should the taipings be buying bolts of black silk dammit they spent taels on it this week more than they spent on cartridge are they expecting funerals most singular says he mr lin have the goodness to examine the return for last week so they did and the taipings had bought even more black silk then they clucked over it and burrowed into their records and came to an astonishing conclusion whenever the taipings undertook any desperate military action they invariably raised black silk flags in every company which their soldiers were bound to follow on pain of death they even had executioners posted in the ranks to behead any shirkers which must have done wonders for their recruiting id have thought and when we learned presently that the black silk had been sent out of the city to two of the taiping armies in the field the golden lions of the famous loyal prince lee and the celestial singers under chen yucheng it was fairly obvious that lee and chen were about to fall on the imp besiegers which in due course they did and our knowing about it in advance enabled the hon f w a bruce to plan and scheme most infernally as i said i was fool enough to be mildly pleased at spotting the item fat and lin regarded me with awe for days but i wasnt much interested having discovered far more important matter in the secret files which enabled me to bring off a splendid coup thus it appeared that countess h wife of a senior attachй at the russian mission paid weekly visits to a chinese hairdresser and under the pretext of being beautified regularly entertained four stalwart manchoo bannermen in a room above the shop later driving home with a new coiffure and a smug expression so you see you cant overestimate the importance of good intelligence work fascinating woman dyou know she smoked those damned brown cigarettes all the time even when and kept a tumbler of vodka on the bedside table but i digress bruce was preparing his bombshell and it was on my return from an exhausting afternoon at the hairdressers that he informed me out of the blue that he was sending me to nanking there was a time when the notion of intruding on the mutual slaughter of millions of chinese would have had me squawking like an agitated hen but i knew better now i nodded judiciously while my face went crimson and my liver turned its accustomed white aloud i wondered frowning if i were the best man to send a clever chinese might do it better one didnt know how long it would take have to be on hand when elgin arrived might our policy not be compromised if a senior british officer were seen near rebel headquarters strict neutrality of course bruce knew best it cant be helped says he briskly it would be folly not to employ your special talents in this emergency the battle is fully joined before nanking and theres no doubt the taipings will crush the imps utterly in the yangtse valley which will alter the whole balance in china at a stroke the rebels become masters of everything between kwangsi and the yellow sea he swept his hand across the southern half of china on his wall map i said some weeks ago that a time might come when we must talk to the taipings says he and for once the cherub face was set and heavy well it is now after this battle lees hands will be free and its my belief that he will march on shanghai if he does then we and france and america and russia can ignore the taipings no longer well be bound to choose once and for all between them and the manchoos he rubbed a hand across his jaw and thats a perilous choice weve avoided it for ten years and im damned if i want to see it made now in haste i said nothing i was too busy recalling with my innards dissolving that at the last great battle for nanking when the taipings took it in the carnage had been frightful beyond contemplation every manchoo in the garrison had been massacred dead in a single day all the women burned alive and it would be infinitely worse now with both taipings and imp fugitives joining in an orgy of slaughter and pillage raping burning and butchering everything in sight just the place to send poor flashy with his little white flag crying please sir may i have a word we can only maintain a de facto neutrality by keeping em at a distance bruce was saying if they advance on shanghai were bound either to fight and god help us or come to terms with them which the manchoos would regard as a flagrant betrayal and god help our pekin expedition so it is our task to see that the taipings dont come to shanghai how the deuce dyou do that i demanded if they beat the imps at nanking and have blood in their eye they wont stand still you dont know the taipings sir harry says he none of us does except to know that with them anything is possible i think theyll come to shanghai but this crazy king of theirs is capable of declaring a seven year tranquillity or some such stuff or launching his armies west to yunnan it is possible they may do nothing at all thats why you must go to nanking what can i hope to accomplish i protested and he took a turn round the room fingered a few papers sat down and stared at the floor devising some novel means of plunging me into the soup no doubt i dont know sir harry says he at last you must persuade em not to march on shanghai at least for a few months but how youre to do it he lifted his head and looked me in the eye the devil of it is i cant send you with any authority ive not replied to lees letter but im having a verbal hint discreetly conveyed to him that he may expect a an english visitor no one official of course simply a gentleman from the london missionary society who wishes to visit the heavenly kingdom and present his compliments lee will understand just as he will understand what is meant when the gentleman expresses the opinion merely the opinion mind you that while a taiping attack on shanghai would destroy any hope of british cooperation restraint now would certainly not incline us to a less favourable view of their overtures in the future i can see myself putting that in fluent mandarin says i and he had the grace to shrug helplessly it is the most i can authorise you to convey this is the most damned ticklish business we have to let them see where we stand but without provoking em into action or offending em mortally or above all being seen to treat with them in any official way whatsoever thats why your presence is a gift from god youve done this kind of business in india with considerable success as i recall well that was so much rot my diplomatic excursions had invariably ended in battle and beastliness on the grand scale with my perspiring self barely a length ahead of the field he got up and glowered at the map chewing his lip you see how difficult it is for me to give you guidance says he we do not even know what kind of folk they truly are the heavenly king himself has hardly been seen for years he keeps himself secluded in a great palace surrounded by a thousand female attendants thinking wonderful thoughts i was willing to bet he didnt spend all his time thinking if he could be persuaded to inaction to hold lee in check he shrugged but who is to say if he is even rational or if you will be allowed near him if not you must do what you can with loyal prince lee a splendid choice youll agree between a recluse who thought he was christs brother and a warlord whod done more murder than genghiz khan the only other who may be open to reason is the prime minister hung jenkan hes the wisest or at least the sanest of the taiping wangs mission educated and speaks english the rest are ignorant superstitious zealots drunk on blood and power and entirely under the sway of the heavenly king he shook his head you must use such tactful persuasions as seem best you will know better than i could tell you how to speak when you are face to face with them in a highpitched shriek probably of all the hopeless dangerous fools errands supposing i even got there how do i reach nanking arent the imps blockading the river a passage has been booked on dents steamer yangtse she got through to nanking last week the imps give our vessels passage and the river will be clear as far as kiangyin still if shes stopped there you must go on as seems best one of our people a missionary called prosser will be looking out for you youll have papers from the london missionary society in the name of mr fleming but the taipings will know precisely who and what you really are although neither they nor you will acknowledge it so it was settled i was for the high jump again and not a damned thing to be done about it he went over it all a second time impressing on me the delicacy of the task how hmg must be in no way compromised that every week of delay would be a godsend but the main thing was to convince this crew of homicidal madmen that whoever they killed next it shouldnt be done at shanghai well sir says i all noble and putupon ill be honest ill try but i dont think theres a hope of success another man might say that out of reluctance to go for his safetys sake says he solemnly i know that with you the thought of danger has not crossed your mind he was right there it had stayed rooted god bless you sir harry and with the angels choiring above us we shook hands and i marched out and bolted for the lavatory i had my adams in my armpit a colt in my valise a hundred rounds a knife in my boot and a bulky notebook containing every known fact about the taipings courtesy of messrs fat and lin when i boarded the yangtse on the following evening it was a good twoday run to nanking in ideal conditions at present it might take a week i was too sick and scared and furious to pay much heed to my surroundings and as i remember the yangtse was like any other river steamboat half a dozen cabins aft for the quality of whom i was one a couple of saloons below for those who couldnt afford a bunk and forward a great open steerage for the coolies and the like her skipper was one witherspoon of greenock a lean pessimist with a cast in his eye and a voice like coals being delivered ive no doubt i spent the time before we cast off brooding fearfully but i dont recall because as i leaned on the rail looking down on the quay and the oily water i saw about the only thing that could have provided any distraction just then the steerage gangway was swarming with coolies and poorer chinese and a few white riffraff shanghai was well stocked with poor whites and shabbygenteel halfcastes and scourings from half the countries on earth even in those days there was lascars of course and dagoes of various descriptions filippinos greeks malay arabs and every variety of slanteye some of em were halfnaked others carried valises and bundles the halfdozen sikh riflemen who acted as boatguards shepherded em aboard none too gently under the great flickering slushlamps which cast weird shadows on the dockside and the steerage deck i was watching with half my mind when i noticed a figure stepping from quay to gangway and even in that motley assembly it was a figure to take the eye not only for the outlandish cut of attire but for style and carriage and animal qualitys the only phrase i like tall women of course susie willinck comes to mind and cleonie of the willowy height and the superb mrs lade by name and nature and cassy and that german wench in the haymarket and even such gorgons as narreeman and queen ranavalona mind you theres much to be said for the little uns too such as the silk one ko dalis daughter and the little blonde valla and mrs mandeville the mad dwarf and whampoas playmates and takesawaycloudswoman and that voluptuous halfpint yehonala on the whole though i aint sure i dont prefer the happy medium like elspeth and lola and irma and josette and fetnab and elspeth it is no disrespect to any of these ladies all of whom i loved dearly to say that when it came to taking the eye the female coming up the steerage gangplank was the equal of any and all for one thing she was six feet six if she was an inch with the erect carriage of a guardsman and light on her feet as a leopard she was chinese beyond a doubt perhaps with a touch of something from the islands when she laughed as she did now to the squat fellow behind her it was with a deep clear ring and a flash of teeth in a lean lovely face not chinese style at all she had a handkerchief bound tight round her head and for the rest her clothing consisted of a blouse cotton breeches ending at the knee and heavy sandals but round her neck she had a deep tight collar that seemed to be made of steel links and her arms bare to the shoulder were heavy with bangles as to the lines of her figure rubens would have bitten his brush in two with the plank crowded ahead of her she had to wait holding the siderail in one hand and lolling back at full stretch carelessly laughing and talking to her companion she chanced to look up and met my eye she said something to the man and looked at me again laughing still and then she was up the plank like a huge cat and out of sight im not the most impressionable of men but i found i was gripping the rail with both hands and clenching my jaw in stern resolve by gum i couldnt let that go unattended to built like a dahomey amazon but far taller and incomparably more graceful and possibly the strongest female id ever seen which would be an interesting experience no common woman either how best to coax her up to the cabin probably not money nor a high hand well the first thing was to get a closer look at her i waited till we had cast off and the screw was churning the water with the lights on tsungming island glittering in the dark distance far ahead then i asked the steward where the ladder was to the steerage he pointed down the companion and said i would find the mate by the saloon door hed show me sure enough a fellow in a pilot cap came out of the saloon and started up the ladder as i started down he glanced up smiling starting to bid me good evening and then his jaw dropped and my hand shot under my jacket to the butt of the adams it was mr frederick townsend ward for perhaps five seconds we just stared at each other and then he laughed in the pleasantest tone imaginable well damn me says he its the colonel how are you sir keep your hands in front of you sir says i now come up slowly i stepped back to the cabin deck and he followed still grinning glancing at my hidden hand say whats the matter look if thats a piece under your coat this is a lawabiding boat you know you mean she isnt running guns to the taipings he laughed heartily at this and shook his head i gave that up say and you took a shot at me two shots what did you do that for you werent going to come to any harm you know id ha taken you back to macao when wed delivered the goods he sounded almost aggrieved oh forgive me no one told me that you see it must have slipped everyones mind along with the trivial fact that you were carrying guns not opium listen carpenter said the less you knew the better says he earnestly those were his orders the damned dummy he added irritably if hed ha given me a real chink pilot wed never ha seen that limey patrolboat hey how did you come out of that though perhaps i didnt i said it on the spur of the moment and his eyes widened you dont mean they broke you he whistled gee im sorry about that i sure am though absolutely he sounded shocked over a passel o guns well ill be he shook his head and smiled a mite sheepish say colonel why dont you let that hogleg alone and come on in my berth for a drink see here im sorry as hell but twasnt my fault sides its over and done with now he looked at me halfgrinning halfcontrite and youre ahead o me by two shots no hard feelings okay and he held out his hand now i know a rogue when i see one and i was forming a strange suspicion that mr ward wasnt a rogue at all oh ive known charming rascals bland as bedamned and the eyes give them away every time this fellows were bright and dark and innocent as a babes which you might say was all against him and yet he sounded downright pleased to see me i couldnt credit he was that good an actor and why should he trouble to be there was nothing i could do to him now certainly not here i ought to blow your blasted head off says i you dam near did cries he cheerily and when i continued to ignore his hand okay youve got a right to be sore i guess but why dont we go lower a couple anyway im off watch indeed why not i can only say he was a hard man to refuse and the truth is i was curious about him he was a rare bird i felt sure so i followed him out of the warm night into the stuffy little cabin where he seated me on the bunk and poured out two stiff tots say this is fine says he sitting on the locker howve you been and without letting me reply he rattled off into a recital of his own escape through the paddy and how hed smuggled himself back to macao and thence up the coast to shanghai where hed flourished his papers at dents and got himself a mates berth i watched him like a hawk but he was easy as old leather prattling away crazy undoubtedly but if he was crook it didnt show its not a bad berth says he but i wont stick fellow called gough one of your people commands a gunboat flotilla for the imps hes offered me second place on the confucius reckon ill take it what happened to the notion of being a taiping prince i asked and he grinned and pulled a face no sir thank you ive had a look at em these past few weeks theyre not for fred t he shook his head so firmly that thinking of my own mission i pressed him for information well all this stuff about being christians they dont have the first notion they have a lot o mumbojumbo about jesus that theyve picked up an got wrong but listen to give you an idea when they get a new recruit they give him three weeks to learn the lords prayer and if he cant whist he chopped his hand against his neck no fooling now what kind of christianity is that will you tell me and they treat the people something shameful take all their goods cos no one can have property in the taiping its all in common lessn youre one of the top wangs and they put em to work in companies like it was the army and if theyre too old or sick to work whist again and everybody has to work for the taiping see and obey all their foolish rules about religion an learn the proclamations of the heavenly king by heart and boy theyre the wildest stuff i tell you the thousand correct things an the book of celestial decrees and nobody understands em a little bit i said the missionaries were all for them and he shook his head again maybe they used to be but now theyve had a good look you go upriver into a taiping province you see the ruin the gutted villages the bodies laying about in thousands and it aint as if all their rules and discipline made things better why they make it worse nobody has land so nobody can plant cept the taiping tells him an the local governors why they have to wait for orders from further up an the fellow further up well theres nothing in it for him and he probably used to be a shoemaker anyway so what does he know about crops he knows the rules though and learns a new chapter of the bible each day and thinks moses was a manchoo mandarin who thought better of it i recalled that the heavenly king himself had been an educated man and while he was crazy there must be some taipings who knew how things should be run he scoffed me out of court that kind of person you mean merchants and clerks and fellows with some schooling they have no time for the heavenly kingdom theyre mostly dead anyway or made themselves scarce why should they truck with a crowd that just robs em and says theyre no bettern the peasants sides they can see the taipings are only good at killing and stealing and laying waste you seem to have learned a lot in a short time i said and he replied that one trip up to nanking and a look at the country around had been enough for him theyre so mean and cruel he kept saying sure the imps are worse their armys rotten and they just use the war as an excuse for plundering and killing wherever they go but at least theyve got something behind them i mean a real government even if it doesnt work too well a a sort of like the constitution i mean china he grinned ruefully and poured me another drink i dont make it too clear i guess but the taipings just have this crazy dream and theyre no good at making things work well the imps arent much better maybe but at least they can read and write i asked if he had seen anything of the leading taipings at nanking and he said no but he had heard plenty they do all right from what i hear thats what really got my goat theres all this fine talk about love and brotherhood and equality but the wangs live in palaces and have a high old time while the people are tret no bettern niggers you know says he all boyish earnestness at the beginning they made the women and men stay apart there was a special part of nanking for the girls and if they and the boys you know why they just killed em even now lessn youre married well if you you know they just whist the poor people are allowed one wife but the wangs he blew out his cheeks they have all the girls they want and arent there some doings in those palaces so i heard i found this quite cheering and pressed him for further details but he didnt have any its one law for the rich and another for the poor i guess says he philosophically mind theyve done some good things like not letting girls bind their feet and dont they come down hard on crooks and shysters though stealing opiumsmoking girls selling themselves anything illegal at all or even just talking out of turn and off comes the head ive seen that i wondered how long the people would endure a rule quite as despotic as the manchoos and even less efficient and he laughed wait till you see those taiping soldiers one thing theyre good at is discipline putting it on the people and taking it themselves thats why they can whip the imps easy theyre real good and so are their generals ill tell you something an the sooner all our people realise it the better this heres going to be a taiping china for keeps unless we i mean you british and us americans and the french maybe do something about it hed become very earnest rapping his finger on the locker a serious lad when he wasnt being crazy but all his talk about the wangs and their women had reminded me of what id been about in the first place so presently i left him and strolled down to the steerage besides my chat with him had almost been in the way of duty and i was due for a spell of vicious recreation it was full night now and we were thumping upstream with the tsungming lights to starboard and the last warmth dying from the night wind the great steerage deck poorly lit was littered with sleepers and i was about to turn back cursing and wait until daylight when i heard voices forrard i picked my way over the bodies and rounded the deckhouse in the bows and my heart gave a lustful little skip there was the slim towering figure at the bowrail talking with a couple of chinese rivermen they turned to glower at me and then the girl laughed and said something and the chinks melted into the dark leaving the two of us alone under the bowlamp she lounged with her elbows on the rail jove what a height she was topping me by a good four inches i stepped up to her lustfully appraising the play of the superb muscles on the bare bangled arms the lazy grace of the splendid body and the sensuous hawk face above the strange chain collar aye she was ready to play it was in every line of her hiya tall girl says i and she shot me an insolent knowing look like a vain tart gimme smoke yao says she extending a palm yao is foreigner and not at all polite from a chinese to a white man the black smoke or one of these i offered my cheroot case and the slant eyes flickered a fanqui who speaks chinese a cheroot then certainly not a common woman she spoke pekin albeit roughly i lit her a cheroot and she held my hand with the match in slender fingers whose grip made me tingle not a whores touch though just simple strength she inhaled deeply and so did i gloating come to my cabin says i slightly hoarse and ill give you a drink she showed her teeth gripping the cheroot theres only one thing you want to give me says she and named it anatomically and right you are says i quite delighted this was something new in chinese women coarse insolent and to the point so to show my own delicacy and good breeding i gripped her port tit under the thin blouse it felt like a large hard pineapple she gave a little grunt and a long slow wicked smile at me drawing on her cheroot how much cash says she narroweyed my dear child says i gallantly relinquishing her poont you dont have to pay me oh i see why i wouldnt insult you by offering money wouldnt i though i was boiling fit to offer her the bank but i guessed it wouldnt answer with this one in spite of her question she had a damned leery look in her eye sensual and calculating but with a glint of amusement unless i was mistaken no cash hey but you expect me to her vocabulary was deplorable but at least it left no room for misunderstanding thats the ticket says i heartily so instead of further flirtation i suggest that we suddenly she chuckled and then laughed outright with her head back and everything quivering to distraction i was preparing to spring when she came up off the rail bangles tinkling and stood looking down at me the ogres missus contemplating a randy jackthegiantkiller its a rum feeling i can tell you being surveyed by a beauty half a head taller than you are stimulating though suppose says she in that soft deep voice that i took payment i might rob a rich fanqui you might try miranda now then yes i might and if you big clever fanqui caught me she put her hands on her hips with that lazy smile you might beat a poor girl would you beat me fanqui with pleasure says i slavering at the prospect she nodded glanced either way gave me her insolent grin again drew deep on the cheroot and pulled the front of her blouse down to her waist for a moment i stood rooted hornily agog before all that magnificent meat and then as any gentleman would have done i seized one in either hand nearly crying which was absolutely as the designing bitch had calculated she suddenly gripped my elbows i instinctively jerked them down to my sides and without stooping or shoulder movement or the least exertion at all she lifted me clean off the deck i was too dumbfounded to do anything but dangle while she held me with only the strength of her forearms under my rigid elbows grinned up into my face and spoke quietly past the cheroot would you really beat a poor girl fanqui then before i could reply or hack her shins or do anything sensible she straightened her arms upwards holding me helpless three feet up in the air before abruptly letting go i came down cursing and stumbling clutching at the deckhouse for support by the time id recovered my balance she was modestly replacing her blouse taking a last pull at the cheroot and flicking it over the rail she put a hand on her hip grinning derisively while i seethed with rage and shame and awe at the realisation of that appalling strength all right then damn you i snarled twenty dollars fifty if youll stay the night god how she laughed the strutting arrogant slut and shed lifted me like a kitten i dont know when ive felt so mortified or so determined to have my way with a woman well it wasnt going to be rape that was sure nor money apparently fifty dollars she laughed no fanqui nor fifty thousand from a weakling but a strong man now she waited with that taunting confident smile daring me as i fell to raging at her and then to whining saying it had been a trick shed taken an unfair advantage damn her and then i gave a great gasp like billy bones in apoplexy rolled my eyes clutched my heart and reeled fainting against the deckhouse well shed not have been human if she hadnt stepped up for a closer look would she i bar hitting women except for fun especially when theyre strong enough to uproot the town hall clock but i was choking with vengeful fury toss me about like thistledown would she the infernal slut i let out a whimpering groan and as she advanced alarmed i let drive my right into her midriff with all my force she doubled up like a rag doll her knees buckling and i was on her back in an instant twisting the chain collar like a garotte flattening her by sheer weight she clawed back at me over her shoulder and i shot my left hand under her arm and on to the nape of her neck in a halfnelson i was blind with rage and fit to murder and if shed been less abominably powerful i might have done it but as she heaved and strained beneath me it was all i could do to hang on doing my damnedest to choke her with the steel links biting into her throat we thrashed and rolled about the deck her long legs flailing thumping against the bulkhead then against the rail my aching fingers twisting the collar ever tighter her splendid shoulders heaving to break my grip god she was strong and i knew in a few seconds she must break the lock i gave one last despairing heave on the collar and suddenly felt her slacken beneath me her head gave a little beneath my left hand and i roared with triumph suddenly her free hand was slapping the deck in the ageold wrestlers submission i clung to the chain like grim death had enough damn you i wheezed give over you bloody monster slapslap on the deck i let the collar slacken an inch and suddenly she reared up breaking the headlock and tearing the collar free i rolled away preparing to fly for my life when i realised she was scrambling back holding her throat her other hand up to ward her face was she beat was this the moment to set about her with my belt and then i realised that she was poised on one knee ready for battle and she was absolutely grinning at me brighteyed and we were no longer alone the unholy row had attracted half kiangsu province by the look of it certainly every coolie on the steerage deck and a ragged mob was staring from either side of the deck house with her chinese rivermen to the fore looking mighty truculent as they pressed forward i put my back to the rail reaching for the adams which id forgotten until that moment the sight of it stopped them dead the rivermens hands came away from their knifehilts and the girl stood up her shoulders shuddering and heaving and grunted something in river dialect then she looked at me gasping and rubbing her throat and so help me she was grinning again positively amiable tuckered as i was i wondered bemusedly if that murderous struggle had been the usual courting ritual of this female goliath lust revived as i observed her fine dishevelment with one udder peeping provocatively out of her blouse i put up the adams scowled back at the mob and then jerked my head at her she grinned broader than ever taking in great breaths and rubbing her throat but then she shook her head goodnight fanqui says she pretty hoarse and then she turned and disappeared into the staring rabble behind her truth to tell i didnt much mind i was bruised and exhausted and another bout would have carried me off if that was what she was like merely fighting for her life god knew how shed behave in amorous ecstasy i straightened my coat and pushed through the crowd marvelling at the minds of women treat em civilised and they swing you round their heads strangle em and suddenly theyre all for you because there was no doubt about it now she fancied me its all a matter of the proper approach i knew better than to seek her out next day as we steamed up the sluggish yangtse the consummation of our wooing would be all the better for keeping i saw her once as i paced the upper walk after tiffin she was standing in the steerage gazing up and raised a hand and gave her lazy smile at sight of me i smiled back surveying her carefully like a farmer at the stockring then nodded as one satisfied for the moment and turned away to resume my stroll aye let her wait i had other matters to occupy me during the day at least i chewed the fat with ward boned up on my taiping notebook wondered when the devil bruces agent would turn up and was first in quest of news at every village landingplace the crisis was plainly at hand upriver off tungchow a downriver boat informed us that the great battle about nanking had become a rout with the taipings everywhere victorious chens celestial singers were driving through to relieve the capital while general lee was driving the imps like sheep and breaking their blockade on the river and ye ken what thatll mean declares skipper witherspoon ominously every scoondrel in an imp uniformll be castin awa his coat and turnin bandit itll be worse than flodden goad help the country well no see nanking this trip im thinkin well dae well if we get the boats neb twenty miles past kiangyin this was serious for it meant that the last fifty miles of my journey would be through lawless country scourged by imp deserters and taiping fanatics well they could count me out if there was no sign of bruces man id turn back with yangtse when witherspoon decided hed reached the safety limit i couldnt be blamed if the country was impassable but i knew bruce wouldnt care for that and i was still studying to find a good excuse when we pulled in at kiangyin late in the afternoon it was the usual miserable hole of mud buildings and rickety bamboo wharves with the usual peasants gaping apathetically and stinking to wake the dead the peasants and kiangyin both beyond the town stale paddy stretched away to the misty distance with a few woods here and there and the inevitable agriculturists and bullocks standing ankledeep a depressing spectacle in no way redeemed by the appearance of the rev matthew prosser ba god rest him he came aboard like a vessel of wrath stamping up the gangway and roaring a small round redfaced cleric with corks hanging from his hat like an australian swagman a green veil streaming behind an enormous dustcoat and a flywhisk which he used as a flail on hindering orientals behind him tottered an urchin with his valise and prosser was furiously demanding the cabin steward when his eye lit on me and he started as though hed been stung he kept darting furtive glances at me while he hectored the steward and was no sooner inside his cabin than the door opened again and his crimson face appeared crying hist i went over and he dragged me in and slammed the door not a word cries he and stood listening intently with his corks bobbing then in a thunderous whisper im prosser howdedo we shall be bearing each other company i believe say nothing sir remember ehud i have a secret errand unto thee oh king who said keep silence and he gave an enormous wink which in that furious red face was positively alarming be seated sir there he pointed firmly to the bunk and began rummaging like a terrier in his valise as it happened i remembered ehud the biblical lefthander who was adept at sticking knives in folk which was a portent if you like as to prosser he seemed such an unlikely agent that i asked him if he knew bruce in shanghai and he rounded on me with bared teeth not another word discretion sir we must bind our faces in secret now where he snarled rummaging again did i put it aha i have it the cup was found in benjamins sack and he lugged out a rum bottle which must have held half a gallon he beamed peered at the level set it on the table and caught my eye well balshazzar drank wine did he not cries he but only after sundown sir and then but a small measure against the evening chill yes now sir attend to me if you please i believe you speak mandarin good he seemed vastly relieved then when we have reached our destination i shall make you known to a certain personage and leave you to your business he nodded heavily glanced at the bottle and muttered something about the lord being good to them that wait but youll be staying with me in where were going says i he might not be much but hed be better than nothing he shook his head angrily no such thing sir i am known you see and they watch me and send forth spies that they may take hold of my words you will do better without me indeed the less we are seen together the better even now and once i have made you known discreetly to one who like timothy is faithful in the lord faithful i say then my task is done besides i have my own work and he glared at the bottle again while i concluded that the faithful one must be the loyal prince general lee hsiuchen of the taipings why the devil couldnt he say so instead of acting like guy fawkes this was disconcerting id supposed i would be drynursed to nanking by some capable thug who not only knew the taipings backwards but could give me all manner of useful tips and do most of the work with luck instead here was this bottlenosed parson who didnt want to be seen near me couldnt wait to get shot of me and darent even say the simplest thing in plain language i said i must have some information and he said quite short that he hadnt any i pointed out that the boat might not go as far as nanking in which case hed have to be seen in my company probably trudging through banditinfested country he didnt take this kindly but growled that if the hosts of midian were prowling the lord must see us through and cheered me up no end by producing an ancient muzzleloader revolver from his valise and jamming rounds into it twitching towards his bottle the while i gave up and left him with a nasty reminder that sundown wasnt for another halfhour as soon as the door closed i heard the cork pop be not among winebibbers thinks i and recalling that that verse ended with reference to riotous eaters of flesh went in search of dinner well it was all sufficiently hellish how i asked myself for the thousandth time in my life had i got into this a couple of months earlier id been homeward bound and now i was heading on a secret mission that made my flesh crawl into the bloodiest civil war ever known on a rickety steamboat in company with the likes of the reverend grogpickle and frederick townsend ward who between them probably had as sure a touch for catastrophe as any pair id ever struck stay though there was my wrestling wench down on the steerage deck a bout with her in my cabin might not disperse the bluedevils entirely but god knows when id have another chance i finished my dinner quickly and went out on the upper deck we were well up from kiangyin by now but what kind of country we were in it was impossible to tell the sky overhead was clear enough with a bright silver moon but the river itself was shrouded with fog and we were pushing into the fleecy blanket at slow ahead the siren hooting dismally traces of it hung like wraiths on the narrow promenade outside the cabins with a clammy touch on the skin the sooner i was snug with my giantess the better out of curiosity i stuck my head into prossers cabin and he was flat on his back and snoring in an atmosphere you could have cut up and sold in the pubs and i was just pulling the door to again when a sudden tremendous shock threw me off my feet the yangtse shuddered like an earthquake plates shattered in the diningsaloon and faint cries of alarm sounded from the steerage deck the boat lurched and stopped and began to swing she was aground i pulled myself up damning witherspoon or whoever was at the wheel and in an instant was flat on my face again as a ragged volley of shots came out of the mist to port smashing a window overhead and splintering woodwork someone shrieked in pain the brazen clash of a gong started beating out on the water and the night was rent by a chorus of infernal yelling from beneath the stern shots were cracking out mingled with the explosion of firecrackers one landed within a foot of me snapping and sending out a shower of sparks something hit the yangtse a grinding jar on her quarter and close at hand were racing feet and wards voice yelling pirates stand to pirates to race into my cabin seize the adams and ram handfuls of loose rounds into my pockets was the work of a few seconds to guess what had happened took even less time river bandits or possibly imp fugitives turned brigand had somehow blocked the channel and were about to swarm aboard that thump under the stern had been a raft or sampan crowded with chinese savages who would pour over us in a wild slashing wave slaughter and torture most hideously whoever survived the attack loot and burn the steamer and be off into the web of sidecreeks before the nearest imperial garrison was any the wiser id seen it in borneo and knew precisely what to expect which is why you now behold the unusual spectacle of flashy making towards the scene of action and not fleeing for cover of which there wasnt any for i knew that in this kind of ambush the first sixty seconds was the vital time that wild volley the ridiculous firecrackers the clashing gong and the howling chorus these were the warwhoop designed to freeze the victim in terror our attackers would have few firearms theyd rely on cold steel swords knives kampilans axes aunt jemimas hatpin to hack down opposition and once they were on our decks in force we were done for catch em with a brisk fire before they could board and we stood a fair chance of driving them off i pounded along the narrow promenade to the after rail and could have whooped with relief at the sight of two sikh guards on the wide stern deck ten feet below me blazing away at the devils crew who were tumbling over the quarterrail about half a dozen had reached the deck horrible creatures in loincloths and pigtails wielding swords others in peasant dress with spears and knives shrieking contorted yellow faces everywhere and the two sikhs with their miniйs calmly picked their men and tumbled em with wellplaced shots reload reload i bawled to let em know they were covered for theyd been about to drop their empty pieces and draw their swords which would have been suicide one sikh heard me and as i opened fire with the adams he and his mate were whipping in fresh charges i knocked over two with five shots and with four down they wavered at the rail i was feverishly pushing in fresh loads when i heard another revolver and there was witherspoon beside the sikhs booming away across the smokefilled deck i heard feet behind me and there was ward pistol in hand get forrard i yelled theyll come at the bow too he didnt hesitate but turned and went like a hare youll go far if you live through this thinks i and in that moment i heard the screams and yells and clash of steel from the steerage forrard and knew that they were into us with a vengeance i turned to the rail again and here was more bad news for witherspoons gun was empty one of the sikhs was down and the other was laying about him with his riflebutt a dozen pirates were on the deck and even as i let fly again i saw witherspoon cut down by a gross yellow genie with a kampilan i blazed away into the brown and now the vicious horde had spotted me yelling and pointing upwards a shot whistled overhead and a spear clattered on the bulkhead behind me and i thought time to go flashy my son for it was all up god knew what was happening at the bow but the brutes were well established here and in two minutes theyd be butchering the coolies and cutting down the remaining crew my plan was already formed time to reload down to the saloon deck or even lower and at the first sight of the enemy over the side and swim for it and after that the lord would provide god willing which reminded me of prosser but he was a certain goner drunk and damned i came down the ladder at a race reloading frantically and reached the saloon deck all hell was breaking loose on the steerage forrard i heard the crash of the miniйs ward must have the remaining sikhs at work then down to the main deck i knew there was no way through from the stern the pirates there would have to climb up to the saloon deck and come down as i had done i slipped through the door to the open steerage and it was like dantes inferno a battle royal was raging round the deckhouse forrard but nothing to be seen for smoke nearer me coolies were going over the rail like lemmings apart from a sizeable group over to starboard who were wailing fearfully and evidently trying to burrow through the deck for twenty feet in front of me the port side of the deck was almost clear as a result of the coolie migration by god here were two of em coming back over the rail and then i saw the glittering kampilans and the evil screaming faces and i shot the first of them as he touched the deck the second a burly thug in embroidered weskit and pantaloons with an enormous topknot on his bald skull sprang down waving an axe and i was about to supply him with ballast when a fleeing coolie cannoned blindly into me i went sprawling and my adams clattered away into the scuppers no one not even elspeth ever believes this but my first words were why the hell dont you look where youre going followed by a scream of terror as the bald bastard lunged for me axe aloft there wasnt time to scramble or strike i was down and helpless he took just a split second to pick his target and someone shouted high and shrill hiya shangi nay his head whipped round in astonishment and so did mine fifteen feet away just clear of the smoke obliterating the forward deck stood the tall girl looking like medusa her kerchief and blouse were gone there was blood on her breeches and on the chain collar and in one hand she carried a bloody kampilan the old china sea trick in fact half your pirates come aboard as passengers and turn on the crew when the attack begins she and those ugly rivermen it was a fleeting thought and of small interest just then as shangi of the axe held his hand in the act of disembowelling me and responded with a huge beam hiya szuzhan and having observed the courtesies swung up his axe to cleave me i heard her scream something he shot her an angry look and a curse took final aim at me and swung i shut my eyes shrieking there was the sound you hear in a butchers shop when the cleaver hits the joint and i thought how deuced odd that was his axe in me and i felt no pain at all i looked again and he was standing sideon chin on breast evidently meditating then i saw the kampilan hilt protruding from his midriff and eighteen inches of bloody blade standing out behind him and he crashed forward on the deck his axe dropping from his hand it had taken five seconds since the coolie barged into me and now i was scrambling over the deck grabbing the adams aware that she was still poised in the act of throwing and as i came round two more pirates were mounting the rail seeing their fallen pal and going for her with blood in their eye i shot one in the back she caught the second by his swordarm and i heard the bone snap something hit me a terrific clout on the head and i was on my knees again with the deck and the night and the hideous din of battle spinning round me i tried to crawl but couldnt the adams was like lead in my fist and i knew i was losing consciousness a boot smashed into me steel rang beside my head voices were screaming and cursing and suddenly i was whirled up helpless i was suspended floating and then i was flying turning over and over for what seemed an age before plunging into warm silent water into which i sank down and down forever nowadays in the split second of uncertainty between sleeping and waking i sometimes wonder which is it going to be this time am i in the jalallabad hospital or the apache wickiup the royal palace of strackenz or the bottle dungeon under gwalior the down bed at bents fort or the mealie bags at rorkes drift is this the morning i go before the san serafino firingsquad or have i only to roll over to be on top of lola montez on the whole its quite a relief to discover its berkeley square i mention this because in all the unconscionable spots ive opened my eyes ive known within seconds where i was and what was what the yangtse valley for some reason was an exception i lay for a good half hour without the least notion despite the fact that i could overhear people talking about me in a strange language which nevertheless i understood perfectly thats the oddest thing they were talking in a chinese river dialect which i havent learned yet but in my awakening it was as clear as english aint that odd one fellow was saying they should cut my throat another says no no this is an important fanqui i should be held for ransom a third thought it was a damned shame that id been the cause of their falling out with the triads because those provident brave butterflies were likely lads whom it was foolish to offend a fourth said they could hold their wind since she would do what she pleased guess what at which they all hawhawed and fell suddenly silent and a moment later a hand was raising my head and strong spirit was being trickled between my lips and i opened my eyes to see the lean handsome face over the steel chain collar then it came rushing back the boat the pirates that hellish melйe in the steerage i struggled up with my head splitting staring around a campfire among bushes beside a sluggish stream half a dozen chinese thugs squatting in a halfcircle regarding me stonily two of them i recognised as rivermen whod been talking to the tall girl that first night and herself kneeling beside me with a flask in her hand eyeing me gravely shed lost her kerchief and her hair was coiled up most becomingly on top of her head which must have made her about seven feet tall for the rest she wore a peasant shirt now and the ragged kneebreeches complete with bloodstain i demanded information fairly hoarse and she gave it the yangtse had been ambushed by members of the provident brave butterfly triad once a perfectly respectable criminal fraternity which in these troubled times had abandoned its urban haunts and gone rogue in the countryside she and her associates knew the butterflies quite well had indeed been on friendly terms until you had to put your knife through shangis guts cries one of the lads what the hell for why he and his friends had spoken their river dialect before his question now was phrased in a dreadful mixture of bastard pekinese and pigeon which i could just make out why he used it i couldnt think unless out of courtesy to me which it probably was in fact they have the oddest notions of etiquette and can show great consideration for strangers even unwelcome prisoners which i seemed to be anyway when he wondered why shed corrected poor old shangis exercises for him she simply said because it pleased me glanced at me and then looked away with her lazy smile itll please you then when the butterflies make feud and kill us all says he or words to that effect youll see whats more he flicking his finger at me shot talungki well get the blame for that too it saved my life says she and looked at him are you complaining you little he hurriedly said no of course not and shangi and talungki were admittedly a pair of prominent bastards still it was a pity to provoke the triads he merely mentioned it who are you i interrupted and she looked slightly surprised bandits says she as one might have said conservatives of course and added with a lift of the splendid head i am szuzhan plainly i was right to look impressed although id never heard the name i nodded solemnly and said i see you work with the triads it appeared they didnt she and the boys were real bandits not townee roughs sure enough theyd been preparing to take the yangtse farther up but the triads had got in first and szuzhan and her gang had been pursuing a neutral policy until it had become necessary to intervene after that to avoid further embarrassment they had left and shed been considerate enough to throw me over the side first what happened to the others the passengers and crew they will be in kiangyin by now says she from the bank we saw them beat off the triads then they refloated the boat and went downriver ward you sonofabitch i thought to myself hed absolutely fought his way clear and thanks to the zeal of my protectress i was stuck in the wilderness not that i could complain but for her id have been digesting shangis axe by now which was highly flattering although id known of course after our tussle behind the deckhouse that she had worked up a ravenous appetite for me it didnt surprise me for i say this without conceit since it aint my doing while civilised women have been more than ordinarily partial to me my most ardent admirers have been the savage females of the species take the captain of gezos amazons for example whod ogled me so outrageously during the deathhouse feast or sonseearray the apache or queen ranavalona whod once confessed shyly that when i died she intended to have part of me pickled in a bottle and worshipped or lady caroline lamb the dahomey slave not the other one who was before my time yes ive done well among the barbarian ladies elspeth of course is scottish and here now was szuzhan of the glorious height and colossal thews when i thought of the strength that could drive a kampilan through a stout human body from fifteen feet i felt a trifle apprehensive but at least i was safe with her and would be most lovingly cared for until aye the sooner we took order the better szuzhan says i gravely i am in your debt i owe you my life im your friend now and hereafter i held out my hand and after a moment she grasped it giving me her pleased insolent smile it was like putting your hand in a mangle my name is harry i am english and stand high in the british army and government halli says she in that deep liquid voice and dye know it never sounded better and im indebted to your friends also says i and held out my hand again the six proud walkers looked at each other and frowned and scratched and scowled and then one by one came forward and each took my hand and muttered hang and tannang and mao and yei as the case might be then they all sat down again and giggled at each other i need to go back to shanghai quickly i went on the british trade superintendent will pay many taels for my safe return in silver i can promise not to shanghai says she not even to kiangyin this is triad country so we go west until we are strong again thirty forty swords then let the butterflies feud and she sneered at mao the argumentative one then let me go says i i pledge two hundred taels to be paid to you wherever you wish ill make my own way back she studied me leaning back on her elbow and if you dont think that shirt bloody breeches and great clog sandals can look elegant youre mistaken the long hungry face was smiling a little as a cat might smile if it could no you were going to nanking we can take you there or farther and for the first time since id met her she dropped her eyes hey cries yei who i learned was the gang idiot and had just reached a conclusion the others had known long ago she wants him to obviously theyd all gone to the same elocution class thats why she wants to keep him with us her response might have been to blush and say really yei and perhaps by chinese bandit standards it was for she was on her feet like a panther reached him in two great strides plucked him up wriggling by the neck and laid into him with a bamboo he yelled and struggled while she lambasted him mercilessly at arms length until the stick broke when she swung him aloft in both hands dashed him down and trampled on him he came to after about ten minutes by which time i had lost any inclination to argue with the lady nanking let it be says i as it happens i have business with the loyal prince lee that ought to impress even bandits you know the taipings the coolie kings she shrugged we have marched with them against the imps now and then what is your business with the chung wang talk says i but first i shall ask him for two hundred taels in silver we spent the night where we were since the crack id taken on the head had left me feeling fairly seedy next morning i had nothing worse than a bad headache and we set off northwest through the wooded flats and floodlands that lie between the great river and the tai hu lake to the south nanking was about fifty miles ahead but in the state of the country i reckoned it would take us a good four days and wary travelling at that for we were marching into a battlefield or rather a killingground that stretched a hundred miles where the remnants of the imperial armies were fleeing before the taipings with both sides savaging the country as they went ive seen slaughter and ruin in my time gettysburg and rio villages where the mimbreno had passed through the ganges valley in the mutiny time and the piratepillaged coast of sarawak but those were single battlegrounds or a few devastated villages at most this was a whole country turned into a charnelhouse village after burned village smoke on every horizon corpses many of them hideously mutilated on every wrecked street and in every paddy and copse i remember one small town burning like a beacon and a pile of bodies of every age and sex outside its shattered gate that pile was eight feet high and as long as a cricket pitch they had been herded together doused with oil and burned imps says szuzhan and i daresay she was right for they were worse than the rebels we saw scattered bands of them every hour and had to lie up as they passed mobs of bannermen in their halfarmour and quilted jacks tiger soldiers like grotesque harlequins in their closefitting suits of diagonal black and yellow tartar cavalry in furedged conical hats and gaudy coats dragging wailing women behind their ponies in one place we saw them driving a crowd of peasants there must have been a couple of hundred into an open field and then they just charged among them and butchered them with their swords and lances and everywhere the dead and the deathsmell mingling with the acrid smoke of burning homes i dont describe this to harrow you but to give some notion of what china was like in that summer of and this was one small corner you understand after one battle in a vast empire where rebellion had flamed for ten long years no one can ever count the dead or tally the destruction or imagine the enormity of its bloodstained horror this was the taiping the kingdom of heavenly peace after the first day though i barely noticed it any more than you notice fallen leaves in autumn for one thing my companions were indifferent to it theyd lived in it for years and i had my own skin to think about which means after a little time that you feel a curious elation you are alive and walking free in the valley of the shadow your lucks holding and its easy to turn your thoughts to higher things like journeys end and your continued survival and the next meal and the slim towering figure ahead with those muscular buttocks and long legs straining the tight breeches the devil of it was while we were sleeping out there was no privacy with those six villains never more than a few yards away and dossing down beside us at night she was watching me though with that knowing smile getting less lazy and her mouth tightening with growing impatience as the hours and miles passed i was getting a mite feverish myself perhaps it was the barbarous conditions and the frustration of being so near but i wanted that strapping body as i wanted salvation once when we lay up in a wood while a long convoy of imp stragglers went by we found ourselves lying flank to flank in long grass with the others behind the bushes and i began to play with her until she turned on me her mouth shaking and searching for mine we pawed and grappled grunting like beasts and i dare say would have done the trick if the clown yei hadnt come and trodden on us by the second afternoon we had struck a patch of country which the war seemed to have passed by peasants were hard at it standing in the fields and not far ahead there was a fortified hillsummit betokening a safe village we had picked up some baggage and sidearms on our journey and even a cart to push them in at which the bandits took complaining turns and szuzhan said we should stay that night at an inn because camping out you never knew when you might be molested by prowlers its a great thing propertyowning we were such an evillooking gang especially with myself a bignosed fairskinned barbarian which is the height of ugliness to the chinese that i doubted if theyd let us through the gate but there was a little temple just outside the wall with a vulturelike priest ringing a handbell and demanding alms and once szuzhan had given him a handful of cash he croaked to the gatekeeper to admit us it was a decent village for china the piled filth was below windowlevel and the inn of mutual prosperity had its own teashop and eatinghouse quite the savoy or browns if you like a shilling a night bring your own grub and bedding indeed ive fared worse at english postinghouses in my schooldays than i have in some rural chink hotels this one was walled all round with a big archway into its central court and we hadnt stopped the cart before a fat little host was out with the inevitable teapot and cups szuzhan demanded two rooms one on the sidewall for the six lads and another de luxe apartment at the top of the yard away from the street those are the better larger rooms and cost three hundred cash or eighteenpence theyre big and airy since the door dont fit and the paper in the windows lets in fine draughts but theyre dry and warm with a big kong or brick platform bed taking up half the room under the bed theres a flue for dry grass or dung fuel so you sleep most comfortably on top of a stove with the smoke going up a vent in the wall or rather not going up since the chimneys blocked and you go to bed in dense fog privacy is ensured by closing the door and getting mine host to jam your cart up against it there wasnt a best room available until szuzhan shrugged back the cloak shed picked up and rested her hand on her cleaverhilt at which mine host blenched and wondered if the paddyfield suite wasnt vacant after all he signified this by grovelling at our feet beating his head on the ground in the kowtow pleading with us to wait just a moment and then scrambling up grabbing a servant and getting him to deputise as kowtower while the host scurried off to eject a party who had just booked in he fairly harried them out screaming and they went too dumb and docile while the servant continued to bash his brains out before us and then we were ushered in another teapot was presented with fawning servility and we were assured that dinner could he served in the apartment or in the commonroom where a wide variety of the choicest dishes was available it was the usual vile assortment of slimy roots and gristle which the chinese call food but i had a whole chicken roasted to myself and it was during the meal that i realised my companions were not chinese but manchoos the common chinks eat out of a communal ricebowl but even the lowliest manchoo will have his separate ricedish as szuzhan and her companions did other interesting native customs were to be observed after t he meal when the six gorged to the point of mischief announced that they were off to the brothel next door ive never seen prostitution so blatant as in china and this although its a hanging offence all through our meal shabby tarts with whitepainted faces had been becking and giggling in the doorway calling out and displaying the mutilated feet by which the chinese set such store and the lads had been eating faster and faster in anticipation now with the samshu and tea going round szuzhan whod been leaning back against the wall sipping and eyeing me restively threw a bag of cash on the table and reminded them that we would be off at dawn put money in front of a chinese even if hes starving and hell gamble for it they turned out the purse yelping and fell to choimooy the linger game in which you whip your hand from behind your hack holding up one or more fingers and the others have to guess how many double quick in two minutes they were briefly at blows with the tarts hanging over the table egging them on then they settled down and the fingers shot out to a chorus of shouts followed by groans or laughter while szuzhan and i sat apart nibbling a fierytasting ginger root which shed spoke for and killing the taste with tea and samshu i watched her strong teeth tearing at the ginger root and saw she was breathing hard and there was a trickle of sweat down the long jaw shes on a short fuse now thinks i so i took her hand firmly and led her out and quickly across to the room i had her shirt and breeches away before the door closed and was just seizing those wonders yammering with lust when she spun me round in an iron grip face to the wall and disrobed me in turn with a great rending of linen and thunder of buttons she held me there with one hand while with the other she drew a long sharp fingernail slowly down my back and up again faster and faster as she hissed at my ear biting my neck and finally slipped her hand round my hips teasing i tore free fit to burst but she turned squirming her rump into me seizing my wrists and forcing my fingers up into her chain collar panting now halli now fight fight and twisting her head and shoulders frenziedly to tighten my grip well strangulation as an accompaniment to la galop was i confess new to me but anything to oblige the weaker sex besides the way she was thrashing about it was odds that if i didnt incapacitate her somehow shed break my leg so i hauled away like fury and the more she choked the wilder she struggled plunging about the room like a bronco with flashy clinging on behind for his life rolling on the floor it was three falls to a finish no error and if i hadnt secured a full nelson and got mounted in the same moment shed have done me a mischief after that it was more tranquil and we didnt hit the wall above twice i settled into my stride which calmed her to a mere frenzy of passion and by the time we reached the ecstatic finish she was as shuddering clay in my hands as i lay there most wonderfully played out with her gasping exhausted beneath me i remember thinking gad suppose she and ranavalona had been joint rulers of madagascar the trouble was that being so infernally strong she recovered quickly from athletic exercise and within the hour we were at it again but now i insisted that i conduct the orchestra and by giving of my artistic best convinced her that grinding is even better fun when you dont try to kill each other at least she seemed to agree afterwards when we lay in each others arms and she kissed me lingeringly calling me fanqui halli and recalling our contortions in terms that made me blush so i drifted into a blissful sleep and about four oclock she was here again offering and demanding violence and this time our exertions were such that we crashed through the top of the bed into the fireplace and completed the capital act among the warm embers and billowing clouds of ash well i reflected thats the first time youve done it in a chinese oven semper aliquid novi a little touch of flashy in the night goes a long way with some women then again there are those who cant wait to play another fixture and so ad infinitum i suppose i should be grateful that szuzhan the bandit was one of the latter since this ensured my safety and also gave me some of the finest rough riding i remember on the other hand the way she spun out that journey to nanking over another three days and tempestuous nights it looked long odds that id have to be carried the last few miles she gave me concern on another more spiritual score too as you know ive no false modesty about my ability to arouse base passion in the lewder sort of female but ive never deluded myself that im the kind who inspires deep lasting affection except in elspeth thank god but shes an emotional halfwit must be shes stuck by me for sixty years however there were one or two like duchess irma and susie who truly loved me and i was beginning to suspect that szuzhan was one of those for one thing she couldnt get enough of my company and conversation on the march plaguing me to tell her about myself and england and my time in the army and places id visited and my likes and dislikes and whether i had a wife at home i hesitated at that fearful that the truth might displease her but decided it was best to let her know i was spoke for already she didnt seem to mind but confessed that she had five husbands herself somewhere or other a happy battered gang they must have been she would listen intent to all i said those slant eyes fixed on my face and the arch satisfied smile breaking out whenever i paid her any marked attention then on the last lap into nanking she fell thoughtful and i knew the poor dear was brooding on journeys end on the previous afternoon we had come into taiping country proper and i saw for the first time those red jackets and blue trousers and the long hair coiled in plaits round the head that marked the famous chang maos the longhaired devils the coolie kings what id heard was true they were finerfeatured than the ordinary chinks smarter more disciplined even in their movements aye more austere is the word their guardposts were wellmanned on the march they kept ranks they were alert and full of business holding up their heads and i began to wonder if perhaps napoleon was right the greatest rebellion ever known the most terrible religious force since islam szuzhan proved to be wellknown to them by repute and now i learned how many professional brigands had joined with the taipings out of no ideals but just for the loot and conversation only to fall away because they wouldnt take the rigid discipline quite trivial military crimes were punished by death or savage flogging and apart from that there was all the rubbish of learning texts and the heavenly kings thoughts and keeping strictly the sabbath so szuzhan took part with them only when she felt like it which wasnt often they treated her with immense respect mind you hed have been a damned odd man who didnt ive known a fair number of females who were leaders of men and every time someone has thought fit to remark on the fact of their sex not with szuzhan her leadership was a matter of course and not only because she was gigantic in stature and strength she had a quality put em on an outpost together and even wellington wouldnt have pressed his seniority but my own humble presence in the party helped to speed us on our way too for they were eager to welcome any outside christians who might take word home of what splendid chaps they were they knew you see that what their movement needed was the approval of the great powers britain france and america for preference but paraguay would do at a pinch so we rode the last day all eight of us in our cart hauled by forty straining peasants in harness with taiping guards flogging cm on when one collapsed they kicked him into the ditch and whistled up another ill not forget that ride in a hurry for it took us not into nanking but into the heart of the vast army of golden lions commanded by general lee hsiuchen the loyal prince and the man i had come to see i had mixed feelings about meeting him great men are chancy and best viewed from a distance as the parade goes by and didnt this one have a parade of his own just mile after mile of outposts and lines and bivouacs swarming with orderly mobs of red coats and white straw coolie hats parks of artillery laagers of storewagons and equipment carts great encampments for the separate corps the youths the earths the waters the women who are respectively the light infantry and scout battalions the sappers and builders the river navy and the female regiments who alone were a hundred thousand strong i looked on those anthills of disciplined humanity covering the ground into the hazy distance and thought palmerston you should see this god knows about their quality although they look well but for weight of numbers theyll be bad to beat take on the russians or the frogs or the yankees if you like but dont tangle with this because youll never come to the end of them well i was wrong as you know a dreamy young scot and a crazy american between them brought the great kingdom of i heavenly peace down in bloody wreck in the end but i wouldnt have bet on it that day below nanking and this wasnt the half of them the rest were still out yonder murdering imps when we were clearly coming to the centre of the camp i decided it was time to announce myself as an english gentleman seeking general lee that cleared our way to a cluster of headquarter tents where i made myself known to an officer outside the biggest marquee of all with stalwart bowmen in fur caps and steel breastplates standing guard a golden lion standard at its canopy and yellow ribbons fluttering from its eaves he told me to wait and i turned to szuzhan asking her to act as my sponsor she shook her head no go in alone he will not wish to see me he will when i tell him that its thanks to you im here says i come on tall girl i need you to speak up for me she shook her head again better you speak to him alone dont worry he will understand what you say she glanced round at the six wise men who were studying their orderly surroundings with contempt and spitting over the edge of the cart youll get no credit from this company fangui something in her voice made me look closer shed been calling me halli not fanqui for days now her eyes seemed bigger and suddenly i realised before she turned her head away sharply it was because there were tears in them for gods sake says i stepping up here come down this minute come down i say she slipped over the edge of the cart and leaned against it with that artless elegance that could make me come all over of a heat and looked sullenly down at me what the devils the matter says i why wont you come in it is not fitting says she stubbornly and brushed a hand over her eyes the bangles tinkling not fitting what stuff why here a thought struck me its not anything youve done is it youre not wanted for being a bandit i mean she stared and then laughed her great deep laugh with her head back the steel collar shaking above her bosom gad but she was fine to see so tall and strong and beautiful no halli i am not wanted she shrugged impatiently but i would rather stay here ill wait well the darlings have their own reasons so when the officer returned i went in alone and was conducted through a long canvas passage ending in a heavy cloth of gold curtain he drew it back and i stepped from the world into the kingdom of heavenly peace it was downright eery one moment the noise and bustle of the camp and now the dead silence of a spacious tent that was walled and roofed and even carpeted in yellow silk filtered light illuminated it in a golden haze the furniture was gilt and the young clerk writing at a gold table was all clad in yellow satin he put down his brush and rose addressing me in good pekinese mr fleming he called it fremming the gentleman from the missionaries of london i said i was and that i wished to see general lee hsiuchen he indicated a chair and slipped out returning a moment later in a brilliant scarlet silk jacket the effect of that glaring splash of colour in the soft golden radiance absolutely made me blink i rose waiting to be ushered please to sit says he this is not ceremonial dress he sat down behind the table folded his hands and looked at me and as i stared at the lean youthful face with its tight lips and stretched skin and met the gaze of the intent dark eyes i realised with shock that this slim youngster must be the famous loyal prince himself i tried to conceal my astonishment while he regarded me impassively we are honoured says he his voice was soft and highpitched you were expected some days ago perhaps you have had a troublesome journey still taken aback i told him about the river ambush and how szuzhan and her friends had brought me across country you were fortunate says he coolly the tall woman and her brigands have been useful auxiliaries in the past but they are pagans and we prefer not to rely on such people not encouraging but i told him slightly embarrassed that id promised her two hundred taels which i didnt have and he continued to regard me without expression my treasurer will supply you says he and at this point in our happy chat a servant entered with tea and tiny cups lee poured in ceremonious silence and the trickle of the tea sounded like a thundering torrent for no good reason i was sweating there was something not canny about this yellow silken cave with the scarletcoated young deathshead asking if i would care for distilled water on the side then we sat sipping in the stillness for about a week and my belly gurgling like the town drains at last he set down his cup and asked quietly will the powers welcome our army at shanghai i damned near swallowed my cup if he handled his army as briskly as his diplomacy it was a wonder there was an imp soldier left in china by now he waited until i had done hawking and coughing and fixed me with those cold dark eyes it is essential that they should he spoke in the flat dispassionate tone of a lecturer the war in china is foregone the dragon will die and we shall have killed it the will of the people inspired by gods holy truth must prevail and in the place of the old corrupt china a new nation will be born the taiping to achieve this we do not need european help but european compliance the powers in effect control the treaty ports the use of one of them shanghai will enable us to end the war so much the sooner well that was what bruce had said and what we in our neutrality were reluctant to grant because it would put a firecracker under pekins backside and grant would have to fight all the way to the capital against an imperial government whod feel that wed betrayed em to the taipings we are aware he went on that britain has a treaty with the emperor and recognises his government while not acknowledging even our existence perhaps she should recall the saying of an english poet that treason cannot prosper because with prosperity it ceases to be treason the taiping is prospering mr fleming is that not a sound reason why your country should look favourably on our request to come to shanghai in peace and friendship so much for oriental diplomacy long fingernails and long negotiations my eye there was his case stated with veiled menaces before id got a word in let alone bruces tactful persuasions one thing was clear this wasnt the time exactly to tell him we didnt want his longhaired gang anywhere near shanghai but there is more much more than mere practical interest to bind our countries he leaned forward slightly and i realised that behind the impassive mask he was quivering like a greyhound the dark eyes were suddenly alight we are christian as you are we believe in progress work improvement as you do we believe in the sacred right of human liberty as you do in none of these things none his voice rose suddenly do the manchoos believe they respect no human values why for example do they shuffle and lie and evade rather than permit your ambassador to go to pekin to sign the treaty to which they are pledged do you know i supposed vaguely that they hoped wed modify a few clauses here and there if they put off long enough no his voice was level again that is not why they would sign today at canton or shanghai even hong kong but not at pekin why because if the ceremony is there in the hall of ceremonies in the imperial city with your lord elgin and the emperor the son of heaven face to face he paused for emphasis then all china all under the skies will see that the big barbarian does not go down on his knees before the celestial throne does not beat his head on the ground before the solitary prince that is why they delay that is why general grant must go up with an army because lord agin will not kowtow and that they cannot endure because it would show the world that the emperor is no more than any other ruler like your queen or the american president and that they will not admit or even believe touchy eh says i well i dare say is a government to be taken seriously that would risk war conquest even rather than forego the kowtow to that debauched imbecile come to a taiping prince and he will take your ambassadors hand like a man that is the difference between a power blinded by ignorance pride and brutality stumbling to its ruin and a power enlightened democratic and benign allow me to pour you some more tea now youll have noticed that for all his cold straight talk he hadnt said they were coming to shanghai willynilly hed urged powerful reasons why we ought to invite them with a strong hint of the consequences if we didnt well wed have to wait and see but it was plain i was going to have the deuce of a job fobbing him off for as long as bruce wanted this was the kind of steeledged young fireeater whod want a straight answer pdq and wouldnt wear any diplomatic nods and winks by gad he wasted no time how long had i been with him ten minutes long enough to feel the force that had brought him in ten years from apprentice charcoalburner and private soldier to the third place in the taiping hierarchy behind hung jenkan and the tien wang himself it was there in the cold soft voice and hard unwinking eyes he was a fanatic of course and a formidable one i didnt care for him one damned bit however i had a part to play even if we both knew it was a sham so i thanked him for his illuminating remarks about his great movement which i looked forward eagerly to studying while i was in nanking i am only a traveller as you know but anxious to learn and to pass on what i learn to my countrymen who are ah deeply interested in your splendid cause what you will learn and pass on says he will include the elementary scientific fact that revolutions do not stand still tomorrow i shall conduct you personally to nanking where i hope you will do me the honour of being my personal guest for as long as it pleases you to stay so that was that and he must have slipped a quick word to his treasurer for in the outer tent and how free and airy it seemed after that golden bath a little chap was waiting with a bag of silver and a scroll which i was invited to sign with a paintbrush when in rome i painted him a small cat sitting on a wall he beamed and i strode out to the cart which wasnt there i stopped dead looking right and left but there was no sign of it nothing but the limitless lines of tents with redcoats swarming everywhere i turned in astonishment to the officer who had admitted me the woman who was here with the cart the very tall woman and six men they went away says he after you had gone in to the chung wang the woman left that for you he jerked his thumb at one of the little flagstaffs planted before the marquee something was hanging on it something shining i went over and was reaching for it in bewilderment when i made out what it was her steelchain collar wondering i took it down weighing it in my hands why the devil had she gone off leaving this i stared at the officer she left this for me did she say why he shook his head bored she told me to give it to the big fanqui nothing more but she said she was going to wait oh aye he stopped in the act of lounging off she told me to say that she would always be waiting he shrugged whatever that may mean theres a test which i apply to all my old flames when i think back sentimentally to moments of parting and its this if shed been mine to sell how long would i have kept her in the case of szuzhan the answer is another night or two at most aside from the fact that she was wearing me to a shadow i needed no encumbrances in taipingdom by all accounts they were a straitlaced lot who mightnt take kindly to a bandit mistress and i couldnt afford to lose face perhaps she sensed that and had the good sense to make herself scarce yet as i stood by the dusty camp road with the flags and ribbons fluttering in the evening wind and the sun going down misty beyond the lines i confess i felt a moments pang at the thought that id straddled her for the last time and i still keep the chain collar in my drawer upstairs with the silk ones scarf lakshmibais stirrup lolas letter irmas little glove and that mysterious red silk garter with semper fidelis embroidered on it that im damned if i can place anyway it shows i still think kindly on szuzhan but even she pales in memory when i look back to that time for now i was entering on one of the strangest episodes of my life which i wouldnt believe myself if i were to read it in someone elses recollections but which you may take my word for because i was there in the eternal kingdom of heavenly peace and you know i aint about to start stretching at this time of day i can say ive walked in nephelococcygia as old arnold would have called it and when i tell you that it beat even madagascar for craziness well you shall judge for yourselves there was little sign of it during the two days i was in lees camp and as i compared the tales id heard with what i was now seeing for myself i wondered if perhaps the taipings hadnt been grossly misrepresented by imp and foreign propagandists that they were savage and bloodthirsty i knew from the journey up but what oriental army is not they were no mere barbarian horde though but a splendidlydisciplined force far more formidable than we had imagined as for their lunacy id spoken with one of their great men and found him sane and intelligent enough if a bit of a zealot very well their heavenly king might be a barmy recluse with odd notions of christianity but it all seemed a far cry from the days when the early wangs or princes had been as crazy as he was and went about calling themselves kings of the east west north and south and murdering each other right and left the titles of their successors were undoubtedly odd shield king and assistant king and heroic king and cockeyed king but if their loyal prince general lee was anything to go by they were businesslike enough so i reasoned and the shock was all the more unexpected when it came we went into nanking on the second afternoon lee borne in a chair of state by taiping stalwarts was magnificent in yellow robes and satin boots wearing a gold crown in the shape of a tiger with ruby eyes and pearl teeth and carrying a jade sceptre this he explained was ceremonial dress for a council of all the wangs who would deliberate on what should be done now that the imps had been driven from the yangtse valley like marching on shanghai no doubt we made a brave procession with a company of redcoat spearmen marching ahead singing who would true valour see in chinese and damnably offkey and in the rear a squadron of mounted bowmen in backsandbreasts mighty smart id noted that the taipings had comparatively few handguns but artillery by the park i rode a tartar pony beside lees chair so that he could point out such objects of interest as the distant ming tombs one of the wonders of ancient china and the huge siegeworks from which the imps had been expelled two weeks earlier massive entrenchments bigger than anything i saw later in the civil war or in france in and filled now with thousands upon thousands of decaying corpses raked together from the battlefields which extended for miles around the stench was appalling even with armies of coolies burying for dear life with quicklime by the cartload lee said it was nothing to when the river was so solid with corpses that boat traffic had had to he suspended nanking lies on the yangtse bank girdled by hills and long before we reached it we could see those famous beetling walls sixty feet high and forty thick which enclose the city in a great triangle twenty miles about its one of the finest cities in china today but when wed passed through the long tunnel at the south gate i was shocked to find myself gazing on a scene of ruin and desolation the suburb had been razed flat and was swarming with crowds of miserablelooking serfs labouring at nothing so far as i could see under the direction of taiping troops starving beggars everywhere ragged children played among the potholed streets and piles of rubble all was foul muddy stinking squalor any doubts i might have had about the social nature of the taiping revolution were dispelled in the next hour the great kingdom of heavenly peace obviously consisted of two classes the state and the populace who were the states slaves everyone you see must work according to his capacity but he aint paid how does he feed and clothe himself you ask he has no money since it and all his valuables and property have been confiscated by the state but there are no shops anyway since all is rationed and distributed by the state he is thus free of all care and responsibility and can give his mind to work and absorbing the precepts decrees and heavenly thoughts of the tien wang or heavenly king and if the rations are shorter and the work harder and the laws more savage than under the evil imps well theres a good time coming and he can take comfort in the knowledge that what is happening to him is correct the foul old system has given way to heavenly peace and while the baskets of heads are even more numerous than in shanghai and theres no lack of malefactors crawling about in wooden collars placarded with their offences well theres a certain tranquillity about that too at least every manjack had his wooden token with the heavenly seal on it to prove his existence and to use as a passport in and out of the city what happened to anyone who lost his token i dont care to think but if the folk were ground down in misery the military were riding high and no mistake i recall one splendid figure in crimson coat and hood marking a subordinate wang mounted on a mule and attended by three skinny urchins carrying his sword his flag and his umbrella all three i was informed aspired to being tajens some day like their master with power of life and death over all despised civilians such as another urchin sitting naked in the gutter offering stones for sale i was so bemused by this that i bought one amidst the laughter of lees retinue only later did it occur to me that it must be a state stone which the little bugger had no right to be selling presumably he probably owns half nanking by now its pleasant to think that i may have founded his commercial career lee didnt seem to notice the filth and poverty of the state hed been extolling to me two days earlier but he drew my attention to the incessant drum and gong signals booming across that muddy desolation and to the fluttering coloured flags on the walls relaying messages to the central watchtower ahead all was efficiency and discipline where the military were concerned with battalions of redcoats chanting at their drill and there were thousands of offduty taipings sauntering among the coolie crowds i reckon every fourth man was a soldier which explains why the slave population voiced no audible discontent all this was plainly the progress work and improvement to say nothing of the sacred right of human liberty which lee had described to me now i beheld proof of his benign enlightened democratic government as the ruins gave way to the splendid new palaces and offices being built in the city centre for the wangs and their favoured subordinates we passed through broad wellkept streets flanked by magnificent yellow walls with lofty minarets and towers beyond tiled in red and green and lavishly decorated extensive gardens were being laid out by coolies hard at it with mattocks and spades scaffolding clung to the new buildings like spiders webs and great loads of brick and paint and timber and tile were everywhere to be seen the place was humming like a beehive well thinks i if this is the revolution im all for it to remind everyone of what a bloody good idea it all was every other street corner had an official orator reading out his heavenly majestys poems and meditations to rapt crowds of soldiers and officials and a few hangdog peasants all no doubt reflecting what fine transcendental stuff the monarch was turning out these days the grand palace of glory and light says lee as our cavalcade turned a corner the earthly residence of the tien wang and i had to admit that it laid over everything we had seen before there was a fortyfoot yellow wall emblazoned with ferocious dragons and hung with yellow silk scrolls of his majestys ghastly poems in vermilion ink a vast gilded gateway guarded by cannon and splendidlycaparisoned sentries with matchlocks and through the gate you caught a glimpse of the palace itself a halfcompleted monstrosity of minarets and peaked roofs tiled in every conceivable hue with dragon designs and silken banners and revolting chinese statuary it must have covered acres and was slightly more grandiose than the taj mahal if in more questionable taste there was even an enormous granite boat to commemorate the heavenly kings arrival in the city in the real boat was rotting in a shed round the hack we dismounted before a low wall dividing the length of the street the quality use the palace side and the rabble tother and if the latter stray the guards beat em to pulp in the name of democracy lee led the way through the gate and then through a series of courts and gardens of dwarf shrubs discoursing as he went and it was now that i got the unexpected shock i mentioned earlier for after some commonplace remarks about the building he suddenly says in describing this as his majestys earthly residence i do not imply any earthly term to his existence he is as you know immortal but a time will come when he decides to take up permanent abode in paradise as it is he makes frequent visits there in his dragon chariot for discussions with god of late his wife has accompanied him on these excursions to heaven and conversed with the heavenly father and the elder brother jesus i wondered if id misheard or if he was speaking symbolically or even with irony but he wasnt he went on conversationally it is a gratifying demonstration of the ordained equality of the sexes in the heavenly kingdom that the heavenly kings consort enters so fully on his affairs it was she you know who received the divine command that henceforth the tien wang should devote himself to meditation apart from such duties as annotating the book of revelation so that he may be fully prepared to take his place with the junior lord his son in paradise and sit with god and the elder brother i see seemed the best response with which to cover my sheer amazement and alarm until now this apparently normal young man had spoken sanely and rationally and here suddenly without a gleam in his eye or foam on his lips he was talking the most outrageous balderdash i knew that from all accounts the heavenly king was as mad as a senile sapper but this was one of his foremost generals could he conceivably believe this bilge about dragon chariots and teteatetes with the almighty with mrs heavenly king going along presumably to help with the service of tea and ginger biscuits hesitantly and in the hope of receiving an answer that would restore my faith in lees sanity i inquired how old his heavenly majesty might be and when he could be expected to go aloft permanently so to speak i was a fool to ask in earthly terms says lee placidly he is fortyseven but in fact he was born out of the belly of gods first wife before heaven and earth existed how else could he have observed all the events of the old testament and jesus christs descent to earth before deciding to manifest himself in as to when he will sit with the heavenly family permanently and shine on all lands and oceans we cannot tell the heavenly south gate will open one day in the meantime we must all fight valiantly for eternal glory theres no doubt of that says i was he having me on or did he simply repeat this moonshine because it wasnt safe to do otherwise its hard enough to read a chinamans thoughts but i had a horrible feeling he meant every word of it dear god were they all non compos mentis he left me with these uncomfortable thoughts in a small outer palace with an escorting officer while he went in to the wang council and no doubt to hear an account of what theyd had for luncheon in heaven yesterday nor did my surroundings do anything to quiet my fears we were in a fairly filthy audience chamber decorated with the crudest kind of drawings gilded lanterns and tatty flags and bunting presided over by a grinning young imbecile who was plainly far gone with opium which i remembering that it was a capital offence thought odd until i learned that he was the acting prime minister the son of the prince of praise he wore a filthy silk robe and a big embroidered dragon hat with a little bird on top and was surrounded by officials there was also a halfcompany of troops posted round the hall filthy slovenly brutes quite unlike the smart taipings of lees camp my guiding officer presented me to this beauty who giggled vacantly invited me in a slurred stuttering voice to pass into the diningroom next door apologised for having no strong drink to offer me and at the same time reached under his table and handed me out a bottle of london gin i declined courteously and passed the time studying a great wall map of the world or rather of the entire territory of the heavenly kingdom to endure for a myriad myriad years it showed china as a perfect square with nanking in the middle but no sign of pekin japan was a speck britain and france small blobs in the top corner and a smear to one side proved to be the state of the flowery flag or usa to you the rest of the world had apparently been suppressed by heavenly decree there was a great inner arch from the chamber and through it across an open court could be glimpsed the gateway to the inner palace with sacred heavenly door inscribed above and two enormous painted dragons one eating the sun and the other pursuing a shrimp i was pondering the mystical meaning of this when a most unholy din broke out from the inner palace guns firing drums rolling cymbals clashing and across the courtyard passed a procession of women bearing steaming golden dishes in at the sacred heavenly door this says my escort was the signal that the heavenly king was going to dinner drawn by women in his dragon chariot the guns and drums would continue until he had finished i asked if we could go in for a peep and he looked shocked only the thousand women attending his heavenly majesty are permitted in the inner palace says he the presence of men except for the wangs and certain great ones would disturb his constant labour of writing decrees revising the scriptures and conceiving new precepts if we are privileged we may presently hear the result of his mornings meditation sure enough hed barely finished speaking when trumpets blared from the inner palace gateway and across the court came the most stunning chinese girl all in green silk and carrying a golden tray with a yellow silk scroll the bearer of heavenly decrees cries my chap eagerly and he and every soul in our audience chamber dropped to his knees yelling ten thousand years ten thousand years the only exceptions being the ignorant foreigner flashy who stood admiring the approaching beauty and the deputy prime minister who fell flat on his face and was sick the bearer of heavenly decrees sashayed in like the queen of sheba unrolled her scroll glanced round superciliously and in a high singsong voice read out the heavenly kings last thought before luncheon it was a decree announcing that since his birthday fell next week all the senior wangs might take another ten wives in addition to the eleven they had already while lesser wangs would have their ration increased from six to nine the public were not mentioned thunderous applause greeted this announcement and the bearer of heavenly decrees handed her scroll to a grovelling minion smiled graciously shot me another reproving look and made her stately way back to the palace twitching her shimmering rump as she went observing this and reflecting on the new decree which all present were hailing with enthusiasm i made a mental salute to the taiping rebellion like all revolutionary movements it was plainly designed to ensure the rulers an abundance of fleshpot while convincing the ruled that austerity was good for the soul but barring the papists i couldnt think of a regime that had the business so nicely in hand as this one needless to say i kept the thought to myself although i couldnt resist trying to draw lee gently when he came to bear me off to dinner at his own palace apologising that it wasnt completed yet in spite of the efforts of a thousand coolies who were slaving like beavers on it i remarked that it was a fine system where the workers were content to live like pigs while providing their rulers with luxury and not getting a penny piece for it he just shrugged and says you english believe in paying for work we know better are we not a great empire it wasnt even cynical just a plain philosophy like his apparently sincere religious lunacy and left me wondering harder than ever about him his was a modest enough spread a mere gold and white bijou residence set in two or three acres of magnificent garden with fantasticallydressed boys and girls swarming round us like gilded butterflies and ushering us to a charming little pavilion surrounded by a miniature rock and tree garden here a tiny child in yellow silk was waiting on the steps and i was taken right aback when he bowed held out a hand to me and says in perfect english good afternoon sir i recovered enough to say well hollo yourself young shaver and see how you like it and at that there was a burst of laughter from the pavilion and out comes a jollylooking chinese all portliness in a rather faded blue dragon robe he patted the lad on the head and gave me an inclination that was halfnod halfbow my dear sir says he you remind me that my own english is too correct and that if my son is to master the language he must go to school to you he chuckled and lifted the boy up in a muscular arm eh young shaver this was astonishing but now lee came up and presented me reciting the titles of the stout party who stood listening with a quizzy grin founder of the dynasty loyal chief of staff upholder of heaven adjudicator of the court of discipline and former secretary of the artisans christmas club at hong kong cries the stout chap merrily his excellency hung jenkan first minister of the heavenly kingdom concluded lee and i realised that this cheery plumpfaced man bouncing the child on his shoulder was the power behind the throne the reputed brain of the taiping second only to the tien wang himself they were setting out the best crockery for flashy werent they just as lee ushered us into the pavilion i was trying to remember what id heard of jenkan that hed spent his life mostly in protestant missions that he was the heavenly kings cousin but had taken no part in the revolution until a year ago when hed turned up suddenly at nanking since then hed risen like a rocket to supreme marshal i wondered how lee and the other wangs felt about being so suddenly outstripped four little tables one apiece had been set out for dinner in the pavilion the small boy addressed me airing his english ceremoniously helped me to my place and jenkan grinning with proud delight winked at me a thing id never seen a chinese do before forgive my son says he but to speak english to an englishman is for him a dream come true i encourage him for without english how can he hope to reap the benefit of western education which is the best in the world every child in china must learn english he added gravely if only so that they may understand the jokes in punch and he roared with laughter shaking in his chair it was extraordinary from a chinese but as i soon learned jenkan was an extraordinary man he knew the world and had his feet on the ground the bright brown eyes which vanished in the fat goodnatured face when he laughed were deep and shrewd and he thought more like a westerner than any oriental i ever knew heres one that matters i thought listening as he gassed nonstop mostly in chinese for lees benefit but now and then forgetting himself into english with splutters of mirth lee sat impassive being the perfect host inviting me to dishes deprecating the food which was superb i may say it came in nine little petalshaped dishes to each table the petals fitting together to form a perfect rose as the meal progressed no chopsticks either but sheffield knives and silver forks and spoons several of the dishes were western in politeness to me i fancy there was wine in gold cups held in enamelled silver cases sherry if you please from bottles with wrapped paper plugs instead of corks i had thought liquor was forbidden in the taiping jenkan pealed with mirth so it is but i told the tien wang if i cannot drink i cannot eat so he gave me a special dispensation unlike this lawbreaker and he nodded at lee who surveyed him in silence and poured more sherry when the meal was done and the servants had brought hot chinese wine and cheroots jenkan nodded to his son who rose bowed to me and piped sir i take my leave charmed by your conversation and by the courtesy with which you have tolerated my clumsy attempts at your glorious language my son says i you speak it a dam a great deal better than most english boys twice your age at which he shot his father a delighted glance before composing himself and marching out jenkan proudly watched him go sighed contentedly bit a cheroot glanced at lee and then at me business thinks i and braced myself sure enough lee asked if i had given thought to what hed said at our first meeting what was the likely british reaction to a taiping march on shanghai i was starting to say that as a humble traveller from the london missionary society i could only speculate when jenkan broke in we can dispense with that sir harry he chuckled at my expression of dismay if mr bruce wishes his intelligence chief to pass incognito he should choose one whose likeness has not appeared so frequently in the picture papers i acquit him of trying to impose on us but he should remember that the illustrated london news may not be unknown in pekin now may i say how delighted i am to make your acquaintance i have been an admirer for years ever since you dismissed felix pilch and mynn in was it not he beamed jovially on this reminder of how englified he was and since there was no use beating about i shrugged modestly and he put his elbows on the table western fashion good now we can talk plainly the loyal prince has already given you reasons why you should welcome us at shanghai this may have led you to suppose that our arrival depends on britains attitude it does not we shall come when we are ready in august with or without british approval he drew on his cheroot regarding me benevolently obviously we hope for it and i am confident that when mr bruce realises that our occupation is inevitable he will decide to welcome it he will he in no doubt of our invincibility once you have reported to him you have seen our army and you will observe it in action when the loyal prince goes presently to expel the imps from soochow that was uncomfortable news but i didnt let on mr bruce will see that our final victory over the manchoos is only a matter of time and that opposition from britain at shanghai would be not only futile but impolitic you will also inform him that as an earnest of good will to her majestys government our first act in shanghai will be to place an order worth one million dollars for twenty armed steamships which will greatly hasten the destruction of the imperial forces he studied a moment like a man who wonders if hes left out anything and gave me his fattest smile well sir harry so there it was the big stick and a carrot and my mission dead and buried for plainly no persuasion of mine was going to keep the taipings away from shanghai all bruces diplomatic stepdancing would be wasted on these fellows they said and they would do unless it was bluff in which case counterbluff might be in order i ran cold sweat at the thought knowing that what i said next might alter the history of china god what napoleon would have given to be in my shoes and how i wished he was im obliged to your excellency says i but do you think it wise to take britains reaction for granted i dont cries he cheerfully whether you welcome or oppose us we shall have shanghai mildly he added the loyal princes army will number not fewer than fifty thousand men fifty thousand men whove never met british or french regulars says i equally mildly not diplomatic i agree but i aint partial to having the law laid down to me by fat chaps with yellow faces this one just smiled and shook his head come sir harry a mere token garrison mr bruce could not resist us even if he wished which i am persuaded he does not well that was gods truth but i had to play it out for what it was worth i gave him my trueblue stare possibly sir but if youre wrong there exists a possibility that youll find yourselves at war with great britain bruce would have swooned to hear me why this was lee sharp and intense his lean face strained why what can it profit england to fight against fellow christians how can loyal prince jenkan raised a plump finger our guest knows his people better than you do so with respect do i and they are the last i should try to persuade in normal circumstances but the circumstances are not normal sir harry he came back to me shanghai is not a british city it is the emperors and you are he smiled apologetically only his tenants in an upstairs room your lives and property will be safe from us indeed your traders will enjoy a freedom unknown under the manchoos he grinned a fat mans satisfied grin you will welcome us britain does not want another war in china certainly not with a regime that offers milliondollar contracts when did the manchoos promise as much they dont even like your opium i waited until his laughter had subsided well sir if thats the message im to take to mr bruce yes but not yet he wagged a finger in august in view of what you have said it may be better if mr bruce has short notice of our intention we dont wish him to have too much time to think and possibly commit some indiscretion he beamed shamelessly i am quite frank you see no in august you will go back to shanghai with a taiping army two days behind you that will surely inspire mr bruce to a wise decision and we shall be in good time before lord elgin reaches pekin to conclude a treaty committing him to the losing side all things considered he may well decide not to go to pekin at all he sat there a chinese pickwick smacking his lips over his hot wine while i weighed the essential point you mean im a prisoner here a guest until august two months perhaps it will be a most pleasant holiday i am selfish enough to look forward to it mr bruce may wonder what has become of you but he will hardly inquire after a mere traveller from the london missionary society oh he was a right twinkling bastard this one and you may take satisfaction that you are performing the duty he laid on you of keeping the taipings away from shanghai for the present that gave me a horrid start but he went on amiably he will be able to pursue his policy of strict neutrality until august until then we shall be doing what he wants he will be doing what we want it is very satisfactory he was right of course if bruce knew the taipings were dead set on shanghai hed have time to reinforce perhaps even send for grant lull him with inaction and when the blow fell in august hed have no choice but to submit to taiping occupation although whether wed accept that quite as tamely as jenkan supposed i was by no means sure one thing was plain there wasnt a ghost of a chance of my escaping to warn bruce ahead of the fair not that i had the least inclination you understand i knew when i was well off and would be well content to wallow for a few weeks in the luxuries of the revolution of these there was no shortage at the pavilion to which lee conducted me after jenkan had gone jovial to the last it was another bijou palace surrounded by dwarf gardens and belonged to lees brother a genial nonentity who was learning to write i remember labouring away at scrolls with a tutor the apartments i was given were in exquisite taste i recall the pink jadewriting set and inkwell the sprig of coral mounted on a silver block with gold pencils thrust through the branches the tiny crystal paperweights on the gleaming walnut desk the fact that i remember such things is proof that i was feeling pretty easy at the prospect of my captivity i should have known better lee hadnt said a word beyond courtesies after our meeting with jenkan but i sensed an unease in him and wondered why it was fairly plain that he disliked the prime minister jealously and id no doubt that behind the scenes some very pretty clawing went on among the wangs in which i might conceivably be a useful pawn there was no plumbing that and since taiping interest seemed to require my health and happiness i didnt care much but i could see lee was anxious and when he took leave of me that night he finally came out with it in our discussion with his excellency i sensed correct me if i am mistaken that you are not wholly convinced of our ultimate success we were alone on the verandah in the warm evening shadows and as he turned those cold eyes on me i felt a prickle of disquiet i do not ask for a political judgment you understand but for a military opinion you have seen the imps you have seen us do you believe we shall win there was only one politic answer and since it was what i believed pretty much i spoke straight out barring accidents youre bound to id not wager on the imps thats certain he considered this but you do not say that victory is assured beyond all doubt it never is but any soldier can see when the odds are in his favour i can see more the yellowrobed figure seemed to grow more erect and his voice was hard i know we shall win well then it doesnt matter what i think but it does says he mighty sharp it matters what you tell mr bruce so that was the pinch ill tell mr bruce what ive just told you i assured him i believe hell have every confidence in your success i nearly added provided you leave shanghai alone and dont provoke the foreign devils but decided not to confidence says he slowly is not faith i could wish you had absolute faith he was a fanatic of course you can put more trust in my confidence says i lightly faith aint a matter of counting guns and divisions he gave me another keen look but left it there and id forgotten all about it by the time i turned in i was pleased to see that taiping luxury didnt stop short of the bedroom door theyd given me a cool spacious chamber with screens onto the garden and a great soft bed with red silk mattress and pillows all that was lacking was the bearer of heavenly decrees i wondered dreamily as i dropped off if lees brother being a lesser wang would care to rent out one of the new wives hed just been awarded or all three and i could give him confidential reports on endurance ingenuity and carnal appetite flashy riding examiner gold medal nanking exhibition a pretty thought on which i slid into a delightful dream in which the bearer of heavenly decrees appeared as identical triplets who came gliding into the room in green silk dresses and steelchain collars bearing scrolls on golden trays ranging themselves beside my bed and smiling alluringly down at me i was just debating whether to tackle em one at a time or all three together when i realised that i couldnt see their faces any longer for they were all three wearing black hoods which seemed deuced odd and the green dresses were gone too under black cloaks i came awake an instant too late to scream the black figures seemed to swoop down on me steel fingers were on my mouth and wrists a heavy cloth was whipped over my head and i was dragged helpless from the bed by invisible hands theres no blind terror to compare with it being hustled along lurching and stumbling by invisible attackers youre lost blind and halfsuffocated you can feel the cruelty in the clutching hands horrible pain and dissolution await you and the only thing worse is the moment when the blanket comes off which mine did before my assailants had taken twenty strides there was a yell and a clash of steel a buffeting shock as my captors staggered and i was crashing to earth dragging the blanket away to find myself rolling in a flowerbed with one of my kidnappers clawing at me in the dark i shrieked as i caught the flash of steel in the halflight and then the knifepoint was beneath my chin and i was shuddering still whispering entreaties for my life it aint the best position to view a fatal mкlйe that is going on a few yards away with dark figures slashing and swearing in the shadows i heard one horrid gurgle as a blade went home caught the glittering arc of a curved sword swinging and the grating ring of the parry but for the most part they fought in silence then the blanket was over my head again and i was being rushed along barking my shins and trying to yell for help until they pulled up a voice hissed walk in chinese and i felt the prick of the point again in my spine this time i walked how far we went i cant guess but it must have been a good quarter of a mile before i felt paved stones under my feet and presently was aware of bright light outside the blanket and the sound of hushed voices i was hustled up a few steps and then there was carpet under my bare soles we stopped the knife was removed and the gripping hands were withdrawn i didnt stir but stood shrouded and quaking for a good five minutes when i was pushed forward again over tiles and then on to another carpet the blanket was whipped away and i stood blinking in bright light facing me breathing with an agitation to equal my own although my bosom could never have heaved like hers stood the bearer of heavenly decrees just for a moment i wondered if i was dreaming but she was fullyclad so it seemed unlikely deuced fetching for all that in a blue silk gown such as the manchoo ladies wear in which there are three or four skirts of varying lengths with huge hanging sleeves and her hair done up in high buns she was one of your roundfaced chinese beauties and none the worse for that but my attention was distracted by the blackcowled figured at my elbow throwing back his hood and i found myself gaping at general lee hsiuchen i apologise it was necessary says he and i wasted no time in babbled questions hed tell me what he wanted me to know he was breathing hard and i saw a trickle of blood on the back of his hand he nodded to the girl and she walked away to a curtained arch at the end of the short carpeted passage in which we stood she waited there head averted and lee spoke rapidly getting his breath back you are to be granted audience of the heavenly king it is a highly unusual honour few foreigners have seen him for many years he understands that you are from the london missionary society say nothing of how you came here listen to him he smiled an odd dreamy smile that sent chills up my back yes listen to him do not be surprised if he talks all night he does not tire as mortals do he gestured me towards the archway and as i approached the bearer of heavenly decrees turned and held out a red silk robe i was in the sarong i wear in bed slipping it over my shoulders then she pulled back the curtains beckoning me to follow the heavy smell of incense struck my nostrils as i saw we were in a small low chamber hung round with dragon silks at the far end was a deep divan caught in a pool of light from two tall candlebranches and on it reclined a short stocky figure in white silk embroidered in gold he was nodding sleepily in that jossladen air while a female voice recited high and clear the heavenly father the elder brother the heavenly king and the junior lord shall be lords forever the heavenly kingdom is established everywhere and the effulgence of the heavenly family is spread upon all the earth for all eternity the voice stopped and the bearer of heavenly decrees rustled forward dropped to her knees halfway to the divan kowtowed several times and addressed the chap on the couch i caught the words london missionary society and then she was hurrying back to me motioning me forward indicating that i too should kowtow well the hell with him heavenly king or not i walked forward and got a close look at him as i began to make a halfbow a tubby little chink with long dark hair framing a round amiable face a short sandy beard and great dark eyes that shone in his pasty face like a hypnotists but with none of the force of your professional mesmeriser they were placid dreamy eyes friendly and kind and what the devil was i doing kowtowing i jumped up vexed and the big eyes smiled sleepily holding mine so that was his secret you couldnt help looking at him with an effort i tore my glance away and realised that we were not alone and i can pay no higher tribute to the tien wangs magnetic personality than to say that only now did i notice those others present one was kneeling on the couch holding a scroll from which she had been reading she wore a towering gilt headdress like a pagoda and a little fringe of gold threads round her hips that was all her attire and out of deference to royalty i modestly lowered my eyes and found myself contemplating another naked female reclining at my feet one more step and id have trod on her buttocks i halfstarted back afraid to look in case there were more bare houris perched on the candelabra but there were just the two twins by the look of them still as superblyshaped statues lovely faces intent on the man on the couch and apparently unaware of my existence reluctantly i looked back at him and he smiled vacantly welcome in the peace of god says he and indicated a silken stool by the couch it was a deep liquid voice with a curious husky quality i sat uncomfortably aware that the reclining poppet was only inches from my foot and that if i looked straight ahead my horizon was voluptuously filled by the charms of the kneeling nymph its hell in the taiping you know not that i bar contemplating the undraped female form but theres a time and a place and heaven knew what id interrupted i wondered if these were two of his reputed eightyeight wives or if he too had been voted a few spares next week being his birthday and all good heavens was it possible one of them was for me i didnt like to ask and i didnt get the chance for he fixed me with those luminous empty eyes and his melancholy smile and began to speak to me my heart was hammering what with the knowledge that this was the tien wang the chinese messiah one of the most powerful men on earth and that what passed between us might be vital bruces instructions my mission that and the nearness of those mouthwatering little fleshtraps dyou wonder i was sweating it was like a wild dream the sweet husky voice pausing every now and then as though to compel an answer the blindly shining eyes the heavy reek of incense the silk edges of the stool hot under my hands the satin gleam of bums bellies and boobies in the candleshine the soft lunatic babble which id not believe if i didnt remember every word tien wang the london missionary society ah yes but i do not remember you only dr sylvester my dear old friend flashy ah yes your majesty sylvester to be sure tw dr sylvester how long how long f couple of months perhaps tw you have spoken with dr sylvester recently then you are greatly blessed for you have made the journey i felicitate you f sorry tw the journey to the celestial above i too have spoken with dr sylvester in heaven since his earthly death in soon the portals will open for us all and we shall rest in the divine halls of eternal peace have you visited heaven often f not to say often nothing like your majesty weekends that sort of thing just to see sylvester really oh god tw how well i recall his discourse illuminating constructive wise f absolutely couldnt get enough of it tw his humanity was equalled only by his scholarship was there a fruit of learning that he had not plucked divinity philosophy theology metaphysics f tits no i mean metaphysics geometry anything he knew it all tw soon we shall join him when we have made the final journey but only after long and laborious struggle when you first visited heaven were you given new bowels f eh oh no no i wasnt i wasnt considered worthy you see your majesty not then not for new bowels tw take heart i too was rebuked when i first entered the golden doors jesus my elder brother was angry because i had not learned my bible lessons well he was correct we must all learn our bible f moab is my washpot over edom will i cast out my shoe er genesis exodus leviticus thing tw i remember how kind jesuss wife was and when my heart and entrails had been removed i was given new ones of shining red f red eh tw and god gave me a sword to exterminate demons and a seal of authority the demons transformed themselves eighteen times as they have power to do f yes yes eighteen shocking tw but i drove them down to hell and the heavenly mother gave me fruits and sweets as i ate them marvelling at their savour god traced the devils misdeeds to errors in confucius and rebuked him but confucius defended himself vehemently f he did did he tw then jesus and the angels joined in against confucius who tried to sneak away to join the devil yenlo but he was caught and brought back and beaten but at last god allowed him to sit in heaven in recognition of past merits f well tw yenlo is the serpentdevil of the garden of eden f is he ah tw and when eve heeded his words she was driven forth and her children were drowned in the great rain but yenlo seeks ever to steal mens souls ensnaring their senses with beautiful temptations there were beautiful handmaidens in heaven this seemed to give him an idea for the husky voice which had been droning away as at a lesson learned trailed off and he turned to stare at the splendid naked nymph kneeling beside him it was the first sign of intelligence id seen in him for he was plainly madder than bedlam his mouth twitched and he came up from his reclining position to gape and then to reach out and fondle her neck and shoulder and arm she stayed stockstill he leaned closer gaping and i had to strain to hear we must strive to discern false beauty from true he muttered and manfully resist yenlo seeking solace only in that which is pure so we should study the book of one hundred correct things let us hear now how we may resist temptation id have thought it was the last thing he needed to hear just then but it was evidently a cue for the kneeling beauty came to life with a sudden shudder that caused his heavenly majesty to grunt alarmingly and gape wider than ever she lifted her scroll and began to read in a shrill breathless little voice temptation must be eradicated from the world and from the human mind by sight by scent by touch may temptation be aroused temptation is caused by the original sin of lust in the beginning of the world well no one was going to argue with that least of all flashy grinding his teeth or the tien wang staring and hanging on every word so to speak then he lay back with a gentle groan as she leaned forward over him reading rapturously temptation results from indecision as a homeless person wanders seeking relief so the unstable mind is always subject to temptation which beguiles the senses of the unwary or her voice sank to a whisper those who lack the power of decision she sighed convulsively no doubt at the pathos of the thing and with difficulty i restrained a sharp cry the tien wang on the other hand emitted a low percolating sound staring up at them like one who lacked the power of decision but would get round to it presently a mind lured by temptation will deteriorate from day to day whispers the reading girl soulfully and shook her pagoda which tinkled conscience will perish ah beware when conscience perishes for then then lust will grow there was much in what she said as the veins standing out on my bulging forehead testified shed been practically suffocating him but now she straightened up rolling her scroll and his majesty gave a little whimper and reached up a pawing hand at the same moment the female at my feet stirred gliding up to rest her arms on the divan blast her her hand straying on to his knee he gaped vacantly at her going red in the face and breathing with difficulty looked back at the reading girl who was opening another scroll and began to growl whether it was possible for his mind to deteriorate any further was doubtful but plainly conscience was about to perish as lust grows and conscience dies the devil will seize his opportunity croons the reading hussy and i contemplated her twins alabaster bottom poised within easy reach and wondered if i dared play the devil myself in the nick of time i recalled that this panting idiot on the couch was the monster who had slaughtered millions and took heads off for adultery god knew what he did to molesters of the heavenly harem i bit my knuckles instead watching helpless as the reader reached her peroration the brute was dazedly pawing at her with one hand while the other clutched at her twin who seemed to be trying to climb into his lap suddenly the reading girl flung aside her scroll and lunged down at him babbling suppress temptation throw out evil cleanse the heart so the felicity of paradise will be won everyone shall conquer temptation and having thus strengthened himself will be able to attack the small demons universal peace will follow and ive no doubt it did to judge by the gasps and sobs and rhythmic pagoda tinklings which pursued me as i fled atiptoe for the archway well it would have been damned bad form to stay and i swear to god i couldnt have not without committing the fearful lиsemajestй of plunging into the mкlйe crying me too not that theyd have noticed probably the women were ecstatics and as for that lecherous lunatic with his crimson bowels and visits to heaven well aside from being the starkest maniac id ever struck he was also a damned poor host and he had inspired the taiping rebellion it passed belief but he did and if you doubt one word of his conversation with me or his concubines recitation youll find every last syllable of them in scholarly works written about him by learned men all except about dr sylvester for whom i believe im the sole authority and that youll allow was the sanest part of it no he was a raving dangerous dreadful madman and one of the most diabolical powers ever loosed on a suffering world flung hsiu chuan the coolie king as to his depravity in my eyes his one redeeming quality ive told my tale and you may put it in the balance between those who claim he was a celibate saint and tothers who say he was topsides with tiberius ill add only that no one disputes that he lived surrounded by a thousand women eightyeight of em wives and devil a thought for his guests i emerged in the corridor panting like the town bull to find the bearer of heavenly decrees wideeyed and palpitating anxiously by george shell never know how close she came to being dragged off and ravished but here was lee pale and eager you saw him he spoke with you what did he say he gripped my arm in his excitement and i had sense enough to take time to reply general lee says i gulping ive never seen or heard the like in my life he let out a hissing breath and then smiled slowly i knew it i knew it he is like god is he not hes certainly like nothing on earth says i and caught a drift of tantalising perfume from the bearer of heavenly decrees who had edged up all eyes and ears i gritted my teeth and tried not to notice her dye mind sending her away says i hoarsely after such an experience i find her presence distracting he snapped a word and she sped off undulating in a way which brought sweat to my temples i can see you are much moved says lee gently it was inevitable but i am uplifted beyond all expression he fairly glowed with holy zeal for now that you have seen him you too have faith it didnt sink in for a moment dyou mean to say i croaked that was why you had me brought just to see him i gaped at the man in gods name did you have to kidnap me id have gone willingly if youd there was no time to explain it was necessary to be secret and sudden as you saw i had learned that there were those who would have kept you from his presence if they could fortunately they failed but who were they why see here i might have had my throat cut by those swine whoever it does not matter now for you have seen him in his divinity and now you too believe he studied my face for you do believe do you not by god i do cries i fervently what i believed i wasnt about to tell him which was that his heavenly king and the whole kitboodle of them were cracked beyond repair id have a line report to give bruce if ever i got out of their demented clutches i shook my head like a man awestruck general lee says i solemnly i am in your debt you have opened my eyes to the full no he has done that says he looking like joan of arc now you can tell your people what manner of being leads the taiping they will share your faith he nodded content and i can go to soochow and later to shanghai with a quiet mind whatever my enemies may wish they cannot undo what has been done for you tonight amen says i and on that he said that henceforth i could slay at his brothers place in perfect safety for now id seen the heavenly king no one would molest me i assured him again that it had been the biggest thing in my life and because im cursed with curiosity i asked him general you have been privileged to see the heavenly king countless times tell me does he usually receive visitors alone or does he have er attendants with him ile frowned and then slowly shook his head whenever i have stood in his divine presence says he i have never been aware of any but him which suggested either that i had caught his majesty off duty so to speak or that his faithful followers were so besotted with worship that they didnt notice or didnt care when naked trollops climbed all over him some damned odd cabinet meetings they must have had one thing was sure they didnt call lee the loyal prince for nothing now ive told you plain at some length of my first day and night in nanking because theres no better way of showing you what the taiping was like and in the two long months i was with them everything i saw merely went to confirm that first impression i saw much of their city of their crazy laws and crazier religion of the might and ruthlessness of the military of the blossoming incompetence of their topheavy administration of the abyss between the despotic luxuriating rulers and the miserable slave populace in this glorious revolution dedicated to equality its all in my dawns and departures of a soldiers life and aint to the point here enough to say that i recognised the taiping as a power that bade fair to engulf china and was already mad and rotten at the heart dont mistake me i dont preach you know my morals and ideals and you wont find the archbishop shopping for em in a hurry but i know right from wrong as perhaps only a scoundrel can and ill say that there was great virtue in the notion of taiping if it hadnt somehow been jarred sideways and become a perversion so that the farther it went the farther it ran off the true one thing i knew i would tell bruce the manchoos might be a corrupt unsavoury awkward crew but we mustnt touch this ship of fools with a bargepole not even if the alternative was to go to war with them and that was a daunting thought for the one thing right about the taiping was its army i saw that for myself when lee took me to soochow the last big imp foothold in the yangtse valley about thirty miles south of nanking and one hundred and fifty from shanghai it was a strong place with heavy fortifications on white dragon hill and as soon as i saw them i put lee down privately as a bungler who must have been lucky until now for hed brought hardly a gun with him twenty thousand good infantry marching like guardsmen and chanting their warsongs transport and commissariat as fine as you could wish for the whole advance perfectly conducted but when i looked at those crenellated walls with the imp gunners blazing away long before our vanguard came in range and the paper tigers and devil banners being waved from ramparts crowded with men well its your infantry youll be wasting thinks i how long a siege did he anticipate i asked him and he smiled quietly and says my banner will be on white dragon hill within three hours and it was he told me later he had close on three hundred infiltrators inside the walls disguised as imp soldiers theyd been at work with friendly citizens and at the given time two of the gates were blown open from within and the taiping infantry just rolled in like a wave ive never seen the like those long ranks of red coats simply thundered forward changing formation as they went into two hammerheads that engulfed the gates up went the black death banners and heedless of the storm of shot that met them those howling devils surged into the city and carried all before them the battle lasted perhaps an hour and then the imps wisely changed sides and they and the taipings sacked the place slaughtering and looting wholesale i wasnt inside the walls until next day by which time it was a smoking bloodstained ruin if there was a living citizen left he wasnt walking about i can tell you nothing can withstand the might of the tien wang says lee and i thought god help shanghai i realised then that my soldiering had been of the genteel polite variety wellmannered actions like cawnpore and balaclava and the kabul retreat in which at least the occasional prisoner was taken in china the idea of war is to kill everything that stirs and burn everything that dont just that i was a week at soochow with lee and then he sent me back to nanking to ponder and count the weeks till my release i wont bore you with their passage i was well housed and cared for at lees palace feeding of the best but nothing to do except loaf and fret and improve my chinese and devil a wench to bless myself with thanks to their godless laws which when i considered what was going on in the grand palace of glory and light was enough to make me bay at the stars the only diversion i had while i ate the beansprouts of idleness and brooded lewdly on the bearer of heavenly decrees and the tien wangs heavenly twins was when hung jenkan would have me over to his house for a prose the more i saw of him the better i liked him he was stout and jolly and full of fun and was plainly the only dog in the pack with two sane brains to rub together damned good brains they were too as i discovered and for all his jokes and guffaws he was a dangerous and ambitious man he had great charm and when you sat with him in his big cluttered yamen it was like gossiping with a chum in the gunroom the place was littered with port bottles full and empty along with three colt revolvers on the sidetable boxes of patent matches a broken telescope a wellthumbed bible next to the woolwich manual of fortification a shelf packed with jars of cowards mixed pickles bundles of silver ingots tied with red waxed string and thrown carelessly on the bed an old barometer piles of french crockery jade ornaments teacups a print of the holy well in flintshire propped up against the young cricketers companion and papers books and rubbish spread in dusty confusion and in the middle of it all that laughing fat rascal in his untidy yellow robe swilling port by the pint and eating steak with a knife and fork pushing the bottle at me lighting our cheroots chortling at his own jokes and crying thanks after his servants who were the ugliest old crones imaginable for jenkan of all the wangs kept no harem or affected any grand style aye it was easy to forget that in little more than a year hed climbed within a step of supreme power in this crazy revolution and held in his podgy fingers all the reins of state the other wangs were a surly crew of peasants beside him hung jenta the heavenly kings elder brother who gave himself ridiculous airs and sported silk robes of rainbow colours ying wang the heroic king who bit his nails and stuttered and the formidable chen yucheng who had abetted lee in the great defeat of the imps a few weeks before he was from the same stable as the loyal prince but even younger and more handsome dressed like a plain soldier never saying a word beyond a grunt and staring through you with black snake eyes they said he was the most ferocious of all the taiping leaders and i believed it one other i met at jenkans house a weedy pathetic little lad of about eleven tricked out in a gold crown and sceptre and a robe fairly crusted with jewels everyone fawned on him and knocked head something extravagant for he was the tien kuei the junior lord son of the heavenly king which made him jesuss nephew i suppose possibly they all talked sense in the council with hung jenkan though i doubt it in public their conversation seemed to consist of childish discussion of the heavenly kings latest decree or poem or pronouncement with misquoted references to the scriptures every other sentence it was like listening to a gang of labourers whod got religious mania it wasnt real if i hadnt had jenkan to talk to i believe id have lost all hold on common sense at least he could give me occasional news of the world outside which he did very fairly and humorously it was a waiting time that early summer of not only for me but for all china elgin had arrived at last and sailed north with grant and the frogs to the peiho mouth whence they would march strong to pekin in august jenkan reckoned though it was doubtful if they would get there before september by then lee would have launched his sudden stroke at shanghai forcing bruce to choose one side or tother at last meanwhile jenkan was bombarding him with letters to which bruce didnt reply so there was a lull through june and july with grant and elgin girding their loins to the north and bruce and the taipings listening for each other at either end of the yangtse valley only one minor portent disturbed the peace and when jenkan told me about it i couldnt believe my ears but it was plain sober unlikely truth as follows with shanghai in uncertainty the china merchants there had got the notion to raise a mercenary force to help defend the city if the taipings attacked according to jenkan it was a bit of a joke a mob of waterfront rowdies sailors deserters and beachcombers everyone but the town drunk oh no he was there too in force there were britons yankees frogs wogs wops greeks every sort of dago and who dyou think was at the head of this band of angels none other than mr frederick townsend ward it just shows what can happen when your backs turned how hed graduated from steamboat mate to this new command i couldnt imagine but when they took the field in june it was the biggest farce since grimaldi retired for young fred not content with guarding shanghai led his amazing rabble upriver one fine night to attack a taiping outpost at sungkiang they found the place for a wonder but most of em were howling drunk by the time they got there and the taipings shot the boots off them and they all tumbled back to shanghai ward damning and blinding every step of the way but he didnt give up not he inside the month he was back with another crew sober this time and most of em filippino bandits with a few american and british officers hed drilled some sense and order into them god knows how and they took sungkiang bigod after a fearful cutandthrust in which they lost sixty dead and a hundred wounded and friend frederick got a hundred and thirty thousand bucks commission from the china merchants jenkan was disposed to laugh the whole thing off but i wasnt so sure it was beyond belief and then again it wasnt id only to remember that bright eye and reckless grin and thank god i was well clear of the dangerous young sonofabitch and take note hed done a small but significant thing hed knocked the first dent in the invincible taiping armour and started something that was to change the face of china little mad fred but at the time i knew only what jenkan told me heaving with merriment at the thought of how affronted lee would be to have this yankee pup nipping his ankle will he be more wary now when he marches on shanghai he wondered i was doing some wondering on my own account as july wore out for lee was due to march in late august with me two days ahead of him and i was counting the time with a will and then just after the turn of the month jenkan showed what lay behind his genial mask and frightened the life out of me we were boozing in his yamen after luncheon and he was telling me of wards latest exploit a slap at another taiping outpost chingpu with three hundred men unluckily for him the rebels had ten thousand under two good leaders chow the taiping and savage a royal navy deserter theyd torn wards attack to bits killing about a hundred and the bold fred had been carried home with five wounds but they say he will come back to chingpu cries jenkan poor fellow loyal prince lee himself has gone down from soochow to take command he will crack this ward under his thumbnail and then he beamed filling my glass he will sweep on to shanghai i sat up at this when do i go two weeks he studied me for a long moment with his fat crafty grin and pulled his old robe round his big shoulders let us talk outside in english says he collaring the bottle and we strolled out into the warm sunshine jenkan blinking contentedly at his miniature garden you know the kind of thing from chinese exhibitions dwarf trees and flowers set among tiny streams and lakes and waterfalls with dollshouse pagodas and bridges all to scale like lilliput why do we love things in little muses jenkan admiring the line of tiny palms that fringed the garden do they make us feel like giants or gods perhaps he sipped his wine speaking of gods i have often meant to ask you what did you think of the heavenly king now neither of us had ever mentioned my visit to the palace though i was certain he knew about it and while he was no fanatic like lee i supposed he must be devoted to the heavenly loosescrew so i hesitated how to answer he settled his broad bottom on a rock under a tree i ask because i am curious to know what you will tell mr bruce what dyou think ill tell him says i warylike and he grinned and then chuckled and finally laughed so hard he had to set down his glass he blinked at me his shoulders shaking why that he is a debauched useless imbecile cries he what else can you say except that he is a poor deranged mystic a hopeless lunatic who makes an obscene parody of christianity that is the truth and that is what you will tell mr bruce he took a deep swig while i stood mum and a mite apprehensive what hed said was a capital offence in these parts and for all i knew listening might be too he shook his head grinning oh but you should have seen him once in the old days to know him then my dear sir harry i intend no blasphemy but it was to understand the force that must have lived in christ or buddha or mahomet and now poor soul a mad shell and nothing left within except that strange power that can still inspire devotion in folk like the loyal prince lee he chuckled even in people like me sometimes enough to make me wish you had not seen him that night i would have prevented it but i learned of lees intention too late those were my men who intervened in the garden unsuccessfully four of them died lie gave an amused snort that made my skin crawl and do you know next day lee and i greeted each other as usual and said nothing we taiping politicians are very discreet let me till your glass i wasnt liking this one bit hed never been this forthcoming before and when great men wax confidential i find myself taking furtive looks over my shoulder i just had to think of palmerston i saw lees purpose of course says the potbellied rascal he hoped you would fall under our divine rulers spell become a fanatical advocate of anglotaiping alliance and convince mr bruce likewise he shook his bullet head poor lee he is such an optimist with respect my dear sir harry soldiers should not meddle in affairs of state i was with him there for now i was in a difficulty until that night i had accepted though without enthusiasm lees plan of marching on shanghai and forcing britains hand but once you had seen the tien wang well i asked myself what must follow when you reported his deplorable condition to mr bruce alas he consoled himself with another hefty gulp it was all too plain whatever force we took to shanghai we could never persuade britain to recognise a regime led by such a creature mr bruce would only have to picture the reaction of prince albert and the church of england they would fight us rather no whatever hope we had of an alliance must perish the moment you set foot in bruces office if theres one thing that can make me puke with terror its having an oriental despot tell me im inconvenient you think id be giving bruce news i blurted dammit the whole world knows your heavenly kings a raving idiot no i think not says he mildly some may suspect it but most charitably regard the rumours as imp propaganda and missionary gossip they would not know the full deplorable truth until you told them he looked wistfully at the bottle now empty and then we agree mr bruce would reject us and lee would take shanghai by storm with all the horrors of sack and slaughter inevitable in such a victory and we would be at war with britain a war we could not hope to win he sighed heavily it seemed to me that our only hope must be that your report never reached mr bruce in which case happily ignorant of the tien wangs condition he might well allow lee to occupy shanghai peacefully ah you are not drinking sir harry my reply to this was an apoplectic croak and he brightened in that case may i take your glass being fat i am slothful and it seems a long way to the house for another bottle i thank you he drained my glass and wiped his lips contentedly i do like port i confess but but look here i interrupted babbling dont you see it wont matter a bit if they know the heavenly kings cracked because i can tell em that youre not and that youre guiding the revolution sir not that mad doxygalloper i swear that when bruce knows youre in charge why hell be far more inclined to accept the taiping knowing you have it in hand make a treaty even why you are jolly kind beams the bloated buddha but alas it would not be true lee is already as powerful as i and when he succeeds at shanghai whether by persuasion or storm it will be a triumph which cannot fail to enhance him and eclipse me utterly it was while i was considering your own position that this fact burst on me with blinding force i could see no issue at shanghai that would not increase lees power and undermine my own and that was terrible to contemplate no it is no use we must have the other bottle and he was off to the house like an obese whippet kilting up his robe his fat calves wobbling while i sat alarmed and bewildered he came back flourishing a bottle laughing merrily as he resumed his seat and splashed port into our glasses your good health sir harry chortles he damn his impudence yes terrible to contemplate but you mustnt think im jealous if lee were a realist i would make way for him for he is a splendid soldier who might win the war and establish the heavenly kingdom i hoped so once he shook his head again but of late i have seen how blind is his fanaticism how implicitly he will obey every insane decree from that lunatic he worships between them they would make the taiping a headless centipede poisonous clawing without direction and there would never be an end to this abominable war of extermination oh thats what it is he laughed heartily chilling my blood do you know why we and the imps never take prisoners because if we did we could not hold our armies together if they knew they could be taken prisoner they would not fight consider that hideous fact sir harry and have some more port he reached for the bottle and i realised he was watching me intently his fat creased face grinning most oddly between them lee and the tien wang will destroy the taiping says he slowly unless i can prevent them and that i can only do if i retain my power and diminish that of loyal prince lee a grievous necessity sighs the fat hypocrite beaming happily now sir harry i wonder if you can foresee as a strictly neutral observer how that might be brought about well id seen where the blubbery villain was headed for some minutes past and what between flooding relief and fury at the way hed scared the innards out of me first i didnt mince words you mean if lee falls flat on his arse at shanghai he looked puzzled doubtless the expression was seldom heard in the hong kong mission where hed worked if lee were to fail at shanghai i explained if he tried to take the place and couldnt he sucked in port noisily but is that possible obviously you have a vested interest in saying that it is but my dear sir harry he leaned forward glittering piggily i have been entirely frank with you dangerously frank and i trust you to be equally candid with me you know mr bruces mind you know the position at shanghai could lee be made to fail of course he knew the answer hed been studying it for weeks well in the first place says i hell not scare bruce into letting him walk in hell have to fight and as i told you at our first meeting it wont be against a mob of useless imps wholl fall down if a taiping farts at them i waited until his bellow of mirth had subsided hell be meeting british and french regulars for the first time not many of em but they can be reinforced given time we have sikhs at chusan two regiments at canton three says he i have information ill bet he had with the fleet lying off peiho oh and this gang of fred wards for what its worth lee will have fifty thousand men remember could shanghai resist such a force the temptation to say we could lick him from china to cheltenham was irresistible so i resisted it he knew the case better than i did so there was nothing for it but honesty i dont know but it could have a damned good try if bruce had warning now by a messenger he trusted i hung on that for a moment and he nodded hed have two weeks to garrison before lee arrived in which case you can wish lee luck because by god hell need it if youve ever seen a fat chinaman holding four aces youll know how he was staring at me as he envisaged the delightful prospect of lee disgraced himself supreme the deliberate sacrifice of hundreds perhaps thousands of taiping lives and the certain loss of shanghai to the taiping cause forever were mere trifles so long as jenkan won his political battle over lee suddenly he gave a little crowing laugh and filled my glass you confirm my conclusions exactly cries he lee will certainly be defeated before shanghai of course in contriving this i am compromising myself most dangerously but i know mr bruce will be discreet he and hm government have much to gain from an enlightened control in the taiping movement the steamships order for example need not be affected by our brief mutual hostilities at shanghai which will soon be forgotten britain can resume her policy of neutrality and left to ourselves we shall defeat the manchoos he raised his glass to me your own immediate profit should be considerable you will be the hero who brought the momentous warning that saved shanghai i drink to your further advancement my friend he smacked his liver lips and leaned back blinking up at the sunlight filtering through the fronds overhead i foresee happy times he had it all pat the fat grinning ruthless scoundrel but dyou know i cant say he was a whit worse than any other statesman of my acquaintance and a sight jollier than most i asked when i would go tonight says he it is all arranged with complete secrecy i shall easily conceal your absence until the appropriate time two weeks hence when i will send word to lee who should he at chingpu by now that his advance to shanghai can begin ile giggled and took another mammoth swig of port your escort will take you as far as chingpu by the way where by all accounts your friend mr ward will be in the vicinity but you will keep well clear of chingpu itself lee would not be pleased to see you he turned to grin at me we know what you will tell mr bruce of the heavenly king and of the loyal prince lee i wonder what you will say of hung jenkan that he drinks port at the wrong time of day he choked on his glass you intend to ruin my reputation in fact ah well i am sure mr bruce will receive an honest account from you the fact that it will be totally misleading is by the way he heaved another of his mountainous sighs you imagine i act out of unscrupulous selfinterest true all revolutionaries do they agitate and harangue and justify every villainy in the name of high ideals they lie to delude the people whom they hold in contempt they seek nothing but their personal ends my only defence is that my ends are modest ones i seek power to see the revolution accomplished after that i have no wish to rule i want the biggest library in china and to visit my cousins in san francisco and to read the lesson just once in an english country church he began to shake with laughter again tell mr bruce that he wont believe a word of it oh and you will not forget to mention the steamships an order worth a million remember whatever happens with lee he looked like a contented pig as superintendent of trade mr bruce will not overlook the importance of the almighty dollar hadnt arrived at nanking in any great style but it was pullman travel compared to the way i went under hatches on a stinking yangtse fishbarge with two of jenkans thugs for company i darent show face until we were well away from the city white fanquis being as common in those parts as niggers in norway not that id have been hindered but jenkan might have had awkward explanations to make if it got about that flashy was heading east ahead of time so we spent a day and night in the poisonous dark and came ashore somewhere on the kiangyin bend where two more thugs were waiting with ponies farther down the river was infested by gangs of imp deserters and bandits and while the land to the south was swarming with taiping battalions jenkan had reckoned wed make better and safer time on horseback taking a long sweep to come in by chingpu where frederick t wards foreign legion was preparing to have another slap at the taiping garrison i dont remember much about that ride except that i was damned stiff after months out of the saddle but i know we raised chingpu on a misty dawn looking down from a crest to the town perhaps a mile away it was wooded country with paddy here and there and many waterways you could see the little mat sails beetling along among the dykes ever so pretty in the pearly morning light it would have been quite an idyllic scene if there hadnt been the deuce of a battle going on round chingpus high mud walls wed heard the guns before we came in view and they were hanging away splendidly wreathing the walls and gatetowers in thick grey smoke while dead to our front great disorderly lines of men were advancing to the assault to my astonishment i saw they were imps straggling along any old how but in the van there was a fairly compact company in green caps and i knew these must be wards people without a glass i couldnt make them out clearly but they were holding together well under the fire from the walls and presently they were charging the main gate while the imp supports milled about and let off crackers and waved banners in fine useless style farther back behind the attackers were more imp battalions by a riverbank with a gunboat blazing away at nothing in particular and about a mile away on my right was a low hill on which a couple of banners were flying with a number of mounted men wheeling about and occasionally dashing out to the attacking force gallopers the hill must be the attackers headquarters so it behoved me to make for it i was just pointing it out to my escort when there was a tremendous pandemonium from the plain before the town the boom of guns and crackle of musketfire redoubled the crimson taiping banners were waving wildly along the walls and suddenly in the smokeclouds before the gate there was a great glare of orange light followed by the thunderous roar of an explosion that was wards lads mining the main gate and as the smoke cleared sure enough one of the supporting towers was in ruins and green caps were surging into a breach as wide as a church at this the imps seeing their side winning set up a huge halloo and went swarming in to join the fun in a moment the whole space before the breach was choked with men while the supporting lines throwing disorder to the winds crowded in behind blazing away indiscriminately and that should have been the end of chingpu what the attackers had forgotten or didnt know was that they were assaulting a stronghold commanded by loyal prince lee they were about to find out and it was a sight to see all along the front wall it was like an enormous football scrimmage there must have been hundreds trying to get to the breach and more arriving every second on the side wall nearest to me there wasnt a single attacker and now a banner waved on the battlements a sidegate opened and out came a column of taiping redcoats trotting orderly four abreast they streamed out hundreds strong rounding the front angle and went into the attacking mob like a scarlet thunderbolt at the same moment from the other side of the town a second taiping column completed the pincer movement the black silk flags went up and within five minutes there wasnt a living attacker within quarter of a mile of chingpu and the whole imp rout was streaming back towards the river utterly broken i never saw a neater sally in my life as the taipings broke off the pursuit and began to strip the dead i reflected that it was as well jenkan wasnt seeing this or he might have entertained doubts about shanghais ability to hold lee at bay but you dont dally on the touchline when the games over i wheeled my pony and made for the headquarters hill keeping well to flank of the fleeing imps with my escort thundering along behind the gallopers and standardbearers were streaming away over the brow so i circled the hill and found myself in a little wood beyond which lay a broad sunken road with what looked like a party of sightseers coming down it there was a disconsolate chap in a green cap carrying a banner which he was plainly itching to throw away a few stragglers and mules iwo minions carrying a picnic basket and finally flanked by a galloper with his arm in a bloody sling and a noisy cove in a norfolk jacket and gaiters came a sedan chair borne by perspiring coolies and containing frederick t ward i almost didnt recognise him at first for he was swathed in bandages like an egyptian mummy with his leg in a splint and a big plaster on his jaw but it didnt stop him talking and id have recognised that staccato yankee voice anywhere the norfolk jacket had just finished roaring in a fine dixie accent that he didnt know wheah ned forrestuh wuz an he didnt dam well cayuh neethuh an if forrestuh had jest waited till the flanks wuz covered they wouldnt ha bin cotched like a nigguh with his pants down in the melonpatch it was downright hoomiliatin now you find him damned quick snaps ward if he got out and i hope to god he did you tell him to get back to sungkiang with every man hes got no the hell with the gunboat let the imps worry about it for all the good it was wed ha been better with a canoe now get going sungkiang remember spitz find the doctor i want our casualty count not the imps goddam it if only i could walk an whayuh the hell do ah git goin to bawled the norfolk jacket raising arms to heaven lessn forrestuhs daid hell be back at the rivuh by naow an holy baldhead who the hell is that i had reined up by the road and he was gaping at me so i gave a cheery wave and sang out just a tourist old fellow hollo fred been in the wars i see none too tactful you may say but no reason for the norfolk jacket to leap three feet and yell cover him spitz hes a changmao dont be a damned fool im nothing of the sort says i do i look like one they do he roars pointing and i realised that jenkans four thugs were lurking modestly behind me on the fringe of the wood and there was no denying they had taiping haircuts hold your fire i shouted for spitz the wounded galloper was unlimbering an enormous pistol ward im flashman were friends theyre not taipings well they are but they aint hostile call him off fred will you he was looking at me as though i were a ghost but he signed spitz to put up his piece whatn tarnation are you doing here going to shanghai says i so will you if youve any sense hes an englishman cries the norfolk jacket like trent an mowbray ah kin tell by his voice i know what he is says ward impatiently and to me i thought you were at the bottom of the yangtse where the dooce have you been thats a long story first if you dont mind and i turned and waved away my escort who wheeled and vanished into the wood on the instant like sensible lads spitz raised a great outcry and the norfolk jacket waved his arms savage is english too an hes with the taipings he bellowed seed the sonofabitch on the wall this mawnin bold as brass i told you to go find forrester barks ward and winced damn this leg spitz will you get that casualty count dyou know they went like lambs he was still young fred ward but hed grown some authority all right well i swan he shook his head at me you back in british service or what i thought you said they busted you over that pearl river business noo you said that and i didnt contradict you im still staff colonel is that a fact he was grinning although the pale young lace was pinched with pain and those four were they on the staff too oh who cares come on dobbin he waved to the coolies who heaved up the sedan again they dont gallop exactly and id as soon the longhairs didnt catch up with me i told him about lees forthcoming advance as we went not mentioning jenkan and he never took those bright black eyes off me although he winced and gasped as he was bounced along when id done he whistled and swore well there goes sungkiang i guess in which case the hell with it im going to france and have a rest he squinted at inc its pukka that lees coming yes and the less you say about it the better we dont want him to know hes expected do we but look here if you cant hold sungkiang hadnt you better pull back to shanghai ive got a contract to hold the dam place says he if i dont yang fangll want his money back and hes my fatherinlaw anyway your man bruce doesnt want me anywhere near shanghai im a confounded mercenary nuisance old boy dontcherknow he laughed bitterly the damned dummy why if hed supported me with arms and men wed ha had a half dozen taiping places by now and leed never get within twenty miles o the coast but all i get is imps and they dont fight you saw that mess just now and i had to lay there and watch say i sure hope ned forrester got out though i said if bruce wasnt helpful why didnt he try his own american consulate and he hooted and said they were even more timid than the british or french theyre all glad enough to hide behind us though preserving their darned neutrality and counting their dividends aint they though oh i reckon not he lay back gasping and stirring to try to ease his wounds god but im tired we were out on the paddy by now threading along the causeways and on either side the plain was dotted with groups of fugitives streaming away from chingpu imps mostly but a few in green caps white men and little darkskinned chaps who i guessed were filippinos they hailed ward whenever we came within earshot and he shouted back although his voice was weak calling all right boys good for you see you in sungkiang paydays coming you bet hurrah and they hurrahed back waving their caps and trudged on through the paddy there was no sign of pursuit and now we called a halt to eat and rest wards bearers the picnic basket proved to contain enough for a banquet with hams cold roasts and fowls fruit chocolate and even iced champagne but ward contented himself with a loaf of bread which he ate in handfuls soaking each bite in rum the rest went in no time for a party of greencap stragglers came up and ward waved them to pitch in they were filippinos under a most illassorted pair a huge brokennosed american with his shirt open over his hairy barrel chest who looked and talked like a hobo and a slim little royal navy chap with a wingcollar and a handkerchief in his sleeve ward called them tom and jerry and now came spitz trotting his nearfoundered horse with the news that ned forrester was slightly wounded but that casualties had been heavy there voss a huntret killed and ass many wounded says he pulling a cold fowl to pieces in his great hands and stuffing it down tom swore and jerry tuttutted but ward just laid down his loaf closed his eyes and recited the lords prayer aloud while we all left off eating and stood about with bowed heads holding drumsticks and glasses aymen says ward at last so weve got a hundred fit to fight all right jerry you and tom make for shanghai tell vincente macanana i need two three hundred recruits and i dont mean imp deserters american and british russki french and all the filippinos he can raise kit em out at the camp ten bucks apiece to sign on no more or theyll take it an quit right there force march to sungkiang and see here tom i want em there in three days no later comprenny dunno old boy drawls jerry shaking his head the wells pretty dry may have to take some odd customers ticketoleave men growls tom bums dagoes i dont give a hoot how odd they are so long as they can stand up and shoot thats all theyll have to do when lee lays siege to sungkiang ward was looking more chipper now he laughed at their glum faces and struggled up in his sedan to clap tom on the back with his good hand no room for drills on the parapet old fellow just bang and reload and knock down changmaos like ninepins who knows an easier way of making a hundred a week eh thats the life in the greenheaded army will tree hunnert hold the place i ask grumbles spitz and ward rounded on him grinning why how you talk easy as pie tumble over their black bannermen and theyll run as fast as as we did that first time we attacked sungkiang member jerry i know you dont tom cos you were blind drunk an snoring in the bottom of a sampan yes you were too oh you neednt smirk so virtuous either jerry who ran the boat aground he laughed again eagerly but we came back didnt we threw the longhairs clear out o the place didnt we and were not giving it up no sir not while i can lay in a sedan chair an give orders just listening to him shot full of holes and chortling like a schoolboy i could see brooke on that rusty little steamer on skrang river slapping the table brighteyed and urging us to sing because we were only outnumbered a hundred to one by headhunting pirates and werent we going to give em what for in the morning they were a matched pair of madmen ward and brooke the kind who dont think a cause worth fighting unless its half lost to start with pumping their own crazy optimism into their followers by sheer force of will for now jerry was smiling and tom grinning and even spitz the surly switzer was looking less sour while the filippinos were laughing and chattering as ward joked and harangued their officers i cant stand em myself these happy heroes theyll do for us all if we dont watch out brooke damned near did for me and f t ward was just the man to have finished the job as appeared presently when the others had gone off and i said i must be pushing on to shanghai myself he lay quiet a moment and cleared his throat you wouldnt feel like taking some furlough would you colonel i mean oh fellows like tom and jerry are just grand you know but well itll take moren pluck to hold sungkiang after today and i could sure use a good man come fred says i you know quite well im a queens officer not a wild goose being tactful you see id sooner have gone on a polar expedition with cetewayo oh sure cries he airily i know that i didnt mean anything permanent just he gave me his cocky urchin grin so young in that worn paincreased face well you took time off to run opium didnt you an this job pays five hundred bucks a week and commission on every town we take like chingpu you mean my how you tempt a fellow listen ill take chingpu dont you fret cries he chingpu an twenty more like it youll see once i get rested up an get a good bunch of fellows together an lick em into shape frederick says i because for some reason id conceived an affection for the young idiot listen to me will you ive been twenty years in this game and i know what im saying now within the limits of raving lunacy youre a good sort and i dont want to see you come to harm so my advice to you is retire the money aint worth it nothings worth it youre lying there like a bloody colander and if you dont see sense why youll finish up under the paddy sure as fate ill finish up in pekin cries he and his black eyes were shining fit to sicken you dont you see this is just a beginning im learning my trade here sure im making mistakes and sure i dont know one little bit about soldiering compared to you but i will yes sir ive got the most important thing behind me a bankroll from the china merchants and the longer i stay in the field the better ill get and im going to build me the greenheaded army into something thatll sweep the taipings out of china and then ill have won the emperors war for him and then he laughed and sat back against his cushions then mister youre going to dine out on how you ran poppy an fought pirates with frederick townsend ward i watched his sedan jogging away across the plain in the wake of his tatterdemalion regiment and thought well theres another damned fool gone to collect the wages of ambition i was right and wrong he found his bed in the paddy as id foretold and hardly anyone remembers even his name nowadays but you may say that without him chinese gordon might never have had a lookin you can read about em both in the books and shudder for the moment ill say only that while gordon finished the taiping business it was young happygolucky fred who broke the ground for him and turned that drunken mob of green caps into one of the great free companies the evervictorious army aye ward and gordon a good pair to stay away from i reached shanghai at midnight and the smell of fear was in the air already word had run ahead of wards debacle at chingpu and that it had been caused by none other than the terrible loyal prince lee himself who could now be expected to sweep on and overwhelm the city even the street lanterns seemed to be burning dimmer in apprehension and i never saw fewer civilians or more troops abroad in the consular district usually gates were wide with lights and music from the houses within and carriages and palkis moving in the streets tonight the gates were closed with strong piquets on guard and occasional files of marines hurrying along their tramp echoing in the silence bruce had gone to bed but they rousted him out and for once his imperturbability deserted him he stared at me like a stricken seraph hair all awry where hed hauled off his nightcap but once hed decided i wasnt dead after all he wasted no time but called for lights to his study thrust me into a chair ordered up brandy and sandwiches and told me to talk as i ate youve got two weeks i told him and launched into it the date of lees advance his probable strength jenkans conspiracy to ensure his failure at which he exclaimed in disbelief and even slater his secretary stopped taking notes to gape at me and then such secondary matters as their detention of yours truly and those impressions id formed which seemed important in the present crisis i talked for an hour almost without pause and he hardly said a word till id done when thank god i sent you to nanking says he weve been growing surer by the week that he was coming but no hint of the date youre positive we have two weeks ten days if you like certainly no less its my guess hell put paid to ward at sungkiang before he marches on shanghai it would be a public service if he did exclaimed bruce that yankee upstart is a greater embarrassment than the french priests he might buy you few days if hes strong enough i reminded him id turn a blind eye to his recruiting anyway if i were you he sniffed but said hed make a note of it and then told me with some satisfaction how hed been urging the consuls and the imps for weeks past to put the city in a state of defence now that they had definite word and a date his hand would be strengthened tremendously and by the time they had improved the fortifications and called in more troops lee could whistle for shanghai however many taipings he had at his back for which he said handsomely they were deeply indebted to me and lord palmerston should know of it well i always say credit and cash you can never have too much of either but the best news he gave me was that he was sending me north without delay to join elgin who had just made his landing at the mouth of the peiho with grants army and was preparing to advance on pekin there is nothing you can do here now my dear sir harry to compare with what you have already done says he all smiles and it is of the first importance that lord elgin himself should have your account of the taipings without delay there will be endless chinchinning with the emperors people you may be sure before he reaches pekin and your intelligence will be of incalculable value i heard him with relief for id been fearful that hed want to keep me by him to advise about lees army and if there was one place id no desire to linger just then it was shanghai you see bruce like jenkan might be certain that lee was going to get a bloody nose but i wasnt id seen his longhaired bastards making mincemeat of soochow and id no wish to be among the gallant defenders when their black flags went up before our walls so i looked knowing and serious and admitted that id be glad to get back to proper campaigning again and he and slater exchanged glances of admiration at this soldierly zeal they couldnt wait to be rid of me though id been looking forward to a few days loafing and being lionised and several restorative romps with my russian maneater at the hairdressers i hadnt had a woman since my last bout with szuzhan and i didnt want to forget how it was done but no bruce said i must take the fast steamsloop for the peiho that very morning because elgin would be in a sweat to have me on hand and mustnt be kept waiting so now you find flashy beating norwest by south or whatever the proper nautical jargon may be thundering amain oer the trackless waste o waters which i did by dossing for fourteen hours straight off and if there was a typhoon it was all one to me for the first time in months since i boarded the steamer yangtse in fact i was free of all care content to be tired with nothing ahead but a safe leisurely campaign in good company while behind lay the nightmare ugly and confused not near as bad as some ive known but disturbing enough perhaps it was those unreal weeks in taipingdom that made the memories distasteful stark danger and horror you can either fight or run from but madness spreads a blight theres no escaping it still made me feel vaguely unclean to think of lees sharp crazy eyes or the blank hypnotic gaze of the archlunatic on that incredible night with the jossstench like a drug and those wonderful satin bodies writhing nakedly by jove theres a lot to be said for starting a new religion or the bearer of heavenly decrees maddeningly out of reach and far better the lean face smiling wickedly above the chain collar and the long barebreasted shapeliness lounging at the rail and then the crash of shots the screaming faces and whirling blades surging out of the mist masked figures and steel claws dragging me through the dark redcoated legions stamping up the dust like jaggernauts black silk flags and burned corpses heaped a fat smiling yellow face telling me i knew too much to live a crippled figure swathed in bandages urging on his fools to die for a handful of dollars that same boys face distorted with horror as a cageful of poor wretches was plunged to death in a mere spiteful gesture surely china must have exhausted its horrors by now so i thought in my drowsy waking like the optimistic idiot i was youd think id have known better after twenty years of counting chickens which turned out to be ravening vultures for china had done no more than spar gently with me as yet and the first gruesome round of the real battle was only three days away that was the time it took from the yangtse to the mouth of the peiho the great waterway to pekin and you must take a squint at the map if youre to follow what happened to me next the mouth of the peiho was guarded by the famous taku forts from which we had been bloodily repulsed the previous year when the yankees watching on the touchline had thrown their neutrality overboard in the crisis and weighed in to help pull cousin john bull out of the soup the forts were still there dragons teeth on either bank and since elgin couldnt tell whether the manchoos would let us pass peacefully or blow us to bits he and grant had wisely landed eight miles farther up the coast at the pehtang from whence they and the frogs could march inland and take the forts from the landward side if the chinks showed any disposition to dispute our passage from the peiho mouth to the pehtang the sea was covered with our squadrons to the south guarded by fighting ships were the river transports waiting to enter the peiho when the forts had been silenced for the moment they lay safe out of range farther north was the main fleet a great forest of masts and rigging and smoking funnels troop transports with their tow vessels supply ships fighting sail steamships and gunboats and even junks and merchantmen and sampans with the small boats scuttling between em like waterbeetles rowed by coolies or redfaced tars in white canvas and straw hats it takes a powerful lot of shipping more than two hundred bottoms to land men horse foot guns and commissariat which was what grant and montauban had done almost two weeks earlier and by all accounts it was still bedlam at the pehtang landingplace wont have you ashore until tomorrow colonel at this rate says my sloop commander and being impatient by now to be off his pitching little washtub i took a look at the long flat coastline a bare mile away and made a damned fool suggestion we were about halfway between peiho and pehtang in the middle of the fleet but over on the coast itself there seemed to be one or two flatbottoms putting in landing horses on the beach could your launch set me down yonder says i and he scratched his head and said he supposed so with the result that half an hour later we were pitching through the surf to an improvised landingstage where a mob of halfnaked coolies were manhandling a pontoon from which syces were leading horses ashore big ugly walers they were rearing and neighing like bedamned as they shied at the salt foam there was a pinkfaced youth in a red turban and grey tunic cussing the handlers richly as i splashed ashore get your fingers in his nose cant you squeaks he oh my stars he aint a sheep you know i hailed him and his name was carnac i remember subaltern in fanes horse an enterprising lad who like me had decided to come in by a side door the walers were remounts for his regiment which he reckoned was somewhere on the causeway between pehtang and sinho a glance at the map will show you how we were placed fane dont care to be kept waiting says he and well need these dam screws tomorrow i imagine so im going to take em over there while the tides still out he gestured north over the mudflats which stretched away for miles into the misty distance our people ought to be in sinho by now thats over there and he pointed dead ahead about five miles but there may be tartars in between so im taking no chances stout fella says i got a buckshee waler for a poor staff colonel have you im looking for lord elgin dunno where he is pehtang probly says the lad but sir hope grants sure to be on the causeway where were going hell do says i and when the last of his walers was ashore and the syces had mounted we trotted off across the flat it was muddy tidal sand as far as you could see with little pools drying in the morning sun but the mist was burning away and presently we heard the thump of guns ahead and carnac set off at a canter for higher ground to our right i followed him scrambling up onto the harder footing of a little plateau dotted with mounds which looked for all the world like big tents burial places not unlike russian koorgans we pushed forward to the farther edge of the plateau and there we were in a ringside seat running across our front about a mile ahead was the causeway a high banked road and along it advancing steadily to the wail of pipes and rattle of drums were columns of redcoated infantry our st division behind them came the khaki coats of native infantry and then the blue overcoats and kepis of the frogs there must have been two thousand men rolling down to the manchoo entrenchments where the causeway ended on our left front with the armstrong guns crashing away behind them and blue bonnets over the border keening in front behind the manchoo entrenchment were masses of chinese infantry bannermen and tiger soldiers and on their left a great horde of tartar cavalry through carnacs glass i could make out the red coats and fur hats of the riders crouched like jockeys on their sheepskins even as we watched the tartar cavalry began to move wheeling away from the causeway and charging en masse away from our advancing columns and out on to their far flank carnac stood in his stirrups his voice cracking with excitement thats the nd division over yonder cant see em for the haze by jove the chinks are charging em would you believe it it was too far to see clearly but the tartars were certainly vanishing into the haze from which came barking salvo after salvo of field pieces and while our columns on the causeway held back there was evidently hell breaking loose to their right front sure enough after a moment back came the tartars flying in disorder and scattering across the plain and out of the haze behind them came a thundering line of grey tunics and red puggarees lances lowered and behind i saw the red coats of the heavies the dragoon guards carnac went wild look at em go those are my chaps tallyho fanes give em what for by crumbs theres an omen first action an were chasing em like hares he was right the chinks were all to pieces with the indian lancers and dragoon sabres in among them and now the columns on the causeway were deploying from the road quickening their pace as they swept on to the chink entrenchment there was the plumed smoke of a volley as they charged a ragged burst of firing from the chinks and then they were into the earthworks and the manchoo gunners and infantry were flying in rout with the armstrong shells bursting among them behind their lines the ground was black with fugitives streaming back to a village which i supposed was sinho carnac was hallooing like a madman and even i found myself exclaiming dam good grant dam fine for i never saw a smarter right and left in my life and that was the battle of sinho receipted and filed and the road to the taku forts open carnac was in a fever to reach his regiment and made off for the causeway with his syces at the gallop but i was in no hurry sinho was a good three miles away with swamp and saltpans and canals in between and if i knew anything about battlefields the ground would be littered with badtempered enemy woundd just ready to take out their spite on passersby id give em time to crawl away or die meanwhile i watched the nd division moving in from the plain and the st cheering em into the chinese positions with great hurrahing and waving of hats that was where grant would be and rather than trot the mile to the causeway which was crowded with our traffic presently rode down to the flat and made a beeline for sinho across country i doubted if any sensible manchoos would be disporting themselves in the vicinity by now i forgot that every army has its share of idiots down on the saltflats i no longer had much view it was nothing but great crusted white beds and little canals with occasional brackish hollows ugly country and after a few minutes there wasnt a soul to be seen anywhere just the glittering lips of the saltpans either side cutting off sight and sound and only the dry scuff of the walers hooves to break the stillness suddenly i remembered the jornada the dead mans journey under the silent new mexican moon and shivered and i was just about to wheel right and make for the direction of the causeway when i became aware of sounds of true british altercation ahead i trotted round a saltbank and beheld an interesting tableau well there was a scotsman an irishman and a chinaman and they were shouting drunken abuse at each other over a grogcart which was foundered with a broken wheel the paddy a burly redhead with a sergeants chevrons was trying to wrest a bottle from the scot a blackavised scoundrel in a red coat who was beating him off and singing an obscene song about a ball at kirriemuir which was new to me the chink was egging em on and shrieking with laughter various other coolies stood passively in the background ye niggerfaced scotch sot roars the murphy will ye come to order now im warnin ye moyes im warnin ye itll be the triangle and a bloody back for ye if ye dont surrinder that bottle whats left of it ye guzzlin pig ye give over the scot left off singing long enough to knock him down and lurched against the cart see you nolan cries he see your grandmither she wiz a hoor nor she couldnae read nor write so she had your mither by a jesuit aye an your mither had you by a bilerman christ nolan ahm ashamed o ye ye want a drink the irishman came up roaring and flew at him and since brawling rankers aint my touch i was about to ride on when there was a pounding of hooves behind me a chorus of yells and over the lip came a section of tartar cavalry bent on villainy after which much happened in a very short space i was off the waler and shooting under its neck with my colt in quick time and down goes the lead tartar his mates hauled up unslinging their bows and i barely had time to leap aside before my waler was down and thrashing feathered with shafts i turned ran and fell rolling over and blowing shots at the red coats which seemed to be swarming everywhere out of the tail of my eye i saw the irishman grabbing a tartars leg and heaving him from the saddle the scotchman whom id have thought too screwed for anything was on top of the grog cart crashing his bottle on the head of another tartar and then diving on to him stabbing with the shards i took an almighty crack on the head which didnt stun me but caused me to lose the use of my limbs entirely then i was being hauled up between two red coats with evil yellow faces yelling at me from under conical fur hats and the stink was fit to knock you down the fact is they never wash even the chinese complain the scene was swimming round me i remember seeing the irishman being frogmarched and bound and the scot lying on the ground apparently dead and thats all now i say i dont believe i lost consciousness but i must have done for piecing events together later theres a day missing so they tell me anyway but it dont matter i know what i remember and can never forget there was terrible pain in my wrists and ankles when the chinese tie a man up they do it as tight as possible so that his hands are quickly useless and in time will mortify there was darkness too and an agonising jolting plainly i was carried on one of their ponies but my first clear recollection is of a foul cell a foot deep in mud and no feeling in my hands or feet which were still bound i couldnt speak for raging thirst that had dried my tongue and lips bone hard all i could do was lie in pain with my senses dulled almost to idiocy i could hear though and i remember that coarse scotch voice yelling obscenities and the irish voice hoarse and begging him to lay off and the wailing of coolies somewhere near me in the dark and then there was blinding light in the cell and tartar swine yelling and dragging us to a low doorway kicking and beating us as we went i remember recalling that the manchoos treated all prisoners alike as vermin so being an officer meant nothing not that i could have proclaimed myself with my tongue like a board i halffell out into the light and was hauled to my feet and after a moment my vision cleared and the first thing i saw was a face no doubt im biased but it was the most cruel evil human visage i ever set eyes on and ive seen some beauties this one was as flat and yellow as a guinea grinning in sheer pleasure at our pain turning to laugh bestially to someone nearby it had a drooping moustache and a little chinbeard and was crowned with a polished steel helmet the figure that went with the face was all in steel and leather armour even to mailed gauntlets with a splendid robe of red silk round the shoulders he was seated on a gilded chair of state with a great sword across his knees and beside him stood a nondescript chink official and a burly tartar bare to the waist with an axe on his shoulder we were in a courtyard with high walls lined by furcapped tartars to my right were halfadozen cringing coolies and to my left barely recognisable for the mud that plastered them stood the paddy and the scot from the grogcart the irishman had his eyes closed muttering hailmary the scot was staring ahead his tunic was halftorn off but i noted dully that it bore the ochre facing of the buffs and that he had old catscars on his shoulder my eyes went back to the huge tartar with the axe and with a thrill of sheer horror i knew that we were going to die suddenly the brute in the chair spoke or rather shrieked in chinese flinging out a pointing hand of which two fingers were sheathed in nailcases filth lice white offal you dare to show your dogfaces in the celestial kingdom and defile the sacred soil you dare to defy the complete abundance but the day of your humiliation is coming like curs you have fed your pride for twenty years now like curs you will hang your heads lay back your ears wag your tails and beg for mercy there was foam at his thin lips and he jerked and glared like a maniac kneel kneel down vermin kowtow kowtow there were squeals and whimpers on my right the coolies were down and knocking head for dear life the two britons on my left not understanding a word didnt move and as the mailed tyrant screamed with rage the little official hurried forward snarling in a fearful parody of english down down to legs down to prince sang makes kill see makes kill he was gesticulating at the big tartar who stumped forward grinning flourishing that awful axe above his head with both hands there was no doubt what was demanded and the alternative it was enough for me i was down and butting my way to the antipodes before the little bastard had done speaking i still thought we were doomed but if a timely grovel would help he could have it from me and welcome you dont catch flashy standing proud and unflinching at the gates of doom there was one who did though down down to prince sang not makes kill not kowtow makes kill kowtow kowtow the official was screaming again and with my head on the earth i stole a sideways glance this is what i saw the paddy was a brave man he absolutely hesitated his face was crimson and he glared and gulped horribly and then he fell to his knees and put his face in the dust like the rest of us beyond him the sawney was standing frowning at the prince as though he couldnt credit what hed heard his mouth was hanging slack and i wondered was he still drunk but he wasnt ye what says he in that rasping gutter voice and as the prince glared and the little official jabbered i heard the irishman hoarse and urgent fer gods sake moyes get down ye bloody idiot hell kill ye else get down man moyes turned his head and his eyes were wide in disbelief by god so were my ears for clear as a bell says he tae a in chink away you and he stood straight as he could stared at prince sang and stuck out his dirty unshaven chin for a full ten seconds there wasnt a sound and then sang screamed like an animal and leaped from his chair the tartar square in front of moyes brought the glittering axe blade round slowly within inches of the scots face and then whirled it up poised to strike the official repeated the order to kowtow and moyes lifted his chin just a trifle looked straight at sang and spat gently out of the corner of his mouth sang quivered as though hed been struck and for a moment i thought hed spring at the bound man but all he did was glare and hiss an order to the tartar who raised the axe s till higher his huge shoulders bunched to strike the irishans voice sounded in a pleading croak jaysus man will ye do as he bids ye for the love o mary yell be kilt ye fool hell murther ye thatll mak him a man afore his mither says moyes quietly and for flat careless contempt i never heard its equal he stood like a rock and suddenly the axe flashed down wi tin a hideous thud his body was sent hurtling back and i was f ace down in the dirt gasping bile and sobbing with horror that was how it happened the stories that he laughed in defiance or made a speech about not bowing his head to any heathen or recited a prayer or even the tale that h died drunk theyre false id say he was taken flat aback at the mere notion of kowtowing and when it sank in he wasnt having it not if it cost him his life you may ask was he a hero or just a fool and ill not answer for i know this much that each man has his price and his was higher than yours or mine thats all i know one other thing whenever i hear someone say proud as lucifer i think no proud as private moyes but id no time for philosophy just then i was numb with shock and a blinding pain in my wounded head as they dragged us back to our cell still in mortal fear of our lives someone i believe it was a coolie loosed my bonds and poured water over my face and down my throat and i remember the excruciating pain as the blood flowed back to my hands and fee t gradually it eased and i must have slept in that bed of stinking mud for suddenly i was awake and it was freezing cold and though my skull was still aching dully i was clearheaded and i was alone in the cell and the door was open by the cold and the dim light it could only be dawn and there was a cannonading shaking the ground from not far away it stopped of a sudden with much chinese yelling and then came the crash of exploding armstrongs followed by a distant rattle of musketry growing closer and culminating in a babble of voices cheering more shots and steps pounding outside and a voice bellowing excitedly en avant en avant chat huant chat huant and as i scrambled up soaked in mud i was thinking frogs and bretons at that and i stumbled from the cell into the arms of a big cove in a blue overcoat and kepi who gave back roaring in disgust from this muddy spectre pawing at him this was how it was id been taken prisoner by the tartars on the afternoon of august and carried by them to the village of tangku the last chink outpost before taku forts id been groggy with the clout on my head until next day when wed been dragged out to the yard where moyes was murdered i must have lain in the cell through the next night and when our people attacked tangku at dawn on the th and the chinese fired a few salvoes and abandoned the place leaving us unheeded why there i was where the irishman and the coolies had gone id no notion but i gave it some thought while a frog rifleman helped me back to a field dressingstation and decided to be french for the moment i mortdemavied and sacredblued like anything while an orderly flung water over me to disperse my filth and then clapped a cold compress on my battered scalp i gave him a torrent of garlic gratitude and withdrew from the bedlam of the station muttering like an apache and considering now that the peril was past how to preserve my precious credit you see id grovelled and been seen to grovel to that infernal chink warlord but only by a paddy sergeant who didnt know me from adam besides id been in khaki mufti and so plastered with dung as to be unrecognisable i doubted if the mick had even seen me at the grogcart it had all happened so quickly so now if i minded my step for a while and covered my tracks there was no earthly reason why the inconvenient fenian or anyone else should ever identify the spruce and heroic flashy who would shortly appear at headquarters with the craven scarecrow whod been first to knock head before the heathens feet very good all we needed was a razor and somebodys clean shirt and trousers its a crying shame as i keep telling royal commissions that among all the military manuals there aint a line about foraging and decorating those essential arts whereby the soldier keeps body and soul together in adversity offered to write em one but they wouldnt have it more fool them for ive lifted everything from chickens to crown jewels and could have set generations of young fellows right if theyd let me it was childs play to kit myself out after tangku the two miles back to sinho was a carnival of support troops and baggage following the advance setting up tents and quarters and a great confusion through which i ambled airing my french when i had to and being taken no doubt for a rather unkempt commissariatwallah or a correspondent or a nonconformist missionary within ten minutes id replaced my soiled garments with a fine tussore coat coolie pants solar helmet and umbrella with a handsome morocco toilet case in my back pocket and if you think that outlandish let me tell you that armies were a deal more informally attired in my day campbell at lucknow looked like a bus conductor and old raglan in the crimea appeared to have robbed a jumble sale so when id shaved in a quiet corner got rid of my bandages and covered my cracked sconce with the topi i was in pretty good fig though feeling like a stretcher case i hopped aboard an empty frog ammunition cart going back to sinho spied grants marker by a covered wagon and strolled up to report swinging my gamp two staff infants were within addiscombe all over em hollo my sons cries i cheerily with my head splitting im flashman not a bit of it sit down sit down dont tell me you havent learned the great headquarters rule yet they looked at each other blushing and respectful in the presence of the celebrated beau sabreur no sir says one nervously whats that harkee my boy if bread is the staff of life what is the life of the staff dunno sir says he grinning one long loaf says i winking so take your ease and tell me wheres sir hope grant they said he was with the th and when i inquired for elgin they looked astonished and told me he was back at pehtang you mean ive trekked all across those confounded mudflats for nothing now thats too bad ah well pehtang it must be my compliments to sir hope and tell wolseley that if i hear hes been fleecing you young chaps at piquet ill call him out so long my sons alibi nicely established you see with two gratified young gallopers reporting that flashy had just tooled in from the coast i could now depart for pehtang in the certainty that no one would ever imagine id been near tangku and the scene of my shame its just a question of taking thought and pains and well worth it i was feeling decidedly flimsy by now and wondering if id last as far as pehtang but by good luck the first man i ran into outside grants wagon was nuxban khan whod been second to my bloodbrother ilderim khan in the irregular horse at jhansi he hailed me with a great whoop and roarings in pushtu a huge afghan thug in a sashed coat and enormous topboots grinning all over his dreadful face as he demanded how i did and recalling those happy days when the thugs all but had me outside the ranis pavilion until he and ilderim and the rest of the khyber cooperative society arrived to carve them up so artistically he was a great man now rissaldar in fanes horse and when he heard where i was bound nothing would do but i must travel in style in the regimental gig shall bloody lance walk or ride like a common sowar no by god thoult ride like a rajah old friend ah the colonel husoors pardon for the honour of ilderims band aye ilderim he ate his last salt at cawnpore peace be with him suddenly there were tears running down his evil face bismilah where are such friends as ilderim today or such foes i lave ye seen these tartars bloody lance mice aye but well go mousehunting anon thou and i then he was shouting hey probyn sahib probyn sahib see who is here and now he was making me known to probyn whom id never met tall handsome softspoken probyn whom some called the best irregular cavalryman since skinner he was only a subaltern in his regular regiment yet here he was with an independent command of his own and a vc to boot he in turn presented a few of his officers afghans to a man and as ugly a crowd as ever crossed the border and it made me feel downright odd when he indicated me as flashman bahadur to see how they straightened and beamed and clicked their heels dyou know it was like coming home suddenly among those wicked friendly faces with nuxban exclaiming and probyn smiling and eyeing me respectfully the terror of the past two days melted away and even my head didnt ache so fierce i realised what it was for the first time in china i wasnt alone i had the best army on earth with me the bravest of the brave terrible men who hailed me as a comrade and an admired comrade at that unless your bellys as yellow as mine you cant imagine what it means i felt downright proud and safe at last probyn rode along with me when i rolled off in nuxbans gig and for the first time i had a proper look at the great british and french army camped outside sinho on either side of the causeway road stretched the long lines of tents white and khaki and green with the guidons fluttering and the troops at exercise or loafing here was a company of frogs with their overcoats and great packs countermarching on the right of the road to marche lorraine in competition with a punjabi battalion very trim in beards and tight puggarees drilling to john peel on the left there was a spahi squadron practising wheels at the gallop the long cloaks flying and a line of probyns riders sikhs and afghans in shirtsleeves taking turns to ride full tilt past an officer who was tossing oranges in the air they were taking em with their sabres on the fly roars of applause greeting each successful cut fanes boys will be doing it with grapes tomorrow i expect says probyn i said it was a pity the chinese emperor couldnt see em and be brought to his senses the neat artillery parks and rocket batteries the endless lines of supply carts and ordnance wagons manned by the milling coolie corps whiskered madrassis wrestling in their loincloths brawny gunners playing cricket on a mat wicket bearded sikhs grinding their lancepoints on the emery wheel greenjacketed th riflemen closeorderdrilling like clockwork a squadron of dragoon guards trotting by each pith helmet and sloped sabre at an identical angle royals in their shirtsleeves mingling with the tirailleurs to swap baccy and gossip and something that would have made his celestial majestys eyes start from his princely head two sowars of fanes in full fig being carried carefully to their horses by their mates for guardmounting so that no speck of dust should blemish the perfection of tunic and long boots or the polish of lance sword pistols and carbine probyn eyed them jaundicedlike stroking his fair moustache if they take the stick again fanell be insufferable says he what youd like the manchoo emperor to see all this dont fret old fellah he will he left me at the causeway and i drove on alone to pehtang a motheaten village on the river boasting one decent house where elgin and his staff were quartered i tiffined first with temple of the military train who deafened me with complaints about the condition of our transport poor forage for the beasts useless coolies officers overworked the native ponies were hopeless the notion of issuing a threeday cooked ration in this climate was lunacy and it was a rotten piddling war anyway which no one at home would mind a bit it sounded like every military train id seen frogs just a damned nuisance of course no proper provision an three days late says he with satisfaction how the blazes bonaparte ever got em on parade beats me we should go without em everyone says that about the french and its gospel true until its rosalies breakfast time and then froggyll be first into the breach ahead of us just out of spite elgin was in the backyard of his house stamping about in his shirtsleeves snapping dictation at loch his secretary while my canton inquisitor parkes sat by i heard elgins sharp busy voice before i saw him as i halted in the gateway he turned glaring like a belligerent pickwick and hailed me in midsentence with a bark and a wave and i have the honour to refer your excellency to the superintendents letter of wheneveritwas ha flashman at last and to repeat the assertion wait loch make that warning aye the warning conveyed in my notes of soandso and soandso that unless we have your assurance solemn assurance that our ultimatum will be complied with directly still dictating he rummaged in a lettercase and shoved a packet at me to my astonishment it was addressed in my wifes simpleton scrawl and id have pocketed it but elgin waved me peremptorily to read it so i did while he went on dictating full spate oh my darlingest dear one how i long to see you it began and plunged straight into an account of how mrs potter was positive that the laundry were pinching our best linen sheets and sending back rubbish so she had approved mrs potters purchase of one of williamsons new patent washingmachines and did i think it a great extravagance i am sure it must prove useful and a great saving shirts require no handrubbing qualified engineers are prompt to carry out repairs tho such are seldom necessary mrs potter says she loved me excessively and had noticed in the press an item which she was sure i must find droll a bishops daughter had married the rev edward cheese such a comical name she had been to hanover square to hear mr ryder read macbeth most moving altho shakespeares notions of scottish speech were outlandish and silly and she and jane speedicut had been twice to the pilgrim of love at the haymarket and jane had wept in a most affected way just to attract attention which she neednt have bothered in that unfortunate lilac gown so out of style she missed me and please i must not mind about the washingmachine for if she hadnt mrs p might have given notice little havvy hoped his papa would kill a chinaman and enclosed a picture of jesus which he had drawn at school oh come to us soon soon dear hero to the fond arms of your loving adoring elspeth xxxxx i aint given to sentimental tears but it was a close thing standing in that hot dusty yard with the smell of china in my nostrils holding that letter which i could picture her writing sighing and frowning and nibbling her pen rumpling her golden curls for inspiration burrowing in her dictionary to see how many ss in necessary smiling fondly as she kissed young havvys execrable drawing eleven years old the little brute was and apparently thought christ had a green face and feathers in his hair if shed written pages of undying devotion and slop as she had in our young days id have yawned at it but all the nonsense about washingmachines and macbeth and janes dress and the man cheese was so so like elspeth if you know what i mean and i felt such a longing for her just to sit by her and have her hand in mind and look into those beautiful wide blue eyes and tear off her corset and flashman elgin was grasping my hand demanding my news ha im glad to see you you were despaired of at shanghai the sharp eyes twinkled for an instant so youll write directly to reassure that bonny little wife whose letter i brought hey shes in blooming health well sit down sit down tell me of nanking so i did and he listened with his bare forearms set on the table john bull to the life hed be fifty then the big barbarian as the chinese called him bald as an egg save for a few little white wisps with his bulldog lip and sudden barks of anger or laughter a peppery old buffer and a deal kinder than he looked how many ambassadors would call on a colonels wife to carry a letter to her man and the shrewdest diplomatic of his day hard as a hammer and subtle as a spaniard best of all he had common sense hed made a name in the west indies and canada negotiated the china treaty which we were now going to enforce and had saved india no question by diverting troops from china at the outbreak of the mutiny without waiting orders from home as to his diplomatic style when the yankees still had their eye on canada and looked like trying annexation elgin went through washingtons drawingrooms like a devouring flame wining and dining every southern democrat he could find dazzling em with his blue blood telling em racy stories carrying on like heeryble and hinting ever so delicate that if canada joined the great republic it would give the northern yankees a fine majority in congress with all those longnosed scotch calvinists becoming american voters overnight that set the firebells ringing from charleston to the gulf and with the south suddenly dead set against annexation why canada never did join the usa did she wily birds these earls this ones father had pinched all the best marbles in greece so you could see they were a family to be watched an unsavoury crew of fanatics was his comment when id told him of the taipings well thanks to you we should be able to keep them from shanghai and once the treatys signed their bolts shot the imperial chinese government can set about em in earnest with our tacit support but not our participation eh parkes yes the trouble is my lord says parkes that those two terms have a deplorable habit of becoming synonymous synonymous be damned snaps elgin hmg will not be drawn into war against the taipings wed find ourselves with a new empire in china before we knew it he heaved up from the table and poured coffee from a spirit kettle and i have no intention parkes of presiding over any extension of the area in which we exhibit the hollowness of our christianity and our civilisation coffee flashman yes you can light one of your damned cheroots if you want to but blow the smoke the other way poisoning mankind there you have three of elgins fads all together he hated tobacco was soft on asiatics and didnt care for empirebuilding i recall him on this very campaign saying hed do anything to prevent england calling down gods curse on herself for brutalities committed on yet another feeble oriental race yet he did more to fix and maintain the course of british empire than any man of his day and is remembered for the supreme atrocity ironic aint it the letter hed been dictating had been yet another demand to the local manchoo governor for free passage to pekin which the chinks had previously agreed to and were now hindering for all they were worth as at sinho and tangku perhaps when weve stormed the forts they may realise the folly of resistance says loch he was a tall grave young file with a great beard who looked a muff until you learned hed been a navy middy at aide to gough at adjutant of skinners horse at and come through sutlej and crimea parkes laughed why should they the emperors not there he wont suffer nor his ministers prince sang and the like who feed him vain lies about sweeping us into the sea the emperor believes them the decree goes forth the local commanders put up a futile fight and send wild accounts to pekin of how theyve licked us so the fools encouraged in his folly and all his concubines clap their little hands and tell him hes lord of creation hes bound to learn the truth eventually though in the imperial palace my dear loch its another world suppose they do learn theyve lost sinho for example it wont have happened before their eyes at pekin so it simply didnt happen you see thats chinese imperial logic whos prince sang i asked remembering the swine whod had moyes butchered and to whom id kowtowed a brute and a firebrand grunts elgin prince sangkolinsen our fellows call him sam collinson mongol general commanding the emperors forces hes in the taku forts this minute which is why well certainly have to fight for them nuff said id met prince sang i asked when wed advance on the forts and he glowered and said in a week twiddling his scanty wing of hair a sure sign of irritation were too damned cumbersome by half says he i told palmerston five thousand men would do but no parliament thinks were still fighting the damned bengal sepoys so we must have three times that number he champed and snorted tugging away a confounded waste of men material and time wait till the commons get the bill though and to be sure the fools of public will ask what it was for theyll expect victories a dozen vcs and enough blood and massacre to make their flesh creep well theyll not get em if i can help it this is not a war but an embassy and this is not an expeditionary force its an escort hed gone quite pink and by the way parkes was pulling his nose and loch studying the distance i could guess it was a wellplayed air after a moment he left off trying to pull his hair loose our assault on taku will take a week to prepare because the field command changes daily to keep the french happy grant handed over to montauban during our attack on sinho if you please oh twas safe enough and montaubans a sensible man but its not a system that makes for expedition wed have been better with a small mobile force and no french ah well he gave his hair a final wrench and suddenly grinned we shall have to see eh loch as our old nurses would have said a sair fecht for your benefit parkes that means a long weary struggle how long i asked parkes when he showed me to my billet and he pursed his lips officially to pekin oh a month perhaps six weeks god save us you aint serious i try to be elgins perfectly correct were too many and sir hope with his many fine qualities is methodical what with the french and the manchoos lying and procrastinating at every step well as his lordships interpreter i expect to be chinchinning to chinamen quite excessively he paused in my doorway and gave a resigned sigh ah well at least it should be a quiet little war we dine at six by the way a coat is sufficient the great taku forts went down on the st as advertised to the astonishment of the manchoos who thought them impregnable and the chagrin of the frogs who had violently opposed grants plan of attack they wanted to assail the forts on both sides of the river grant said no settle the great north fort and the jobs done montauban squawked and hooted saying it was an affront to military science but grant just shook his head north fort goes restll submit youll see bonjour and carried on humming bullfiddle tunes his force might be unwieldy as elgin said but it was damned expert he built two miles of road to the approaches had volunteers swimming the river by night to mine the defences hammered the place with siege guns and a naval bombardment and sent in the infantry with pontoons and ladders to carry the walls and sure enough the infuriated crapauds made sure they got in first your correspondent bore no part beyond loafing up when the chinese guns had been safely silenced to offer cheer and comfort to major temple before the final assault a week ago hed been damning his coolies for useless but now he was in a desperate fret for their welfare they were to carry in the scaling ladders in the teeth of cannon jingalfire spears stinkpots and whatever else the manchoos were hurling from the walls and temple the ass was determined to go in with them i found him croaking under his brolly waiting for the word but for once his complaint wasnt a military one these bloody magistrates cries he have you seen the china mail heenans been held to bail at derby an he an sayers are to be charged with assault damned nonsense why cant they leave sport alone ahah he roars waving to the frog colonel ready are we sortons is that it come on you chaps china forever and he was away bounding over the ditches with his yellow mob at his heels and the frog infantry in full cry bursting with la gloire they had warm work crossing the moats and canals but they and our own th and th carried the walls with the bayonet and as grant had said out came the white silk flags on the other forts four hundred manchoos were killed out of five hundred we lost about and ten times as many wounded the coolies behaved famously temple said parkes and loch and i were in the party sent across the river to arrange terms with hangfu the local mandarin a leery ancient with the opium shakes who received us in a garden sitting on a chair of state with a mighty block of ice underneath to keep him cool and his minions carrying his spectacles and chopsticks and silver watch in embroidered cases he served us champagne but when parkes demanded a signed surrender the old fox said he darent not being military and prince sang had already left upriver parkes then came all over diplomatic promising to blow the forts to kingdom come at which hangfu said well the emperor would be graciously pleased to give us temporary occupation of them and we could take our gunboats up to tientsin parkes almost had to take him by the throat to get it in writing and then we ploughed back to the boat in the dark past the huge gloomy fortbuildings with slowfuse mines which the chinks had thoughtfully left behind exploding here and there i was never so glad to get back to a boat in my life so now the way was clear and with the gunboats leading the way up the twisty moonlit river it began the famous march on pekin the last great stronghold on earth that had never seen a white soldier the forbidden city of the oldest of civilisations the capital of the world to the chinese having dominion over all mankind and now the foreign devils were coming the whining pipes echoing out across the sodden plain the jaunty little poilus with their kepis tilted stepping it out the jingling troopers of fanes and probyns with the sun atwinkle on their lanceheads the buffs swinging by to the odd little march that handel wrote for them the artillery limbers churning up the mud the hampshire yokels and lothian ploughboys the sikhs and mahrattas and punjabis mccleverty hare to the waist in the prow of his gunboat wolseley halting his pony to sketch a group of coolies napier riding silent shading his eyes ahead elgin sitting under the awning of coromandel fanning himself with his hat and reading the origin of species montauban careering up and down the columns with great dash chattering to his staff grant standing by the roadside tugging his grizzled whiskers and touching his cap to the troops who cheered him as they marched by fifteen thousand horse foot and guns rolling up the peiho not to fight or to hold or to conquer but just so that the big barbarian could stand before the son of heaven and watch him put his mark on paper and when he does says elgin the ends of the earth will have met at last and there will be no more savage kings for our people to subdue weve come a long way from our northern forests i wonder if we were wise the chinese evidently thought not for having given us fawning assurance of free passage and no resistance they hampered us every yard to tientsin transport and beasts had vanished from the country the local officials used every excuse to delay us and to make things worse the weather was at extremes of broiling heat and choking dust or deluges of rain and axledeep mud fortunately the manchoos hadnt had the wit to break bridges or block channels and the peasantry with a fine disregard for imperial policy were perfectly ready to repair our road and sell us beef and mutton fruit vegetables and ice at twenty times their proper price snug on coromandel i could endure our leisurely progress but parkes was plumb in the path of all the manchoos growing insolence and deceit and i could see his official smile getting tighter by the hour at this rate we may reach pekin by christmas the more we submit to their lies and hindrance the less they respect us he was at the rail glaring coldly at the glittering saltheaps that lined the banks below tientsin in after we shelled canton the river banks were black with chinese kowtowing you will observe sir harry that they do not kowtow today much as i admire our chief i cannot share his recentlyexpressed satisfaction that in these enlightened times we no longer require every chinaman to take off his hat to us but even elgins patience was beginning to wear thin somehow he preserved a placid politeness through every meeting with manchoo officials who barely concealed their satisfaction in wasting time and frustrating our progress but afterwards hed be in a fever to get on snapping at us tugging his fringe urging grant and montauban with an energy that stopped just short of rudeness montauban would bridle and grant would nod and then we staffmen would get pepper again he was bedevilled trying to keep the chinks sweet and the advance moving fearful of provoking downright hostility but knowing that every hour lost was time for the war party in pekin to get their nerve back after taku we knew sangkolinsen was back in the capital urging resistance and elgin in his impatience was being tempted by a new manchoo ploy speedy passage to pekin in return for a promise of active british help against the taipings which he darent concede or bluntly refuse it took us ten crawling days to cover sixty miles to tientsin a stinkhole of saltheaps and pidogs and smiling manchoo mandarins sent by pekin to negotiate our further progress they talked for a full week while parkes risked apoplexy and elgin nodded gravely with his lip stuck out finally after interminable discussion they agreed that we might advance to tangchao eleven miles from pekin provided we didnt take artillery or too many gunboats to alarm the people and from there elgin and baron gros might go into pekin with a thousand cavalry for escort and sign the damned treaty it seemed too good to be true although grant looked grim at the smallness of the escort but elgin accepted hiding his satisfaction and then the mandarins smiling more politely than ever said of course they couldnt confirm these arrangements but doubtless pekin would do so if we were patient a little longer if bismarck or disraeli or metternich had had to sit through those interminable hours listening to those bland lying old dotards and then received that slap in the face i swear theyd have started to scream and smash the furniture elgin didnt even blink he listened to parkess nearchoked translation of that astounding insolence thanked the mandarins for their courtesy stood up bowed and told parkes almost offhand to pass em the word that they now owed britain four million quid for delays and damage to our expedition oh aye and the treaty would now contain a clause opening tientsin to european trade back on coromandel he was grimly satisfied their bad faith affords the perfect excuse for proceeding to pekin forthwith sir hope the army will nolonger halt when discussions take place if they want to talk well do it on the march and if they dont like it and want a fight they can have it suddenly everyone was grinning even parkes was delighted although he confided to me later that elgin should have taken a high hand sooner elgin himself looked ten years younger now that hed cast the die but i thought exuberance had got the better of him when he strode into the saloon later threw the origin of species on the table and announced its very original no doubt but not for a hot evening what i need is some trollop i couldnt believe my ears and him a churchgoer too well my lord i dunno says i tientsin aint much of a place but ill see what i can drum up michels been reading dr thorne since taku cries he he must have finished it by now surely ask him flashman will you so i did and had my ignorance enlightened it was bundle and go now we left nd division at tientsin shed all surplus gear and cracked away at twice our previous pace while the manchoos plagued elgin with appeals to stop the advance they would appoint new commissioners they had further proposals there must be a pause for discussion and elgin replied agreeably that hed talk to em at tangchao as agreed the manchoos were frantic and now we saw something new great numbers of refugees ordinary folk streaming towards us from pekin in evident fear of what would happen when we arrived they flooded past us men women and children with their possessions piled on rickety carts i remember one enormous mongol wheeling four women in a barrow but no sign of armed opposition and when our local guides and drivers decamped one night spirits were so high that no one minded and admiral hope and bowlby the times correspondent took over as muleskinners whooping and hawing like deadwood dick we swung on upriver the gunboats keeping pace and the frog band thumping madelon for now pekin was barely thirty miles ahead and we were going to see the elephant at last seven thousand cavalry and infantry ready for anything not that it mattered for the manchoo protests had subsided to whines of resignation and we were coming home on a tight rein hurrah boys hurrah and the dragon waited it happened the day after we held divine service in a big temple and afterwards there was much fun while we looked over a book of pictures which beato whod been photographing the march presented to elgin word came that new manchoo commissioners including the famous prince i were waiting just up ahead at tangchao and they hoped the army would camp on the near side of the town while we negotiated the details of elgins entry to pekin go and see him says elgin to parkes so on the monday in the cool of a beautiful dawn about thirty of us set out to ride ahead there was parkes loch de normann from bruces office bowlby of the times and myself with six dragoon guards and twenty of fanes sowars under young anderson as escort walker the qmg and thompson of the commissariat rode along to inspect the camp site we trotted up the dusty road myself in the lead as senior officer with parkes to our right was the river half a mile off and on our left empty plain and millet fields to the horizon beyond a little village we were met by a mandarin with a small troop of tartar cavalry who said he would show us our campsite it proved to be to the right of the road where the river took a great loop near a village called fiveli point walker and i thought it would do although hed have preferred to be closer to the river for water the mandarin assured us that water would be brought to us and as we rode on he chatted amiably to parkes and me telling us hed been in command of the garrison wed defeated at sinho as you can see he touched the button on his hat it was white not red i was also degraded by losing my peacock feather he added grinning like a corpse and parkes and i made sounds of commiseration oh it is no matter cries he lost honours can be regained as confucius says be patient and at last the mulberry leaf will become a silk robe i remember the proverb because it was just then that i chanced to look round the six dragoons had been riding immediately behind parkes and me since we set out in double file but id paid em no special heed and it was only as i glanced idly back that i saw one of them was watching me staring at me dammit with the oddest fixed grin he was a typical burly heavy with a face as red as his coat under the pith helmet and i was just about to ask what the devil he meant by it when his grin broadened and in that moment i knew him and knew that he knew me it was the irishman whod been beside me when moyes was killed i must have gaped like an idiot and then i was facing front again chilled with horror this was the man whod seen me grovelling to sam collinson my abject companion in shame and here he was riding at my shoulder like bloody nemesis no doubt on the point of denouncing me to the world as a poltroon its a great thing to have a conscience as guilty as mine i can tell you it always makes you fear far more than the worst my god and yet it couldnt be the irishman had been a sergeant of the th this was a trooper of dragoon guards i must be mistaken he hadnt been staring at me at all he must have been grinning at some joke of his mates when id caught his eye and my terrified imagination was doing the rest where the hell dyou think youre goin nolan it was the dragoon corporal just behind keep in file nolan that had been the name moyes had spoken oh god it was him right enough i darent look round id give myself away for certain i must just ride on chatting to parkes as though nothing had happened and god knows what i said or how much farther we rode for i was aware of nothing except that my cowardly sins had found me out at last you may think i was in a great stew over nothing what had the great flashy to fear from the memory of a mere lout of a trooper after all a hell of a deal says i as youll see but if i was in a state of nervous funk for the rest of the day i remember the business we did well enough at tangchao we met the great prince i the emperors cousin a tall skinny crow of a manchoo in gorgeous green robes with all his nails cased he looked at us as if we were dirt and when parkes said we hoped the arrangements agreed for elgins entry to pekin were still satisfactory to their side he hissed like an angry cat nothing can be discussed until the barbarian leader has withdrawn his presumptuous request for an audience with the son of heaven and begged our pardon he does not come to pekin parkes to my surprise just smiled at him as though he were a child and said they must really talk about something important elgin was going to pekin and the emperor would receive him now then at this prince i went wild spitting curses calling parkes a foreign cur and reptile and i dont know what and parkes just smiled away and said elgin would be there and that was that and in this way the time passed until six oclock when prince i had cursed himself hoarse then parkes got up repeated for the four hundredth time that elgin was going to pekin and suddenly prince i said very well with a thousand cavalry as agreed then in double time he and parkes settled the wording of a proclamation informing the public that peace and harmony were the order of the day and we retired to the quarters that had been prepared for us and had dinner who said the chinese were negotiators scoffs parkes the mans a fool and a fraud he caved in very suddenly says loch dyou trust him no but i dont need to their goose is cooked loch and they know it and because they cant abide it they squeal like children in a tantrum and if he goes back on his word tomorrow it doesnt matter because the big barbarian is going to pekin anyway it was arranged that in the morning while de normann and bowlby would stay in tangchao with anderson and the sowars the rest of us would return to the army parkes and loch to report to elgin walker and ito guide them to the camp site the others turned in early except for parkes who had invited one of the lesser mandarins over for a chat so i retired to the verandah to rehearse my anxieties for the umpteenth time able to sweat and curse in private at last nolan knew me what would he say what could he say suppose he told the shameful truth would anyone believe him never but why should he say anything dammit hed grovelled too i went all through my horrid fears again and again pacing in the dark little garden away from the house chewing my cheroot fiercely what would he say a foine evenin colonel was what in fact he said and i spun round with an oath there he was by the low wall at the garden foot standing respectfully to attention rot him the trooper out for an evening stroll greeting his superior with all decorum i choked back a raging question and forced myself to say nonchalantly why i didnt see you there my man yes a fine evening i hoped to god it was too shadowy for him to see me trembling i lit another cheroot and he moved forward a step beg pardon sorr dont ye remember me i had myself in hand now what youre one of the dragoons arent you yes sorr i mean afore that sorr he had one of those soft whiny nutatahl irish brogues which i find especially detestable whin i wuz in the th afore dey posted me to the heavies shure an its just a month since i think ye mind foine sorry my boy says i pleasantly my heart hammering i dont know much of the th and i certainly dont know you i gave him a nod goodnight i was turning away when his voice stopped me suddenly soft and hard together oh but ye do sorr an i know you an we both know where it wuz at tangku when moyes got kilt what should an innocent man say to that ill tell you he turns sharp frowning bewildered when who was killed what the devil are you talking about are you drunk man no sorr im not drunk nor i wuznt drunk then you wuz in the yard at tangku whin they made us bow down to yon chink bastard silence youre drunker than davids sow youre raving now look here my lad you cut along to your billet and ill say no more oh but ye will ye will

what your game is but another word from you and ill get you a bloody back for your damned insolence dye hear i towered outraged glaring like a colonel im a patient man nolan but it was out before i knew it and he saw the blunder as soon as i did the eyes bulged with triumph in his crimson face whuts dat nolan dye say an if ye dont know me how the hell dye know me name den in fact id heard his corporal use it that day but in my panic i remembered only moyes at the grogcart i was speechless and he rattled on excitedly it wuz you by the virgin it wuz you in that yard crawlin wid the rest on

flash harry the famous afghan hero him that wan the cross at lucknow an kilt all the ruskis an that shure tis the bravest man in tharmy so it is dals whut they said he paused getting his breath back in his excitement and for the life of me i could only mouth at him he stepped closer breathing whisky at me an i sez nuthin but i thinks is that a fact now cos i seen him when he wuznt bein so bloody heroical lickin a chinese niggers boots an whinin fer his life if id been heeled id have shot him then and there and damn the consequences for there was no doubt he had me or where he was going he

talk colonel ugly talk ye know what i mean bad for the credit o tharmy aye a bloody backs a sore thing so it is but it heals fastern a blown reppitation he paused a moment id think meself itd be worth keepin quiet wouldnt you colonel i could bluster still or not better not it would be a waste of time this was a cunning swine if he spread his story as well as hed summed it up i was done for disgraced ruined i knew my army you see and the jealousies and hatreds under the hearty grins oh i didnt lack for enemies whod delight in sniffing it all out prying till they found carnac compared dates put two and two together where had i been on august eh even if i could bluff it away the mud would stick and this sly peasant could see clear through he knew he didnt have to prove a thing that being guilty id be ready to fork out to prevent any breath of rumour sir harry are you there it was parkess voice calling sharply from the verandah twenty yards away his figure was silhouetted against the glow from the house sir harry nolan took a swift step back into the shadows tis another word well be havin tomorrow colonel eh he whispered until den i heard his soft chuckle as i turned to the house still stricken dumb with parkes crying ah there you are care for a nightcap how much sleep i got you may imagine i couldnt defy the brute the question was whether it was safer to pay squeeze and risk his blabbing another day or kill him and try to make it look accidental that was how desperate i was and it was still unresolved when we saddled up at dawn to ride back to the army as the party fell in under the trees a sudden reckless devil took hold of me and i told the dragoon corporal id inspect the escort parkes cocked an amused eyebrow at this military zeal while the corporal bawled his troopers into mounted line i rode slowly along surveying each man carefully while they sweated in the sun i checked one for a loose girth asked the youngest how long hed been in china and came to nolan on the end staring redfaced to his front a fly settled on his cheek and his lip twitched let it be my boy says i jocularlike if a fly can sit still so can you name and service nolan sorr twelve years his brow was running wet but he sat like a statue wondering what the hell i was about trahnsferred las month sir when th went dahn to shangai says the corporal cavalry trained tho in the skins i blieve whyd you transfer nolan i asked idly and he couldnt keep his voice steady if ye please sorr i i tuk a fancy to see peekin sorr looking for excitement eh i smiled capital very good corporal form up if you ask what i was up to why i was taking a closer look by daylight and unsettling the bastard it never hurts but it was a wasted effort for in the next hour everything changed and even disgrace and reputation ceased to matter almost the road had been empty coming up but from the moment we left tangchao we were aware of a steady movement of imperial troops a few odd platoons and halfsections at first and then larger numbers not only on the road but in the paddy and milletfields either side what seemed most odd they were moving in the same direction as ourselves towards our army i didnt like the look of em above half but there was nothing to do but forge ahead we rode at a steady canter for about an hour past increasing numbers and when we came to changkiawan about halfway home the town was thick with them and there was no doubt of it we were in the middle of a thumping big imperial army parkes wanted to stop to make inquiries the ass but as senior officer i wouldnt allow it and we cantered out of the place and had to skirt the road to pass a full regiment of bannermen great ugly devils in bamboo armour who scowled and shouted abuse at us as we thundered by what can this mean cries parkes as we drew clear they cannot intend to put themselves in sir hopes way surely they aint going to a field day says i colonel walker how many dyou reckon weve come through ten thousand easily says he but god knows how many there are in the milletfields those stalks are fifteen feet high take the rear and keep em closed up says i forward my dear sir harry cries parkes surely we should stop and consider what is to be done whats to be done is get to the army close up there but my dear sir they cannot mean any treachery i mr parkes says i when youve ridden through as many armies as i have you learn how to smell mischief and its breasthigh here i can tell you but we must not exhibit any signs of distrust right you are says i anyone who pukes or soils himself will answer to me which had the troopers hawhawing while parkes looked furious really sir if they intended any harm would they advance in full view why the country to our right is quite clear so it was and the millet was so high to the left that for a moment we seemed all alone i glanced right and walker was doing the same thing our eyes met and i grabbed parkess bridle as we rode heading him out to the right while he demanded to know what i was about youll see i told him what walker and i had noticed was a big nullah away on the right and now we went for it full lick turning down its lip as we reached it and parkes gave a great cry of astonishment and would have reined in but i kept him going in full view eh says i that settles it there were three thousand tartar horsemen in that nullah if there was one dismounted with drawn sabres and they gave a great roar at the sight of us but now i had us heading left again towards the road and the little village beyond which lay the campsite to which our army would presently be advancing as we thundered past it a little group of horsemen broke cover led by a mandarin who yelled at us to keep away beyond him i could see the guns in the trees masked battery cries walker jesus look at that as we came through the fringe of trees to the campsite the whole eastern horizon seemed to be moving immediately to our left a long bund stretched away and it was lined with heavy guns covering the campsite in the millet behind the bund the country was alive with tiger soldiers the black and yellow stripes clear to be seen but on the eastern flank of the plain was the sight that had brought walker up in his stirrups long lines of tartar cavalry advancing at the walk thousands upons thousands of them we raced out into the unoccupied campsite and suddenly parkes reined in whitefaced sir harry stop if you please i reined up and the whole troop followed sir harry i am returning to tangchao i must inform prince i of this this extraordinary proceeding i couldnt believe it and then i realised his pallor wasnt fear but anger he was in a positive fury so help me good god i cried dyou think he doesnt know it is impossible that he should mr loch will you return to lord elgin at once and inform him of what is happening sir harry i must ask for a small escort if you please one trooper will be sufficient im a trueblue craven as you know but im also too old a soldier to waste time raving youll never come out alive says i no you are mistaken i shall be perfectly safe my person is inviolate dye know it was on the tip of my tongue to holler it may be in bloody lilac stripes for all the good itll do you but i kept a grip thinking in the saddle it must be a good ten miles to the army with god knew how many chinese along the road if there was trouble it would be here and the risk of cutting and running was appalling the prospect of returning to tangchoa was even worse except for one thing parkes was right he was inviolate whoever the chinks cut up it wouldnt be her majestys biggest diplomatic gun bar elgin himself they wouldnt dare that it came home to me with blinding clarity that the one safe place in the whole ugly mess was alongside h parkes esq very good mr parkes says i ill ride with you corporal detail two dragoons as escort mr loch take one trooper ride to the army inform sir hope and lord elgin colonel walker remain here with the rest of the party to observe retire at discretion corporal i drew him aside he was a rangy lanternjawed roughneck with a tight chinstrap if it gets ugly scatter and ride through dye hear get to grant whatever anyone else says tell him flashy says close up mind that im counting on you mr loch what the dooce are you waiting for be off at a steady canter dont run mr parkes i suggest we lose no time doing my duty by the army you see before bolting to what i hoped to god was safety i glanced round tartar cavalry two miles to the left closing slowly masked batteries on the bund and now the concealed tartars emerging from the nullah to the right streaming down in a great mass the campsite was a deathtrap but grant would steer clear of it i slapped parkess screw and we raced away the two dragoons at our heels back through the trees and on to the tangchoa road before wed gone a mile i was breathing easy whether all the troops wed seen coming down had now reached the campsite i dont know but the way was clear and when we met chinese they didnt attempt to stay us we were in tangchoa under the hour and while parkes hurried off to find prince i i set the dragoons searching for anderson and the others it was only then that i realised one of my dragoons was nolan hollo thinks i we may find advantage in this yet tangchoa aint a big place and i found two sikh troopers near the bazaar bowlby sahib was buying silk says they grinning and sure enough he was festooned in the stuff with his money on the table while the vendor shook his sticks to determine the price with anderson and de normann chaffing and half a dozen sowars chortling round the stall i cant gamble with times money bowlby was laughing pink in the face delane will go through my accounts himself i tell you i say anderson tell him to name a price and ill cough it up hang it i tapped andersons arm everyone to the square quietly in twos and threes no fuss were riding in ten minutes good boy anderson he nodded called a joke to de normann passed word to his jemadar and the sikhs began to drift off slow and easy i left him to bring bowlby and went to find another horse from our two remounts i ride thirteen stone and if there was one thing i wanted it was a fresh beast anderson had his troop ready in the square by the temple loafing so as not to attract notice i was glad to see and there was nothing to do but wait for parkes and tell de normann and bowlby what had happened it was roasting hot now in the dusty square the beasts stamped and jingled and the sowars yawned and spat while anderson strolled hands in pockets whistling my nerves were stretching i can tell you when there was a clatter of hooves and who should it be but loch with two sowars carrying white flags on their lancepoints and young brabazon a staffwalloper yes loch had seen grant and after reporting had felt bound to return for parkes and me he said it almost apologetically blinking and stroking his beard while i marvelled at human folly the imps were in greater force than ever at the campsite and in lochs opinion presenting a most threatening appearance but while montauban had been all for a frontal attack grant was sitting tight to give us time to get clear that cheered me up for if he didnt advance the imps would have nothing to shoot at and all might blow over but it was still gruelling work waiting for parkes i beguiled the time trying to think of fatal errands on which i might despatch trooper nolan who was sitting aside puffing his pipe his bright little eyes sliding every so often in my direction suddenly here was parkes riding alone pausing to scribble furiously in his notebook and in a fine taking i am out of all patience with i snaps he he is a lying scoundrel sam collinson has been at work stirring up resistance and what dyou think i had the effrontery to say that it is all our fault for insisting on lord elgins entering pekin you said that says loch puzzled what of course not i said it cries parkes and as gods my witness they began to discuss the personal pronoun one thing rapidly became clear the chinks had repudiated the agreement made only yesterday and were now vowing that unless elgin withdrew his demand they were ready to fight there can be no peace prince i had shouted at parkes it must be war i gave the word to anderson and we were off at the canter stretching to a gallop as we left the town with luck we might pass through before the explosion came but barely a mile out on the road parkess horse fell and although he remounted i could see that his beast and de normanns would never stay the course i slowed to a trot wondering what the devil to do if it came to the pinch they could damned well take their chance but for the moment we must hold together and hope by god it was a long ride with my ears straining for the first crack of gunfire ahead if only grant held off a little longer we passed through changkiawan again in a solid phalanx with the sikh sowars around us thrusting by main force through streets choked with jingalmen and tiger soldiers who sneered and spat but kept their distance from those razorsharp lanceheads then we were out and trotting down the long slope towards the distant campsite the plain either side was black with imps foot and horse the huge coloured banners were streaming in the breeze paper standards were flapping and filling their horns were blaring and cymbals clashing every group we passed turned to scream execrations at us suddenly before us was a troop of manchoo artillery absolutely slewing round their great dragonheaded brass pieces to threaten us i looked back de normann and bowlby had fallen behind on their foundering hacks and parkes seized my elbow sir harry sir harry we must decide what is best to be done theyre smart in the diplomatic you know and in a moment the others had caught fire from his inspiration loch said that in such moments decisions should be arrived at quickly de normann urged the necessity of calm and brabazon cried out that since parkes was the chief negotiator he must say how we should proceed shut your bloody trap i roared anderson wheel right f there was a way through for anyone lucky enough to have a fresh horse anyway it was beyond the big nullah where we might skirt round to the army we swung off the road and in that moment there was a thunderous roar of cannon from far ahead and i knew the masked batteries were in action a breathless pause and then as armstrong shells began to burst among the imps pandemonium broke loose i yelled to anderson to hold them together as we surged forward through the milling infantry and here was bowlby clattering up brandishing his pistol now well see how these yellow fellows can fight cries he i roared to him to holster his piece heard parkes yelling in front of me and saw that he and loch had reined up by a little silk pavilion where a mandarin was sitting a tartar pony with officers at his back it was our acquaintance of yesterday who had lost his spurs at sinho as i rode up to them parkes was shouting something about safeconduct but now there was a crowd of angry imps in the way theyd spotted us as enemy clever lads and were crowding in waving fists and spears suddenly there seemed to be contorted yellow faces all round us screaming hate above the din i heard the mandarin cry out something about a prince then parkes was calling across the crowd to me wait for us sir harry prince and then he and loch and one of the sowars were galloping off with the mandarin come back i roared parkes you idiot for it was plain that our one hope was the mandarin and we should all stay with him roaring to anderson to hold on i drove through the press in pursuit by the time id cleared that howling mob my quarry was wheeling into a gully a furlong ahead and i cursed and thundered after them i plunged into the gully and there they were not twenty paces off reined up before a group of magnificentlyarmoured manchoo horsemen banners planted in the turf beside them and parkes was pointing to the white rag on the sowars lancepoint i pulled up and the leader of the manchoos was standing in his stirrups screaming with laughter which seemed damned odd till i saw who it was prince sangkolinsen in fine voice he was you ask safeconduct foreign filth crawling savages you who would shame the son of heaven and who come now treacherously to attack us barbarian lice offal and now you come whining the rest was lost in howls of hatred as his followers closed in i saw parkes struggling with a mounted rider and thought mcnaghten loch was knocked flying from the saddle and the sikh was thrashing with his lance as they bore him down i didnt linger i was round and out of that gully like a guilty squirrel and slap in front of me was a boiling crowd of imp braves with andersons party struggling desperately in the middle a musket barked and i saw a sikh reel in the saddle then the sabres were out sikhs and dragoons laying about them with anderson yelling to close up a ragged volley of musketry a sikh going down the answering crash of revolver fire bowlby blazing away wildeyed until he was dragged from the saddle nolan bleeding from a swordcut on the brow as he drove through the press i heard him shriek as he pitched forward over his horses head into the crush it didnt matter now i stared appalled at that hideous mкlйe and turned to flee but they were streaming out of the gully too tiger soldiers with drawn swords and at their head the whitebutton mandarin and half a dozen mounted monsters in black bamboo armour and helmets brandishing pennoned spears and screaming blue murder i put my beast to the bank he scrambled up reared and fell back and i rolled clear just in time there was a sidegully and i raced up it howling as i went and came down headlong over a pile of stones i scrambled afoot mouthing vainly for help there wasnt a friendly soul in sight loch and parkes might be dead by now hacked to pieces well by god thinks i if it must be ill make a better end than that i swung to face them whipping out my sabre and dropping a hand to my pistolbutt as that devils horde bore down on me even for old flashy you see there comes the moment when you realise that after a lifetime of running you cant run any longer and theres only one thing for it i gritted my teeth and ran at them spun the weapons in my hands and bawled in my best chinese quarter i surrender im a british staff colonel and you touch me at your peril my sword your excellency for a welldecorated hero ive done a deal of surrendering in my time which is doubtless why i remain a welldecorated hero pipers fort balaclava cawnpore appomattox i suppose i cant count little big horn because the uncivilised rascals wouldnt accept it try as i might and various minor capitulations and if theres one thing ive learned which young military men should bear in mind its that the foeman is generally as glad to accept your surrender as you are to give it mind you he may turn spiteful later when hes got you snug and helpless but thats a risk you must run you know most of my captors have been decent enough the chinese were not youd have thought the trouble i saved em they might have shown me some consideration but they didnt for two days i was confined in a stinking wooden cage no bigger than a trunk unable to stand or lie but only to crouch painfully while i was exhibited in the temple square at tangchao to a jeering mob who spat and poked and shovelled ordure through the bars i was given no food or drink beyond a filthy rag soaked in water without which id have died but i was in paradise compared with parkes and loch who had survived only to be dragged to the board of punishments in pekin the worst of it was not knowing what would they do to me where were the others what had happened at fiveli point the manchoo thugs who guarded my cage and egged on the mob to torment me gloated about the terrible slaughter theyd inflicted on our army which i knew was lies for they couldnt have licked grant and why wasnt tangchoa choked with prisoners like myself but i didnt know that in fact grant had thrashed their ambush out of sight with our cavalry driving twenty thousand tartar horsemen pellmell and even riding round the walls of tangchoa before withdrawing to grants new position at changkiawan nor could i guess that elgin was furiously demanding our release or that the manchoos were refusing even to talk it beats belief but those lordly idiots at the imperial court still wouldnt accept the evidence of their senses no their army hadnt been driven like sheep no it was impossible that the insolent barbarians could approach pekin no it wasnt happening at all so they were telling each other with sangkolinsen and prince i spitting venom into the ear of their imbecilic emperor convincing the poor dupe that the sound of our guns twenty miles away was merely our last despairing gasp and that presently we should be laid in the dust at his feet they were ready to try to prove it too as you shall see i knew only from my guards that pekin had proclaimed that we prisoners would be executed the moment our army advanced i hadnt heard thank god that elgins reply was a flat defiance he was coming to pekin and if a hair of our heads was hurt god help the emperor looking back now in safety i can say he was right if hed weakened those manchoo idiots would have thought theyd won and murdered us in sheer gloating exuberance for thats their style but as long as he was coming on with blood in his eye they held their hands out of secret fear and he was coming the big barbarian at the double and tugging his hair even while i crouched in that hellish cage and while they were dying by inches in the board of punishments grant was throwing aside his map and thrusting his sgian dhu into his boot and montauban was haranguing his poilus as they stuffed their cartridgepouches it was different then touch a briton and the lion roared once and sprang they came like a whirlwind on the third day of our captivity with a thundrous prelude of artillery that had me craning vainly at the thick wooden bars the townsfolk scattered in panic to get out of the way as chinese troops came pouring through the square horse foot and guns streaming through to the pekin road i was croaking with hope expecting any moment to see the beards and puggarees and lanceheads galloping into view when i was dragged from my cage and hauled before an armoured horseman my cramped limbs wouldnt answer at first but when they lashed my wrists by a long rein to his crupper and the swine set off up the street well its astonishing how you can hobble when you have to i knew if i fell id be dragged and flayed to pieces so i ran stumbling with my arms being halftorn from their sockets fortunately the road was so crowded with troops that he couldnt go above a trot we must have been about a mile beyond the town and more artillery was booming close at hand when we came in view of an enormous bridge built of great marble blocks it must have been thirty yards wide by three hundred long spanning the muddy yellow peiho this was the bridge of pahlichao and here i saw an amazing sight on the approaches to the bridge and for miles to my left was drawn up the chinese imperial army ive heard there were thirty thousand id say double that number but no matter they stood in perfect parade order regiment on regiment stretching away as far as i could see tartar cavalry in their coloured coats and conical fur hats lances at rest rank after rank of massive bannermen in clumsy armour and barred helms tiger soldiers like yellow harlequins chanting their warsong robed jingalmen two to a piece their fuses smouldering halfnaked mongol infantry like stone buddhas with drawn swords armoured horsemen with long spears and antique firearms their wide plated coatskirts giving them the appearance of gigantic beetles pigtailed musketeers in pyjama dresses of black silk and yellow pillbox hats batteries of their ridiculous artillery longbarrelled ancient cannon with muzzles carved in fantastic dragon mouths the stone shot piled beside them crashing out ragged salvoes that shook the ground and over all fluttered banners of every hue and design shimmering in the sunrise great paper tigers and hideouslyfeatured effigies to frighten the enemy above the explosion of the guns rose the hellish din of gongs and cymbals and fifes and rattles and fireworks china hurling defiance at the barbarians the noise swelled to a deafening crescendo as the guns fell silent then it too died to a conclusion and through the ranks of the tremendous host swept a roar of human sound pealing out into a final great shout and then silence silence a dead eery quiet over the flat fields before the army stretching off into the eastern haze nothing to be heard but the soft flap of a silk banner the clink of a stirrupiron the gentle swirl of a tiny dustdevil on the marble flags of the bridge until out of the hazy distance came the faroff voice of a bugle followed by the faintest of whispers down the wind a piper playing highland laddie and the great imperial army bristled down its length like an angry cat and the horns and cymbals blared again in deafening reply my horseman gave an angry shout and spurred up the bridge so suddenly that i was thrown off my feet and dragged across the flags until i managed to stumble up after him he cast me loose before a knot of mounted officers on the summit their leader was an ugly pockmarked mandarin in black plate armour and a pagoda helmet who flourished a fightingiron at me throw this pig in with the rest of the herd he bawls and i saw that behind him on the parapet was another of their infernal cages an iron one this time as long as an omnibus containing half a dozen ragged wretches i was seized and thrust up on to the parapet and through the low iron door a cry of astonishment met me and then brabazon was gripping my hand a ragged holloweyed brabazon with his arm in a tattered sling he was as filthy as i colonel flashman youre alive oh thank god thank god youre safe sir you call this safe do you says i he stared and cackled eh oh my word not too safe perhaps no oh but its famous to see you sir you see we feared we were the only he gestured at his companions a couple of sikhs trying to sit up to attention a dragoon halfslumped down against the bars a frail little stick of a man with long silver hair in a priests robe but mr parkes sir mr loch what of them i said i believed they were dead he groaned and then cried well at least youre alive sir and the dragoon chuckled raising his head shure an why wouldnt he be ye dont kill flash harry that easy do ye colonel says trooper nolan he had a bloody bandage round his brow and there was dried blood on his cheek but he was wearing the same slack calculating grin as he stared at me across the cage brabazon gobbled indignantly its not for you to say so my man how dare you address an officer in that familiar style he grimaced admiringly at me mind you its true what he says sir they cant keep you down can they im sure he meant no harm sir none taken my boy says i and sank down in the straw opposite nolan id forgotten all about the blackmailing brute and now my fears came rushing back at the sight of that knowing peasant grin you may think i should have had more immediate cares but the very sight of these five other prisoners had sent my spirits soaring plainly they were regarding us as hostages and would keep us alive to the bitter end and when we were free again there would still be nolan i could see he was already contemplating that happy prospect for when a renewed cannonade by the chink guns took brabazon to the bars for a looksee he leaned forward towards me and says quietly shure an mebbe well be havin our little talk after all colonel any talking we do can wait until were out of this says i equally quiet until then hold your tongue his grin faded to an ugly look well see about dat he whispered whether i hold it or not depends does it not sorr he sat back against the bars glowering truculently and just then there was a sudden uproar on the bridge and brabazon was shouting to me to come and look smoke was swirling over the bridge from the nearest battery but when it cleared i saw that the mandarin and his staff were at the parapet just beneath us pointing and yelling excitedly and there far out on the plain where visibility ended in a bright haze flecked gold by the morning sun little figures were moving hundreds of them advancing out of the mist towards the imperial army they couldnt be more than a mile away french infantry in open order rifles at the trail their trumpets were sounding through the thunder of the chinese guns and as the stone shot kicked up fountains of dust among them they held on steadily moving directly towards us the tricolour standards waving before them oh vive la france mutters brabazon strange little buggers see em strut though stick it you frogs the chinese horns and gongs were going full blast now and there was more hullaballoo and racing about on the bridge as lines of british and indian infantry came into view on the french left flank in between there was a little line of dust thrown up by hooves and above it the twinkling lancepoints and the thin slivers of the sabres fanes horse and the dragoon guards knee to knee down beyond the parapet the chinese gunners were labouring like billybedamned their shot was churning the ground all along the allied line but still it came on unhurried and unbroken and the chinks were yelling exultantly in their ranks their banners waving in triumph for out on the plain could be seen how small was our army advancing on that mighty mass of imperials who outflanked it half a mile on either side brabazon was muttering excitedly speaking my own thought oh run away you silly chinamen you aint got a hope there was a great stir to the imperial right and we saw the tartar horse were advancing a great mass swinging out to turn the british flank the armstrong shells were bursting above them little flashes of flame and smoke but they held together well weathering it as their stride lengthened to a canter and brabazon was beating his fist on the bars my god do they think grants asleep hes been up for hours you foolish fellows look look there for suddenly a trumpet was shrilling from the allied line and like a gate swinging on its hinge our cavalry came drumming out of the centre sweeping round in a deadly arc the lances going down and the sabres twinkling as they were advanced like a great fist they tore into the tartar flank scattering them riding them down as the enemy cavalry wavered and gave back with fanes and the dragoons tearing into their heart there was another blast of trumpets and probyns riders came charging in to complete the rout brabazon was bellowing like a madman and the two sikhs were dancing at the bars yah sowar satsreeakal shabash suddenly one of the sikhs yelled and fell back blood welling from a gash in his thigh nolan caught him swearing in amazement and then we saw the bannerman on the bridge beneath us screaming curses and brandishing a bloody spear the mandarins staff were shaking their fists at the cage until the crash of an armstrong shell on the bridge end sent them headlong for cover another burst on the far parapet splinters whining everywhere the armstrongs had ranged on the chinese guns positions and through the thunder of the imperial salvoes we could hear the thumping strains of the marseillaise there were the dear little crapauds storming into the chinese forward positions with the armstrong bursts creeping ahead of them behind the chink front line it was like an antheap kicked over and then another shell burst plumb on the summit of the bridge and we were dashed to the floor of the cage when i raised my head brabazon was back at the bars staring down in disgust at a bloody palpitating mass on the flags which had been a bannerman or possibly two the ugly mandarin was standing beside it staring at a bloody gash on his hand and brabazon the eternal oaf had to sing out take that you villain thatll teach you to attack a prisoner the mandarin looked up he couldnt understand the words but he didnt need to i never saw such livid hate in a human face and i thought we were goners there and then then he strode to the cage gibbering with fury fanqui scum you see this he flourished his bloody hand for every wound i take one of you dies ill send his head back to your gunners you spawn of the white whore he turned to scream orders to his men and i thought oh jesus here goes one of us but it was evidently a promise for the future for all their response was to line the parapet and blaze away with their jingals at the frogs who were still engaged in the forward entrenchments three hundred yards away what did he say brabazon was demanding sir what was he shouting at us none of them understood chinese of course the unwounded sikh and the little priest were bandaging the wounded mans leg nolan was a yard off slightly behind me brabazon at my side questioning and in that moment i had what i still maintain was one of the most brilliant inspirations of my life and ive had one or two hoaxing bismarck into a prizefight convincing jefferson davis that id come to fix the lightningrod hitting rudi starnberg with a bottle of cherry heering hurling valentina out of the sledge into a snowdrift all are fragrant leaves to press in the book of memory but im inclined to think pahlichao was my finest hour what did he say sir cried brabazon again i shook my head shrugging and spoke just loud enough for nolan to overhear well someones in luck hes going to send one of us under a white flag to the frogs try to make terms i suppose well he can see its all up good heavens cries brabazon then were saved i doubt that says i oh the chap who goes will be all right but the frogs wont parley i wouldnt if i commanded em what trust these yellow scoundrels when the games all but won no the french aint such fools theyll refuse and we know what ourcaptors will do then i looked him in the eye dont we now if wed been a directors meeting no doubt thered have been questions and eleventeen holes shot in my specious statement but prisoners in a cage surrounded by bloodthirsty chinks dont reason straight anyway i was the bloody colonel so he swallowed it whole my god says he and went grey but if the french commander knows that five lives are hell do his duty my boy as you or i would his head came up yes sir of course who shall go sir it ought to be you i gave him my wryest flashy grin and clapped him on the shoulder thanks my son but it wont do no i think well leave it to chance what let the chinks pick the lucky one he nodded and behind me i could almost hear nolans ears waving as he took it all in brabazon stepped resolutely away from the cage door i stayed at the bars studying the mandarins health there had been a brief lull in the armstrong barrage but now they began again the frogs were trying to carry the second line of works and making heavy weather of it the jingalmen were firing volleys from the bridge the ugly mandarin rushing about in the smoke exhorting em to aim low for the honour of old pekin high school no doubt he even jumped on the parapet waving his sword you wont last long you silly sod thinks i sure enough came a blinding flash that rocked the cage and when the smoke had cleared there were half a dozen manchoos splattered on the marble and the mandarin leaning on the parapet clutching his leg and bawling for the ambulance my one fear was that hed have brabazon marked down as his victim but he hadnt he was a man of his word though he screamed an order there was a rush of armoured feet the cage door was flung open a manchoo officer poked his head in shrieking and trooper nolan glaring desperately about him had made good and sure he was closest to the door the manchoo officer shouted again gesturing nolan wearing what i can best describe as a grin of gloating guilt took a step towards him brabazon was standing back ramrodstraight while i did my damnedest not to catch the chairmans eye take him yells the officer and two of his minions plunged in and flung nolan from the cage the door slammed shut i sighed and loafed across to it looking down through the bars at him as he stood gripped by two bannermen be sure and tell em about tangku fort says i sotfly and he goggled in bewilderment then as they ran him to the parapet he must have realised what was happening for he began to struggle and yell and i staggered back from the door crying to brabazon in stricken accents my god what are they doing why that lying hound of a mandarin ah no it cannot be they had forced nolan to his knees before the wounded mandarin who left off bellowing long enough to spit in his face then they hauled him up on to the parapet and while two gripped his arms and bent him double a third seized his hair and dragged his head forward the officer drew his sword shook back his sleeve and braced himself mother o mercy oh christ dont the scream ended abruptly cut off as you might say and i sank my face into my hands with a hollow groan reflecting that who steals my purse may get away with it but he who filches from me my good name will surely find his tits in the wringer the filthy butchers roars brabazon oh the poor fellow but why in heavens name when theyd said because thats the kind of swine john chinaman is i growled they lie for the pleasure of it brabazon he gritted his teeth and drew a shuddering breath and my last words to him were a rebuke did you did you know him well sir well enough i said a rough diamond but here how are the frogs getting along in fact they were making capital progress bayonetting away with йlan in the second entrenchment and while the chinese positions to the right were hidden by smoke from th sounds of things the british attack was going well the imps seemed to be giving back all along the line hundreds of them were streaming over the bridge with officers trying to rally then riding about and howling but there was only one way the battle could go the question was would they slaughter us before could be rescued torn between terror and hope i reckoned it was odds on our preservation unless that reckless fool of a mandarin stopped another splinter in which case wed better chivvy up the priest he being well stricken in years and presumably in a state of grace i looked anxiously for the mandarin and saw he was being held up by two of his pals while directing operations but the armstrongs seemed to have given over for the moment and clattering up the bridge came a cavalcade of gorgeouslyarmoured nobles accompanied by standardbearers my heart rose in my throat as i saw that their leader was sangkolinsen he was reining up addressing the mandarin and now the whole gang turned towards the cage the mandarin pointing and yelling orders my knees gave under me hell were they going to serve us as theyd served nolan the bannermen swarmed in and three of us were hauled out they left the sikhs and in a moment i understood why for they flung us down on the flags before sangs horse and that ghoulish face was turned on us pale eyes glaring under the wizards helmet as he demanded to know if any of us spoke chinese now he wasnt asking that for the purpose of execution so i hauled myself upright and said i did he considered me frowning malevolently and then snarled your name reptile flashman colonel on the staff of lord elgin i demand the immediate release of myself and my four companions as well as silence foulness he screamed on such a note that his pony reared and he hammered its head with his mailed glove to quiet it snake pig he leaned down from the saddle mouthing like a madman and struck me across the face open your mouth again and it will be sewn up bring him he wheeled his mount and clattered away and i was seized my wrists bound and i was flung bodily on to a cart as it rolled away i had one glimpse of brabazon looking after me and the little priest head bowed telling his beads i never saw them again no one did this may seem an odd time to mention it but my entry to pekin recalls a conversation which i had a couple of years ago with the eminent wiseacre and playwright george b shaw i was advising him on pistolplay for a frightful pantomime he was writing about a lynching in a kansas cowtown discussing hangings set him off on the subject of pain in general and he advanced the fatuous opinion that mental anguish was worse than physical when i could get a word in i asked him if spiritual torment had ever made him vomit he allowed it hadnt so i told him what my apache wife had done to ilario the scalphunter and had the satisfaction of watching our leading dramatist bolting for the lavatory with his handkerchief to his mouth i reflect on this only because the most prolonged pain i ever endured and ive been shot stabbed hung by the heels flogged halfdrowned and even stretched on the rack was on the road into pekin all they did was tie my hands and feet and pour water on my bonds then they hauled my wrists up behind me and tied em to a spar above the cart and set off at a slow trot the blazing sun and the bouncing cart did the rest ill not describe it because i cant save to say that the fiery agony in wrists and ankles spreads through every nerve of your body until youre a living mass of pain which will eventually drive you mad luckily pekin is only eleven miles from tangchoa i dont remember much except the pain long rows of suburbs yellow faces jeering and spitting into the cart a towering redoubt of purple stone topped by crenellated turrets foul narrow streets a bluecovered carriage with the driver sitting on the shaft he called to his passengers to look and i was aware of two cold lovely female faces regarding me without expression as i halfhung whimpering in my bonds they werent shocked or pitying or amused or even curious merely indifferent and in my agony i felt such a blazing rage of hatred that i was almost exalted by it and now i can say arrant coward that i am that at least i understand how martyrs bear their tortures they may have faith and hope and all the rest of it but greater than these is blind unquenchable red anger it sustained me i know the will to endure and survive and make those icefaced bitches howl for mercy it must have cleared my mind for i remember distinctly coloured pagoda roofs bigger than id ever seen and a teahouse with dragons heads above its eaves and the great scarlet gate of valour into the imperial city for pekin you must know is many cities within each other and innermost of all is the forbidden city the paradise the great within girded by gleaming yellow walls and entered by the gate of supreme harmony there are palaces for seven hundred princes within the imperial city but they pale before the great within it is simply not of this world like the summer palace outside pekin its entirely cut off from reality a dreamland if you like where the emperor and his creatures live out a great play in their stately halls and gorgeous gardens and all that matters is formality and lingernails and fornication nothing is seen or heard of the rest of mankind except what his ministers think fit there he dwells remote as a god sublime not in omniscience but in ignorance lost to the world he might as well be in the athenaeum i saw most of it later the palace of earthly repose for the emperors consort the temple of imperial ancestors for sacrifices the gate of extensive peace a hundred and ten feet high for kowtowing the hall of intense mental exercise for studying confucius the temple of the civic deity dont know what thats for paying rates i dare say and the library the portrait hall and even the office of the local rag the imperial gazette which circulates every day to all the nobles and officials in china thats the unreality of the country they nail thieves hands together and have a daily paper for the moment all i saw was the great gilt copper tower in which incense is kept perpetually burning filling the city with its sweet musky odour and beyond it the holy of holies the palace of heavenly tranquillity i was dragged in through a round doorway and flung into a great room utterly bare of furniture where i lay for several hours on a cold marble floor too sick and sore and parched even to move or to do anything except groan i must have slept for suddenly i was aware of tramping feet and a door crashing open and the glare of torches and the revolting face of sangkolinsen glaring down at me he was still in full martial fig brazen breastplate mailed gloves spurred greaves and all but with a furlined robe of green silk over his shoulders he was bareheaded so i had the benefit of his bald mongol skull as well as the obscene little beard on the brutal moonfeatures he fetched me a shattering kick and shouted get on your knees louse i tried to obey but my limbs were so painful that i pitched over and received several more kicks before i managed to kneel croaking for a drink of water silence he bawled and cuffed me left and right cracking the skin with his brass fingers i crouched sobbing and he laughed at me spitefully a soldier you he kicked me again he didnt seem to remember me from tangku fort not that that was any comfort there were two manchoo bannermen flanking the door and now came two others bearing an open sedan in which sat prince i the skullfaced monster who had raved and shrieked at parkes at tangchao he looked even more of a spectre in the glare of torchlight sitting lean and motionless in his shimmering yellow robe hands on knees the silver cases on his nails came halfway down his shins only his eyes moved gleaming balefully on me to complete the comedy trio there was a burly thicklipped manchoo in dragon robes his fingers heavy with rings a ruby button in his hat this i was to learn was sushun the assistant grand secretary of the imperial government a vulture for corruption and the emperors tutor in vice and debauchery on which to judge by his pupils condition he must have been the greatest authority since caligula to me for the moment he was only another very nastylooking manchoo is this the creature growls sang and prince i nodded imperceptibly and piped in his thin voice he was with pahsiali when that lying dog deceived us at tangchao then he may go the way of pahsiali snarls sang it is enough for the moment that he is what the barbarian scum call an officer an officer he stooped to scream in my face who is your commander pigdung general sir hope i was beginning and he knocked me flying with his boot you lie you have no generals who commands your ships admiral ho he screamed and stamped on my arm agonisingly another lie you have no admirals you are barbarian swine you have no nobles no officers no generals or colonels or admirals you have animals who grunt louder than the rest you offal that is all he was bent over me raving spraying me with his spittle glaring like a maniac then he straightened up snarling and snapped an order to the bannermen i was huddled babbling to be let alone terrified as much by the brutes frenzied ranting as by what he might do to me and what happened now reduced me to the final depth of fear the bannermen were carrying in a stool on which was seated a naked chinese a white shuddering figure who seemed to have no arms until i realised that they were clamped tight against his body by a horrible coat of meshed wire bound so tight that his flesh protruded through the spaces in obscene lumps about the size of fingertips it covered him from neck to knee and ive seen nothing more disgusting than that trembling rippled skin in its hideous wire casing they plumped the stool down in front of me the poor wretch slobbering with terror the wire jacket says sang grinning even a benighted worm of a fanqui must have heard of it without taking his eyes from me he beckoned and one of the bannermen came forward carrying an open razor he laid the shining blade on the victims shoulder and the fellow jerked and squealed at the touch of the steel sang watched me and then nodded the bannerman flicked his wrist the trembling mouth before me gaped in a dreadful scream and one of the fleshlumps had vanished replaced by a tiny disc of blood which coursed down the naked arm sang bellowed with laughter absolutely slapping his sides and the burly sushun came forward chuckling to peer at the wound i turned my head aside gagging and received a stinging slap across the face t watch coward roars sang and slapped me again now says he a wearer of the wire jacket has been known to receive as many as ten thousand cuts and still live indeed he may live for months if the executioner is patient and eventually he will have no skin at all he laughed again enjoying my terror but if a quicker despatch is desired he nodded again and the bannermans razor streaked down the full length of the victims arm i didnt faint i could wish i had for id have been spared the tortured screaming and the diabolical laughter if not the bloody pool which remained on the marble after theyd carried that babbling wretch out of the room i wonder i didnt go crazy i fairly grovelled to these fiends begging them to let me be not to cut me anything so they spared me that unthinkable cruelty oh ive faced some horrors in my time narreeman and her knife mimbreno squaws out for an evenings amusement malagassy inquisitors and ignatieff with his knout but nothing more ghastly than the gloating enjoyment of those two devils sang and sushun prince i sat in the background immobile his face expressionless you have seen dogdirt snarls sang now hear you will wear the wire jacket i swear and when your foul carcase has been flayed an inch at a time it will be thrown to the maggots and still you will be living unless you obey to the uttermost the orders we give you do you hear me kite id do anything i whined anything he asked and he seemed satisfied and kicked me again for luck he thrust his face into mine dropping his voice to a mere rasp you are to be honoured beyond your bestial imagining you are going into the divine presence and you will go like the crawling animal you are on your knees and you will speak this is what you will say he gestured to sushun and the burly brute swaggered forward towering over me and shouted i am a banner chief in the redhaired army a trusted creature of the big barbarian see i lay at your divine feet the unworthy sword which misbegotten foreign slave that i am i dared to raise in revolt against the authority of the complete abundance i was misled by evil counsellors my master the big barbarian and the archliar pahsiali who tempted me from my allegiance to the glorious kwakuin the tientze the son of heaven i marched in their army which prevailed by lies and treachery against the trusting and unwary generals of the divine emperor at sinho for example we succeeded only by despicable fraud for our leaders bade us perform the kowtow before the imperial soldiers and when they approached in good faith we fired on them treacherously and so overcame them for the moment thus we continued in stealth and trickery lying shamelessly to the imperial ambassadors when they besought us gently to repent our rebellion and return to our duty to you the son of heaven who rules all under the skies pahsiali lied the big barbarian lied we all lied but now we see our error we tremble under the just wrath of your servant prince sang who has chastised us dismay and fear spread through our ranks our soldiers run crying away our evil leaders cannot control them the big barbarian bites his nails and weeps in his tent all our soldiers and sailors weep we beg your divine forgiveness kneeling and acknowledge your supremacy oh son of heaven be merciful accept our homage for we were misled by evil people well ive talked greater rubbish in my time he could have it signed and witnessed if he wanted but even in my abject terror kneeling almost in the blood of the wire jacket victim with those madmen screaming at me i couldnt help wondering what mortal use they thought it would be within a week their precious son of heaven was going to be brought face to face with the big barbarian whod make him eat crow and like it the despised redheaded soldiers would march the sacred streets of the forbidden city and get drunk and piss against his temple walls and accost his women and kick his mandarins backsides if they didnt stir themselves and since nothing in heaven or earth could prevent that and sang and sushun and prince i knew it what was the point of stuffing the emperors ears with nonsense at the eleventh hour when hed learn the dreadful truth at the twelfth i still didnt understand you see the blind arrogant stupidity of the manchoo mind that even if elgin stood in the emperors presence his ministers would still pretend he wasnt there at all that theyd be whispering him just to wait this foreign pig would be brought to book presently and his army thrashed that none of it was happening because it couldnt happen qed and in the meantime here was a highranking british officer to tell him the same tale what more proof could his majesty want they had me rehearsing it now and you may be sure i howled it with a will even throwing in corroborative detail of my own about how my family were held hostage by elgins villains to coerce me into rebellion against my better judgment dyou know they were delighted i aint sure they didnt believe it sang bellowed and kicked me with enthusiasm and prince i said coldly they had chosen well sushun spat on me to show his approval then strip the swine cried sang and the bannermen cut my cords tore off my clothes gave me a rag of loincloth such as coolies wear and replaced my bonds with ponderous steel fetters whose links must have been two inches thick i now looked abject enough to satisfy them but they kept my lancer tunic belt boots and spurs to show their lord and master and produced a ridiculous oriental sword which would be laid at his divine feet during my speech to the throne then they left me for about an hour halfdead with pain and fear and icy cold mumbling over the farrago of drivel that i knew i would be repeating for my very life but after that suddenly it was onstage with a vengeance with the bannermen hauling me out and along passages and up stairways beating me with their spearshafts while i laboured with the deadweight of my chains we passed through chambers where chinese officials stared curiously and uniformed bannermen guarded the round crimson doorways i remember a carpeted gallery crammed with porcelain statues of grotesque figures with enormous teeth and staring eyes then they were driving me out across a polished marble floor like a frozen lake reflecting a great hall as long and high as a church with a bass gong booming hollowly in its emptiness huge vases three times the height of a man stood on either side of that cavernous apartment which was lit by great lanterns with candles of perfumed wax threequarters of its length was only dimlylighted but at the far end above three tiers of broad marble steps was a dais on which was seated a golden figure shining in the flames of the great candlebranches flanking his throne a massive ebony contraption inlaid all over with motherofpearl robed figures about a dozen of them stood on the steps to either side there was sang and prince i and sushun but i had little chance to take em in for my bannermen flung me headlong and i had to crawl the whole damned way dragging those beastly irons and staring at the reflection of the naked bearded wretch in the glassy floor beneath me hollo flashy old son i thought bellows to mend again my boy but you keep going and speak civil to the gentleman and youll get a sugarplum at tea the gong had stopped and the only sounds in that jossladen silence were clanks and laboured breathing i reached the steps and under the bannermens proddings dragged my way upwards kowtowing all the way thirtythree of them were there and then i stopped sprawled stark with a pair of yellow velvet boots just ahead and the hem of a robe that seemed to be made of solid gold inlaid with emeralds he doesnt look like a soldier said a drowsy voice where is his armour why is he not wearing it your slave kneeling begs your imperial majesty to look on these rags of garments which the redheaded savages wear this was sang and it was the first time id heard him speak at anything but the top of his voice they have no armour no armour says the other they must be very brave thats foxed you you bastard thinks i but after a minute sushun explained that we were so bloody backward we hadnt thought of armour yet and sang cried aye that was it no armour says the drowsy voice yet they have great guns that is not consistent you how is it that you have guns but no armour address the son of heaven pig yells sang and the bannermen bashed me with their spearshafts i scrambled to my knees looked up and blinked for if the fellow on the throne wasnt basset my orderly from the th hussars he was dooced like him except that he was chinese you understand it was just one of those odd resemblances the same puffy pasty weak young face and little mouth with a pathetic scrap of hair on the upper lip but where bassets eyes had been weaselsharp this fellows were watery and dull he looked as though hed spent the last ten years in a brothel which wasnt far wrong all this i took in at a glance and then hastened to answer his question our guns majesty says i were stolen from your imperial army at least that ought to please sang but with a face like his you couldnt be sure and your ships says the drowsy voice your iron ships how do you make such things t by george this wasnt going according to sushuns scenario at all here was i all ready with a prepared statement and this inquisitive oaf of an emperor asking questions which i darent answer truthfully or sang would have my innards all over the yard i know of no iron ships majesty says i earnestly i think they are a lie i have never seen them i have seen pictures says he sulkily and thought for a moment an unhappy frown on his soft yellow face you must have come to the middle kingdom in a ship was it not of iron he looked ready to cry it was a very old wooden ship majesty says i full of rats and leaked like a sieve i didnt want to come i cried on a sudden inspiration but i was seduced from my allegiance to your divine person by evil people like pahsiali and the big barbarian you see and they made me a banner chief in the redheaded army and a trusted creature of the big barbarian himself and it was the only way i could get into sushuns speech and forestall further embarrassment i poured it out keeping my eyes lowered and knocking head obsequiously at intervals and putting a heartrending pathos into my final appeal for his divine forgiveness if hed then said what about all these railways and telegraphs and the crystal palace hey id have been stumped but he didnt silence reigned and when i stole a glance up at the imperial throne damned if he hadnt gone to sleep bored stiff no doubt but highly disconcerting when youve been pleading for your life and sang and sushun glaring like baptists at a mass none of em seemed to know what to do the son of heaven smacked his lips broke wind gently and began to snore there were whispered consultations and finally one of them went off and returned with a stout little pug in a plain robe who approached the throne knocked head and began to tickle the royal ankle the emperor grunted woke stared around and asked sleepily which tortoiseshell was turned over tonight the fragrant almond leopardess oh kwakuin ruling the world squeaks the stout party and the emperor pulled a face no says he petulantly she is large and clumsy and without culture she sings like a crow he sniggered and sang and the others whod been mirroring his disapproval chuckled heartily let it be the orchid says the emperor sighing happily and everyone beamed i may even have nodded approbation myself for he looked at me again and frowned i saw a picture of an iron ship with three great chimneys says he sadly and then he got up unsteadily and everyone dropped to their knees crying there cannot be two suns in the heaven and knocked head vigorously i watched him shuffle off attended by the stout fellow he walked like an old sick man for all he couldnt have been thirty the solitary prince son of heaven the most absolute monarch on earth yearning for a trip on a steamship the fact remained that he hadnt told em to give flashy a pound from the till and a ticket to tooting i doubted if sang would either forwhile id done my damnedest to carry out his orders i knew i hadnt made much of a hit and if he was displeased my fears were realised as i was abruptly jerked to my feet and that hateful voice was snarling at the bannermen put him below tomorrow he can join the other barbarian curs in the board of punishments my blood froze at the words and as they seized my fetters i was foolish enough to protest but you swore to let me off i said what you wanted didnt i you said youd spare me you lying beast he was on me like a tiger striking viciously at my face while i cowered and yammered i said i would spare you the wire jacket he shouted and fetched me a final clip that knocked me down so i will spare you the wire jacket you may yet come to beg for it as a blessed release away with him they hauled me off and since i was in such fear that i woke the echoes with my roaring they gagged me brutally before rushing me down a spiral stairway it wasnt the way wed come and i was expecting stone cells and dripping walls but evidently they didnt have such amenities in the emperors private apartments for the room they thrust me into seemed to be a furniture store dry and musty but clean enough with chairs and tables piled against the walls the swine made me as comfortable as possible though throwing me back down on a narrow wooden bench and shackling my wrists so tightly beneath it that i couldnt budge an inch and must lie there supine with my legs trailing on the floor either side then they left me a prey to the most horrid imaginings and unable even to whine and curse by reason of my gag the board of punishments id heard of it and horrid rumours of what happened there if id known what parkes and loch and the others were already suffering id have gone off my head mercifully i didnt know and strove to drive the awful fears out of my mind telling myself that the army was only a few miles away that even mad monsters like sang must realise the vengeance that elgin would take if we were illtreated and hold his hand and then i remembered moyes and nolan and the vicious mindless spite with which theyd been murdered and i knew that my only hope was that rescue would get here in time they were so close grant and the frogs and probyn and nuxban khan and wolseley and temple those splendid sikhs and afghans and royals i could weep to think of them in their safe strong familiar world loafing under the canvas sitting about on payne cos boxes reading the daily press chewing the rag about what had it been that evening a century ago before we rode to tangchao oh aye the military steeplechase at northampton won by a dragoon over twenty fences and three ploughs and spectators riding alongside had spoiled sport goin to ride next year flash garn hes topheavy they say the navy are enterin in sailors on horseback hawhaw thats how theyd be gassing and boozing and idling away precious time the selfish bastards while i was bound shivering and naked and neardemented with fear of what lay ahead i must have dozed for i came awake freezing cold racked by pain where the sharp edges of the bench were cutting into the back of my shoulders and thighs it was still night for the window was dark but through the lattice door light was streaming light that moved someone was quietly descending the stairway to my prison there was a murmur of chinese voices just outside one a falsetto squeak that i seemed to have heard before and the other even to my battered senses it was one of the loveliest human sounds id ever listened to soft and tinkling as a silver bell the kind of voice a happy angel might have had a slightly excited tipsy angel is this the room little an it was whispering youre sure well take me in then hurry i want to see but orchid lady it is madness whimpers squeaker if we were seen please let us go back im frightened stop trembling or youll drop me oh come on fat foolish frightened little an be a man how can i im a eunuch and its cruel and mean and unworthy to taunt me aiee oh you pinched me oh vicious when you know i bruise at the least nip yes so think how youll bruise when the mongols take their flails to you little jelly you wouldnt i would i will unless you take me in and let me see now oh this is wilful its wicked and dangerous please dear imperial concubine yi why cant we just go upstairs and because ive never seen a barbarian and im going to dear little an the lovely voice chuckled and began to sing softly oh im going to see a barbarian im going to see a barbarian oh please please orchid lady quietly oh very well the door opened and light flooded into the room dazzled all i could make out at first was a short stout figure carrying someone a child by the look of it then the lantern was placed on a cupboard so that it shone down on me and as they advanced into the room i saw that the bearer was the portly cove whod scratched the emperors foot in the hall of audience his burden was wrapped in a scarlet silk cloak with a hood keeping the face in shadow well hisses the eunuch there it is i hope youre satisfied risking our lives just to gape at that monster to say nothing of the scandal if it were known that the empress of the western palace was sneaking about oh shut up pudding says she in that silvery chuckle and put me down no were going we must before put me down and close the door he gave a hysterical whimper and obeyed and she circled the bench none too steadily giggling and clutching the cloak tightly under her chin she craned foward to look at me and the light fell on the most beautiful face ive ever seen in my life ive said that of three women and still do elspeth lola montez and yehonala tzuhsi the orchid the incomparable yi concubine and its true of each in her own way fair elspeth dark lola and yehonala was the orient in all its pearly delicacy of flowerlike skin lustrous black eyes slender little nose cherry mouth with the full lower lip tiny even teeth all in a perfect oval face add that her hair was blueblack coiled in the manchoo style and you aint much wiser for there are no words to describe that pure loveliness who could have guessed that it masked a nature compounded of all the seven deadly sins except envy and sloth but even when you knew it it didnt matter one damned bit with that breathtaking beauty she said it herself i can make people hate me or love me with blind worship i have that power all i knew then as she surveyed me swaying and tittering excitedly was that id never seen the like and i can pay the little heartstopper nohigher tribute than to say that my first wish was that i had my uniform and a shave being flat on your hack gagged and bound in a filthy loincloth cramps the style no end my second thought was that whoever had painted her mouth purple and her eyelids silver with devils streaks slanting up the brows had done her no service and then i noticed that the black pupils were shrunk to pinpoints and the perfect lips were loosely open she was rollicking drunk on opium her first words confirmed it id say ughh hes disgusting not human look at the hair on his chest like an ape she shivered deliciously are they all like this what did you expect pipes an fearfully i told you but you wouldnt listen yes theyre all like that some are even worse revolting now please come away they cant be uglier than this see his dreadful great nose like a vultures beak and his ears and his hair she gurgled hysterically and the lovely face came closer wrinkling delicately he smells too ugh they all smell like sour pork oh orchid lady why do you wait staring at the beastly thing hes a barbarian very well youve seen him and unless we make haste be quiet i want to look at him hes grotesque those huge shoulders and his skin she put out a slim white hand whose silver nails were twoinch talons and brushed my chest with her fingertips its like oxhide feel she squeaked with delight ill do no such thing and neither will you stop it i say eegh to touch that foulness how can you bear it oh orchid mistress i beg you come before anyone finds us but his arms and legs an theyre enormous like an elephant he must says she all tipsy solemnity be terribly strong strong as a bull wouldnt you think yes as a bull and quite as interesting imperial concubine yi this is not fitting please i implore you let us go quickly in a moment stupid im still looking at him she took an unsteady pace back head on one side hes an absolute monster she giggled again her knuckles to her lips i wonder what what do you wonder eh aha i know what you wonder oh vile shameless come away this instant no no i just want to look fool you wouldnt care if it was a horse or or a monkey would you well hes just a barbarian and before he could stop her she had swayed forward laughing and yanked at my loincloth there was a rending sound little an screamed averted his eyes tried to drag her away succeeded in pulling the cloak from her shoulders and while her ladyship oblivious blinked in drunken contemplation i returned the scrutiny with interest in fact i near swallowed my gag i should explain that she had looked in while returning from duty in the emperors bed and consequently was still in uniform or rather out of it and his majestys tastes were curious she was dressed in enormous wings of peacock feathers attached from shoulder to wrist and highsoled manchoo slippers from which silver crossgarters wound up to above her knees the effect was striking she was one of your slim perfectlyshaped highbreasted figures with skin like alabaster as i said i never saw the like she would have made a stone idol squeal put it back stop it dont look little an was in a frenzy dropping to his knees beside her pawing distraught for pitys sake orchid lady please come away quickly before oh gods what are you doing it was a question which had i not been gagged i might well have echoed rhetorically since there was no doubt what she was doing the wicked insolent little flirt she had detached a plume from her peacock wing and was tickling lasciviously humming what i took to be an old chinese lullaby and going into delighted peals at the visible result of her handiwork oh buffalo she exclaimed clapping her hands while little an stared in horror and absolutely beat his forehead with his fists and the hapless victim struggled helplessly distracted and outraged for i have my dignity dammit and i bar being unbreeched and assailed by opiumsodden houris however bewitching without even a byyourleave oh horrible impossible little an fairly gibbered oh lady dear orchid please come away see i lie at your feet i beg i beseech stop stop if someone should find us that would be unlucky for them she stopped tickling and laid hold ohh little an says she breathlessly go outside and guard the door he gave a frenzied neigh what will you do he squealed which was as foolish a question as ever i heard considering my condition and her behaviour no i forbid it you cannot it is sacrilege blasphemy awful it is improper do you want to be alive tomorrow little an the voice was as musically soft as ever but there was a note in it to bristle your hair go out keep watch and wait till i call now he gave a last despairing wail and fled and she teased fondly for a moment breathing hard and then leaned over to look into my face possibly to make sure i wasnt going to sleep dear god but she was lovely the purple mouth was wide panting violetscented breaths the black eyes were glittering as she laughed and called softly oh an he is so ugly i cant bear to look at him then dont his piping came faintly through the door dont look dont do anything dont touch it him remember who you are you bad lascivious wretch youre the imperial concubine yi beloved of the complete abundance mother of his only child moon to the heavenly sun here are you listening what did you say about complete abundance chuckled the drunken hussy and dropped her silk cloak over my face to cut off her view no doubt damn her impudence her hands gripped my chest as she swung nimbly astride her knees either side of my hips for a moment she was upright playing and fondling while i lay fit to burst and then with a long shuddering sigh she sank slowly down impaling herself gliding up and down with maddening deliberation and what could i do but close my eyes and think of england an said afterwards that it was incredible and but for the gag id have cried hear hear supposing id had breath to do it but while i wouldnt have missed it for the world it was deuced unnerving being ravished is all very well especially by the most accomplished wanton in china if not all asia but when youre utterly helpless and she has finally worked her wicked will and lain sated and moaning drunkenly on your manly chest only to draw away suddenly with a cry of ugh how he stinks and then plucks away the cloak for another look and shudder at you well youre bound to wonder about the future if you follow me little an had it all settled rot him when she called he waddled in sulking furiously and said that if shed quite finished behaving like a rutting sow he would carry her to bed and then slit the barbarians tongue so that the disgusting brute couldnt blab when they took him to the board of punishments i listened in cold horror but she reclined gracefully in a chair and says yawning bloodthirsty little pig youll leave his tongue alone and the rest of him she stretched luxuriously oh an do you know what its like when your whole body melts in such ecstasy that you feel youll die of bliss no of course you dont but i do now i thought jung was wonderful but oh jung was just a boy this was like who was that ancient god who used to rape everyone it doesnt matter she waved a languid wing in my direction carry me upstairs and have him taken to the wangshawewen put him in are you mad has lechery disordered your wits what the devil is he to do in the wangshawewen die a happy barbarian purrs madam eventually unless i tire of him first which is unimaginable she sighed happily of course all that horrid hair must be shaved from his body and he must be bathed in musk for that awful odour and dressed decently you are mad take that that thing to your own pavilion he gargled and waved his arms and when the emperor hears of it or prince kung or your enemies sang and sushun and the tsai yuan oh dont be silly who would be so brave or foolish as to tell on the concubine yi even you arent so stupid are you little an just for a second the silvery voice hardened on that chilly note and then she had risen staggered giggled and broken into a littlegirl singsong im hungry an yes i am an and i want some pickles an and roast pork and cherries and lots of crackling and sugared lotus seeds and a cup of honeysuckle tea and then sleep sleep sleep she leaned against him murmuring but but oh its the infernal black smoke it makes you mad and irresponsible and and naughty you dont know what youre saying or doing please dear orchid lady little empress listen to reason youve enjoyed the beastly fellow ugh isnt it enough you say no one would tell but how if the emperor came to your pavilion and found that that creature the emperor says she drowsily will never get out of his bed again why should he when im always in it but if he did and caught me with twenty barbarians dyou know what hed forgive me she brushed a wing playfully across his face if you were a man little an youd know why my barbarian knows why she pushed away from him laughing and skipped unsteadily to my bench beating her wings oh yes he knows why dont you my ugly hairy barbarian so ugly except for the happy part see oh an im so happy stop it stop it at once i say he pulled her away he was nearly in tears i wont have it dyou hear its not decent you a great manchoo lady how can you think of that animal oh leave me alone look youve torn my wing the lovely mouth pouted as she smoothed her feathers youll make me angry in a minute little an i should have you beaten for that yes i will you blubbery little ape have me beaten then he squealed in sudden passion beat me for a torn wing and what of your torn honour you yehonala daughter of a knight of the banner corps mother of tungchi the seed of heaven to forget your loyalty to the emperor you indulge your wicked lust with this peasant savage you whose lifes duty is the solace and comfort of the solitary prince shame on you ill have no part in it and you can beat or kill me if you like he finished on a fine fearful flourish its not good enough ive taken part in some damned odd scenes in my time but i imagine a visitor to that room just then would have agreed that the present spectacle was unique there we were among the furniture and dustsheets on my left in brown robe and pillbox hat twenty diminutive stone of blubber shrilling like a steam whistle on my right topping him by a head in her pearlfringed block shoes that incredible ivory beauty her nudity only enhanced by the ridiculous trailing peacock wings and silver garters they faced each other across the supine form of the pride of the th lancers trussed gagged and stark as a picked bone but following the debate with rapt attention my admiration if not my sympathy was all with little an as i looked at that lovely silverpainted mask of a face beneath the coiled raven hair suddenly it was wiped clean of drugged laughter and the cold implacability that looked out of it was frightening i even left off staring at those excellent jutting tits which goes to show id not have faced her for a fortune but when she spoke it was in the same soft belllike tone eunuch antehai says she and negligently indicated her feet and the poor little tub came waddling and sank down like a burst bladder she touched his cheek gently with a silver talon and he turned up his trembling pug face poor little an you know i always get my way dont you it was like a caress and you always obey because i am your little orchid whom you have loved since i came here long ago a frightened little girl to whom you were kind remember the watermelon seeds and walnuts and how you consoled me when my heart was breaking for the boy i loved and how you shielded me from the anger of the dowager when i broke her best gold cup and you took the blame and how you whispered comfort when first you wrapped me in the scarlet cloak and took me to the emperors bed trembling and in tears be brave little empress you will be a real empress some day have you forgotten little an i never shall he was leaking like the drinking fountain movement by now and no wonder i was starting to feel horny for her again myself now because i love you too and need you little an i shall be honest with you as i always am the silvery voice was sober as a judges now i want this barbarian for what you call my wicked lust no no its true and why not if it pleases me you talk of honour loyalty to the emperor what loyalty do i owe to that debauched pervert you know im not a woman to him but a pretty painted toy trained to pander to his filthy vices what honour is there in that you know and pity me and used to arrange those secret trysts with jung the man i loved where was my honour then jung lu was a noble a manchoo a banner chief who would have married you if he could he whimpered pawing her feet oh please orchid i seek only your good this thing is a barbarian brute but if i want him little an maynt i have him please he is just a little pleasure a watermelon seed and he may have another use you should know of it and of other things which it will soon be time to tell you she paused head lifting yes why not now this is a good secret place away from big ears go see that all is safe he hopped up all alarm popped his head out and came back nodding nervously she sat down motioning him to kneel close and stroked his fat cheek playfully dont be frightened small jelly just listen she began to talk quite unaware that the big ears of the barbarian melonseed were understanding every word soon little an two great things will happen the barbarians will take pekin and the emperor will die no listen you fat fool and keep your babbling to yourself first the emperor only i and one discreet physician know it but in a few weeks he will be dead partly of his infirmities but mostly of overindulgence in the charms of the yi concubine well its a pleasant death and i give him every assistance i believe says this manchoo messalina with a reflective chuckle that i could have carried him off tonight by combining the exquisite torment of the seven velvet mirrors with the prolonged ecstasy of the reluctant shrimp which as you know involves partial immersion in icecold water but it will be soon anyway and who will rule china then little an she played with her feathers smiling at his evident terror will it be that amiable weakling prince kung the emperors brother or his cousin the hungry skeleton prince i or that murderous madman prince sang or tungchi the emperors only son my son any one of these or as many others might become emperor little an but who will rule china well he could guess all right and i could have a suspicion myself i knew nothing of their palace politics or the immense power of imperial concubines but i know women this one had the spirit no error and probably the brains and determination above all she had that matchless beauty which could get her whatever she wanted what too frightened even to guess little an never mind leave the dying son of heaven and consider the barbarians sang the idiot still hopes to defeat them which is why he and his fellowjackals have been urging the emperor to go north to jehol on an ostensible hunting trip for his health she laughed without mirth in fact sang knows such a departure would be seen as a cowardly flight and the emperor would be disgraced and sang having beaten the barbarians in his absence would step into his shoes as the darling of army and people poor sang if only he knew it the throne will soon be vacant and his intrigues all for nothing in any event he will not beat the barbarians they will be here within two weeks but that is impossible little an started up in horror and that you should say so you orchid lady who have urged the emperor to fight to the end who made him send the silk cord to defeated generals who made him set the price on barbarian heads to be sure a thousand taels for the big barbarians head isnt it she sounded amused a hundred for every white head fifty for their black soldiers five hundred for banner chiefs like that repulsive thing there she waved a wing at me the awful bitch really i must make him wear a mask in bed but of course i urge resistance you think i like these barbarian swine yehonala is the resolute champion of china and the people know it and will remember the banner knights daughter especially when the emperor is dead until he is i make him fight who do you think has kept him from fleeing to jehol stupid it is quite wonderful how even such a flabby wreck as the son of heaven can be roused to martial ardour in bed but if the barbarians triumph all is lost no little fool all is gained the barbarians will come and go with their piece of paper china remains with a new emperor but of course he must be an emperor acceptable to the barbarians they will see to that before they go and they will countenance no bitter enemies like sang or prince i or sushun but forgive me orchid lady you are their bitterest foe of all but they dont know that do they they think sang and the ministers control the emperor they cant conceive the power that rests in the little lotus hand she raised one slim silvertaloned pinkie and laughed what a mere girl who looks like me can you hear the big barbarian crying enemy when i smile and bid my ladies serve him rosepetal tea and honey cakes in the birthday garden why im just the dead emperors whore and the mother of his heir no to ensure a clear field for my imperial candidate whoever he may be it is necessary only to ensure the complete discredit in barbarian eyes of such rivals as sang and his reptiles as the known leaders of resistance they are illregarded already but i shall contrive their utter disgrace perhaps even get them hanged who knows dyou know who she reminded me of otto bismarck not to look at you understand but in the smooth sure way she summed it up and lined it out and had you agog for her to drop the next piece into place and a bare halfhour since shed been rogering her soul out whooping drunk on lust and poppy and like dear otto she was holding my interest despite my other pressing concerns come on come on i was thinking lets hear how youre going to get sang to tyburn because i want to be there to swing on the bastards ankles little an too was clamouring for information albeit apprehensively so she told him and i wished she hadnt it is simple before he dies the emperor will issue a final vermilion decree ordering the execution of all barbarian captives now in the board of punishments for this the emperors advisers sang and the rest will be held responsible and when the bodies are handed back and it is seen that they have died by the usual procedures binding flogging bursting maggots the barbarians will be in a rage for retribution sang will have to make apologies and excuses that it was the work of brutal underlings most unfortunate much to be regretted and so forth the barbarians growling will accept the apology and a cash compensation as they have done in the past they will bear no love for sang and his friends but they will let the matter end there unless she laughed and it would have frozen your marrow there is among the bodies one that has died by the wire jacket or something equally elaborate for that cannot be excused as the casual brutality of some underling it will be seen as a calculated insulting atrocity barbarians are very sensitive about such things they will certainly take vengeance and i wonder if sang will escape with his life my soul shrank as i listened only a chinese female could plot with such cruel diabolic cunning our prisoners were doomed then one of them by the most ghastly torture just so that this wicked lovely harpy could bring down her rivals and capture imperial power and there was nothing to be done i didnt even know how many of our fellows had been taken or who and it would be done without warning or hope of rescue that little toad an was at the knots and splices of it already once hed babbled out his admiration oh orchid lady forgive your kneeling slave cries he and he was weeping buckets so help me your eyes are on the stars and mine on the dirt when shall it be done and which of them shall it be for it will be to arrange the victim must be brought from the board secretly lest sangs people should hear afterwards when the bodies are sent to the barbarian camp it will be easy to increase their number by that one in a week perhaps when the barbarians prepare their final attack on the city and who will wear the jacket she shrugged one of their leading people pahsiali perhaps so theyd got parkes i could hear that lazy drawl see the superior smile and the wire jacket it does not matter you will see it done now she stood up stretching you will take me up oh but im tired little an and hungry why did you let me talk so long you stupid little man and she pretended to box his ears laughing while he squeaked and feigned anguish that was what made my flesh crawl the sudden capricious change from hellish scheming to playful mischief from the cold unspeakably cruel calculation that meant dreadful death for men shed never seen to happy high spirits demanding crackling with cherries and a tealeaf pillow because her eyes were tired its a rare thing that gift of human translation although id seen it before always in people who held immense power i mentioned bismarck just now he had it so did lakshmibai of jhansi and in a way james brooke of borneo although with him it had to be a conscious act of will for the others it was a necessary part of their nature to be able to turn in perfect oblivion from determining the destiny of a nation or a matter of life and death to choosing a new hat or listening to music and then back again with the mind wiped clean here in an hour or so this bonny girl of twentyfive had been subjected to heavenknewwhat debauches with a dying monarch drugged herself with opium run the risk of death for the mere whim of seeing some new thing ravished a helpless captive for the sheer sport of it rehearsed her plans for securing supreme political power again at the risk of death and was now yawning contentedly at the thought of a snack and a good sleep god knew what her diary held for tomorrow my point is it wasnt quite the home life of our own dear queen and it takes a nature beyond our understanding to manage it now as she yawned and hummed and resumed her cloak and hood she spared a thought for me again tickling mischievously and skipping away laughing as little an scuttled in to fend her off i was to be taken secretly she reminded him to the wangshawewen which sounded like some sort of garden the little eunuch made a doubtful lip a pity we must be at the trouble of removing a captive from the board of punishments grumbles he when we have one to hand at which she cuffed him soundly and serve him right fat savage would you harm my barbarian youll treat him with care and respect dyou hear or ill have you fed to the tiny devil fish one greasy inch at a time she considered me with her secret smile besides i told you i may have another use for him just suppose when the other prisoners have been killed the barbarians discover that one has been saved and kindly treated by the yi concubine wont they be pleased with her and with her party at court she patted his head lightly well it is a possibility better he should wear the wire jacket pipes he viciously he deserves it after tonight he isnt fit to live how could you he shuddered in revulsion ugh disgusting why i believe youre jealous little an she mocked him as he lifted her in his arms oh stop sulking just because youre weaponless selfish little hound am i to have no fun oh no im sorry that was a mean thing to say forgive me little an as he bore her from the room she was apologising to the beastly little bladder and her last words drifted to my ears filling me with a new and dreadful fear look if he does not please me or i tire of him quickly perhaps the beautiful voice faded up the stairs and i was left a prey as they say to conflicting emotions its a strange thing but i remember distinctly i wasnt tired when they whisked me out of that lumber room just as dawn was breaking twentyfour hours earlier id been waking in my cage at tangchoa since then id witnessed the battle of pahlichao arranged the demise of trooper nolan been illused and terrified by sangs thugs crawled to the emperor of china and conferred so to speak with his principal concubine a busy day youll allow but while id a right to be played out body and soul i wasnt because i didnt dare to be i must keep my wits about me for one stark thought was hammering in my brain above all others when the shadowy figures flitted into my room to unchain and carry me swiftly out wrapped in a carpet like cleopatra as ever was whatever happened now i must not for my very lifes sake utter so much as a syllable in chinese it was the grace of god that little an hadnt been present when i babbled before the emperor true hed later suggested slitting my tongue but that presumably had just been native caution he plainly didnt even suspect that i understood the lingo or hed never have permitted yehonala to pour out her girlish dreams in my hearing to both of them i was a mere lump of uncomprehending barbarian beef and if ever they realised that id taken in every word quite thank heaven id been gagged throughout our meeting or i might well have spoken at some point you permit yourself strange liberties madam for example well they didnt know and provided i kept my trap shut they never would only the emperor and his nobles were aware of my linguistic skill and i wasnt liable to be meeting them again in the meantime i faced the prospect of becoming stallionentitre to that gorgeous little tyrant which was capital and the possibility if she tired of me or it suited her murderous plan that id be the one given the wire jacket when they started butchering prisoners that wouldnt be for a week i had that much law in which to escape and take word to grant that hed better look sharp if he was to rescue them then again escaping would be damned risky my safest course might well be to lie snug bulling yehonalas pretty little rump off and pray that shed exempt me from the slaughter which she seemed inclined to do which meant letting the other prisoners go hang aye well its a cruel world it was all very difficult and i must just wait and see what seemed best best for flashy you understand and good luck to everyone else these were my thoughts as i was borne off and one thing quickly became plain in the event that escape did eventually seem advisable at least it wouldnt have to be from the forbidden city which would have been next to impossible for after my swathed carcase had been carried some way it was slung aboard a cart and driven for about two miles through city streets to judge from the noises then the rumble of other traffic and the din of the waking city ceased our speed picked up there were several cockcrows and i guessed we were in open country after about half an hour the cart slowed to a walk my carpet was stripped away i was hauled into a sitting position and looked about me my escort were four men dressed like little an which meant they were eunuchs nominally at least for while three were squeaking butterballs the fourth was lean and whiskered and spoke in a bass croak theres one whos all present and correct thinks i and he probably was these eunuchs you see are an extraordinary gang in most eastern countries theyre prisoners or slaves whove been emasculated and given charge of the royal womenfolk but not in china where theyre absolutely volunteers i swear it its a most prestigious career you see offering huge opportunities of power and profit and there are young chaps positively clamouring to be detinkled so that they can qualify for the job not a line of work that would appeal to me but then im not chinese however royal concubines being what they are it was sometimes arranged that a candidate escaped the scissors and took up his duties in full working order i suspect that my chap in the cart was one such and a capital time he must have had of it since concubines outnumbered the emperor by about three hundred to one and his majesty was so besotted with yehonala that the others had to look elsewhere for diversion but fullyarmed or not the eunuchs were the most influential clique at court as spies agents and policymakers saving the emperor the most powerful man in china was undoubtedly little an the chief eunuch and he was right under yehonalas dainty little thumb but ill digress no longer for now i have to tell you of one of the most wonderful things ive ever seen a marvel to compare with any on earth and no one will ever see it again there are many beautiful things in the world mostly works of nature a colorado sunset dawn over the south china sea elspeth primroses cold moonlight on the sahara an english woodland after rain man cannot make anything to equal these but just once in this critics opinion he came so close that id hate to live on the difference and it was done by shaping nature delicately and with infinite patience as probably only chinese artists and craftsmen could have done it this was what i was privileged to see that september morning as i remember we were leaving a little village on a narrow road between high stone walls which took us over a stone bridge and a causeway through a lake to a great carved entrance gate beyond that was a courtyard and a massive building blazing with gold in the rising sun we drove past it and a scattering of lesser pavilions and then it burst on the view in all its perfect silent splendour and i gasped aloud in wonder while the eunuchs squeaked and laughed and nudged each other to see the barbarian stricken dumb as he gazed for the first time on the summer palace as you may have heard it was not a palace at all but a garden eight miles long but it wasnt a garden either it was fairyland and how dyou describe that i can only tell you that in that vast parkland stretching away to distant hazy hills there was every beauty of nature and human architecture blended together in a harmony of shape and colour so perfect that it stopped the breath in your throat and you could only sit and wonder i can talk of groves of trees of velvet lawns of labyrinths of lakes with pavilioned islands of temples and summer houses and palaces of gleaming roofs of imperial yellow porcelain seen through leaves of darkest green of slow streams meandering through woods of waterfalls cascading silently down mossy rocks of fields of flowers of pebbled paths winding past marble basins where fountains played like silver needles in the sunlight of deer cropping daintily beneath spreading branches of willowpattern bridges of dark grottoes where pale gold statues shone faintly in the shadows of lotus pools where swans slept i can write these things down and say that they were spread out like a great magic carpet in glorious panorama as far as the eye could see and what does it convey very little it may even sound vulgar and overdone but you see i cant describe how one delicate shade of colour blends into another and both into a third which is not a colour at all but a radiance i cant show you how the curve of a temple roof harmonises with the branches that frame it or with the landscape about it i cant make you see the grace of a slender path winding serpentine among the islands of a lake that is itself a soft mirror bordered by everchanging reflections i cant say why the ripple of water beneath the prow of a slowgliding pleasure barge seems to have been designed to complement the shape of barge and lake and lilypad and to have been rippling since time began i can only say that all these things blended into one great unified perfection that was beyond belief and damned expensive too it had taken centuries to make and if all the great artists of the classical age and the renaissance had seen it theyd have agreed that the fellows who designed it knew their business being a philistine i will add only never talk to me about art or beauty or good taste or style because ive seen the bloody elephant i say it was a vast garden but in fact it was many the main one was the ewenmingewen the enclosed and beautiful garden a great walled park with palaces which were museums of all chinese art and civilisation accumulated through the ages then there was the chingmingewen the golden and brilliant garden with its hills crowned by a sixstorey jade tower and a magnificently ruined lamasery and the fragrant hills the jade fountain park the imperial hunting park the garden of clear rippling water and the one to which i was taken the wangshawewen or birthday garden which was reckoned the most perfect of all with its views of the whole shootingmatch and beyond that distant pekin and the surrounding hills this miracle was all for the personal delight of the emperor and his court no other visitors ever saw it which was perhaps as well since i should think it was by far the richest treasure house there has ever been in the world to give you a notion yehonalas favourite pavilion was a modest cabin covering about an acre roofed with gold leaf and apparently constructed of marble jade and ivory throughout its scores of rooms were stuffed with priceless fabrics carpets and furs statuary of every precious metal and porcelain clocks jewellery paintings i remember going along a verandah looking out at the glorious scenery and suddenly realising that i was no longer out of doors but was staring at a wall so cunningly decorated that it appeared to be a continuation of the world outside i had walked a good ten paces before i discovered that i was no longer seeing reality but artifice and when i went back and stood at gaze i could hardly tell where one ended and tother began it was almost sickening to think of the genius and labour that had gone to the making of such a vain thing yet it was lovely and as to the movable loot well an entire wing was devoted to thousands of magnificent silk dresses scarves and shawls you absolutely waded through them another wing was given over to jewelled ornaments so brilliant and numerous that the eye could not bear to look at them for long one vast room was filled with the most intricate mechanical toys crusted with gems jade jackintheboxes walking dolls blasted diamond frogs and beetles hopping and scuttling all over the shop and youd no sooner escaped them than you were in a room walled in solid silver and carpeted in ermine and sable with gold racks covered in ladies shoes s that was yehonalas house and there were hundreds like it palaces temples museums art galleries libraries summer houses and pavilions all crammed with treasures so opulent that why if those russian easter eggs that are so admired had found their way into the summer palace i swear theyd have boiled em god knows what it was all worth or what it was all for greed vanity an attempt to create a luxurious paradise on earth so that the earth could be forgotten if the last then it succeeded for you forgot the world in an instant it should have seemed just a great overstuffed bazaar but it didnt probably because of this last detail which i shall tell you and then im done with description every one of the millions of precious things in the summer palace from the fortyfoot jade vases in the hall of audience so fragile that you could read print through them to the tiny gold thimble on a corner shelf in the room of yehonalas chief seamstress was labelled with its description origin and the exact position which it must occupy in the room think of that the next time you drop a book on the table possibly because of recent events and my new surroundings my memories of the first two days in that house are all at random i saw no one but the eunuchs whose first task was to groom the barbarian and make him fit for human consumption little an was early on the scene scowling sullenly and instructing the lads to see me shaved scrubbed and suitably attired i had to be careful not to understand the shrill directions screamed at me and to appear to cotton on slowly i insisted on bathing and shaving myself and recall sitting in a splendid marble bathing pool using a jewelled razor on my chest arms and legs and damning the eyes of the bollockless brigade as they twittered round the brink pouring in the salts and oils to make me smell chinese i had a splendid shoutingmatch with an on the subject of my moustache and whiskers which he indicated must come off and which i by saxon oath and gesture showed i was ready to defend to the last finally i removed them the first time id been cleanshaven since i rode as a bronco apache in mangus colorados spring war party back in but dug in my heels about my tophair id been bald when i was crown prince of strackenz and looked hellish another memory is of sleeping in silk sheets on a bed so soft i had to climb out and camp on the floor i suppose i ate and loafed but its fairly hazy until the second night when they took me in a closed sedan chair to the imperial apartments in the ewenmingewen this was a piece of pure effrontery on yehonalas part and showed not only her supreme confidence in her power but the extent of that power and the fear she inspired among the minions of the imperial court the emperor was down in the forbidden city still with all his retinue of nobles and attendants while the concubine yi lorded it in the summer palace alone but instead of conducting her illicit amours secretly in her own pavilion damn if she didnt appropriate his majestys private apartments serenely sure that not one of the eunuchs or guards or palace servants would dare to betray her little ans spy system was so perfect that i doubt if an informer could have got near the emperor or any of her enemies but probably her best security was that almost the whole court worshipped the ground she trod on i have that power remember i had no inkling of this when they decanted me at the third of the great halls that made up the emperors residence and led me through a circular sidedoor to a small dressingroom hung with quilted dragon robes in every conceivable colour it was just like her you know to fig me out in her old mans best gear although i had no suspicion of what was afoot until little an began puffing musk at me from a giant squirt and his assistant applied lacquer to my hair to make it lie down when they tied a flimsy gauze mask over my face i thought aha and then they bundled me into a corridor and along to a great gilt door where a table stood bearing scores of tortoiseshell plaques each with a different design worked in precious stones these were the concubines tablets with which his majesty indicated his choice for the night it was then little ans task to rout out the appropriate houri wrap her in the silk cloak carry her to the gilt door and shoot her in no doubt with a cry of shop he didnt attempt to carry me just waved me in and closed the door after me and through the thin mask i saw enough to confirm my growing suspicions directly ahead of me there was a sort of sloping ramp which led up to an alcove entirely filled by a bed large enough to accommodate the kings own yorkshire light infantry and a couple of signallers it was sheeted in purple silk with gold lamй pillows in case anyone wanted to sleep to the left of the ramp were low ebony tables covered with the kind of bricabric that susie willinck had insisted on taking to california only more expensive silver opium pipes and skewers delicate golden chains and fetters cords of silk and velvet and plaited leather a tiny catoninetails with minute gems glinting in its lashes and a scattering of exquisitelytinted pictures which they wouldnt have shown at the royal academy in a hurry hang it this aint the billiard room thinks i and glanced to my right and forgot everything else yehonala was sitting on a low stool dabbing her lower lip with a little brush before a dressingtable mirror she was wearing a robe of some gauzy shimmering material that changed colour with every movement a wasted effect since it was entirely transparent but it wasnt only the sudden vision of that flawless ivory body that set me gulping and gloating as i surveyed the slender foot and ankle the slim tapering legs the smooth curve of belly and rump the tiny waist and the splendid conical breasts standing clear of the robe well you can see it wasnt it was that perfect face in the mirror so arrestingly lovely that you couldnt believe it was flesh and blood and not a picture of some impossible ideal she glanced at my reflection in the mirror cool upanddown you look much better in a mask says she idly as she might have addressed her pet pekingese pouting her lip to examine it in the glass go to the bed then and wait i didnt move and remembering that i was an uncomprehending barbarian she pointed with a silver fingernail flicking her hand impatiently to the bed there go on if theres one thing that can make me randier than a badger its an imperious little dollymop giving me orders with her tits out of her dress dont you believe it my lass growls i in english and she stopped brush poised eyes wide in astonishment i reckon it was a shock to her to hear the noise the animal made she gasped as i pulled off my mask and for an instant there was fear in the dark eyes so i smiled politely made her my best bow and came up behind her stool her face set in anger but before she could speak i had applied the fond caress that i use to coax elspeth when shes sulking one hand beneath the chin to pull her head back while you chew her mouth open the other kneading her bouncers with passionate ardour they cant stir you see and after a moment they dont want to sure enough she stiffened and tried to struggle writhing on the stool with smothered noises and then she began to tremble her mouth opened under mine and as i worked away feverishly at her poonts her hands reached up to clasp behind my head i disengaged instantly dropped to one knee by her stool smiled tenderly into the beautiful bewildered face squeezed her belly fondly stole a quick kiss on each tit and swept her up in my arms as i rose wait put me down no let me go wait but having no chinese i strode masterfully up the ramp whistling lilliburlero to soothe her dropped her head and shoulders on the edge of the bed while holding the rest of her clear with a hand under either buttock leaned forward in the approved firing position and piled in roaring like a gorgon i believe she was quite taken aback for she gave one uncertain wail gesturing feebly with those dear little white hands but id arranged her artfully in a helpless position hanging suspended while wicked harry bulled away mercilessly with his feet on the ground and what was the poor child to do i was fairly certain from the look of the emperors bedside tackle and what id heard her tell little an about reluctant shrimps or galloping lobsters or whatever it was that she had never been romped in normal true british style in her life but you could see her taking to it and by the time my knees began to creak for i spun the business out to the ecstatic uttermost for her benefit she was in a condition of swoon as i once heard a french naval officer put it i was quite breathless myself and blissfully content but i knew that wouldnt be the end of it she fulfilled you see four of the five conditions necessary for what may be called the australian ideal she was an immensely rich stunningly beautiful highlyskilled professional amorist with the sexual appetite of a pagan priestess she did not own a public house and having spent ten years entertaining a depraved idiot of unspeakable tastes she was now determined to make the most of flashy while he lasted which was until about noon next day so far as i could judge and if little an had offered to carry me away id have held out my arms whimpering weakly mind you it was partly my own fault for being such a susceptible romantic for it wasnt only her beauty or passion or matchless skill in the noble art that were nearly the death of me it was her pure irresistible charm when i was ruined beyond redemption face down and fagged out thinking aye well its been not a bad life and whod ha thought it would end on the emperor of chinas mattress in the chamber of divine repose on the morning of september then that perfumed musical whisper would be in my ear and id turn feebly to meet that angelic face with its little smile that pierced me through and such a wave of sentimental affection would come over me and a great longing to lock her in my heart forever and well somehow before i knew it it was boots and saddles again in a gazette article entitled the fate of the peiping captives in the late war you may read how col sir h flashman endured a captivity little better than slavery at the hands of his tormentors who treated him in the most degrading and insulting manner and subjected him to such usage as can seldom have been met with by a british officer in the hands of a savage foreign power its gospel true and omits only that if the army had known the circumstances theyd have been lining up to change places with me i was fourteen memorable days in the summer palace of pekin held thrall by the notorious yi concubine and since they followed the pattern of the first you may think i was on velvet which i was and silk satin gauze fur grass marble yellow jade oriental carpet leather upholstery a black watch tartan rug and the deck of a pleasure barge on the jade fountain lake which was her most extraordinary choice of all i think wed been cruising about watching a battle between little model gunboats blazing away at each other with tiny brass cannon when my lady becomes bored and consequently amorous and decided she didnt care to wait till we reached shore so she made every other soul on board jump overboard and flounder ashore in ten feet of water so that i could rattle her undisturbed two of the girls were almost drowned from this you might suppose that my sojourn was a continuous orgy not at all most of the time i was confined to yehonalas pavilion with a couple of the burliest eunuchs on guard for she was by no means preoccupied with me in those critical times when she was juggling to catch a crown sometimes i didnt see her for two days on end early in my captivity for instance she went with the emperor to jehol forty miles away where she tucked him up to die out of harms way before returning to pekin for the showdown with sang and the barbarians she was plotting and politicking for dear life then and i was her wednesday afternoon football match and brandyandcigar in the evening so to speak and her weekend picnic a humiliating position which i was mortal glad of after what id been through and i just prayed she wouldnt lose interest in her new toy before elgin closed his grip on pekin for incredibly our army was holding off at the last fearful that a hostile advance might spell the end of us hostages yet fearing too that delay might be equally fatal you may wonder how i knew of this it arose from yehonalas remarkable attitude towards me i said before that she spoke to me as though i were a pet poodle and that was precisely how she treated me not wholly surprising perhaps with all the arrogance and ignorance of the wellborn manchoo she thought of foreigners as rather less than human and exercised no more reticence before me than you do before poll or your tabby and since quite apart from coupling it was her whim to keep me on hand in her leisure hours when she walked or sat in the gardens or boated or played games with her ladies i learned a deal by sitting quiet with my ears open i suspect she paraded me chiefly to tease little an who was her constant attendant and couldnt abide the sight of me theyd talk shop by the lilypond while fido sunned himself on the grass the target of apples playfully tossed by her ladies and took it all in how parkes and loch had been segregated from the other prisoners and would make ideal candidates for the wire jacket when the time came yes the emperors signature was already on the vermilion death warrant which would be forwarded from jehol to pekin whenever she wished the word from the barbarian camp was that theyd rather negotiate than fight so she had time in hand if she wished prince kung the emperors brother could be relied on when the final struggle came for imperial power this was the kind of thing they discussed never dreaming it was understood one vital titbit of information explained why yehonala instead of staying with the emperor at jehol had returned to the summer palace i gathered that her fouryearold son tungchi to whom she was devoted was in pekin under the care of the empress consort sakota being heir to the throne he was far too important to be entrusted to his own mother who when all was said was only a concubine this was something that yehonala for all her great hidden power could do nothing about she could only keep as close to the child as possible ready to defy protocol by stepping in if he was in any danger or if the likes of sang or prince i tried to get their hands on him it might come to bloody palace revolution yet and possession of the infant would be vital quite apart from her being his doting mama in the meantime she could only wait and trust to sakota who was her cousin and bosom pal they having been apprentice concubines together before sakota was made empress it wasnt canny hearing all these state secrets and knowing that the speakers regarded me as no more sensate than the chairs they sat on i wondered if any spy had ever been so fortunately placed before the irony was that it was of no practical use with the eunuchs forever on the prowl and guards within call i might as well have been in a dungeon but at least my own position seemed secure enough so long as i betrayed no understanding the really dangerous times were when yehonala and i were in bed together and her attention close upon me her confounded playful poodletalk unnerved me for as youll guess if youve ever listened to a woman scratching a kittens belly it consisted mostly of damfool questions which it took presence of mind not to answer so ugly so ugly she would whisper lying on my chest and brushing her unbound hair across my face so ugly as to be almost magnificent arent you so misshapen and ungraceful great lumpy muscles youre very strong arent you strong and stupid with teeth like a horse open let me see them open i say gods do you have to be shown everything ugh i dont want to look at them horrible i wonder what your barbarian women are like are they repulsive too youll find them so after this wont you after the incomparable yi concubine i must look like a goddess to you do i look like a goddess is it possible you might prefer female barbarians i wonder i mean great apes like each other but you may never see your barbarian womenapes again not if i keep you i might when my son rules and im allpowerful would you like that i could send you now to jehol before your friends come or i could give you back to them no i dont want to lose you yet and how unhappy youd be without me wouldnt you you must think youre in heaven poor barbarian if only you could speak why cant you speak properly i mean suppose you could what would you say to me would you make love to me with words like the poets do you know what poetry is even could you write a poem in praise of my beauty in butterfly words fluttering crooked up and down the page of my heart jung lu wrote me a poem once comparing me to a new moon which was not very original what would you compare me to dyou think oh youre hopeless you couldnt love with words you know only one way dont you like a great greedy beast like this no greedy beast not like that be still like this slowly you see this is the fourteenth gossamer caress did you know there are more than twenty of them and the last the supreme delirium can be experienced only once for during it the lover dies they say let us be content with the fourteenth for the moment then well try the fifteenth shall we its desperate work listening to that kind of drivel with a straight face never showing a glimmer of comprehension in constant fear lest a blink of surprise to say nothing of an ecstatic shriek in the wrong language means certain and hideous death for i had no illusions about this sweet young thing if she so much as suspected i understood the wire jacket would be the least of it the more i knew of her the more i became aware of what i said some time ago that she was a compound of five of the deadly sins greed gluttony lust pride and anger with ruthlessness cruelty and treachery thrown in it was fatally easy to forget it gazing on that lovely face and embracing that wonderful body or listening to her chaffing little an or joking like a mischievous schoolgirl with her ladies for she had a great sense of fun and true playfulness and yet in spite of all that theres only one word to describe her she was a monster for one thing she really enjoyed cruelty and as an authority in the bullying line myself i dont speak lightly ranavalona of madagascar has always headed my list of atrocious females but she was raving mad and did her abominations almost offhand without emotion yehonala was anything but mad and if her cruelties seem trivial beside those of my malagassy moonbeam she still inflicted them with the relish of a true sadist she had a servant following her about with a case of canes and switches and when anyone displeased her down came the breeches and lay on with a will farriersergeant when two of her eunuchs caught some crows and released them with firecrackers tied to their legs so that the birds were blown to bits in midair yehonala had the culprits backsides cut to bloody pulp with bamboo whips watching the infliction of the full hundred strokes with smiling enjoyment you may say they deserved a drubbing but you didnt see it even crueller i thought was her treatment of a maid called willow who offended in some trivial way yehonala ordered another maid to start slapping willows face and when she didnt do it hard enough made willow slap her back in the end she had the two little chits thrashing each other in tears while she laughed and clapped her hands add that it was she who constantly urged the slaughter of prisoners and sent the suicide cords to unfortunate commanders and id say the cruelty case is proved for ruthlessness and treachery id refer you only to her first conversation in my presence as to the deadly sins i saw her in a towering rage only once with the birdblowing eunuchs but im told that her anger was legendary and could be berserk in its fury she wasnt a glutton in the ordinary sense but her pleasure in food was voluptuous especially in dainties like sugared seeds of various kinds and every kind of confectionery which seemed to have no effect on her figure she enjoyed opium but thought no one else should have it she also took snuff from a hollowedout pearl with a ruby stopper and was the prettiest sneezer you ever did see giving tiny little cheef noises and wrinkling her nose she was uncommon greedy for precious things which was astonishing since she had everything a woman could conceivably want yet she gloated over her jewellery and clothing in a way that was positively indecent and i doubt if enough money could have been minted to satisfy her hand in hand with her delight in clothing her transparent robes her pearl capes her enormous sleeves her thousand pairs of shoes the jewels which she would fondle as though they were alive went her vanity which was allconsuming and she had every reason for it as to her lust dont ask me how would i know perhaps on consideration im wrong to call her a monster unless its monstrous to indulge an unbridled appetite without regard for anyone or anything yes i think thats right i do and im a monster with yehonala everything was extreme whatever she did was done with every fibre of her and enjoyed with sensual intensity whether it was nibbling a sugared walnut or halfkilling a partner in bed or flaunting a new dress or having an offender flogged nearly to death or watching the sun go down over the fragrant hills or ruling an empire she would squeeze the last drop of savour out of it and lick her fingers afterwards if you could have seen her even walking with that quick gliding stride or pinning one of her five hundred jade butterfly brooches to her dress or playing the eight fairies travel across the sea game with her ladies or spraying glycerine on her face to fix her cosmetics always the same concentration the same implacable zeal to do it exactly right the same ambition for perfection no wonder she became mistress of all china or that the emperor died of her mattress gymnastics ten years its a marvel he lasted ten days i append these details because since she became one of the great women of history an eyewitness account may be of some interest perhaps itll help some clever biographer to plumb the mystery of her character i cant i knew her as a lover you see and dick burton assures me im a hopeless nympholeptic which sounds good fun she ravished my senses right enough and scared me to death which by the way is true of the only three women whom ive truly loved lola lakshmibai and yehonala an empress a queen and the greatest courtesan of her time i dare say im just a snob however my little charactersketch will have explained my growing anxiety in case she discovered that she was nourishing a chinesespeaking british viper in her gorgeous bosom for every day increased that risk and still elgin didnt move the british and french army seemed to have put down roots at tangchao a mere ten miles from pekin i couldnt fathom grants intentions with winter coming on his lines of communication gaping for a hundred miles behind him to the coast his force still outnumbered at least four to one if id had command of the remaining tartar cavalry id have had him and his army and his bull fiddle bottled on the peiho yet the reason according to little an was that the big barbarian was scared the prisoners would be murdered if he moved knowing elgin i was sure there must be more to it in fact he and grant were just makking siccar as my wife would say counting on the very error which i heard little an making to yehonala we shall have warning if they move says he the big guns will sound the order for the deaths of the barbarian prisoners can be dispatched and we shall have ample time to retire to jehol leaving sang and prince i and sushun and the rest of the reptiles to meet the wrath of the big barbarian hangki has charge of pahsiali and the other they can be removed quietly and executed by the jacket whenever you wish unless he glanced moodily at me you will be wise and put that thing away meeting his eye i smiled amiably and nodded what in the name of yenlo are you going to do with him orchid lady take him to jehol says she why not gods to jehol and play the harlot with him while while the son of heaven is dying in the next room well i can hardly play the harlot with the emperor in his condition can i and you know me little an i have to be playing the harlot with someone or so you keep telling me will you jest at such a time he shrilled oh little empress if you have no shame at least have sense prince kung and the empress dowager are lodged only a mile away in the ewenmingewen suppose word reached them of this beasts presence suppose sang gets to hear of it at the moment when you have the prize all but in your grasp oh why do i waste time talking to a lovely idol with an ivory head how will you hide him in jehol or on the road its a full days journey he can travel with the eunuchs it may be that ill keep him as one eventually perhaps make him chief in place of you at least he wont deafen me with impertinence by the way well travel to jehol by night have the horselitters and cavalry escort standing by from tomorrow the barbarians may come soon now by gad i hadnt liked the sound of that of course she was just joking teasing little an wasnt she one thing was sure she wasnt getting me to jehol when those guns sounded id make a run for it somehow if i could give my watchdogs the slip after dark even if i didnt get out of the summer palace there were acres of woodland to lie up in i might even get clear away and be in time to reach grant and have him send a flying column slap into the city to rescue parkes and the others probyn or fane would be in and out before the chinks knew theyd been aye but i mustnt run the slightest risk of capture myself the thought of being dragged back helpless to face her fury and little ans malice whats the matter with the filthy brute he looks as though hed seen a spirit it was little ans harsh squeal and i realised with a thrill of fear that he was staring at me how i didnt start round in guilty panic god knows i forced myself to sit still we were in the long ivory saloon of her pavilion an standing beside her chair while she ate her supper of peaches sliced in honey and wine myself on a stool about ten feet away a few of her ladies were playing go at the other end laughing and chattering softly out of the corner of my eye i could see yehonala had turned to look at me laying down her spoon i took a deep breath pressed my hands to my stomach and belched gently she laughed fried bread dragons or lovepangs for his orchid eh little an she returned to her peaches perhaps to my consternation he walked towards me slowly and i gave him my idiot smile as he paused before me a thoughtful frown on his pudgy face do you know orchid lady says he watching me i have sometimes wondered if this this stallion of yours is as senseless as he seems once or twice just now for instance ive wondered if he doesnt understand every word we say it was like a douche of cold water but i darent drop my eyes i could only blink without interest and hope the thunder of my heart wasnt audible what her spoon tinkled into the dish oh what old wool barbarians dont speak our language stupid pahsiali does like a schoolmaster his little eyes were bright with suspicion so will others perhaps this one and never a word out of him in days or any sign of sense nonsense what makes you think so apart from malice he continued to stare at me a look an expression a sense he shrugged i may be wrong but if im not the tale of your pleasuring him will be the least he can tell his eyes narrowed and i knew what was coming and began a cavernous yawn to cover the reaction which i knew he was going to startle out of me sure enough look at his thumb he squeaked now i defy anyone in my position not to twitch his thumb or whatever extremity is mentioned unless he has set his muscles and begun to yawn which is a fine suppressor of the guilty start hutton old pams treasury gunslinger taught me that one i saw the disappointment on little ans face and looked at him serenely if you are right says yehonala then he understands us now i glanced at her reasonably enough since shed spoken and felt sick she was frowning uncertainly upright in her chair she beckoned abruptly so i got up and went over meeting her stare with polite interest after a moment do you understand me says she sharply and i smiled hopefully as her eyes stayed steady on mine then she pointed at her feet so i knelt upright in front of her my face just below the level of her own about two feet away she continued to watch me intently that lovely oval mask expressionless and then said quietly i dont know an but we must be sure its a pity take the sabre from the wall yonder quietly when i say begin strike if it was a bluff it was bound to work even hope grant or rudi starnberg wouldnt have been able to repress a flicker when she spoke the fatal word and my nerves werent in the same parish as theirs i didnt hear little an move behind me but i knew hed be there quietly poising that razorsharp blade waiting i could only kneel patiently praying the sweat wasnt starting from my brow meeting her cold gaze with smiling inquiry as i would have done if id been innocent letting my smile fade uncertainly as she didnt respond i strove not to gulp to look easy knowing it was no go unless i could think of something was bound to flinch at the word in desperation i lowered my eyes searching for inspiration finally letting my glance stray to her bust she was wearing one of those tight silk manchoo dresses that button at the throat and are open to the breastbone leaving a gap through which appetising curves of eves puddings are to be seen i stared with rapt interest moving my head slightly for a better view moistened my lips and blew gently at the opening she flinched and i glanced up with an insolent suggestive twitch of the brow to let her see how my thoughts were running there was a shadow of doubt in the dark eyes so i returned to my leering contemplation of her bouncers with a contented sigh leaning a little closer and blowing again a longer sustained breeze this time begin says she softly and i continued to blow soft and steady without a tremor for i knew it was a bluff and that little an far from holding a sabre over my head was still ten feet away watching if you want to play doubledares with flashy dont do it when theres a polished walnut cabinet reflecting the room behind him idiot snaps yehonala and snatching up her spoon she flung it at ans head he doesnt understand a word youre a snivelling old woman and a spiteful little worm now get out and leave us alone by george i was glad to see the brute go hed had my innards in a rare turmoil for a few minutes and i knew that now his suspicions were aroused hed watch me like a lynx even in the small hours when yehonala had played us both out i was still too nervous to go to sleep for fear i babbled in chinese and next day to my consternation i was confined to my room with the door locked and a mongol trooper of the imperial guards cavalry on sentry which had never happened before i glimpsed him when they brought my dinner a hulking shavenheaded rascal in a mail coat and yellow sleeves i demanded in english to be let out and they slammed the door on me without a word i ate little dinner i can tell you pacing up and down my room with its high impossibly tiny windows asking myself if an had been poisoning her mind with suspicions but as the day wore on my anxieties changed colour something strange was doing in the summer palace there was distant bustle in yehonalas pavilion voices raised and feet hurrying outside in the garden towards evening there were unmistakable noises of horses going past and a peremptory voice in chinese i know the litters are there but the third ones empty no cushions or rugs why not an apologetic mumble and then well get them and stay with the grooms if anyone wanders off hell walk to jehol in a cangue so she was going was grant moving at last then but there hadnt been a single cannonshot ours or the chinese he couldnt be advancing on pekin without some hysterical tartar touching off a field piece surely tangchao was less than a dozen miles away the sound of firing would carry easily but the afternoon light was fading it wasnt possible he was coming today yehonalas people must have had a false alarm and then faroff there was the brazen whisper of a manchoo trumpet and a drum of approaching hoofbeats a single rider pounding across the sward voices calling anxiously at the front of the house and a hoarse cry of alarm the barbarians fly for your lives they are in the city the streets run with blood everyone is dead the temple of heaven is overthrown the shops are closed i swear its what he said and even the last part wasnt true not a single allied soldier was in pekin nor even a gun threatening its walls the manchoo army was watching in vain but the barbarians were coming all right grant had slipped his hounds without so much as a shout our cavalry was sweeping in from the north with the frog infantry in support everyone got lost in the dark and went blundering about famously but that only added to the chinese confusion i knew nothing of that as i listened to the uproar in the pavilion and now footsteps were padding to my door it was thrown open and a eunuch came in threw me a cloak and jerked his thumb i slipped it over the loose tunic and trousers that were my only clothes and followed him out my mongol guard looming behind me as we made our way to the ivory saloon the pavilion was in the throes of a flitting the halls and passageways were cluttered with luggage servants were staggering out under boxes and bundles eunuchs fussed everywhere maids were fluttering in silken confusion and a stalwart young manchoo guards officer was barking orders and cuffing heads in an effort to bring them to order only in the ivory saloon was there comparative peace with yehonala looking uncommon fetching in a magnificent snowleopard robe with a gigantic collar sitting at ease while little an fussed about her and half a dozen of her ladies waited in a respectful semicircle at the far end all dressed for the road she indicated that i should stand by her table and the mongol fell in beside me breathing garlic why dont they come little an was squeaking his face was bright with sweat if their soldiers are north of the city we may be cut off here how could we escape their devilcavalry who speed like flying dragons should we not send another messenger orchid what can be keeping them yehonala stifled a yawn the empress dowager will have mislaid her eyebrow tweezers stop fussing little an the barbarians are intent on pekin they wont come here even if they did jung lu has men on the road to bring word little an glanced round as though he expected to see elgin climbing in the window and stooped to whisper and if sang should come have you thought of that we know who hes after dont we suppose he were to come with riders what case are we in to resist him with only a handful of guards sang has enough to do with the barbarians fool besides he wouldnt dare lay hands on the empress or on him but i saw the silver nails were drumming gently on the arm of her chair you think theres anything that madman would not dare an shrilled i tell you orchid lady the barbarians can have pekin for him so long as he can get his claws on that will do eunuch antehai the lovely voice had a dangerous edge youre alarming my ladies which is bad for their digestions another word and youll stand on that table and repeat a hundred times i beg the ladies pardon for my unmannerly cowardice and humbly entreat the empress of the western palace to sentence me to a hundred lashes on my fat little bottom and shell do it too that sent her ladies into great giggles and little an fell sullenly silent the noises of exodus were dying away in the pavilion a door slammed and then there was silence i strained my ears if our fellows were north of the city they couldnt be more than five miles away yehonala was right they wouldnt bother with the summer palace until pekin was secure but if i could make a break perhaps when we set off it would be dark brisk footsteps sounded and the young guards commander strode in halting smartly and bowing his pagoda helmet to his waist the prince kung and the lady dowager have decided to remain concubine yi but the others will be here in a few minutes what can have happened to those tweezers says yehonala and probably the sleeping pantaloons too ah well are the litters ready colonel jung three horse palanquins in the court orchid with the carriage for your ladies he was breathing hard ive sent the servants carts ahead so that they wont delay us and had all the gates locked it will be necessary to reach the court by the garden passage he pointed to the narrow arch at the far end of the room where the ladies stood and from the court the avenue of dawn enchantment is walled as far as the jehol road where i have a troop waiting he paused for breath and little an cried why these precautions are the barbarians so close jung ignored him speaking direct to yehonala he was a goodlooking lad in a dense resolute sort of way guards officers much the same the world over i suppose not the barbarians orchid no my rider at the anting gate has not reported but it would be best to leave quickly as soon as the empress arrives there may be some danger in delay little an absolutely farted in agitation and was beginning to squeal but yehonala cut in be quiet what is it jung perhaps nothing he hesitated i stationed my sergeant on the pekin road halfway his horse came in just now without a rider there was silence for a moment then sang shrills little an i knew it what did i say lady there is no time to lose we must go at once we must without my son she was on her feet jung go and meet them bring them yourself bring them jung you understand he saluted and strode out and yehonala turned to the palpitating an and said quietly every shadow is not prince sang little an even sergeants fall off their horses sometimes no be silent whatever has happened your bleatings will do nothing to help she adjusted her fur collar its cold lady willow have them put the screen across the window as her woman pattered to obey she paced the floor slowly humming to herself outside the sound of jungs hoofbeats had faded and we waited in the stillness the air heavy with suspense she may have found it cold but i was sweating whatever the possible danger i reckoned jung was a good judge and hed been a sight more worried than he let on little an was visibly bursting with silent terrors in which sang presumably had the lead role well that was one i could do without if he bowled in i could see a pretty little scene ensuing when he recognised one of his star prisoners suppose i broke for it now a bolt for the door downstairs and into the garden my skin roughened at the thought the mongol was at my elbow stinking to high heaven never taking his eyes off me hohum cheer up little an says yehonala pausing in her walk and prodding him playfully in the stomach you need some exercise my lad i know wheres my cup and ball it was lying on the table beside me a priceless little toy of solid gold stem with a jade cup and a gold chain attaching to the ball which was a black pearl she was expert in its use but little an was a hopeless duffer and it was a standing joke with her to make him sweat away at it fumbling and squealing while her ladies went into fits i picked it up and handed it to her very well i was offguard preoccupied with the thought of bolting for safety and my action was purely automatic so much so that she had actually taken it with a little smile at me and it was only the horrified realisation dawning on my own face that made her stare without that my blunder might have passed unnoticed or i might have bluffed it out but now her eyes were blazing little an was shrieking and i lunged headlong for the door slipped on a rug on the polished floor and came down with a crash that shook the building the mongol was on me before i could roll away snarling like a bear his great hands reaching for my throat i thumped him once and then like a clever lad he had his knifepoint under my chin climbing off me nimbly and bringing me up like a hooked fish his free hand locked in my collar he shot a glance at yehonala and asked for instructions kill him kill him squealed little an hes a spy a barbarian spy a brilliant thought struck him gods he was sangs prisoner hes a spy of sangs he put him yonder says yehonala and the mongol thrust me down in her chair taking his stand behind it with his knife prodding the angle of my neck and shoulder it beats handcuffs any day why yelps little an kill him now aiee orchid why do you hesitate he has heard all he knows he must die at once before the empress comes please orchid kill him quickly she came to stand in front of me moving without haste and save for the black ice of her eyes there wasnt a trace of expression on the beautiful oval face framed in the fur collar even in that hellish moment i couldnt help thinking what an absolute peach she was she flicked the golden toy in her hand and the black pearl fell into the cup with a sharp click you speak and understand chinese it was a cold whisper and since there was no point in denial i nodded ignoring an who was gibbering for my blood she clicked the ball into its socket again and said the last thing id have expected you must have nerves like steel chains last night you knew what i had told little an but you didnt flinch by a hairs breadth im a soldier empress of the western palace i was trying not to croak with terror for i knew that if there was any hope at all it rested on a cool offhand bearing try it next time a mongols honing his knife on your jugular my names colonel banner chief flashman and im chief of intelligence to lord elgin whom you call the big barbarian hes a spy shrieks an he admits it kill him give the order orchid lady why did you never speak before her voice could never sound harsh but it was fit to freeze your ears why did you lie and deceive by silence are you a spy of course he is he said so he no i was a prisoner of prince sangs taken by treachery when you found me i was gagged and unable to speak by the time i was released i had heard so much that to have admitted my knowledge would have meant certain death i frowned gave my lip a gentle chew and then looked her in the eye speaking soft like a man striving valiantly to conceal his emotion you know a kind of ruptured galahad i had no wish to die not when i had found a new reason for living for a second she didnt take the drift and then dyou know she absolutely blushed and for the only time in our acquaintance she couldnt meet my eye he lies screamed little an god bless him orchid he has the tongue of a snake the lying barbarian dog will you let him insult you this beast kill him think what he knows think what hes done keep it up little an thinks i and youll talk me out of this yet she met my eye again cold as a clam you think you will live now she flicked her cup and ball again and missed why should you kill me when i can serve you better alive what ive overheard is in no way dangerous to you or to your son on the contrary i knew i mustnt babble in panic but maintain a calm measured delivery head up jaw firm eyes steady bowels dissolving tomorrow the british army will be in pekin seeking a treaty not with prince sang or prince i or sushun but as you said yourself with an emperor acceptable to the barbarians since its likely that the present emperor will die i can think of no more acceptable successor than your own son guided by those who love him and seek the good of china so ill tell lord elgin and hell believe me he will also see it for himself and believe me empress if you want a friend youll find none better than the big barbarian except one by jove it was manly stuff and true for that matter how she was taking it i couldnt tell for her face was as masklike as ever little an wasnt buying hed picked his line a singularly unattractive one and was sticking to it the mongol i wasnt sure about but he wasnt a voting shareholder i sat bursting with concealed funk should i say more yehonala flicked her cup again and this time the ball snapped home with such finality that like a fool i came out with the first thing that entered my head of course youd want to stop the death warrants for pahsiali and the others lord elgin would never forgive i stopped dead appalled at the thought that i was voicing a threat and an even more frightful thought occurred suppose parkes was dead already oh jesus what had i said yehonalas reply left me in no doubt he would never forgive prince sang you mean yes yes cries an eagerly that is the way dont listen to this liar orchid kill him and have done hes a spy wholl take every word to the big barbarian lying and poisoning him against us what do they care for china they hate us mutinous slaves he turned on her hissing and he would defame you oh he wont tell them just what hes heard hell invent foul slanders abominations mocking your honour the temptation to bellow him down with indignant denials was strong but i knew it wouldnt do with this icy beautys eye on me and her mouth tightening as she listened i waited until he ran out of venom and sighed there speaks the jealous eunuch says i and gave her just a hint of my wistful flashy smile what can he know orchid lady those were my bolts shot diplomatic and romantic and if they didnt hold i could try shooting feet first out of the chair and diving for the door but i rather fancied the expert at my back would be ready for that i waited while she clicked her infernal toy again and then she turned abruptly away signing little an to follow her out of earshot at the end of the room her ladies stood agog twittering at this sensation while she and an conferred my watchdog and i fell into conversation lift the point a little soldier will you shut up pig whether our friendship would have ripened or what conclusion yehonala and an would have reached i can only guess for it was at that moment that we were interrupted one second all was still and then there was a confused tumult from the garden a babble of voices with a man shouting and women crying out closer at hand distant yells and the sound of approaching hoofbeats feet running in the house itself and then the door was flung open and a tiny boy rushed into the room he was the complete little mandarin button hat and dragon robe and all and at the sight of yehonala he screamed with delight and raced towards her arms out only to stop abruptly and make a very slow deep bow which was never completed for she had swept him up kissing him crying out and hugging him to her cheek then there were women in the room three of them a tall bonny manchoo girl with scared eyes in a sable hat and cloak and two other ladies one of them squealing in alarm from the fact that everyone in the room except yehonala and my mongol dropped to their knees and knocked head i knew this could only be the empress sakota and the little boy who was demanding shrilly to be let down so that he could show yehonala his new watch with the little bell must be the heir to the throne tungchi they were all crying out at once but before any sense could be made of it there was a yell and a clang of steel from the front of the house a stentorian voice roaring to knock the bastard down but not to kill him and noises to suggest that this was being done not without difficulty then the empress sakota went into hysterics covering her ears and shrilling wildly her ladies stood appalled and helpless until yehonala slapped her soundly pushing her towards her own ladies who bore her in a screaming scrimmage to the end of the room one of sakotas females swooned the other was sobbing that the prince general was here and booted feet were striding up the passage the halfopen door was thrown back to the wall and general sangkolinsen stood on the threshold it had happened more quickly than it takes to tell i doubt if a minute had elapsed since the mongol told me to shut up and now for a second the room was still as death except for the subdued sobbing of the empress and the little princes shrill voice see when i push it it rings it rings he pulled at yehonalas sleeve see mama it rings she had set him down but now she picked him up again and handed him to little an who had turned a pale green but took the boy and was turning away at yehonalas quiet word when sang roared wait and advanced a couple of paces into the room he was in full fig of tin belly and mailed legs with a fur cloak hanging from his shoulders his dragon helmet under one arm and his shaven skull gleaming like a moon two wiry tartar troopers were at his back and i think it was the sight of them that made my mongol withdraw his knife and step clear of my chair his hand resting on his sabrehilt i sat still im nobodys fool yehonala stood perfectly still in the centre of the room facing sang who had halted about ten feet away his basilisk stare moved from little an to her and he gave her a curt nod all harmony yi concubine i have all harmony lord sang says she quietly but you forget her imperial highness is in the room he grunted and ducked his head towards the distant women her imperial highnesss pardon my business is with his highness the son of the son of heaven his sacred presence is required in pekin the prince i commands it his highness is going to jehol says she the emperor commands it her tone rather than the words made his face crimson and i saw the cords of his bull neck stiffen in anger but instead of howling as usual he gave a contemptuous snort you have a vermilion decree swaying the wide world no then we waste time ill take his highness i have an escort chief eunuch says she take his highness down to the court at once she stood as stately calm as ever but i caught the shake in her voice and so did sang for he laughed again stand still bladder dont be a fool yi concubine your imperial guards hero is down there with a broken head and this fellowll take my orders he jerked a thumb at my mongol glanced in our direction and noticed me for the first time for a moment he frowned and then his eyes dilated and his mouth gaped which didnt improve his appearance one bit that he bawled by death what is it doing here he is a banner chief of the barbarian army she retorted a staff officer of the big barbarian himself i know what he is i asked how he came here his glare fell on little an halfhidden behind yehonala and clinging to the small prince as though he were a lifebelt you capon is this some of your work no you scum you never do anything but at her bidding he thrust out his jaw at yehonala well what is an enemy prisoner doing in the yi concubines pavilion i am not answerable to you her voice trembled with anger now get out of my house and knock your head as you go you lowborn mongol he actually fell back a pace and then he seemed to swell towering above her with both mailed hands raised mouthing like a maniac my guard took a pace forward but sang mastered himself glaring from one to other of us and his dirty mind must have come to the right conclusion for suddenly he gave a snarling grin ah i begin to see well its no matter well put the foreign filth where he belongs in the board of punishments and you he shouted at yehonala can answer to the supreme tribunal and bring your own silk cord with you traitress he gestured to his men take his imperial highness and that fanqui rubbish one of the tartars stepped towards yehonala none too brisk and she turned and snatched the boy from little an pulling him close to her side she was quivering like a deer but her eyes were blazing dare dare to touch him you stable scum and youll die for it for treason and sacrilege the emperor will on the word of a faithless whore jeers sang and thrust the tartar brutally forward fetch him fool the tartar took another step little an screamed and blundered bravely forward arms windmilling to bar his way and yehonala swung the prince up in her arms turned to run in sudden panic realised it was hopeless and turned again helpless the tartar flung little an aside the ladies behind wailed in terror and yehonala flung out a hand to ward off the tartar crying out help me stop them help me and by god she was calling to me well you know what follows when a beautiful young woman threatened by brutal enemies turns to me in a frenzy of entreaty hand outstretched and eyes imploring if shes lucky i may roar for the bobbies as i slide over the sill but this was different for while theyd been trading insults id been calculating like sin and i knew how it must be even before she hollered for help if sang prevailed i was dead meat if i turned up trumps yehonala would see me right if sang thought he could rule out the mongol he was wrong for the brute was not only an imperial guardsman worth two tartars any day he had a mishandled chief to avenge and the sight of yehonala threatened had been causing him to bristle like a chivalrous gorilla it was his size that determined me and the fact that there wasnt a sill to slide over anyway it was now or never i leaped from my chair crimson with fear and roared sangkolinsen that lady and her child are under the protection of her majestys government molest them at your peril i speak for lord elgin and the british army so so back off dyou see and for good measure i added you dirty dog you it stopped em dead in sheer amazement dick dauntless facing the stricken heathen and i wished elspeth could have seen me just then or perhaps considering what yehonala looked like better not there was a breathless pause and then sang went literally mad with rage howling and lugging out his sword i yelped and sprang away turning for the sabre which i knew was on the wall since yehonala had indicated it to an last night and the damned thing wasnt there sangs blade whirled in a glittering arc and i hurled myself aside bellowing as it shattered a table in my rear there was the sabre three yards along i leaped and snatched it from the wall whirling to meet another furious cut roaring to the mongol to get on parade and breaking ground as sang came after me frothing like a pidog on clear floor i fell on guard parrying two cuts to take his measure and my heart leaped as i realised id been right in one vital hope he couldnt use a sabre to save himself he was a blind furious lasher so i exposed my flank took the cut on the forte waited his lurching recovery and ran him through the left arm i neednt have fretted about the mongol one tartar was down with his guts on the rug and the other was in desperate retreat with my lad coming in foot and hand i had a brief glimpse of the room wailing women stampeding for the archway passage leading to the court little an carrying the prince and herding them like a fat collie yehonala standing halfway watching us clutching her fur to her neck and then sang was on me again spraying gore and hewing like a woodman oh he was game right you swine thinks i thisll read well in the morning post and i went in to kill him id have done it too but the cowardly bastard got behind a table roaring for help yehonala suddenly cried out and i stole a glance behind there were fur caps and swords in the doorway with the mongol charging them more of sangs riders three at the least but the mongol was holding them in the narrow entrance useful chap he was die hard attila i roared to encourage him took a last cut at sang and turned to race along the room yehonala was at the archway glancing back anxiously while little an who seemed to have got shot of the prince to one of the women pleaded with her to make haste i seconded that as i ran for i wanted no one hindering my line of retreat get out woman run for it well stand em off by which i meant that the mongol would but just as i came level with him moving smoothly the mob in the doorway forced him back and i must turn to cover his flank hed done for the original two but had taken a couple of cuts in the process one an ugly gash on the face that was running like a tap there were four new swords against us and as the mongol reeled i could only ply the maltese cross for my very life then he recovered and we retreated shoulder to shoulder for the arch while sang came steaming up with shouts and great action damning em for sluggards but keeping his distance that mongol was a complete hand ive never seen a faster big man and with his tremendous reach he could have given my old chum de gautet a few minutes trouble he fought lefthanded with a short sword in his right and didnt mind at all taking a cut in a good cause he stopped one with his bare shoulder grunted and chopped like lightning and there was a head trundling away across the polished floor while the mongol bayed triumphantly and the three other tartars checked aghast and reviewed the position with sang going demented we were under the arch and into the passage and since there was room for only one i considerately went first while genghiz turned and dared the foemen to come on clashing his hilts against his mailed chest and howling with laughter he seemed in such spirits that i left him to it flying along the passage and round the corner and not so much as a mousehole to hide in so i must career down the stairs and into the starlit dark of the walled court two horsepalkis were clattering out and away along an avenue of high impenetrable hedges one remained and yehonala was drawing aside its curtain preparing to climb in but looking back anxiously for me i like to think for she gave a little cry as i appeared little an was trying to climb aboard the lead horse and making sad work of it squealing oaths and slipping under its neck i heaved him up bodily it was like handling a mattress full of blancmange and slapped the beast with the flat of my sabre it started forward and as the palki came by yehonala had the curtain raised she said nothing but stretched out her hand i caught it for a second and she smiled then the palki was past and i got a foot on the shaft and swung aboard the rear horse and we were away the palki swaying like a hammock between the two beasts as we lumbered down the avenue i looked back the court was empty under the stars which suggested that my mongol was still at profitable labour and if you cry out on me for a deserter so i am and you can spare your sympathy for his opponents the avenue ran straight for half a mile and we picked up a good pace with the panic of action over i was suddenly reeling tired and trembling at the thought of the risks id run the temptation to sink forward on the horses mane sobbing with relief mastered me for a moment and then i thought sit up you fool youre still in the wood the avenue was curving now and the hedge had thinned to a border of bushes two furlongs ahead there were lanterns burning and the helmets of horsemen jung lus troop waiting on the jehol road time to go so i swung my leg over gripped my sabre and hopped down the palki faded into the night there were faint shouts from the gate and the lanterns were moving up the avenue to meet it why did i slip my cable when id just won the gratitude of a powerful and beautiful woman who was halfcrazy about me to start with well ill tell you gratitudes a funny thing do a favour and often as not youve made an enemy or at best a grudging friend folk hate to feel obliged and in yehonalas case how long would it have been before she remembered how much dangerous knowledge i had of her and her ambitions and the debt had dwindled into insignificance with little an putting in his twopennorth of hate perhaps i misjudge her perhaps she could feel gratitude with the same intensity she gave to her vice but i doubt it gratitude feeds best on love and the only love she had for me was an insatiable appetite for jolly roger i on the other hand was perfectly ready for a change from chinkmeat and yet even now i can feel a stopping of the heart when i see in memory that lovely pale oval mask suspended in the blackness of the palki smiling at me and the slim fingers brushing for a moment across mine oh she had a magic and its with me still when i saw her again forty years later i was gulping like a boy that was during the boxer nonsense when she was old buddha still with china helpless in those tiny silver talons shed hardly changed a little plumper in the face more heavilypainted but the eye was as bright as a girls and the voice when i heard those soft singing tones the years fell away and i was in the summer palace on a sunlit lawn watching that perfect profile against the dark leaves listening to the bells across the lake she didnt recognise the big silverwhiskered grogfaced ruffian among the diplomatic riffraff and i didnt make myself known we spoke for only a moment i remember she talked of western dancing as two people holding hands and jumping all over the room and then she gave a little sigh and said we should have thought it a very tame amusement in my young day i wonder if she did recognise me anyway wild horses wouldnt have got me to jehol my one thought was the army and safety so i put the pole star just abaft my left shoulder and set off on my last quiet stroll through the summer palace i was close by the boundary well clear of sang and his scoundrels supposing the mongol hadnt slaughtered them all with luck and knew that an hours easy march should bring me in reach of the pekin road there id take stock and cast about for our fellows mind you looking back i was uncommon reckless for heaven knew what imps might be loose about the night but it seemed so quiet and serene under the starlight with the breeze soft in the branches and long cypress shadows reaching across the lawns the distant glimmer of a lake the twinkle of light from a pavilion halfhidden in the groves i remember thinking as i walked youll never find such peace again youll forget the blood and terror in which you came to it and came away and remember only the starlit garden her place and call it heaven as i moved silently up the last slope i looked back and there it lay fairyland on earth the last elysium stretching away in the dawn dark seen through the misty vision of her face it struck me that there might be some good portable loot in the ewenmingewen and never a better chance with the empresss suite cleared out in haste and everyone else either fled or occupied with events around pekin it wasnt much out of my way so i slipped swiftly through the trees until i saw the great gold hall of audience ahead and scouted through the bushes for a looksee and dyou know what the plundering froggy bastards had got there first i heard their racket ahead and couldnt make out who it might be for our folk couldnt be so close surely then i tripped over a dead eunuch and saw there were about a dozen of em still figures sprawled on the sward towards the great gate one poor fat sod was clutching a huge ornamental snickersnee of carved ivory and another had a little ladys bow and golden arrows and theyd tried to defend their treasure house against european infantryl the hall entrance was lit by flickering lanterns and people were hurrying in and out there were marching feet down by the gate and then i heard halle sac a terre and i whooped for joy and ran across the lawn shouting there was a young lieutenant posting pickets around the building and when id made myself known he was in a rare frenzy and i must see his captain for i was the first prisoner theyd seen death of his life and where were the others labbй and m gommelle and see mon capitaine un colonel anglais quel phйnomиne avec un glaive et les pantalons chines i answered his questions as best i could and learned that they were the advance guard of a french regiment sent to secure the northern approach to the city and what was this place le palais estival le residence impйrial ma foi ici corporal fromage and listen to this pardon oh yes there were british cavalry about somewhere but in the dark who knew now if i would excuse him i sat on a rocketbox dog tired eating bread and issue wine watching an endless stream of chattering yelling frog infantry swarming out of the hall of audience weighed down with bolts of silk bundles of shimmering dragon robes jade vases clocks jewelled watches pictures everything they could lay hands on some were wearing womens dresses and hats i remember one roaring bearded sergeant with a magnificent cloth of gold gown kilted up above his red breeches dancing a cancan as his mates yelled and clapped another was skimming plumed picture hats up in the air like a jugglers plates my little lieutenant had a cashmere shawl embroidered with tiny gems about his shoulders and the major was casting a connoisseurs eye over a fine giltframed painting and exclaiming that it was a petitot as ever was there were enormous piles of loot growing in the courtyard silks here clocks there paintings over yonder vases farther on very orderly in their plundering were our gallic allies but what would you when grandpapa has followed napoleon you know how such things should be done so the french army loot by numbers with a shrewd eye to quality while the indiscriminate british will lift anything that comes in their way just for the fun of it it was sunrise and the frogs were exclaiming over the sight of the hall of audience gleaming in the first rays shading their eyes and running off for a better look when i managed to collar a mule and set off at a nice amble down the pekin road the french were camped everywhere but only a mile along i struck a troop of dragoons boiling their dixies by the roadside no we werent in pekin yet and grant intended to force a capitulation by wheeling up his guns to the anting gate and putting his finger on the trigger so to speak so the campaign was over i commandeered a horse and a few minutes later was trotting in to the grounds of a fine temple where advance headquarters had been set up and the first thing i saw was elgin still in his nightshirt the rising sun gilding his pate munching a bun and waving a bottle of beer at a big map on an easel with hope grant and the staff ringed round him there was a tremendous yell when i hove in view and a tumult of questions as i slid from the saddle and fellows slapping me on the back and shouting the prisoners are safe and hurrahing and elgin came bustling to shake my hand crying flashman my dear chap wed given you up for dead thank god youre safe my dear fellow wherever have you been this is capital my boy are you hurt have those villains illused you i couldnt answer because all of a sudden i felt very weak and wanted to blub i think it was the kind words the first id heard in ever so long although it was barely three weeks and the english voices and everyone looking so cheery and glad to see me and the anxious glower on elgins bulldog face at the thought that id been mistreated and just the knowledge that i was home then someone whistled exclaiming and they were all staring at the sabre which id hung from my saddle dried blood all over the blade sangs blood and that struck me as ever so funny for some reason and id have laughed if id had the energy but i just stood mum and choking while they cried out and shouted questions and rejoiced until hope grant shouldered them all aside pretty rough even elgin and pushed me down on to a stool and put a cup of tea in my hand and stood with his hand round my shoulders not saying a word then i blubbed survival apart the great thing in intelligence work is knowing how to report well you saw that at the start of this memoir when i danced truths gossamer tightrope before parkes at canton the principal aim remember is to win the greatest possible credit to yourself which calls not only for the exclusion of anything that might damage you but also for the judicious understatement of those things which tell in your favour if any brush em aside never boast let appearances speak for themselves this was revealed to me at the age of nineteen when i woke in jalallabad hospital to find myself a hero provided i lay still and made the right responses then you must convince your chiefs that what youre telling em is important which aint difficult since they want to believe you having chiefs of their own to satisfy make as much mystery of your methods as you can hint what a thoroughgoing ruffian you can be in a good cause but never forget that innocence shines brighter than any virtue remember that silence frequently passes for shrewdness and that while suppressio veri is a damned good servant suggestio falsi is a perilous master selah i stuck to these principles in making my verbal report to elgin that afternoon and for once they were almost completely wasted this was because the first words id uttered after gulping grants tea were to tell him that there was a vermilion death sentence on parkes and the other prisoners this caused such a sensation that once id told all i knew about it i was forgotten in the uproar of activity with diplomatic threats being sent into pekin and probyn ordered to stand by with a flying squadron and when i sat down with elgin later and gave him my wordofmouth it was plain that the fate of our people was the only thing on his mind reasonably enough my account of the secret intrigues of the imperial court interested him hardly at all it cramped my style which as ive indicated tends to be bluff and laconic making little of such hardships as binding caging and starvation oh they knocked me about a bit you know is my line but he wasnt having it he wanted every detail of my treatment and damn the politics so he got it including a fictitious account of how theyd hammered me senseless before dragging me gasping defiance to audience with the emperor so that i didnt remember much about it i neednt have fretted elgin was still grinding his teeth over sangs threatening me with death by the thousand cuts and clenching his fist at the butchery of nolan my account of captivity in the summer palace which id planned as my piиce de rйsistance fell flat as your hat i gave him the plain unvarnished truth too omitting only the trifling detail that the emperors favourite concubine had been grinding me breathless every night i believe in discretion and delicacy you see for one thing you never know wholl run tattling to elspeth anyway id have thought my story sufficiently sensational as it was he received it almost impatiently prime political stuff and all i now realise that even if he hadnt had the prisoners obsessing him he still wouldnt have been much interested in all the tattle id eavesdropped between yehonala and little an he was there to ratify a treaty and show the chinese that we meant business the last thing he wanted was entanglement in manchoo politics with himself acting as kingmaker or anything of that sort he brightened briefly at my description of the setto with sang and his braves but when id done his first question was excepting prince sangs murderous attack was no violence offered to you at the summer palace none at all no rigorous confinement or illusage hardly my lord says i and just for devilment i added the yi concubines ladies did throw apples at me on one occasion good god cries he apples he stared at me in play you mean i believe it was in a spirit of mischief my lord they were quite small apples small apples ill be damned he muttered and thought hard for a moment frowning at the scenery and then at me did you obtain any inkling of the purpose for which you were kept at the house of this yi concubine did you say i gathered she had never seen a barbarian before says i gravely she seemed to regard me as a curiosity damned impertinence says he but i noticed his pate had gone slightly pink what sort of a woman is she in her person i mean i reflected judiciously ravishing is the word that best describes her my lord quite ravishing in the oriental style oh i see he digested this and her character strong retiring amiable perhaps take it shes an educated woman not amiable precisely i shook my head strongwilled certainly exacting purposeful immensely energetic i should say she was extremely welleducated my lord at this point he noticed that his young secretary whod been recording my report was agog with hopeful interest so he concluded rather abruptly by saying id done extremely well congratulated me on my safe return told the secretary to make a fair copy for me to sign and dismissed me shooting me a last perplexed look that business about being pelted with apples by harem beauties had unsettled him i could see he wasnt alone either outside i found the young penpusher blinking at me enviously obviously wishing that he too could be regarded as a curiosity by ravishing orientals i say says he the summer palace must be a jolly place damned jolly says i did you get it all down i say oh yes every word it was frightfully interesting you know not at all like most reports he peered at his notes through steamy spectacles ah yes whats a concubine harlequins ladylove in the pantomime no dont put that down you young juggins a concubine is a chinese noblemans personal whore i say how dyou spell it i told him and what he told others in his turn i dont care to think but just to show you how rumours run and reputations are made desborough of the artillery swore to me later that hed heard one of his gunners telling his chum that there was no daht abaht it flash arry ad got isself took prisoner apurpose see cos e was beloved by this yeller bint the empress o china an im an sam collinson wot was jealous ad fought a bloody duel over er an flash arry touched the barstid in five places strite up an then cut is bleedin ead orf see strange how close fiction can come to truth aint it the oddest thing of all was that the part of the yarn which did gain some acceptance among quite sensible people too was that id deliberately allowed myself to be captured as a clever way of getting into the enemys headquarters folkll believe anything especially if theyve invented it themselves anyway you can see why i dont count my report to elgin entirely wasted later that day he and grant and our senior commanders went to the ewenmingewen officially to view the splendours but in fact to make sure that the frogs didnt pick it clean before our army got its share i was on hand and absolutely heard montauban protesting volubly that no looting whatever had taken place this with his rascals still streaming out of the hall of audience with everything but the floortiles and the piles of spoil filling the great courtyard some of our earlycomers i noticed were already among the plunderers a party of sikh cavalry were offering magnificent bolts of coloured silk to the later arrivals at two dollars a time and the frogs whod had the best of it were doing a fine trade in jade tablets watches jewelled masks furs ornamental weapons enamels toys and robes and finding no lack of takers the yard was like a tremendous gaudy market for loot from the other buildings near at hand was being brought in as well and fellows were bargaining away what they couldnt carry elgin watched in bleak disgust with montauban hopping at his elbow crying ah but this is merely to make the inventory is it not so that all can be divided fairly among the allies milor might rest assured that every item would be accounted for so that all should benefit what a splendid place it has been says elgin sadly standing in the entrance to the great golden hall and now desolation the floor was covered with broken shards of glass and jade and porcelain broken cabinetwork and torn hangings and gangs of frogs and chink villagers and our own early birds were swarming everywhere after the last pickings the vast hollow chamber echoing to their yells of triumph and disappointment the smashing of furniture and pottery that was too big to carry the oaths and laughter and quarrelling no credit to our vaunted civilisation gentlemen says elgin and everyone looked sober except montauban who sulked cant stop it says hope grant casting a bright professional eye and tugging his whisker soldiers privilege time immemorial he glanced at me remember lucknow it is the waste that offends cries elgin i daresay this place contained a million yesterday how much would it fetch now fifty thousand bah plunder is one thing but sheer wanton destruction he shook his head angrily wolseley consulting a notebook said that of course this was only a fraction of the summer palace which was of vast extent no doubt packed with stuff flashman probably knew it best of anybody at which they all fell silent and looked to me you never in your life saw so many beady eyes just for a second i had a vision of that pretty pavilion by the lake and yehonalas white hand placing a delicate ivory fairypiece on the game board just so the silver nails reflected in the polished jade her ladies silken sleeves rustling and felt a sudden anger and revulsion but what was the odds when theyd find it anyway and why not after all wed won the irony was that if the manchoos had kept their word on the treaty to begin with or even compromised a fortnight ago wed never have been near the place i said there were hundreds of buildings palaces and temples and so forth spread over many miles of parkland that the ewen where we stood was probably the biggest since it contained the imperial apartments but that the rest was pretty fine too good spot o boodle though what says someone i said i supposed thered be enough to go round at this there was great debate about the need for prize agents who would select prime pieces for each army the rest going for individual spoil grant said he would have all the british share sold and paid out to the troops as prize money on the spot rather than wait for government adjudication which would have meant cut shares at the end of the day some ass said that was unauthorised grant said he didnt give a dam he was doing it anyway who took pekin says he commons committee no such thing our fellows very good wrath o the gods ill stand bail he did it too wolseley who was a dab artist was in a fidget to be exercising his pencil so after the seniors had departed i strolled with him among the buildings and we watched the looters gutting the place as elgin had observed and i knew from india they destroyed fifty times what they took away see how they enjoy destruction says joe sketching for dear life while i smoked and studied its a marvellous thing the effect of plunder on soldiers i suppose they feel real power for once in their wretched lives not the power to kill they know all about that its just brute force against a body but the greater power to destroy a creation of the mind something they know they could never make look at that just look at em will you he was pointing up at a gallery where a mob of whitechapel scruff had found huge boxes of the most delicate yellow eggshell porcelain priceless pieces varying in size from vases four feet high to the tiniest teacups each wrapped carefully in fine tissue they were throwing em down from the balcony in a golden shower to smash on the floor in explosions of a million glittering fragments so light that they drifted like a snowmist through the hall those below ran laughing among them scattering them and making them swirl like golden smoke yelling to the chaps above to throw down more which they did until the whole place seemed to be filled with it cant draw that grumbles joe hang it all turner himself couldnt catch that colour odd aint it thats quite lovely too we watched another gang british french and sikhs manhandling an enormous vase twenty feet if it was an inch all inlaid with dazzling mosaic work to the top of a flight of steps poising it with a onetwothreeandaway and hurrahing like mad as it smashed with an explosion like artillery scattering gleaming shards everywhere and at the same time there were quiet coves going about methodically examining a jade bowl here and an enamel tablet there consulting and appraising and dropping em in their knapsacks you know that porcelain statuette on the mantel or the pretty screen with dragons on it that aunt sophies so proud of thats what they were picking up while alongside em patsy hooligan was kicking a door in because he couldnt be bothered to try the handle and pierre maquereau was grimacing at himself in a sиvres mirror and taking the butt to his own reflection and yussef beg was carving up an oil painting with his bayonet and joe tomkins was painting a moustache on an ivory venus hawhawing while jock machaggis used it as an aunt sally and the little chinaman from down the road oh dont forget him was squealing with glee as he ripped up clothofgold cushions and capered among the feathers and through it all went the quiet strollers like joe and me and the tall fair fellow in the sapper coat whom we found in a room that had once contained hundreds of jewelled timepieces and mechanical toys and was now ankledeep in glittering rubble he had found an item undamaged and was grinning delightedly over it i really must have this cries he she will be delighted with it dont you think such exquisite craftsmanship he sighed fondly what pleasure to look at a gift for a dear one at home and think of the joy with which it will be received it was one of the little chiming watches enamelled and inlaid with diamonds he held it up for joe and me to look at exclaiming at the clear tone of the bell see mama it rings thinks ito myself dear god had that been only yesterday she would be safe in jehol now with her dying emperor and the little son through whom she hoped to rule china what would she think when she came back to her beloved summer palace we complimented the fair chap on his good taste id never seen him before but i knew him well later on he was chinese gordon the three of us took a turn in the gardens and watched a group of enthusiasts digging up shrubs and flowers and sticking them in jade vases filched from the rooms i can see these taking splendidly in suffolk cries one i say jim if only we can keep em alive what a capital rockery we shall have give him the transport hed have had the blasted trees up suddenly i stopped short at the sight of a round doorway in the third palace it was the one scarred now with shotholes we went in and the anteroom that had been hung with the son of heavens quilted dragon robes was bare as a cupboard and not a trace of the musk with which little an had sprayed me no wonder since the soldiery had been pissing on the floor but here was the little corridor to the chamber of divine repose the great golden door hung half off its hinges its precious mouldings stripped away and the handle hacked off the tortoiseshell plaques of the concubines were scattered about some of them broken gordon turned one over what can these be tokens in some sort of game dyou suppose i said i was fairly sure he was right my heart was beating faster as i followed the others into the room i didnt really want to see it but i looked about anyway the filthy pictures and implements of perversion had gone the mattress of the great bed had been dragged from the alcove and hacked to shreds its purple silks torn the gold pillows ripped open but it was the shattered hole in the dressingtable mirror that made me wince that was where her lovely reflection had looked out at me while she painted carefully at her lower lip that broken stool had supported the wonderful body with one perfect leg thrust out to the side the silver toes brushing the carpet yet even amid that wreckage while the others gaped and speculated foolishly about whose room it had been there was a fierce secret joy about remembering how the others would have stared if theyd known gordon would probably have burst into tears i didnt know which was her tortoiseshell plaque but i took one anyway slipping it into my pocket with the jewellery and gold id picked up on our walk though none of it compared with the black jade chessmen i collared in the birthday garden a couple of days later no one else would even look at em which showed judgment since the experts will tell you that black jade doesnt exist i dont mind all i know is that while lucknow paid for gandamack lodge those chessmen bought me the place on berkeley square but i still have the tortoiseshell plaque elspeth stands her bedside teapot on it the prisoners are safe someone had hollered when i first rode into elgins headquarters supposing that my appearance heralded the return of the others they werent and it didnt although hopes ran high when loch and parkes turned up a day later theyd been released fifteen minutes before their vermilion death warrant arrived at the board of punishments whether yehonala or the mandarin who had special charge of them hangki had held it back or whether they were just plain lucky we never discovered theyd had a bad time parkes had escaped with binding and hammering but loch had been dungeoned and shackled and put to the iron collar and from what hed seen he suspected that some of the others had been tortured to death whether elgin had any earlier suspicion of this i cant say i think he may have from the way he questioned me about my treatment in any event his one thought now was to get them out grant had already positioned his guns against the anting gate and the word went to prince kung the emperors brother and regent that unless pekin surrendered and the prisoners were released the bombardment would begin and still the chinese put off the inevitable with futile messages and maddening delays while elgin aged ten years under the mortal fear that if he did start shooting the prisoners would be goners for certain so he must wait and hope and question parkes and loch and me again and again about our treatment and what we thought might be happening to the others id escaped on the sunday parkes and loch arrived on the monday it was friday before eight sikhs and three frenchmen were set free and when elgin had talked to them he came out greyfaced and told grant that he was to open fire the following noon at the eleventh hour kung surrendered and the following night the first bodies came out they came on carts after dark four of them two british two sikh and had to be examined by torchlight when the lids came off the coffins there were cries of horror and disbelief and one or two of the younger fellows turned away physically sick after that no one said a word except to whisper christ thats anderson or thats mahomed bux my daffadar or thats de normann is it elgin stopped at each coffin in turn with a face like stone then he said harshly to replace the lids and stood turning his hat in his hands staring before him and i saw him biting his lips and the tears shining in the torchlight then he walked quickly away without a word the other bodies came two days later they had been used in the same fashion fourteen of them and if elgin had given the word our army would have slaughtered every man in pekin now ive never aimed to horrify you for horrifyings sake or revelled in gory detail with the excuse that im just being a faithful historian but im bound to tell you what the chinese had done if you are to understand the sequel and judge it if youve a mind to the bodies were in quicklime but it was still easy to see what had happened i told you the chinese tie their captives as tightly as possible so that eventually the hands and feet burst and mortify some of our people had been bound for weeks a few au crapaudine some hung up some with heavy chains many had had their bonds soaked to make them tighter others had been flogged ill add only that if in a chinese prison you get the least cut or scratch goodnight theres a special kind of maggot by the million and they eat you alive agonisingly sometimes for weeks so you see as i said earlier theres nothing ingenious about chinese torture there dont need to be they just rot you slowly to death and the lucky ones are brabazon and the little french padrй who were beheaded at pahlichao like nolan it is the uselessness of it that defeats me if they had wanted to wring information from us at least torture would be understandable but this had no purpose it was the wanton cruelty of men who enjoyed inflicting pain for its own sake knowing that if retribution followed it would not fall on them personally i mean the emperor and sang and prince i and the like for the emperor certainly knew de normanns torture began in the royal apartments indeed they knew this was harry parkes lean and pale but as stubbornly urbane as ever although his drawl shook a bit when he told me how loch when he was sure he was going to die had sung rule britannia to let the others hear and of trooper phipps whod kept everyones spirits up with jokes when he was dying in agony and anderson telling his sowars not to cry out for the honour of the regiment and old daffadar mahomed bux with no hands left damning his torturers for giving him pork to eat even so parkes and loch had more christian forgiveness towards their captors than i care for given my way id have collared sang and prince i and the whole foul gang and turned em over to the wives and daughters of our afghan troopers if id had to drag ern the whole way to peshawar to do it what riled everyone was that the chinks had been careful to surrender on terms before wed seen the bodies so there was no hope of the mandarins being punished as they deserved how to make em pay that was the question that ran through the army camped before pekin and elgin sent word to kung that thered be no talk of treatysigning or indeed any talk at all until hed decided how to avenge our people diplomatic claptrap thinks i well let the swine get away with it as usual i didnt know the big barbarian he took a day to think about it brooding alone under the trees in the temple garden wearing a face that kept us all at a distance except grant he and elgin talked for about an hour at least elgin did while grant listened and nodded and presently retired to his tent to put his bull fiddle through its paces something cruel thats his way of beating his wife says wolseley summats in the wind that he dont like whos going to inquire eh no one else volunteered so during a pause in the cacophony i loafed in and found him staring at the manuscript on his music stand with his pencil behind his ear i asked what was up finished says he not right cant help it whats finished and not right quartet piano violins and cello he grunted impatiently journeyman work just to have to perform it see whats amiss then oh absolutely says i itll come right i daresay if you keep whistling it to yourself but general sahib whats elgin going to do he turned those bright eyes and tufted brows on me for about three minutes and picked up his bull fiddle mans in torment says he difficult he began to saw away again so i gave up and went back to the mess to report failure we werent kept long in suspense the last bodies came in next day and after hed seen them elgin called an immediate meeting of all the leading men from both armies with baron gros the french envoy sharing the tabletop with him and parkes loch and myself sitting by he was wearing his frockcoat which was a portent since he was used to roll about in flannels and open neck with a cricket belt and a handkerchief round his head but he seemed easy enough pouring a lemonade for gros asking if montaubans cold were any better making his opening statement in a quiet measured way just from his style i was positive hed memorised it carefully beforehand it is necessary says he without preamble to mark in a manner that cannot soon be forgotten the punishment we are bound to award for the treachery and brutality which have characterised the chinese emperors policy and which have resulted in the cruel murder of so many officers and men of the emperors personal implication and that of his leading mandarins there can be no doubt so while the punishment must be apparent to the whole chinese empire i am most anxious that it should fall and be seen to fall only on the emperor and his chief nobles who were fully aware of and responsible for these atrocious crimes he paused looking round the table and i wondered for a moment if he was going to propose hanging the pack of em emperor and all the same thought may have been exercising gros he was wearing a worried frown but elgins next words should have put his mind at rest it is manifestly impossible to proceed directly against the persons of the culprits even if we wished to since they are beyond our reach considering the temper of the army which i confess expresses my own feeling that is perhaps as well it remains to punish them by other means them and them alone he glanced at gros who came in nineteen to the dozen to say that milor was bowling a perfect length it leaped to the eye the offenders must be made to account for their conduct unpardonable and no nonsense it remained only to determine a suitable method of expressing the just indignation of the powers and to precisely monsieur le baron says elgin and i have so determined after careful deliberation i can see only one way to mark to the chinese empire and to the whole world our abhorrence of these wanton and cruel acts of treachery and bloodshed i am therefore requesting the commanderinchief he nodded towards grant to take the requisite steps for the complete destruction of the summer palace my first thought was that i hadnt heard right my second what a perfectly nonsensical idea someone murders twenty people so you plough up his garden others seemed to share my thoughts gros and montauban were staring blank bewilderment parkes was looking thoughtfully at the sky hope grant was pursing his lips which in him was the equivalent of leaping up and beating his forehead lochs mouth was open gros was just drawing breath when elgin went on before you respond gentlemen permit me to observe that this is no hasty decision it is based on what seem to me to be compelling reasons the bulldog face was expressionless but he tapped a finger to emphasise each point bear in mind that we have no quarrel with the people of china who are in no way to blame they do not suffer by this penalty the emperor and nobles suffer by the loss of their most precious possession they suffer also in their pride because their punishment and their sole guilt are made plain for the world to see and the chinese people are made aware of their emperors shame nothing could show more clearly that he is not omnipotent as he pretends nothing could demonstrate so clearly our detestation of his perfidy and cruelty he sat with his hands flat on the table waiting for the storm of protest which he guessed was coming from gros and perhaps as much from pique at not being consulted beforehand as from genuine disapproval the normally amiable little frenchman weighed in like a good un milor i am astonished it grieves me extremely to have to disagree with your lordship before these gentlemen assembled but i cannot accept this this extraordinary proposal it it appears to me to have no relevance this it is unthinkable he took a deep breath i must beg your lordship to reconsider i have monsieur le baron says elgin quietly with great care i assure you but forgive me milor you appear to contradict yourself you say we must punish the emperor with which i and all agree but not the people of china yet you propose the destruction the desecration of a a national shrine of china the repository of its ancient civilisation its art its culture its genius its learning he was in full gallic spate by now all waving hands and eyebrows bouncing in his chair what is this but an insult of the most gross to the very soul of china if it were that i should not have proposed it says elgin the summer palace is not a shrine of any kind unless to imperial luxury and vanity it is the emperors private pleasure park and not one of the millions of ordinary chinese has ever been inside it or cares a straw for it and its treasures if they think of it at all it must be as a monument to human greed built on extortion and suffering china has bled to make that place and china will not weep for its loss believe me monsieur le baron the fact that he said this as though hed been reading the minutes of the last meeting did nothing to cool gross indignation he gasped for breath and found it and the treasures then are they nothing the irreplaceable works of art the sublime craftsmanship the priceless carvings and paintings and jewellery are they to be vandalised to signal our abhorrence of the crime of a few guilty noblemen are we to punish their barbarism by an act infinitely more barbaric by destroying a thing of infinite beauty of incalculable value it is it is out of all proportion milor out of proportion for the first time there was a touch of colour on elgins cheek but his voice was even quieter than before that is a matter of opinion a few moments ago you and i monsieur le baron looked on something which had been infinitely more beautiful and of incalculably greater value than anything ever created by a chinese architect the body of a soldier of the queen his name was ayub khan you saw what chinese civilisation had done to him milor that is not just gros was on his feet whitefaced you know very well i am as enraged as yourself at the atrocities committed upon our people but i ask you what can it profit your good soldier or any other of those martyred to take revenge in this fashion by destroying something with which they and their deaths had nothing to do please sir take your seat again says elgin rising and with it my assurance that i intended no reflection on your humanity or your concern for our dead comrades didnt you though thinks i he waited until gros had sat down again there is no way to profit or adequately to avenge them my purpose is to punish their murderers in a way that will best bring down their pride and publish their infamy that is why i shall burn the summer palace unless your excellency can suggest a suitable alternative poor gros stared at him helplessly and waved his hands if it seems good to destroy some building why then let it be the board of punishments where the crimes were committed what could be more fitting ive heard that suggestion says elgin dryly it emanated i believe from the russian mission at pekin to burn the board and erect a suitable memorial on the site to chinese perfidy i can think of nothing better calculated to inflame hatred of our two countries among ordinary chinese i hesitate of course to conclude that that is why the russians suggested it you would say monsieur le baron only only gros shrugged in real distress ah milor you think only of the effect on the emperor and the others but consider another effect on the honour of our countries and ourselves think how such an act will be regarded in the world it is not the emperor of china who will be disgraced by what all civilised peoples must see as a as a barbarism grassier incivilisй are we to bear the brand of attila and alaric merely to punish the emperors vanity and possibly encouraged by the approving cries of his own folk and the doubtful looks of some of ours the silly ass put his great frog foot right in it ah surely milor you of all men must be aware of what of what public opinion realising his gaffe he broke off shaking his head ah dieu the destruction of precious works of art is not well regarded he finished snappishly even the other frogs were trying to look elsewhere parkes beside me sighed and murmured something about gros by name and nature what well everyone knew how elgins guvnor had stripped half greece of statuary even then elgin marbles was a slogan of outrage among hellenic enthusiasts the only person present who didnt seem to mind was elgin himself for the first time in days he absolutely grinned i had no notion says he affably from the conduct of your troops at the ewenmingewen that such a sentiment prevailed in france milor montauban was wattling furiously but elgin didnt mind him if stigma there be he went on talking straight to gros i shall be content to bear it alone if i must it will be a small thing compared to the wound dealt to the pride and false glory of the creature who calls himself emperor of china and if it wounds him as you hope cries gros if you so disgrace him in the eyes of his subjects have you considered it may mean the downfall of the manchoo dynasty he was on his feet again all frosty dignity elgin rose with him all john bull if i thought that monsieur le baron says he i should be in the summer palace this minute with a torch and a bundle of straw alas i fear it will have no such consequence gros bowed stiffly milor elgin i must officially inform you that my government cannot associate itself with a policy which we must consider illadvised disproportionate and i have to say it deeply as i deplore the necessity uncivilised he looked elgin in the eye monsieur it is cruel yes sir says elgin quietly its meant to be when the french had stalked off elgin sat down and passed a hand across his forehead suddenly he looked very tired aye weel says he heavily a stoot hert tae a stae brae eh loch now grant which troops shall do the work they settled on michels division the destruction to begin two days hence loch was instructed to write the letter of information to prince kung and the proclamation for general distribution i was interested that neither referred to the deaths of our people but only to the emperors treachery and bad faith that officially was why the summer palace was to be destroyed to show that no individual however exalted could escape the responsibility and punishment which must always follow acts of falsehood and deceit here endeth the lesson says parkes to me he means to rub it into the emperor rather the emperor dont know a dam thing about it says i the fellows an idiot probably a dead idiot by now you dont really care for this do you says he eyeing me me i shook my head taint my house and flowerbeds he laughed i dont like it much myself my suggestion was for a thumping fine and the surrender to our justice of the actual murderers the jailers and tormentors who did the work and in particular one gross brute who took the keenest satisfaction in pulling my hair out by the roots he pointed out correctly that a fine would inevitably fall on the populace and that the jailers were merely doing what they were bidden by fiends like sang also that they probably wouldnt be handed over theyd send us a batch of condemned convicts and who would know the difference he looked to where elgin was sitting hands in pockets talking to grant in fact hes dead right this will accomplish what he wants to do teach the emperor a lesson you mean says i not greatly interested oh no hes teaching china the word will go to the ends of the empire how the barbarians came and smashed the chalice and went away and for the first time all china will realise that theyre not the worlds core that their emperor is not god and that the dream theyve lived in for thousands of years is just a dream gros was right itll bring down the manchoos no error not today perhaps not for years but at last the mystery that binds china will go up in smoke with the summer palace you see and just by the way china will break no more treaties not in our time i thought about yehonala and wondered if he was right as it turned out he was almost china was quiet for forty years until she roused the boxers against us and now the manchoos are gone and wholl deny that it was the fire that elgin kindled that made chinas millions think thoughts theyd never thought before he called me over presently and asked not ordered mark you but asked which wasnt his usual style if id mind going with michel as guide so that no buildings were missed you know the summer palace better i daresay than any european living says he had that occurred to you it hadnt as it happened but the dutys not distasteful to you flashman i said i didnt mind grant had gone off and we were alone by the table in the temple garden he gave me a keen look and then fell to examining the peeled skin on the back of his hand smiling a little i seem to sense some disapproval in my staff says he but since i dislike embarrassment almost as much as i dislike contradiction i have borne it in silence a chief of intelligence however has an obligation to be forthright do you agree with gros once on a day id have cried no my lord youre entirely right my lord burn the bugger hull and sticks my lord like a good little toady but its better fun to tell the truth when it cant hurt and is bound to cause devilment so i said no my lord im sure your decision is correct i waited until he was looking at me to see that i meant it and then added but in your position id not burn the summer palace he stared at me frowning i dont understand flashman you think it right but you wouldnt do it what can you mean i mean i wouldnt dare my lord i do love to stir em up oh ill fry in hell for it you see gros is right in one thing itll get a dam bad press and id not care to have punch labelling me harry the hun his jaw jerked at that and for a moment i thought he was going to explode then he gave a jarring laugh by god says he youre an uncomfortable man well youre honest at least which is more than can be said for the french who have already looted the place but take care to escape the odium for its destruction ha and while crying philistine they and the other powers will be happy enough to enjoy the trade benefits and safe commerce which our salutary action will have ensured he folded his arms leaning back and gave me a bleak look harry the hun indeed theyll have no need to coin a nickname for me the chinese have done it for them have they not the big barbarian he was thinking he knew what to expect but it had rattled him to have me state it so bluntly which is why id done it of course yet he wasnt altogether displeased i wondered if he wasnt glad in a way to be bearing the blame alone he was odd fish was elgin he was no vandal certainly indeed bar wolseley he was probably the most sincere lover of the arts in the army not that im an authority you understand give me rubens and you can keep the rest so how could he bring himself to destroy so much that was rare and beautiful and valuable ill tell you he was avenging our dead with coldblooded fury striking at their murderers in the way he knew would hurt them most for he was right there he knew the chinese mind he was hitting em where they lived and putting the fear of god into china too but i suspect he had another reason which he may not have admitted to himself i believe that the summer palace offended elgin that the thought of so much luxury and extravagance for the pleasure of a privileged selfish few while the coolie millions paid for it and lived in squalor was too much for his scotch stomach odd notions for a belted earl you think well perhaps im wrong tragedy usually has a fair element of farce about it and this was seen next day when the mass funeral of our dead took place at the russian cemetery outside pekin as elgin observed the french had a wonderful time making speeches in bad taste and following their usual practice of firing the final volleys into the grave and not over it chinese observers were heard to remark that this was to make sure the corpses were dead there were protestant roman and greek priests officiating together which looked odd enough but the sight i wouldnt have missed was hope grant taking part in papist rituals sprinkling holy water at montaubans request and plainly enjoying it as much as john knox in a music hall we began to burn the summer palace the day after michels division marched up to the ewenmingewen gate where they were split into parties furnished with crowbars sledges axes and combustibles and despatched under their officers to chosen spots in the four great gardens the enclosed and beautiful the golden and brilliant the birthday and the fragrant hills i rode round to the birthday garden entrance because i had no great desire to view the whole splendid panorama again from the ewen slope before the fires were lighted it was a glorious day there wasnt a soul to be seen and the park seemed to glow in the sunlight the great beds of flowers and avenues of shrubs had never been so brilliant or the lawns so green a little breeze was ruffling the waters of the lake and stirring the leaves in the woods her pavilion gleamed white among its trees the birds were singing and the deer posing in the sunshine and there was such a perfume on the warm air as you might breathe in paradise from a long way off i caught the first drift of woodsmoke then there were distant voices and the soft tramp of feet and someone calling the step sounding closer and the stamp as they halted and the clatter of crowbars and hammers being grounded and a voice sings out which un fust sir and over there sarnt and right you are lads this way and the first smash of timber im a bad man ive done most wickedness and id do it again for the pleasure it gave me ive hurt and done spite and amused myself most viciously often at the expense of others and i dont feel regret enough to keep me awake of nights i guess if drink and the devil were in me i could ruin a summer palace in my own way rampaging and whooping and hollering and breaking windows and heaving vases downstairs for the joy of hearing em smash and stuffing my pockets with whatever i could lay hands on like the fellows wolseley and i watched at the ewen id certainly have to be drunk but yes i know my nature id do it and revel in the doing until i got fed up or my eye lit on a woman but i couldnt do it as it was done that day methodically carefully almost by numbers with a gang to each house all ticked on the list and smash goes the door under the axes and in tramp the carriers to remove the best pieces and the hammermen to smash the rest with sledges and the sappers to knock out a few beams and windows for draught and set the oily rags and straw just so and give us one o your fusees corporal right fall in outside and then on to the next house while behind the flames lick up blistering the enamels cracking the porcelain charring the polished wood blackening the bright paint smouldering the silks and rugs crackling under the eaves next to the wreck of a human body nothing looks so foul as a pretty house in its setting when the smoke eddies from the roof and the glare shines in the windows and the air shakes with the heat that was how it was done by word of command one place after another tramptramptramp smashsmashsmash burnburnburn by men who didnt talk much or swear or laugh that was the uncanny thing british soldiers can make a jest of anything including their own deaths but no one joked in the summer palace they went about it sourtempered grudging id say they were heartsick or just plain dull and morose i remember one north country voice saying it seemed a reet shame to spoil that many pretty things but the only other note of protest came in a great setto when some woods caught fire and a redfaced fellow comes roaring what the hell are you about sir your orders are to burn buildings thats good timber fine trees damnation take you are you a madman or what and the reply no sir im not but in case its escaped your notice bloody trees are made of bloody wood you know which commonly burns when exposed to bloody fire and dyou expect me to race about catching all the bloody sparks now the curious thing about this was that one of the speakers was majorgeneral sir john michel and the other a private soldier gentlemanranker and they cussed each other blind with no thought of discipline and no reprisals either it was a strange day that later i remember the rending sound of roofs caving in and the great rush of flames the red glare of fire on bare chests and sweatgrimed faces the harsh crackling and the foul stench as choking smoke drifted across the lawns blotting out the lakes and flowers the weary shouts and hoarse commands as the gangs moved on to the next little white jewel among the trees ive said i couldnt have done it which is to say i wouldnt for choice but could if i had to just as ive packed dahomey slaves when needful the summer palace was just about as sickly as that but i watched for curiosity and because there was nothing else to do michels men seemed to find the houses without my assistance and it was curiosity that took me up the ewen slope towards evening to look back on the great pall of smoke many miles in extent covering the country to the distant hills with ugly patches of flame behind it and here and there a break where you could see a blazing building or a smouldering ruin or a patch of burning forest or virgin parkland or a pool of dull grey water that had been a shining lake or even a white palace untouched amid the green it looked pretty much like hell im not saying elgin was wrong it achieved what he wanted without his having to break down a door or smash a window or set a match thats the great thing about policy and why the world is such an infernal place the man who makes the policy dont have to carry it out and the man who carries it out aint responsible for the policy which is how our folk were tortured to death and the summer palace was burned mind you if that wasnt the case precious little would ever get done but didnt a tear mist my eye or a lump rise in my throat didnt i turn away at last with a manly sob well no yes as the chap remarked it was a shame so many pretty things were spoiled but im no great admirer of objets dart myself they just bring out the worst in connoisseurs and female students but even you flashman surely to god must have been moved at the destruction of so much beauty in a spot where you had spent so many idyllic hours well again no you see i dont live there im here in berkeley square and when i want to visit the summer palace i can close my eyes and there it is and so is she it burned for almost a week with a vast pillar of smoke a mile high in the windless air like some great brooding genie from a bottle spreading his pall across the countryside pekin was a city in twilight its people awestricken to silence to them it was incredible yet there it was and they saw it and believed at last if we hadnt burned it but had merely occupied pekin for a season and gone away again i dont doubt that in no time the manchoo propagandists would have convinced the population that wed never been there at all but with the summer palace in flames they couldnt doubt the truth the barbarians had won the son of heaven had been humbled to the dust and there was the funeral pyre to prove it as some callous scoundrel remarked and it may have been me by the sound of it at least the times couldnt complain that elgin hadnt avenged their correspondent properly poor young bowlby having been one of the emperors victims you see that smoke spread metaphorically all over the world and some called elgin a visigoth and others said hed done the right thing but one of the warmest debates was over exactly what he had done most folk still believe that one great palace building was burned in fact there were more than two hundred destroyed to my knowledge with most of their contents and great areas of woodland and garden some like loch have softened it as best they can by claiming that many buildings and much treasure escaped that some palaces were only halfburned that few manuscripts were lost and that the damage was less than it looked the plain truth is that the great summer palace eight miles by ten was a charred ruin and if lloyds had been faced with the bill theyd have shut up shop and fled the country the lesson was driven home with the usual horse guards pomp when the convention was signed a few days later kung having had to agree to everything we demanded including ј for the families of our dead elgin looking like pickwick strayed into an aladdin pantomime was toted through the streets of pekin in an enormous palanquin by liveried chinese with our troops lining the route for three miles to the hall of ceremonies the band playing the national anthem an escort of infantry and cavalry hundreds strong and the senior men mounted in full fig wearing that curious ceremonial expression of solemn intensity as though they were trying not to fart i cant be doing with hyde park soldiering it looks so dam ridiculous when anyone can see with half an eye that it costs more time and trouble and expense than fighting a war and the jacksinoffice and hangerson who take part plainly think its a whole heap more important id abolish the tin bellies and trooping the colour if i had my way but thats by the by the public love it and theres no question it awed the chinese they gazed at elgin in stricken silence and knocked head as he went by the treaty was signed with tremendous ceremony before a great concourse of mandarins in dragon robes and ourselves in dress uniforms elgin looking damned disinheriting and poor little prince kung plainly scared out of his wits by beatos camera which he seemed to think was some kind of gun it was infernally dull and went on for hours both sides loathing each other with icy politeness and the only possibility of fun was when parkes that imperturbable diplomat spotted the chap whod pulled his hair standing among the chinese dignitaries and i believe would have gone for him then and there if loch the spoilsport hadnt restrained him and then quite suddenly it was all over elgin had his piece of paper with red seals and yellow ribbon china and britain were sworn to eternal friendship our traders were free to deluge the market with pulse grain sulphur saltpetre cash opium brimstone and even spelter there were a few hundred new graves along the peiho the summer palace was a smoking ruin in jehol a dainty silver fingernail was poised to pin the chinese empire and i was going downriver on coromandel with elgins kindly note of appreciation in my pocket a black jade chess set in my valise and a few memories in mind so often its like that when the most vivid chapters end the storm of war and action hurtles you along in blood and thunder seeking vainly for a hold to cling to and then the wind drops and in a moment youre at peace and dogtired with your back to a gunwheel at gwalior or closing your eyes in a corner seat of the deadwood stage or drinking tea contentedly with an old kirghiz bandit in a serai on the golden road or sitting alone with the president of the united states at the end of a great war listening to him softly whistling dixie so it was now for thats my china story done save for one curious little postscript and i could loaf at the rail looking forward to a tranquil voyage home to elspeth and a gentlemans life far away from mist and mud and ricepaddy and drydung smells and tiger soldiers and silk banners and nightmare bannermen and belching ornamental cannon and crazy taipings and even crazier yankees and firecrackers and yellow faces no i wouldnt even miss the gigantic bandit women and jolly hong kong boaters and beauteous dragon queens not too much anyway possibly those three were in my mind though a few weeks later as i sat in dutranquoys bar in singapore where the mail had dropped me idly wondering how id kill the fortnight before the p o cape ship sailed for home for i was shot if i was going by that infernal suez route at any rate something awoke a memory of the voluptuous madam sabba with whom id wrestled so enjoyably on my last visit there until shed spoiled sport by whistling up the hatchetmen heavens that had been more than fifteen years ago still i doubted if singapore had gone baptist in the meantime so i took a palki across the river and up through chinatown to the pleasant residential area which i remembered where the big houses stood back in their gardens with paper lanterns glimmering on the dark drives and burly sikh porters bowing at the front door very genteel resorts they were no trollops on view or anything of that sort you had a capital dinner and caught the waiters eye and he drummed up the flashtail discreetly i demanded to be taken to the best place and it looked al with a big dimlylit club diningroom where silent bearers waited on the tables and two smart hostesses went the rounds to see that all was in order one of them was a stately ivory who might have been sabbas daughter i considered her carefully as i ate my duck curry with a bottle of bubbly but then i noticed the other one at the far end of the room and changed my mind she was white and fair and excellently set up and i felt an almighty urge to try some civilised goods for a change i heard her soft laughter as she paused by a table where halfadozen planters were eating then she passed on to a solitary diner a blondbearded young stalwart in good linen with a clippercaptain look to him and i wondered if he was on the same lay as myself for she stood in talk for quite five minutes while i consumed a jealous soufflй but then she turned away and swayed to my corner smiling graciously and asking if everything was to my satisfaction it will be directly says i rising gallantly if youll condescend to join me in a bottle of fizz i was setting a chair when i heard her gasp she was staring as though i were marleys ghost hold on thinks i my new whiskers are grown enough to be presentable surely and then i almost dropped the chair for it was phoebe carpenter pillar of the church and wholesaler of firearms to the taiping rebels colonel flashman cries she oh dear mrs carpenter cries i good god she swayed eyes closed and sat down abruptly gulping and staring at me wideeyed as i resumed my seat oh what a start you gave me thats what i said up the pearl river says i well well i never here take a glass and do tell me how the reverend josiah is keeping missionary society doing well is it oh dear she whispers trembling violently which improved an already delightful appearance i hadnt known her because the phoebe i remembered had borne her beauty in matronly modesty innocent of rouge and fairly swathed in muslin this was a most artistic translation redlipped and polished with her gold ringlets piled behind her head and her udders threatening to leap with agitation from a lowcut gown of black satin which i doubted had come from the last sale of work she drank her teeth chattering what must you think says she speaking low and taking a quick slant to see that no one was listening well says i cheerily i think youre wanted in hong kong for gunrunning which should get you about five years if anyone were inconsiderate enough to mention it to the singapore traps i also think that would be a crying shame you wouldnt betray me she whimpers faintly you betrayed me dear phoebe says i gently and laid my hand on hers but of course i wouldnt you might says she starting to weep nonsense child why ever on earth should i for for rerevenge she stared piteously like a blueeyed fawn her bosom heaving i we deceived you most shamefully oh dear what am ito do have some bubbly says i soothingly and rest assured i have no thoughts of revenge compensation perhaps compcompensation she blinked miserably but i have no substance i couldnt afford my dear mrs carpenter says i squeezing her hand you have absolutely capital substance and you know perfectly well i dont mean money now im sure josiah has told you all about susannah and the elders well im not feeling exactly elderly but oh susannah i beamed at her and she blinked again dabbed her nose and looked at me thoughtfully still heaving a bit but settling down and accepting another ration of fizz im by no means sure that they would send me to prison says she unexpectedly pouting after all it was a very good cause it was a dam bad cause says i and if you think they wont shove you in clink just ask dear josiah i cant he has abandoned me you dont mean it i was astonished he must be mad you mean he just up and left you here can you suppose i would accept employment in a restaurant if i were still a clergymans wife well i am still his wife she admitted taking another sip but he has deserted me and gone to sumatra has he though missionary work or piracy well thats bad luck to be sure but youll soon get another chap you know with your looks i reassured her well take tonight for example why before i even recognised you i was most entirely fetched oh say you will not inform on me she leaned forward all entreaty you see i have a most fortunate situation here and am in hope to save sufficient to go back to to england to middle wallop and my dear parents at the rectory i knew it must be a rectory middle wallop eh when i think of it says she biting her lip compared to she gestured at the room pathetically compared to beating copra in the womens compound with all those smelly chinese sluts absolutely well now phoebe tempus is fugiting when does your shop shut and where shall we ah we close in an hour i live in the house says she looking at the table and shot me a reproachful pout my she was a little stunner you do very wrong to compel me if you were a gentleman id shop you like a worthy citizen if you were a lady you wouldnt hocus fellows into running guns so were well suited and i aint compelling you one bit youre all for it i gave her a wink and a squeeze now then where can i spend the next hour got a billiard table have you capital just pass me the word when youve got the dishes washed oh and see we have a couple of bottles iced upstairs will you come on goose well have the jolliest time you know she gave her head a little toss going pink and glanced at me slantendicular and you promise faithfully not to tell anything oh if only i could be sure well you cant oh come why should i peach on a little darling like you eh as we stood up close together i squeezed the satin unseen and her mouth opened on a little gasp see two hours from now you wont care i ambled down to the empty billiard room in prime fettle calling kyahai and ordering up another bottle of bubbly i tickled the pills until it arrived and then wandered glass in hand to the verandah to look out into the tropic dark it had started to rain with great force as it does in singapore straight down in stairrods battering the leaves and gurgling in the monsoon ditch bringing that heavy earthy smell that is the east i stood reflecting in great content homeward bound champagne good burma cheroot and lissom little phoebe under starters orders what more could a happy warrior ask after the second glass i tried a few combination shots but my eye wasnt in any longer and after a while i left off yawning and wishing impatiently that phoebe would hurry the mateys along beginning to feel sleepy as well as monstrous randy the door opened abruptly and a chap stuck his head in rain glistening on his hat and cape he gave me a cheery nod evenin sport seen joss about have you joss the guvnor you know carpenter or maybe you dont know neer mind i daresay hes upstairs he was withdrawing hold on dyou mean the rev josiah carpenter the one and only says he grinning our esteemed proprietor i gaped at him proprietor you mean he owns this place hes not in sumatra well he wasnt this afternoon i say are you all right but mrs carpenter distinctly told me oh shes about is she good ill see her chinchin the door slammed leaving me standing bewildered and angry what was the little bitch playing at shed said hold on she had said i turned sharply at a step on the verandah lurching heavily against the table and catching hold to steady myself the big blondbearded chap whod been in the restaurant was standing in the open screen he was wearing a pilotcap now and there seemed to be another fellow in a souwester just behind him in the shadows why was i so dizzy all of a sudden hollo says the blond chap and his glance went to the bottle and glass on the sidetable he grinned at me enjoying your drink appendix i the taiping rebellion the taiping rebellion was the worst civil war in history and the second bloodiest war of any kind being exceeded in casualties only by the second world war with its estimated million dead how many died during the fourteen years of the taiping rising can only be guessed the lowest estimate is million but million is considered more probable when it is remembered that the taiping struggle was fought largely with small arms and only primitive artillery some idea may be gained of the scale of the land fighting with its attendant horrors of massacre and starvation again the word battle nowadays is frequently applied to struggles lasting over months using the more traditional sense of the term which covers only days it can be said that the bloodiest battle ever fought on earth was the third battle of nanking in when in three days the dead exceeded a hundred thousand so far as his account goes up to the summer of flashman gives an accurate if necessarily condensed version of the taiping movement and its astonishing leader the cantonese clerk hung hsiuchuan who fell into a trance after failing his civil service examinations saw visions of heaven and became inspired to overthrow the manchus cast the idols out of china and establish the taiping tienkwo the heavenly dynasty of perfect peace based on his own notions of christianity he is said to have been much influenced by a missionary tract good words to admonish the age that hung was a leader of extraordinary magnetism is not to be doubted and he was materially assisted by the corruption and decadence of manchu government china was ripe for revolution at first his small movement concentrated on attacking idolatry but with the persecution of the sect for heresy magic and conspiracy his crusade developed into guerrilla warfare and the first rising in kwangsi in spread into other provinces with able generals such as loyal prince lee the taiping armies fought with increasing success their organisation and discipline far outmatched the imperials and after the capture of nanking in they threatened pekin and controlled more than a third of china establishing capitals in provinces which they had devastated flashman saw them when they were at their peak and might still have accomplished their revolution but the seeds of defeat were already apparent for all their zeal and military discipline the taipings were poor social organisers and administrators their rule was oppressive and haphazard and they failed to attract either foreign support or the chinese middle and upper classes they also suffered from internal feuds and the degeneration of the once inspirational hung who after went into almost complete seclusion with his women and mystical meditations strategically the taipings made the mistake of never securing a major port through which they might have made contact with the outside world and failing to concentrate their thrust at pekin the seat of imperial power after the events of their decline was rapid tseng kuofan organised the imperial reconquest aided by the evervictorious army under ward and gordon and after hungs suicide by poison in june nanking fell and the greatest rebellion ever seen in the world was over six hundred towns had been destroyed whole provinces devastated billions of pounds worth of property lost and countless millions were dead including all the rebel leaders loyal prince lee and hung jenkan were both executed in other notable wangs were the east king yang hsiuching a charcoal burner who became a shrewd and ruthless general also known as gods holy ghost he was murdered in by the north king wei chianghui pawnbroker who in turn was executed with twenty thousand followers by the heavenly king in the west king and the south king were both killed in action in apart from these early wangs the principal leaders included the young and formidable general chen yucheng who with lee raised the siege of nanking and died in the redoubtable shih takai also known as the assistant king executed in hung jenta elder brother of the heavenly king executed the ying wang executed and most pathetic of all tien kuei the junior lord son of the heavenly king executed by the imperialists in he was fifteen among eyewitnesses of the taipings none is more interesting than augustus lindley an intensely partisan young englishman who defended them as moderates contended that the heavenly king had been elected not merely selfdeclared denied that his claim of relationship to christ was meant to be taken literally and defined as antitaiping all britons of the elgin school the opium interests missionaries roman catholics and merchants generally he paints an attractive picture of loyal prince lee whom he met and is a mine of detail about taipingdom he is at variance however with other contemporary writers the most extreme of whom describe the taipings as enslavers destroyers of trade living on loot etc at this distance they look as flashman says like a worthy movement gone wrong in fairness it has to be said that they included some sincere reformers even among local commanders and in some areas at least brought lower taxation and tried to encourage trade and agriculture as to the havoc they wrought the one point on which most authorities seem to agree is that the imperialist forces were worse jen yuwen described the carnage when the taipings took nanking as the first and last taiping massacre considering the scale of bloodshed in the war it is difficult to accept this there is a considerable modern literature on the subject and chinese scholars have devoted close study to the writings and philosophy of the movement see lindley tiping tienkwoh lewis b browning a visit to the taipings in in h b morse an eminently fair authority is blunt the taiping government is not known to have organised any form of civil administration even in nanking levying of taxes was simplicity

established herself as the imperial favourite when she bore the emperors only son in her hold over the ailing weakly monarch and on political power became greatly strengthened with fateful results for china for the young concubine although well educated by manchu standards was ignorant of the world outside she was also an extreme reactionary inflexibly autocratic and highly aggressive in diplomacy she appears to have been a prime mover in chinas resistance policy during the arrow war and elgin expedition forbidding trade putting prices on british heads sending suicide orders to unlucky commanders inspiring the death warrants and urging opposition to the barbarians at all costs at the same time with the emperors health failing she was entering on a political struggle to ensure her sons succession and her own survival flashmans account of her scheming in september is uncorroborated but there is no doubt that she was already deep in palace plotting and in the year that followed her courage ruthlessness and genius for intrigue were tested by events which resemble sensational fiction rather than sober fact for the emperor did not die quickly as expected he lingered for a year at jehol and in that time yehonala suffered an almost fatal setback reports of her affair with jung lu who was said to be her lover reached the emperor and she was forbidden the royal presence worse still when a council of regency was appointed by the emperors decree on the day before his death in august its leaders were her bitterest enemies prince i sushun and prince cheng yehonala herself was excluded that should have been the end of her but her enemies had overlooked one small but vital point the edict of regency signed by the emperor had not been sealed with the dynastic seal yehonala had purloined it and at a time when it was essential for the reins of power to be seized in pekin prince i and the other regents were bound by court protocol to remain with the royal corpse at jehol and then accompany it in slow ceremonial procession to the capital not so yehonala and the empress sakota whose duty it was to go ahead to pekin and meet the coffin on its arrival prince i and sushun well aware of yehonalas popularity with the troops and fearing what might happen if she reached pekin first arranged to have her and sakota ambushed and murdered on the journey but the faithful jung lu learned of the plot and set off from jehol by night overtook the royal ladies on the road escaped the ambush and brought them safely to the capital where yehonala lost no time in raising support sakota as usual was content to stay in the background thus when prince i and the regents finally arrived with the cortege they were welcomed by an urbane yi concubine who thanked them graciously dismissed them from the regency and had them arrested in the name of the new emperor the regents charged with responsibility for the recent war and with treacherously capturing loch and parkes were sentenced to be tortured to death but this was commuted to suicide by the silk cord for princes i and cheng and beheading for sushun jung lu was rewarded with the viceroyalty of a province and control of the army yehonala and sakota assumed the titles of empress of the western and eastern palace respectively and from that moment the former concubine never relaxed her grip on imperial power when her son the new emperor died in she engineered the succession for her infant nephew but when he reached manhood and showed reformist tendencies she had him interned and wielded supreme authority until her death yehonala tzuhsi was the worlds last great absolute queen and may be compared to catherine the great and the first elizabeth for the ills her country suffered through her resistance policy and refusal to accept change she may fairly be blamed against that she kept the world at bay from china until the end of the century when economic decline war with japan and the boxer rising completed the undermining of imperial rule soon after her death china was a republic whether it would have profited from earlier revolution earlier reform and earlier acceptance of the outside world no one can say in its details flashmans portrait of yehonala is a faithful one her beauty and charm were legendary as were her less admirable qualities and his account of her lifestyle is confirmed elsewhere even to such trivia as her favourite food clothes jewellery and boardgames how just he is in his sweeping assessment of her character is a matter for conjecture as her biographer sergeant observes contemporary writers depending on their viewpoint show her almost as two different women one a monster of iniquity the other a lovable genius there is ample evidence that she was vain greedy cruel and autocratic but less that she was as callous ruthless and promiscuous as flashman suggests opinions differ sharply about her private morals she was for years concubine to a depraved monarch and rumours of her immorality were persistent apart from jung lu her lovers were said to include a later chief eunuch li lien ying her confirmed favourite who may not have been a eunuch at all the american artist katherine carl described him as tall thin and savonarolalike with elegant manners and a pleasant voice there is virtually no personal evidence for her early life most of the memoirs refer to her later years when the picture is of a sprightly domineering old lady of unshakeable will immense vanity high intelligence and winning charm when she chose to exert it obviously a once great beauty and

empress of china j and m porteous an explanatory account of the chinese ladies pamphlet dublin for the political intrigues of see morse international relations appendix iii the doctor of letters of the hanlin academy one of the most touching and illuminating documents of the china war is a diary covering the last few weeks before elgins army reached pekin it was kept by a doctor of letters and member of the hanlin academy living in the capital and is an invaluable record of the crisis as seen by an educated middleclass chinese he calls it a record of grief incurable the time of national catastrophe was also for him one of personal tragedy because while the barbarians were closing on pekin the doctors aged mother was dying and the diary is a moving record of his personal anxieties set against the background of great events the diary has another value it shows the power which the yi concubine yehonala exerted on the dying emperor and his court and the extent to which she was responsible for the bitter resistance to the allies demands in the moon of the ken shen year writes the doctor rumours began to circulate that the barbarians had already reached taku there was alarm and uneasiness in pekin but no flight as yet his majesty was seriously ill and it was known that he wished to leave for the north but the imperial concubine yi dissuaded him and assured him that the barbarians would never enter the city after news of the defeat at taku however people began to leave and as the news became progressively worse the exodus became one of thousands the doctor now turns to his own immediate troubles his mothers medicine the preparation of her coffin its appearance and its cost which he reflects would have been much greater if he had not had the foresight to buy the wood years earlier and keep it in store this comforted me not a little his next entry is divided between national affairs and the progress being made on the coffin there are rumours that pekin would be bombarded on the th so that everyone was escaping who could on the th we put on the second coating of lacquer on that day our troops captured the barbarian leader pahsiali with eight others and they were imprisoned in the board of punishments he notes that the emperor was preparing to leave but the imperial concubine yi persuaded some of the high officials to memorialise him to remain all officials were now sending their families and valuables out of the city his mothers death was clearly approaching so the ceremonial robes were prepared his mother thought the coverlet was too heavy so one of silk was substituted but she thought that too luxurious her parentsinlaw she pointed out had not had gravewrappings of such valuable stuff meanwhile in the battle at chi hua gate the mongol cavalry broke and many were trampled to death in the general rout and now the princes and ministers besought the concubine yi to induce his majesty to leave his majesty was only too anxious to start at once persuaded the two grand secretaries to memorialise against his doing so and a decree was issued stating that in no circumstances would the emperor leave the capital another battle was reported the next day and the emperor attended by his concubines the princes ministers and dukes and all the officers of the household left the city in desperate rout and disorder unspeakable in fact the doctor notes the barbarians were still some way off and the court was at the summer palace so there was nothing to fear up to the last the yi concubine begged him to remain as his presence could not fail to awe the barbarians and thus to exert a protecting influence for the good of the city and people how she said could the barbarians be expected to spare the city if the sacred chariot had fled leaving unprotected the tutelary shrines and the altars of the gods shortly after this the doctors mother died abandoning her most undutiful son her death lies at my door because of my ignorance of medicine he was worried about having her buried in case the barbarians should desecrate her grave but finally had her buried in a temple a few days later he notes briefly vast columns of smoke seen rising to the northwest when the yi concubine heard of the surrender she implored the emperor to reopen hostilities but his majesty was dangerously ill so our revenge must be postponed for the time being he was not a doctor of letters for nothing for in short space he conjures up a most moving and vivid picture of life and death going on in a small house in pekin while the captains and the kings make history of his concern for the indomitable old lady reproving his extravagance while the imperial army crumbles of his touching selfreproach at her death and his admiration for the fiery yi concubine vainly urging resistance for the honour of china of his fears for his mothers grave while the summer palace is burning and perhaps the strongest impression he leaves is that if the men of pekin had matched the spirit of the women lord elgin would have bought his treaty dear notes flashman is usually vague about dates but from internal evidence it is clear that the ten days were march it is not known why he was on transit through hong kong at this time approximately eighteen months earlier in the autumn of he was definitely in india preparing to return to england at the end of his service in the indian mutiny which earned him a vc and knighthood but the present narrative makes it plain that this return did not take place and that during he was engaged in further foreign service what this was a later packet of the papers may explain but there is some reason to suppose that it was connected with china since up to the end of he had never visited that country yet at the beginning of the present memoir he writes of it with apparent familiarity and displays some fluency in chinese a language not mentioned in his earlier reminiscences there is a possible alternative for farfetched though it may seem one reference in his earlier writings suggests an acquaintance with john brown the american abolitionist whose celebrated raid on harpers ferry took place in october and since flashman had been at one time an agent of the underground railroad it is not impossible that the missing eighteen months were partly spent in the united states although in what capacity it would be rash to speculate p a reasonable summary of anglochinese relations up to including the arrow war of for details of the palmerstoncobden debate see division iv of j ewing ritchies life and times of viscount palmerston p flashman of course had no scruples about the opium trade but the mere fact that he mentioned morality to mrs carpenter is some reflection of the opposition that was growing against the opium interests china had legalised the traffic for the first time under the treaty of tientsin the opium lobby brazenly claimed that this was voluntary sir thomas wade a leading china expert said the concession had been extorted and lord elgin postponed the relevant clause rather than force chinas hand in fact the chinese recognised that there was nothing they could do about it the present generation of smokers must and will have opium their commissioner told elgin a fact recognised by such experienced observers as the missionary alexander williamson who called for abolition by britain but admitted that it would make little difference to the chinese who would get their drug anyway this argument was fastened on by the opium lobby whose line is echoed by mrs carpenter what is surprising is that even old china hands like john scarth could assert that the drug was smoked as a sedative rather than as a narcotic an excellent summary of the subject is j spencer hills maitland prizewinning essay of the indochinese opium trade hill came to the subject strongly prejudiced against the antiopium lobby but his investigations changed his mind alexander williamson travels in north china h b morse the trade and administration of the chinese empire p unless there were two jack fishers midshipmen on the china station in flashmans young acquaintance can only have been john arbuthnot fisher later admiral of the fleet baron fisher of kilverstone godfather of the dreadnought battleship and the foremost name in the royal navy since nelson just as wolseley may be called the architect of the modern british army so fisher with his biggun turbine ships gave the royal navy command of the seas in the first half of the present century he entered the navy when he was thirteen and served during the crimea before going to the china station in where he took part in the capture of canton and the attack on taku forts he was in chinese waters in the spring of and still a midshipman although actinglieutenant a rank not confirmed until the end of the year since flashman certainly knew fisher in later life it is surprising that he does not identify him at their first meeting on the other hand his brief description sounds very like the young bulldog jackie p chinese secret societies tongs and triads had various recognition signals three fingers round a cup was that of the white lilies p garnet joseph wolseley the model of a modern majorgeneral was one of britains most important soldiers he won no distinction as a commander in a great war but his record in the socalled little wars indeed the variety and success of his service generally is probably unique in the history of arms an angloirishman he followed his own maxim that if a young officer wants to do well he should try to get himself killed wolseley tried really hard first in the burma war when he was badly wounded leading the attack on an enemy stockade in the crimea where he was twice wounded losing an eye in the indian mutiny where he served in the relief and siege of lucknow being five times mentioned in despatches in the china war of in canada where in his first independent command he put down the red river rebellion without a casualty in africa where he won a lightning campaign against king koffee of ashanti and captured cetewayo the zulu leader in egypt where he beat arabi pasha at telelkebir and took cairo in the sudan where he reached khartoum just too late to rescue gordon his old friend of the crimea and china he was made a viscount and later field marshal but wolseleys real importance was as a military reformer and creator of the modern british army having seen and suffered under a traditional regime which while largely successful had hardly changed in centuries and being a confirmed champion of the private soldier he foresaw the need for change in a rapidly changing military world he had seen the first modern war in the struggle between the american states and his reforms and reorganisations bitterly opposed at the time prepared the british army for a new era of warfare his influence largely forgotten is on the army still he was a man of many talents a trained draughtsman and surveyor he sketched and painted well and wrote several books including most notably the soldiers pocket book a life of marlborough a novel and his reminiscences of the china campaign flashman shows him briefly as a young staffofficer before the full flowering of the quick temper and impatient efficiency which were to make the expression all sir garnet synonymous with the modern right on wolseley always wanted the best typically he chose for one campaign a man who had beaten him in competition disraeli passed an illuminating judgment on him wolseley is an egotist and a braggart so was nelson and story of a soldiers life sir john fortescue history of the british army vol xiii dictionary of national biography p since flashman probably knew more eminent fighting men including the great names of the crimea mutiny us civil war and afghan and american frontiers to say nothing of his various native foemen than any other observer of his day his opinion of james hope grant has to be taken seriously the record seems to bear him out grants active service in india and china is chiefly remarkable for the amount of time he spent in handtohand combat to which he brought an iron constitution and an apparently total disregard for his own safety to die is nothing he once explained its only going from one room to another it was in outpost work and the leadership of flying cavalry columns that his talent lay although his one major command was conducted with efficiency despite his being to some extent at the mercy of his diplomats flashmans character sketch and physical description are sound he makes the important point that the terrible fighter and stern disciplinarian was an unusually gentle and kindly man whose consuming interest was music grant was a gifted cellist and composer and indeed owed an early advancement to the fact that his commanding general was a keen violinist who wanted a cello player as brigademajor despite his sketchy education grant was something of a military innovator he is credited with introducing regular manoeuvres and the war game and it is interesting that wolseley the most intellectual of soldiers should say if i have attained any measure of military prosperity my gratitude is due to one man and that man is sir hope grant p the hon f w a bruce was at a diplomat of considerable experience having served in south america egypt hong kong newfoundland and in china first as secretary to his brother and from as superintendent of trade and envoy extraordinary to the chinese empire p the inn of mutual prosperity was fairly typical to judge from the experience of that sturdy missionary the rev alexander williamson who stayed in similar establishments while ranging north china on behalf of the national bible society of scotland he and john scarth are lively and informative sources for china at this time and their observations of the social scene customs manners recreations costume food crime punishment etc accord closely with flashmans mr williamson has a keen eye for detail and a fine sweeping style thus the chinese are ignorant conceited and supercilious and regard europeans as a fierce mentally deficient semitamed breed to be placated like dogs or as wilful children he is scathing on chinese morals secret dens of hideous licentiousness exist in every city and on the great roads all disguise is thrown off scarth takes a particular delight in minutiae and is good with the telling phrase professional mourners he describes as howling for hire they and many foreign writers confirm flashmans strong impression of the chinese conviction of superiority over all other races whom they regarded as having tributary status p professional bandits pirates and members of the triad secret societies occasionally joined the taipings as did other rebels against the manchu regime only to fall away because of the revolutionaries strict social and religious discipline and because regular crime paid better some of the bandits continued as auxiliaries among them at least two female brigand leaders one of whom was called szuzhan it was an offshoot of the triads the small sword society which took shanghai in a conquest which flashman mistakenly attributes to the taipings in fact the small swords claimed association with the rebels but the taipings repudiated them because of their immoral habits and vicious propensities and so missed the opportunity of gaining a major port p flashmans account of the formidable taiping army is in accord with other contemporary descriptions so far as armaments uniforms organisation battle tactics black flags etc are concerned but one eminent military man disagreed with him about the rebels discipline wolseley who visited nanking a year later thought the taipings an undrilled undisciplined rabble whose strength lay in the fact that the imperial army was even worse even so wolseley had a deep admiration for the chinese whom he saw as the coming rulers of the world his vision of armageddon was china versus the united states fast becoming the greatest power of the world thank heaven they speak english p one revolution is probably very much like another and readers of flashmans narrative will no doubt detect resemblances between taipingdom and communist china a few decades ago the taipings were of course a socialist movement this is not the place to labour the point sufficient to say that the pronouncements of the heavenly king seem to have been received with the same kind of reverence later accorded to the thoughts of chairman mao of a taiping rebel and in his early days described himself as the new hung hsiuchuan who would expel the manchus p flashmans description of loyal prince lee chung wang and taiping commanderinchief requires some qualification whatever flashman may have thought lee was certainly not mad a former charcoal burner who had joined the taipings as a private soldier the chung wang was the best of the rebel generals and many authorities believe that had he had sole control of the movement the revolution would have succeeded an intelligent enlightened and humane soldier lee had a sincere belief in the taiping mission and in the bond of christianity which he supposed should exist between the taipings and the foreign powers in the latter he was to be bitterly disappointed he was said to be egotistical and jealous but the impression left by lindley is of a courteous capable and thoroughly rational man he also seems to have been a good administrator unlike most of his fellowgenerals flashmans physical description is close to lindleys p flashmans description of nanking and what he saw there is so detailed that it really requires footnoting throughout to save space it should be said that everything which he saw and heard in the city can be verified from other sources principally thomas w blakistons five months on the yangtze which contains among much other information r j forrests account of a progress through the city almost identical to flashmans forrest corroborates virtually everything from the street scenes the anterooms of he heavenly kings palace and social conditions to the furnishings and lifestyle in the homes of the taiping leaders flashmans personal adventures are of course another matter but for the rest from the taiping soldier with his attendant urchins to the bottles of cowards mixed pickles in jenkans livingroom the author can be accepted as an accurate reporter p the character and personality of hung hsiuchuan inspirer and leader of the taiping rebellion remain a mystery which chinese scholars are still working hard to solve chiefly by examination of the writings attributed to him obviously he was one of these rare unfathomable folk with the gift of communicating religious zeal and inspiring devotion in a way which is hardly understood even by those who know them intimately hungs case is complicated by the fact that he was by any normal standards quite mad and his condition seems to have deteriorated with time although almost a recluse at nanking he was seen by visitors on occasion he is described as being about five feet five inches tall wellbuilt and inclining to stoutness with a handsome rather round face sandy beard black hair and piercing dark eyes he was said to be physically very strong with a forceful personality at the time of his meeting with flashman he was years old the details of that meeting while obviously uncorroborated are by no means inconsistent with other evidence hungs time seems to have been devoted entirely to mystical speculation writing pronouncements and decrees and his numerous harem the vision he described to flashman is the one which he proclaimed after waking from his original trance the recitation of his concubine tallies closely with an exhortation which is to be found in taiping literature p hung jenkan kan wang prime minister and generalissimo of the taipings is the most interesting and enigmatic of the revolutionary leaders a cousin of the heavenly kings he studied with him at a baptist mission in canton and became one of his first disciples but was thought too young to join the revolution at its outset in after working at a protestant mission in hong kong he tried to reach nanking but failed and spent another four years in the colony with the london missionary society in he succeeded in reaching nanking and within a year had become second only to his cousin in the revolutionary hierarchy favouritism aside this meteoric rise can be attributed only to jenkans native talent and the advantage which worldly education had given him over the largely uneducated taiping wangs with the deterioration of the heavenly king jenkan with lee became the real head of the movement and one can only speculate why they did not combine more effectively jenkan was a strong man of vision and faith and one of the few taiping leaders with a real knowledge of affairs and the world outside china he spoke english fluently and like lee wanted to improve taiping relations with the european powers he also wished to inculcate orthodox protestant christianity jenkan was a stout genial outgoing personality and from all accounts as pleasant as flashman makes him sound he seems to have been alone among the taipings in genuinely detesting war had a deep admiration of british education and institutions and in his personal behaviour and tastes was perhaps closer to the west than the east he certainly appears to have had a realistic grasp of foreign attitudes to china particularly where trade was concerned flashman and forrest agree on his manner and lifestyle unlike the luxurious generals he enjoyed a simple rather untidy existence in his cluttered study kept no harem often ate european food and ignored the taiping prejudice against alcohol p that there was rivalry between lee and jenkan is not only possible but likely in view of the latters sudden ascendancy but only flashman suggests that it was carried as far as this there must always be doubt about what was happening behind the scenes at this critical stage in taiping fortunes but while flashmans story is plausible and not inconsistent with later events and while some mystery attaches to jenkans role within the movement it is only right to say that no other writer has suggested that the prime minister was actively plotting the generals downfall p the expression the almighty dollar which now refers to american currency was applied to the chinese dollar in the last century p flashman does more justice than is usually shown to frederick townsend ward the american soldier of fortune was unlucky in being succeeded in command of the evervictorious army of mercenaries by one of the great heroes of the victorian age majorgeneral charles george gordon who not only crushed the taiping rebellion but achieved immortality by his defence of khartoum two decades later it was the kind of fame that overshadowed all but his most eminent contemporaries and wards part in the china wars was quite eclipsed it remains that ward did found the evervictorious army and after initial reverses won several victories in the course of which he forged the weapon which gordon was to wield so brilliantly no doubt wards reputation suffered from his unpopularity with the foreign consulates in china particularly the british who resented his recruitment of the soldiers and sailors who were at one time the backbone of his force it was also feared that his activities might endanger british neutrality wards biographer cahill is reasonably indignant at the scant credit which the american has received in comparison to gordon but seems to spoil his case by overstatement to say that ward was a military genius who helped change the history of china may be defensible but to call him gordons superior as an organiser strategist and diplomat and unquestionably the greatest foreign soldier who fought in the taiping rebellion is perhaps to exaggerate flashmans account of ward seems fairly accurate as far as the facts of his career go a native of salem mass he was a mate on merchant ships when he was only and had military experience in central america mexico and the crimea with the french forces he came to china apparently with romantic notions of joining the taipings there is no record of his ever having run guns or opium but in the spring of he was mate of a yangtse steamship and fought a successful action against pirates when his vessel grounded he was later mate of an imperial gunboat in goughs flotilla before forming his own private army to defend shanghai for the manchus in this he was financed by china merchants including yang fang whose daughter he married flashmans account of wards initial battles is entirely accurate after his second defeat at chingpu and the loss of sungkiang which followed he went to france to recuperate returning to china and fighting with growing success until his death he was killed leading an attack on tsekee on september then came gordon to inherit his army and at least one of his gestures it is a small thing but while it is gordon who is remembered as the general who led his men into battle carrying only a cane the practice seems to have originated with ward he was a small man active and wiry with intense dark eyes and a mild pleasant manner little is known of his personality except that he was cheerful and amiable but he must have had a remarkable gift of leadership if only to hold his little army together through its early reverses especially the first assault on sungkiang when his entire force arrived in action in an advanced state of intoxication it may well be that he was as genially eccentric as flashman suggests by his own account he did once fall overboard while pursuing a butterfly and it is a matter of record that he was carried to the second attack on chingpu with his five wounds heavily bandaged in a sedan chair the man in the norfolk jacket described by flashman was probably henry burgevine wards lieutenant who briefly commanded the evervictorious army in the interval between wards death and gordons appointment an explosive eccentric from the american south burgevine had served in the crimea and changed sides several times during the taiping rebellion he lost the command of the eva after assaulting an official for withholding his troops pay went over to the rebels subsequently deserted and rejoined gordon tried to change sides again but was arrested and subsequently met his death by drowning in mysterious circumstances p french travellers to soochow including priests and missionaries had assured lee of a warm welcome in shanghai and since he set great store by the christian bond between taipings and europeans he advanced on the city in high hopes of a peaceful occupation only to be thunderstruck when he was opposed a rumour later arose that roman catholic priests who detested the taiping religion had encouraged his advance in the hope that he and his army would be destroyed p admiral hopes failure to force a passage at the taku forts on june is a forgotten imperial incident it was also probably the first occasion on which british and american servicemen fought side by side if unofficially hopes gunboats came under heavy bombardment from the chinese batteries and one the plover lost thirtyone out of her crew of forty her commander was killed the admiral was wounded and the remaining nine seamen were fighting their guns against hopeless odds it was too much for the elderly commodore josiah tattnall watching from the neutral deck of his us navy steamer toeywhan as a young midshipman he had fought against the british in the war of now disregarding his countrys nonbelligerent status he took a boat in under fire and offered hope his help hope accepted and tattnalls launch brought out the british wounded only later did he discover several of his men black with powder smoke what have you been doing you rascals he asked and received the reply beg pardon sir but they were a bit shorthanded with the bow gun the old commodore made no excuses for himself or his men in reporting the incident to washington blood he wrote is thicker than water hopes failure at taku met with less sympathy from the london correspondent of the new york daily news karl marx reporting the subsequent debate in parliament he wrote the whole debate in both houses on the china war evaporated in grotesque compliments showered on the head of admiral hope for having so gloriously buried the british forces in the mud marx was a trenchant commentator on chinese affairs he it was who likened the dissolution of the manchu empire to that of a mummy in a hermeticallysealed coffin brought into contact with the open air p last night among his fellow roughs he jested quaffd and swore a drunken private of the buffs who never lookd before today beneath his foemans frown he stands in elgins place ambassador from britains crown and type of all her race flashman had witnessed one of the most dramatic moments of the china war and its most famous heroism when moyes the drunken private of the buffs who had been captured along with an irish sergeant of the th and some coolies flatly refused to kowtow to his chinese captors and was cut down in cold blood yet but for sir francis doyles poem the incident might hardly have been heard of today it is largely forgotten and the facts behind it are difficult to trace the story rests on the sergeants authority and there seems no reason to doubt him or flashman or for that matter doyles poem which only errs in presenting moyes as a young kentish country boy when in fact he was a fairly disreputable scot old enough it is said to have been broken from the rank of colour sergeant for insubordination which seems characteristic not much more is known of moyes whose presence in the buffs was presumably a matter of chance a rumour that he died of drink in captivity seems to have no foundation he was in the hands of the chinese for barely one day and the sergeants account which doyle obviously accepted is consistent with the experience of later prisoners it is just possible that doyle who was matthew arnolds successor as professor of poetry at oxford had the moyes story from a most authoritative source lord elgin himself they had been contemporaries at eton and christ church where both took firsts in classics in belonged to the small circle of gladstones intimates and may have met again after elgins return to britain in p the hoot of the tawny owl the chat huant was a recognition signal among the peasant guerrilla fighters of britanny who remained loyal to the crown in the french revolution probably only flashman hearing the words at such a critical moment would have known that the speaker was presumably a breton p according to british army custom the most smartly turned out member of a guard was excused guard duty and given the light task of orderly to the guard this is known as taking the stick possibly because the orderly would carry a cane rather than a weapon the practice of carrying the guard on to parade was still occasionally seen in india in the editors time forty years ago p it is fairly rare for flashman to show much regard for politicals but the three with whom he was to work on the pekin expedition seem to have been exceptions they were in fact an impressive trio james bruce th earl of elgin was britains most accomplished foreign envoy in the middle years of the century and served with distinction as governor of jamaica governorgeneral of both canada and india and on missions to china and japan his great diplomatic service was to prevent annexation of canada to the us and negotiate the reciprocity treaty of which he was accused of floating through the american senate on oceans of champagne harry parkes former canton commissioner and elgins interpreter was to spend his life in the orient and make a name in both china and japan small wiry tenacious and a glutton both for work and punishment he had an adventurous career distinguished by his ability to survive attempts on his life he was the first foreigner ever received in private audience by the mikado henry loch as flashman indicates already had a highly active service career behind him belied by his gentle disposition and scholarly appearance he was to write the standard work on the pekin expedition and was subsequently governor of the cape of victoria australia and of the isle of man where he had the unusual distinction of having part of the seafront named after him g wrong the earl of elgin theodore waldron editor letters and journals of james th

elgin was to revise before the campaign was over british opinion of the french was as usual highly critical but on the march elgin noted that the french soldiers were better improvisers than the british and adapted well to the conditions our soldiers do little for themselves and their necessities are so great that we move but slowly the french work in all sorts of ways for the army the contrast is i must say very striking p the fight between tom sayers the pimlico bricklayer and john camel heenan usa for the equivalent of the modern world heavyweight title had taken place at farnborough in april and ended in a draw after rounds by which time neither man was fit to continue the exchanges had been so brutal that there was an outcry and the new marquess of queensberry rules were introduced a few years later this was the last bareknuckle prize fight in england p flashman is right in supposing that the regimental march of the buffs is attributed to handel but almost certainly wrong in saying that it was played on the march to pekin the buffs had been left behind to guard the taku forts while the th were left at sinho and the th sent as reinforcements to shanghai thus reducing the army to a more manageable size as to the handel attribution there is no conclusive proof that he wrote the march although the buffs tradition is strong on the point the suggestion is that the composer had an affection for the regiment with its distinguished record of continental service and perhaps also because it had its origins in the old trained bands of london his adopted home

flashmans narrative with any important matter but the present glaring omission has to be filled having devoted almost half his narrative to his mission to nanking and his efforts to prevent the taipings taking shanghai the author now blandly forgets all about the matter of course it is quite characteristic that he should no longer have cared whether shanghai fell or not since he was safely away from it but one would have expected at least a line about the outcome especially since elgin had just drawn it to his attention for the manchu request for british help against the taipings was prompted by the news from shanghai where loyal prince lees forces had been repulsed by british marines and sikhs on august it was not a major action although the taipings suffered some casualties lees reaction appears to have been one of bewildered disappointment at being rejected by fellowchristians his failure seemed to do him no harm in the taiping hierarchy p flashman may not have persuaded general sir john michel to part immediately with dr thorne the new bestseller by anthony trollope since it is known that lord elgin was reading it some months later it and darwins origin of species published the previous year were his lordships relaxation during his china mission p flashman was remembering the murder in in similar circumstances of sir william mcnaghten british envoy to kabul at the hands of the followers of akbar khan p the events of september when the chinese tried to ambush the allied force at fiveli point and took several prisoners in violation of the truce are corroborated by the authorities cited in note especially loch who with parkes was captured by sangkolinsen himself loch like flashman paints a most unpleasant picture of the warlord who worked himself into a fury storming and yelling abuse at his prisoners while his guards beat them forced them to kneel and rubbed lochs face in the dirt he called parkes a liar accused him of trying to humiliate the emperor and of preparing a treacherous attack on the chinese forces and added that he would teach us what it was to speak to high officers of the celestial empire in the manner in which they had been addressed yesterday it was after this that loch and the others were taken to the board of punishments screaming at barbarians seems to have been common among the mandarins when their superiority was in question sang flew into a passion at the suggestion that queen victoria was the equal of the emperor incidentally flashman is the only authority that sang was responsible for private moyes murder but it is interesting that the tirade directed at the tangku prisoners is identical with one delivered by sang on another occasion sam collinson was something of a mascot to the british troops probably because of his name he was certainly a resolute if unskilful opponent physically he was powerful with a face described as broad humorous savage strong and crafty p flashmans account of events at pahlichao bridge might seem incredible if it did not conform so closely to known facts the mandarin commanding the bridge was twice wounded during the battle and ordered the execution of brabazon and the abbe de luc in revenge both were beheaded on the parapet of the bridge although there is no record outside flashman of the death of nolan the chinese authorities later said that the two had died from natural causes but unofficial chinese sources agreed that the mandarin beheaded them in reprisal this was confirmed by the russian mission whose intelligence service was excellent months later the graves were identified by chinese and two headless skeletons were found along with scraps of cloth from artillery trousers and a piece of silk consistent with french ecclesiastical clothing the battle in which the french suffered the heavier casualties among the allies followed the course briefly described by flashman the chinese forces were routed and driven to within six miles of pekin it was the last action of the campaign montauban the french commander was ennobled as count palikao p shaws only western the shewingup of blanco posnet was first staged in p such is the power of propaganda that at sinho the imperial troops thought the british infantry were kowtowing when their front rank assumed the kneeling firing position p the emperor hsien feng son of heaven complete abundance solitary prince celestial emperor lord of the middle kingdom etc was at this time and dying of dropsy and debauchery as with many other oriental princes care had been taken to deprave him early in life his tutor in vice had been his assistant secretary sushun and he appears to have been completely in thrall to his favourite concubine yehonala at one time he had been a fine gymnast and even when his health was breaking down he retained a stately dignified bearing he was simple of face with a small mouth and wore a little moustache flashmans observation of the imperial throne room in the forbidden city is accurate as are his later descriptions of the emperors private apartments in the summer palace it was customary to address his majesty with the words your slave kneeling his decrees written in vermilion ink began swaying the wide world we protocol demanded that he should always face south and nobles invariably stood in his presence even when eating p many travellers visited the old summer palace and marvelled it has been described by several of flashmans army comrades although none of them had the opportunity to study it as closely as he did but it was obviously a place that had to be seen to be believed it was a wonder on two counts for the priceless treasures it contained and as the supreme example of landscape gardening for every inch of its extensive grounds its lakes and woods and hills was said to have been built by craftsmen to the most careful design some of it over centuries p one of yehonalas sixinch block shoes fringed with pearls is said to have fetched ј after being looted in the boxer rising p flashman is clear about the date of yehonalas departure the night of october at first sight there is an inconsistency here since other records established that the emperor and his suite including yehonala left for jehol on september the day after flashmans audience with the emperor the explanation is provided in flashmans narrative yehonala did leave on the nd and returned two days later others of the court also remained at pekin until the last minute the empress dowager and prince kung narrowly escaped the french advance on the ewenmingewen p about twenty badlyarmed eunuchs made a valiant effort to stop the french vanguard and were shot down p the looting of the ewenmingewen by the french the subsequent visit by elgin the generals conference about dividing the spoil the participation of british troops and chinese villagers the wanton destruction of anything too big to carry etc are all confirmed in other accounts most of the eyewitnesses express sadness disgust or horror but seem to have taken their share wolseley who watched the proceedings with an artists eye has interesting reflections on the psychology of looting which incidentally is not a subject to be pronounced on by those who have never had the opportunity flashmans black jade chess set may well have been a priceless rarity even if it was probably a black variety of jadeite rather than nephrite the very existence of black jade has been denied but there are references to it in chinese literature and some black jade carvings are said to be extant including a knife of the early chou dynasty illustrated in s c notts chinese jade p on the treatment of the prisoners and the return of the bodies flashman is scrupulously exact p whether flashman is right in his examination of elgins motives he has at least set out clearly the chain of events which led to the decision to burn the summer palace and the arguments which were advanced for and against at the time and he has done this so fully that there is little to add whether elgin was justified of his act of calculated vandalism is a question which may be set as an interesting historical exercise but not in the hope of receiving a satisfactory answer such matters are simply not to be judged at a distance it is abominable to destroy priceless works of art against that elgin was faced with the necessity of making a gesture which would not only have the effect of punishment but of inculcating a lesson and of securing future peace and security so far as he could see his time and means were limited his critics cannot merely say he was wrong they must say what else he could have done and they must show that it would have been equally effective it is also necessary to bear in mind the personality of he man himself and to put aside the idea that the burning was an act of mindless imperial barbarism mindless it certainly was not james bruce was no unthinking vandal far from it he was almost the last man to do such a thing it is not possible to say that he felt no primitive desire for revenge if he did he had cause but not enough to cloud the judgment of an experienced and responsible statesman who was also a sensitive and decent man elgin was enlightened beyond his day to some of his contemporaries he may have seemed almost heretical he knew too that in judging his act the world would not forget the elgin marbles acquired by his father it took a brave man to burn the summer palace he hated doing it he does not mention it in letters to his wife and there is a gap in his correspondence from october to when he notes that he has not been keeping his journal lately but knowing the circumstances as only he could know them he did at pekin what he thought best and it worked whether the end justified the means is a matter of opinion barbaric is a fair word to apply to the deed it is not paradoxically a fair word to apply to the big barbarian the reactions of his subordinates are interesting loch plainly felt guilty about it mcghee regretted it but thought it necessary wolseley the artist and art collector was saddened by it he had strong views on looting and paid for his share although he is said to have been given a petitot picture by a french officer the impenetrable hope grant refused any share of loot but insisted that his troops should receive their proper entitlement gordon wrote of pillaging and destroying in a vandallike manner it was wretchedly demoralising work but he noted succinctly although i have not as much as many i have done well since his loot included furs jade enamel and part of a throne he obviously had but whatever their opinion of the burning most of the british felt that the french had got the best of the loot although wolseley may have been nearer the truth when he estimated that the chinese villagers had plundered more than the british and french combined p flashman disagrees here with loch who says that this incident when parkes unexpectedly came face to face with his tormentor the president of the board of punishments took place three days earlier on october p
