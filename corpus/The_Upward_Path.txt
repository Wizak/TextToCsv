the negro has been in america just about three hundred years and in that time he has become intertwined in all the history of the nation he has fought in her wars he has endured hardships with her pioneers he has toiled in her fields and factories and the record of some of the nations greatest heroes is in large part the story of their service and sacrifice for this people the negro arrived in america as a slave in just one year before the pilgrims arrived at plymouth in search of freedom since then their lot has not always been a happy one but nevertheless in spite of difficulties and hardships the race has learned many valuable lessons in its conflict with the american civilization as a slave the lessons of labor of constructive endeavor of homelife and religion were learned even if the opportunity was not always present to use these lessons to good advantage after slavery other lessons were learned in their order devoted selfsacrificing souls soldiers of human brotherhood took up the task in the schoolroom which their brothers began on the battlefield here it was that the negro learned the history of america of the deeds of her great men the stirring events which marked her development the ideals that made america great and so well have they been learned that today there are no more loyal americans than the twelve million negroes that make up so large a part of the nation but the race has other things yet to learn the education of any race is incomplete unless the members of that race know the history and character of its own people as well as those of other peoples the negro has yet to learn of the part which his own race has played in making america great has yet to learn of the noble and heroic souls among his own people whose achievements are praiseworthy among any people a number of books poetry history and fiction have been written by negro authors in which the life of their own people has been faithfully and attractively set forth but until recently no effort has been made on a large scale to see that negro boys and girls became acquainted with these books and the facts they contained concerning their people in this volume the publishers have brought together a number of selections from the best literary works of negro authors through which these young people may learn more of the character and accomplishments of the worthy members of their race such matter is both informing and inspiring and no negro boy or girl can read it without feeling a deeper pride in his own race the selections are each calculated to teach a valuable lesson and all make a direct appeal to the best impulses of the human heart for a number of years several educational institutions for negro youths have conducted classes in negro history with a similar object in view the results of these classes have been most gratifying and the present volume is a commendable contribution to the literature of such a course robert r moton tuskegee institute ala june to the man in the tower the world below him is likely to look very small men look like ants and all the bustle and stir of their hurrying lives seems pitifully confused and aimless but the man in the street who is looking and striving upward is in a different situation however poor his present plight the thing he aims at and is striving toward stands out clear and distinct above him inspiring him with hope and ambition in his struggle upward for the man who is down there is always something to hope for always something to be gained the man who is down looking up may catch a glimpse now and then of heaven but the man who is so situated that he can only look down is pretty likely to see another and quite different place booker t washington the upward path the boy and the bayonet paul laurence dunbar it was june and nearing the closing time of school the air was full of the sound of bustle and preparation for the final exercises field day and drills drills especially for nothing so gladdens the heart of the washington mother be she black or white as seeing her boy in the blue cadets uniform marching proudly to the huzzas of an admiring crowd then she forgets the many nights when he has come in tired out and dusty from his practice drill and feels only the pride and elation of the result although tom did all he could outside of study hours there were many days of hard work for hannah davis when her son went into the high school but she took it upon herself gladly since it gave bud the chance to learn that she wanted him to have when however he entered the cadet corps it seemed to her as if the first steps toward the fulfilment of all her hopes had been made it was a hard pull to her getting the uniform but bud himself helped manfully and when his mother saw him rigged out in all his regimentals she felt that she had not toiled in vain and in fact it was worth all the trouble and expense just to see the joy and pride of little sister who adored bud as the time for the competitive drill drew near there was an air of suppressed excitement about the little house on d street where the three lived all day long little sister who was never very well and did not go to school sat and looked out of the window on the uninteresting prospect of a dusty thoroughfare lined on either side with dull red brick houses all of the same ugly pattern interspersed with older uglier and viler frame shanties in the evening hannah hurried home to get supper against the time when bud should return hungry and tired from his drilling and the chore work which followed hard upon its heels things were all cheerful however for as they applied themselves to the supper the boy with glowing face would tell just how his company a was getting on and what they were going to do to companies b and c it was not boasting so much as the expression of a confidence founded upon the hard work he was doing and hannah and the little sister shared that with him the child often listening to her brother would clap her hands or cry oh bud youre just splendid an i know youll beat em if hard workll beat em weve got em beat bud would reply and hannah to add an admonitory check to her own confidence would break in with now dont you be too sho dey aint been no man so good dat dey wasnt somebody bettah but all the while her face and manner were disputing what her words expressed the great day came and it was a wonderful crowd of people that packed the great baseball grounds to overflowing it seemed that all of washingtons colored population was out when there were really only about onetenth of them there it was an enthusiastic bannerwaving shouting hallooing crowd its component parts were strictly and frankly partisan and so separated themselves into sections differentiated by the colors of the flags they carried and the ribbons they wore side yelled defiance at side and party bantered party here the blue and white of company a flaunted audaciously on the breeze beside the very seats over which the crimson and gray of b were flying and they in their turn nodded defiance over the imaginary barrier between themselves and cs black and yellow the band was thundering out sousas high school cadets march the school officials the judges and reporters and some with less purpose were bustling about discussing and conferring altogether doing nothing much with beautiful unanimity all was noise hurry gaiety and turbulence in the midst of it all with blue and white rosettes pinned on their breasts sat two spectators tense and silent while the breakers of movement and sound struck and broke around them it seemed too much to hannah and little sister for them to laugh and shout bud was with company a and so the whole program was more like a religious ceremonial to them the blare of the brass to them might have been the trumpet call to battle in old judea and the farthrown tones of the megaphone the voice of a prophet proclaiming from the hilltop hannahs face glowed with expectation and little sister sat very still and held her mothers hand save when amid a burst of cheers company a swept into the parade ground at a quick step then she sprang up crying shrilly theres bud theres bud i see him and then settled back into her seat overcome with embarrassment the mothers eyes danced as soon as the sisters had singled out their dear one from the midst of the bluecoated boys and it was an effort for her to keep from following her little daughters example even to echoing her words company a came swinging down the field toward the judges in a manner that called for more enthusiastic huzzas that carried even the freshmen of other commands off their feet they were indeed a set of finelooking young fellows brisk straight and soldierly in bearing their captain was proud of them and his very step showed it he was like a skilled operator pressing the key of some great mechanism and at his command they moved like clockwork seen from the side it was as if they were all bound together by inflexible iron bars and as the end man moved all must move with him the crowd was full of exclamations of praise and admiration but a tense quiet enveloped them as company a came from columns of four into line for volley firing this was a real test it meant not only grace and precision of movement singleness of attention and steadiness but quickness tempered by selfcontrol at the command the volley rang forth like a single shot this was again the signal for wild cheering and the blue and white streamers kissed the sunlight with swift impulsive kisses hannah and little sister drew closer together and pressed hands the a adherents however were considerably cooled when the next volley came out badly scattering with one shot entirely apart and before the rest buds mother did not entirely understand the sudden quieting of the adherents they felt vaguely that all was not as it should be and the chill of fear laid hold upon their hearts what if buds company it was always buds company to them what if his company should lose but of course that couldnt be bud himself had said that they would win suppose though they didnt and with these thoughts they were miserable until the cheering again told them that the company had redeemed itself someone behind hannah said they are doing splendidly theyll win theyll win yet in spite of the second volley company a in columns of four had executed the right oblique in double time and halted amid cheers then formed left front into line without halting the next movement was one looked forward to with much anxiety on account of its difficulty the order was marching by fours to fix or unfix bayonets they were going at a quick step but the boys hands were steady hope was bright in their hearts they were doing it rapidly and freely when suddenly from the ranks there was the bright gleam of steel lower down than it should have been a gasp broke from the breasts of company as friends the blue and white dropped disconsolately while a few heartless ones who wore other colors attempted to hiss someone had dropped his bayonet but with muscles unquivering without a turned head the company moved on as if nothing had happened while one of the judges an army officer stepped into the wake of the boys and picked up the fallen steel no two eyes had seen half so quickly as hannah and little sisters who the blunderer was in the whole drill there had been but one figure for them and that was bud bud and it was he who had dropped his bayonet anxious nervous with the desire to please them perhaps with a shade too much of thought of them looking on with their hearts in their eyes he had fumbled and lost all he was striving for his head went round and round and all seemed black before him he executed the movements in a dazed way the applause generous and sympathetic as his company left the parade ground came to him from afar off and like a wounded animal he crept away from his comrades not because their reproaches stung him for he did not hear them but because he wanted to think what his mother and little sister would say but his misery was as nothing to that of the two who sat up there amid the ranks of the blue and white holding each others hands with a despairing grip to bud all of the rest of the contest was a horrid nightmare he hardly knew when the three companies were marched back to receive the judges decision the applause that greeted company b when the blue ribbons were pinned on the members coats meant nothing to his ears he had disgraced himself and his company what would his mother and his little sister say to hannah and little sister as to bud all of the remainder of the drill was a misery the one interest they had had in it failed and not even the dropping of his gun by one of company e when on the march halting in line could raise their spirits the little girl tried to be brave but when it was all over she was glad to hurry out before the crowd got started and to hasten away home once there and her tears flowed freely she hid her face in her mothers dress and sobbed as if her heart would break dont cry baby dont cry lammie dis aint da las time da wah goin to be a drill budll have a chance anotha time and den hell show em somethin bless you i spec hell be a captain but this consolation of philosophy was nothing to little sister it was so terrible to her this failure of buds she couldnt blame him she couldnt blame anyone else and she had not yet learned to lay all such unfathomed catastrophes at the door of fate what to her was the thought of another day what did it matter to her whether he was a captain or a private she didnt even know the meaning of the words but little sister from the time she knew bud was a private thought that was much better than being a captain or any other of those things with a long name so that settled it her mother finally set about getting the supper while little sister drooped disconsolately in her own little splintbottomed chair she sat there weeping silently until she heard the sound of buds step then sprang up and ran away to hide she didnt dare to face him with tears in her eyes bud came in without a word and sat down in the dark front room dat you bud asked his mother yassum bettah come now suppers puty nigh ready i dont want no supper you bettah come on bud i reckon yous mighty tired he did not reply but just then a pair of thin arms were put around his neck and a soft cheek was placed close to his own come on buddie whispered little sister mammy an me know you didnt mean to do it an we dont keer bud threw his arms around his little sister and held her tightly its only you an ma i care about he said though i am sorry i spoiled the companys drill they say b would have won anyway on account of our bad firing but i did want you and ma to be proud we is proud she whispered wes mos prouder dan if youd won and pretty soon she led him by the hand to supper hannah did all she could to cheer the boy and to encourage him to hope for next year but he had little to say in reply and went to bed early in the morning though it neared school time bud lingered around and seemed in no disposition to get ready to go bettah git ready fer school said hannah cheerily i dont believe i want to go any more bud replied not go any more why aint you shamed to talk that way o cose you goin to school im ashamed to show my face to the boys what you say about de boys de boys aint agoin to give you an edgication when you need it oh i dont want to go ma you dont know how i feel im kinder sorry i let you go into dat company said hannah musingly cause it was de teachin i wanted you to git not the prancin and steppin but i did tink it would make mo of a man of you an it aint yo pappy was a po man had wokin an he wasnt hightoned neither but from the time i first see him to the day of his death i nevah seen him back down because he was afeared of anything and hannah turned to her work little sister went up and slipped her hand in his you aint agoin to back down is you buddie she said no said bud stoutly as he braced his shoulders im agoin but no persuasion could make him wear his uniform the boys were a little cold to him and some were brutal but most of them recognized the fact that what had happened to tom harris might have happened to any one of them besides since the percentage had been shown it was found that b had outpointed them in many ways and so their loss was not due to the one grave error buds heart sank when he dropped into his seat in the assembly hall to find seated on the platform one of the bluecoated officers who had acted as judge the day before after the opening exercises were over he was called upon to address the school he spoke readily and pleasantly laying especial stress upon the value of discipline toward the end of his address he said i suppose company a is heaping accusations upon the head of the young man who dropped his bayonet yesterday tom could have died it was most regrettable the officer continued but to me the most significant thing at the drill was the conduct of that cadet afterward i saw the whole proceeding i saw that he did not pause for an instant that he did not even turn his head and it appeared to me as one of the finest bits of selfcontrol i had ever seen in any youth had he forgotten himself for a moment and stopped however quickly to secure the weapon the next line would have been interfered with and your whole movement thrown into confusion there were a half hundred eyes glancing furtively at bud and the light began to dawn in his face this boy has shown what discipline means and i for one want to shake hands with him if he is here when he had concluded the principal called bud forward and the boys even his detractors cheered as the officer took his hand why are you not in uniform sir he asked i was ashamed to wear it after yesterday was the reply dont be ashamed to wear your uniform the officer said to him and bud could have fallen on his knees and thanked him there were no more jeers from his comrades and when he related it all at home that evening there were two more happy hearts in that south washington cottage i told you we was more prouder dan if youd won said little sister an what did i tell you bout backin out asked his mother bud was too happy and too busy to answer he was brushing his uniform the beginnings of a mississippi school william h holtzclaw i had been unable to get permission to teach in the little church so i started my school in the open air we were out under the big trees amidst the shrubbery this would have made a very good schoolhouse but for its size in such a schoolhouse one could get along very well if he could keep his pupils close enough to him but the chances are as i have found that they will put bugs down one anothers collars and while you are hearing one class the other children will chase one another about their buoyant spirits will not permit them to keep quiet while they are in the open it is pretty hard to hear a class reciting and at the same time to witness a boxingmatch but those who teach in the open air must be prepared for such performances these annoyances were accentuated by the fact that some of my pupils were forty years old while others were six after a while we moved into an abandoned house which we used for a schoolhouse but it was little better than teaching out of doors when it rained the water not only came through the roof but through the sides as well during cold winter rains i had to teach while standing with my overcoat on and with arctic rubbers to protect myself against pneumonia during those rainy days miss lee my assistant would get up on a bench and stand there all day to keep her feet out of the water and would have an umbrella stretched over her to keep from getting wet from above the little fellows would be standing in the water below like little ducks they stood these conditions exceedingly well many of them were not protected with overshoes or any shoes but they came to school each day just as if they had been properly clad it is impossible to describe the hardships that we suffered during that winter which was severe for the south as the winter came on and grew more and more severe a great many of the children were taken with pneumonia la grippe and similar ailments i wished in the interest of health to abandon the school for a few weeks until better weather but neither pupils nor teachers nor parents would listen to this and so the school continued under these circumstances until the new schoolhouse was ready for use it is needless to say that some of the pupils never survived those conditions in fact the strange thing is that any of us did up from slavery the struggle for an education booker t washington one day while at work in the coalmine i happened to overhear two miners talking about a great school for colored people somewhere in virginia this was the first time that i had ever heard anything about any kind of school or college that was more pretentious than the little colored school in our town in the darkness of the mine i noiselessly crept as close as i could to the two men who were talking i heard one tell the other that not only was the school established for the members of my race but that opportunities were provided by which poor but worthy students could work out all or a part of the cost of board and at the same time be taught some trade or industry as they went on describing the school it seemed to me that it must be the greatest place on earth and not even heaven presented more attractions for me at that time than did the hampton normal and agricultural institute in virginia about which these men were talking i resolved at once to go to that school although i had no idea where it was or how many miles away or how i was going to reach it i remembered only that i was on fire constantly with one ambition and that was to go to hampton this thought was with me day and night after hearing of the hampton institute i continued to work for a few months longer in the coalmine while at work there i heard of a vacant position in the household of general lewis ruffner the owner of the saltfurnace and coalmine mrs viola ruffner the wife of general ruffner was a yankee woman from vermont mrs ruffner had a reputation all through the vicinity for being very strict with her servants and especially with the boys who tried to serve her few of them had remained with her more than two or three weeks they all left with the same excuse she was too strict i decided however that i would rather try mrs ruffners house than remain in the coalmine and so my mother applied to her for the vacant position i was hired at a salary of per month i had heard so much about mrs ruffners severity that i was almost afraid to see her and trembled when i went into her presence i had not lived with her many weeks however before i began to understand her i soon began to learn that first of all she wanted everything kept clean about her that she wanted things done promptly and systematically and that at the bottom of everything she wanted absolute honesty and frankness nothing must be sloven or slipshod every door every fence must be kept in repair i cannot now recall how long i lived with mrs ruffner before going to hampton but i think it must have been a year and a half at any rate i here repeat what i have said more than once before that the lessons that i learned in the home of mrs ruffner were as valuable to me as any education i have ever gotten anywhere since even to this day i never see bits of paper scattered around a house or in the street that i do not want to pick them up at once i never see a filthy yard that i do not want to clean it a paling off of a fence that i do not want to put it on an unpainted or unwhitewashed house that i do not want to paint or whitewash it or a button off ones clothes or a greasespot on them or on a floor that i do not want to call attention to it from fearing mrs ruffner i soon learned to look upon her as one of my best friends when she found that she could trust me she did so implicitly during the one or two winters that i was with her she gave me an opportunity to go to school for an hour in the day during a portion of the winter months but most of my studying was done at night sometimes alone sometimes under some one whom i could hire to teach me mrs ruffner always encouraged and sympathized with me in all my efforts to get an education it was while living with her that i began to get together my first library i secured a drygoods box knocked out one side of it put some shelves in it and began putting into it every kind of book that i could get my hands upon and called it my library without any unusual occurrence i reached hampton with a surplus of exactly fifty cents with which to begin my education to me it had been a long eventful journey but the first sight of the large threestory brick school building seemed to have rewarded me for all that i had undergone in order to reach the place if the people who gave the money to provide that building could appreciate the influence the sight of it had upon me as well as upon thousands of other youths they would feel all the more encouraged to make such gifts it seemed to me to be the largest and most beautiful building i had ever seen the sight of it seemed to give me new life i felt that a new kind of existence had now begun that life would now have a new meaning i felt that i had reached the promised land and i resolved to let no obstacle prevent me from putting forth the highest effort to fit myself to accomplish the most good in the world as soon as possible after reaching the grounds of the hampton institute i presented myself before the head teacher for assignment to a class having been so long without proper food a bath and change of clothing i did not of course make a very favorable impression upon her and i could see at once that there were doubts in her mind about the wisdom of admitting me as a student i felt that i could hardly blame her if she got the idea that i was a worthless loafer or tramp for some time she did not refuse to admit me neither did she decide in my favor and i continued to linger about her and to impress her in all the ways i could with my worthiness in the meantime i saw her admitting other students and that added greatly to my discomfort for i felt deep down in my heart that i could do as well as they if i could only get a chance to show what was in me after some hours had passed the head teacher said to me the adjoining recitation room needs sweeping take the broom and sweep it it occurred to me at once that here was my chance never did i receive an order with more delight i knew that i could sweep for mrs ruffner had thoroughly taught me how to do that when i lived with her i swept the recitationroom three times then i got a dustingcloth and i dusted it four times all the woodwork around the walls every bench table and desk i went over four times with my dustingcloth besides every piece of furniture had been moved and every closet and corner in the room had been thoroughly cleaned i had the feeling that in a large measure my future depended upon the impression i made upon the teacher in the cleaning of that room when i was through i reported to the head teacher she was a yankee woman who knew just where to look for dirt she went into the room and inspected the floor and closets then she took her handkerchief and rubbed it on the woodwork about the walls and over the table and benches when she was unable to find one bit of dirt on the floor or a particle of dust on any of the furniture she remarked quietly i guess you will do to enter this institution booker t washington a students memory of him william h holtzclaw one thing about mr washington that impressed me was his regularity he was as regular as the clock he appeared at his office in the morning exactly at eight oclock remained until twelve very often took part in an executive council meeting until one and then went to lunch at two oclock he would again be in his office and would invariably remain there until halfpast four when he would leave and tramp across the plantation sometimes he would run for a mile or two as fast as he could go for exercise when he returned he would go to his library and there would pass the time until six when he would go to dinner after dinner he played with the children for a while and then returned to his library until he would then go to chapel for evening prayers with the whole student body this prayer service was one that mr washington seldom ever missed and he always appeared on the rostrum exactly on the minute mr washington had a grasp of the details of the work of tuskegee that seemed almost incredible i remember one evening that i was startled to hear my name together with that of one of my friends called out by mr washington from the chapel platform he simply said william holtzclaw and charles washington may rise i was so weak in my knees that i could scarcely stand but i knew nothing else to do but to rise at the command of that voice after we stood up and the whole school was looking at us mr washington said these young men may pass out of the chapel and go and pick up the tools they worked with today we had been ditching and when the workbell rang had left our tools where we were working when they should have been carried to the toolhouse if the water main or water pipe had a defect in it so that it was leaking anywhere on the grounds mr washington was almost sure to see that something was wrong and to call the matter to the attention of the superintendent of industries if he came into the diningroom while the students were eating their meals he would notice such small details as a students pouring out more molasses on his plate than he could eat and would stop in the diningroom send for the matron have some bread brought to the student and wait until that student had eaten all the molasses he had poured on his plate if one walked about the campus at night he would be sure to meet mr washington almost anywhere on the grounds for instance he might be found in the kitchen at two oclock in the morning examining the method of preparing the students breakfast he seldom seemed to me to take sufficient rest for an average man annamargaret augusta bird to annamargarets mind being the baby of the family was simply awful this fact seemed to grow with it each day it began in the morning when she watched her sisters as they laughed and rollicked through their dressing bet ill beat and you got on your stockings already challenged edith ill bet you wont bet ill be out to the pump my face washed and be at the breakfast table and you wont have your shoes laced up boasted ruth the older of the two well see well see giggled edith oho i guess you will mother gave you new shoe strings said ruth somewhat crestfallen i told you so i told you so and edith bounded out of the door closely pursued by ruth who cried you didnt beat me but bout an inch annamargaret was left alone to sit and think for all the next hour how perfectly awful it was to be the baby until mother dear was able to come and dress her the next morning it was the same torture all over again it seemed to annamargaret that people never stopped to think or know what a baby was forced to go through there were edith and ruth racing again annamargaret spied her shoes and stockings on a chair out of the side of her crib she climbed look at annamargaret screamed edith you annamargaret get right back in that crib commanded ruth assuming her mothers tone i wont and right over to the chair where her shoes and stockings were walked the baby she seated herself on the floor and drew on her stocking as if she had been in the habit of doing it on preceding mornings it was surprising to annamargaret herself the ease with which it went on look at that child gasped ruth edith looked and said a little grudgingly ill bet she cant put on her shoes though edith remembered how long it was before she was able to put on her shoes and this accomplishment in her mind seemed to give her a great superiority over her baby sister come on edith called ruth ill beat you down to the pump and ill give you to the rose bush too struggling pulling and twisting sat annamargaret all alone but the shoe would not go on she was just about to give up in utter despair and burst into tears when mother dear appeared in the doorway what is mothers angel doing well well look at mothers smart child she has got on her stocking already here let mother help her it was awful to think you were still such a baby that you couldnt do anything yourself but it was very nice so annamargaret thought to have such an adorable mother to come to your rescue there now run out and tell ruth to wash your face and then mother will give you your breakfast wash my face ruth requested annamargaret at the pump who laced up your shoes asked edith suspiciously i did annamargaret said it so easily that it startled herself i dont believe it i dont believe it i am going to ask mother hold still will you and let me wash your face commanded ruth as soon as she was free away went annamargaret back to the house muvver muvver cried annamargaret almost breathless as she entered the big kitchen tell edith i laced up my shoes tell er muvver will yo muvver mother stopped her work at the breakfast table annamargaret i could not do

them as fast as her little chubby brown legs could carry her which wasnt very fast the other children were far in front of her annamargaret stopped suddenly she heard a little biddie in distress there was a mother hen darting through the grass after a fleeing grasshopper and close behind her was the whole flock save one annamargaret watched them as the young chickens spread open their wings and hurried in pursuit of their mother far behind one little black fuzzy biddie struggled and tripped over the tall grass stems the baby looked at the little chick and then at the other ones and saw that they were different she didnt know what the difference was she could not understand that the other chickens were several days older and that this one had only been taken away from its own mother hen that morning in order that she would remain on her nest until all her chicks were hatched all annamargaret knew was that they were different poor lll biddie dey dont want you to play wif them she

annamargaret went straight to the big sewingbasket and placing the biddie on the machine extracted a threaded needle cutting two small pieces of black cloth for wings she took the chick and seated herself on the dropstep between the sewingroom and diningroom she then attempted to sew one of the little black pieces of cloth to one of the tiny wings of the young chick illustration there there

fairest of the fair with every grace bedight beyond compare said i what doest thou pray tell to me i see the good in others answered she my first school w e b dubois once upon a time i taught school in the hills of tennessee where the broad dark vale of the mississippi begins to roll and crumple to greet the alleghanies i was a fisk student then and all fisk men thought that tennessee beyond the veil was theirs alone and in vacation time they sallied forth in lusty bands to meet the county schoolcommissioners young and happy i too went and i shall not soon forget that summer first there was a teachers institute at the countyseat and there distinguished guests of the superintendent taught the teachers fractions and spelling and other mysteries white teachers in the morning negroes at night a picnic now and then and a supper and the rough world was softened by laughter and song i remember how but i wander there came a day when all the teachers left the institute and began the hunt for schools i learn from hearsay for my mother was mortally afraid of firearms that the hunting of ducks and bears and men is wonderfully interesting but i am sure that the man who has never hunted a country school has something to learn of the pleasures of the chase i see now the white hot roads lazily rise and fall and wind before me under the burning july sun i feel the deep weariness of heart and limb as ten eight six miles stretch relentlessly ahead i feel my heart sink heavily as i hear again and again got a teacher yes so i walked on horses were too expensive until i wandered beyond railways beyond stage lines to a land of varmints and rattlesnakes where the coming of a stranger was an event and men lived and died in the shadow of one blue hill sprinkled over hill and dale lay cabins and farmhouses shut out from the world by the forests and the rolling hills toward the east there i found at last a little school josie told me of it she was a thin homely girl of twenty with a darkbrown face and thick hard hair i had crossed the stream at watertown and rested under the great willows then i had gone to the little cabin in the lot where josie was resting on her way to town the gaunt farmer made me welcome and josie hearing my errand told me anxiously that they wanted a school over the hill that but once since the war had a teacher been there that she herself longed to learn and thus she ran on talking fast and loud with much earnestness and energy next morning i crossed the tall round hill lingered to look at the blue and yellow mountains stretching toward the carolinas then plunged into the wood and came out at josies home it was a dull frame cottage with four rooms perched just below the brow of the hill amid peach trees the father was a quiet simple soul calmly ignorant with no touch of vulgarity the mother was different strong bustling and energetic with a quick restless tongue and an ambition to live like folks there was a crowd of children two boys had gone away there remained two growing girls a shy midget of eight john tall awkward and eighteen jim younger quicker and better looking and two babies of indefinite age then there was josie herself she seemed to be the center of the family always busy at service or at home or berrypicking a little nervous and inclined to scold like her mother yet faithful too like her father she had about her a certain fineness the shadow of an unconscious moral heroism that would willingly give all of life to make life broader deeper and fuller for her and hers i saw much of this family afterwards and grew to love them for their honest efforts to be decent and comfortable and for their knowledge of their own ignorance there was with them no affectation the mother would scold the father for being so easy josie would roundly berate the boys for carelessness and all know that it was a hard thing to dig a living out of a rocky sidehill i secured the school i remember the day i rode horseback out to the commissioners house with a pleasant young white fellow who wanted the white school the road ran down the bed of a stream the sun laughed and the water jingled and we rode on come in said the commissioner come in have a seat yes that certificate will do stay to dinner what do you want a month oh thought i this is lucky but even then fell the first awful shadow of the veil for they ate first then i alone the schoolhouse was a log hut where colonel wheeler used to shelter his corn it sat in a lot behind a rail fence and thorn bushes near the sweetest of springs there was an entrance where a door once was and within a massive rickety fireplace great chinks between the logs served as windows furniture was scarce a pale blackboard crouched in the corner my desk was made of three boards reinforced at critical points and my chair borrowed from the landlady had to be returned every night seats for the children these puzzled me much i was haunted by a new england vision of neat little desks and chairs but alas the reality was rough plank benches without backs and at times without legs they had the one virtue of making naps dangerous possibly fatal for the floor was not to be trusted it was a hot morning late in july when the school opened i trembled when i heard the patter of little feet down the dusty road and saw the growing row of dark solemn faces and bright eager eyes facing me first came josie and her brothers and sisters the longing to know to be a student in the great school at nashville hovered like a star above this childwoman amid her work and worry and she studied doggedly there were the dowells from their farm over toward alexandria fanny with her smooth black face and wondering eyes martha brown and dull the pretty girlwife of a brother and the younger brood there were the burkes two brown and yellow lads and a tiny haughtyeyed girl fat reubens little chubby girl came with golden face and oldgold hair faithful and solemn thenie was on hand early a jolly ugly goodhearted girl who slyly dipped snuff and looked after her little bowlegged brother when her mother could spare her tildy came a midnight beauty with starry eyes and tapering limbs and her brother correspondingly homely and then the big boys the hulking lawrences the lazy neills unfathered sons of mother and daughter hickman with a stoop in his shoulders and the rest there they sat nearly thirty of them on the rough benches their faces shading from a pale cream to a deep brown the little feet bare and swinging the eyes full of expectation with here and there a twinkle of mischief and the hands grasping websters blueback spellingbook i loved my school and the fine faith the children had in the wisdom of their teacher was truly marvelous we read and spelled together wrote a little picked flowers sang and listened to stories of the world beyond the hill at times the school would dwindle away and i would start out i would visit mun eddings who lived in two very dirty rooms and ask why little lugene whose flaming face seemed ever ablaze with the darkred hair uncombed was absent all last week or why i missed so often the inimitable rags of mack and ed then the father who worked colonel wheelers farm on shares would tell me how the crops needed the boys and the thin slovenly mother whose face was pretty when washed assured me that lugene must mind the baby but well start them again next week when the lawrences stopped i knew that the doubts of the old folks about booklearning had conquered again and so toiling up the hill and getting as far into the cabin as possible i put cicero pro archia poeta into the simplest english with local applications and usually convinced them for a week or so on friday nights i often went home with some of the children sometimes to doc burkes farm he was a great loud thin black ever working and trying to buy the seventyfive acres of hill and dale where he lived but people said that he would surely fail and the white folks would get it all his wife was a magnificent amazon with saffron face and shining hair uncorseted and barefooted and the children were strong and beautiful they lived in a oneandahalfroom cabin in the hollow of the farm near the spring the front room was full of great fat white beds scrupulously neat and there were bad chromos on the walls and a tired centertable in the tiny back kitchen i was often invited to take out and help myself to fried chicken and wheat biscuit meat and corn pone stringbeans and berries at first i used to be a little alarmed at the approach of bedtime in the lone bedroom but embarrassment was very deftly avoided first all the children nodded and slept and were stowed away in one great pile of goose feathers next the mother and the father discreetly slipped away to the kitchen while i went to bed then blowing out the dim light they retired in the dark in the morning all were up and away before i thought of awaking across the road where fat reuben lived they all went outdoors while the teacher retired because they did not boast the luxury of a kitchen i liked to stay with the dowells for they had four rooms and plenty of good country fare uncle bird had a small rough farm all woods and hills miles from the big road but he was full of tales he preached now and then and with his children berries horses and wheat he was happy and prosperous often to keep the peace i must go where life was less lovely for instance tildys mother was incorrigibly dirty reubens larder was limited seriously and herds of untamed insects wandered over the eddingses beds best of all i loved to go to josies and sit on the porch eating peaches while the mother bustled and talked how josie had bought the sewingmachine how josie worked at service in winter but that four dollars a month was mighty little wages how josie longed to go away to school but that it looked like they never could get far enough ahead to let her how the crops failed and the well was yet unfinished and finally how mean some of the white folks were for two summers i lived in this little world it was dull and humdrum the girls looked at the hill in wistful longing and the boys fretted and haunted alexandria alexandria was town a straggling lay village of houses churches and shops and an aristocracy of toms dicks and captains cuddled on the hill to the north was the village of the colored folks who lived in threeor fourroom unpainted cottages some neat and homelike and some dirty the dwellings were scattered rather aimlessly but they centered about the twin temples of the hamlet the methodist and the hardshell baptist churches these in turn leaned gingerly on a sadcolored schoolhouse hither my little world wended its crooked way on sunday to meet other worlds and gossip and wonder and make the weekly sacrifice with frenzied priest at the altar of the oldtime religion then the soft melody and mighty cadences of negro song fluttered and thundered i have called my tiny community a world and so its isolation made it and yet there was among us but a halfawakened common consciousness sprung from common joy and grief at burial birth or wedding from a common hardship in poverty poor land and low wages and above all from the sight of the veil that hung between us and opportunity all this caused us to think some thoughts together but these when ripe for speech were spoken in various languages those whose eyes twentyfive or more years before had seen the glory of the coming of the lord saw in every present hindrance or help a dark fatalism bound to bring all things right in his own good time the mass of those to whom slavery was a dim recollection of childhood found the world a puzzling thing it asked little of them and they answered with little and yet it ridiculed their offering such a paradox they could not understand and therefore sank into listless indifference or shiftlessness or reckless bravado there were however some such as josie jim and ben to whom war hell and slavery were but childhood tales whose young appetites had been whetted to an edge by school and story and halfawakened thought ill could they be content born without and beyond the world and their weak wings beat against their barriers barriers of caste of youth of life at last in dangerous moments against everything that opposed even a whim ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes paul laurence dunbar ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes which all the day with ceaseless care have sought the magic gold which from the seeker flies ere

the soul is torn ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes now all the griefs and heartaches we have known come up like poisnous vapors that arise

hard very hard all day and beat them when they did not move fast enough and always every night before they went to bed they slept in an attic on a rickety narrow bed that went screech screech whenever they moved and in the summer they nearly died with the heat up there and in the winter with the cold one wintry night when they were both weeping very bitterly after a particularly hard beating they suddenly heard a pleasant voice saying why are you crying little boys they looked up and there in the moonlight by their bed was the dearest little old lady she was dressed all in grey from the peak of her little pointed hat to her little buckled shoes she held a black cane much taller than her little self her hair fell about her ears in tiny grey corkscrew curls and they bobbed about as she moved her eyes were black and bright as bright as well as that lovely white light in the fire and her cheeks were as red as an apple why are you crying little boys she asked again in a lovely low little voice because we are tired and sore and hungry and cold and we are all alone in the world and we dont know how to laugh any more we should so like to laugh again why thats easy she said its just like this and she laughed a little joyous musical laugh try she commanded they tried but their laughing boxes were very rusty and they made horrid sounds well she said i advise you to pack up and go away as soon as you can to the land of laughter youll soon learn there i can tell you is there such a land they asked doubtfully to be sure there is she answered the least bit sharply we never heard of it they said well im sure there must be plenty of things you never heard about she said just the leastest bit more sharply in a moment youll be telling me the flowers dont talk together and the birds we never heard of such a thing they said in surprise their eyes like saucers there she said bobbing her little curls what did i tell you you have much to learn how do you get to the land of laughter they asked you go out of the eastern gate of the town just as the sun is rising and you take the highway there and follow it and if you go with it long enough it will bring you to the gate of the land of laughter it is a long long way from here and it will take you many days the words had scarcely left her mouth when lo the little lady disappeared and where she had stood was the white square of moonlight nothing else and without more ado these two little boys put their arms round each other and fell fast asleep and in the grey just before daybreak they awoke and dressed and putting on their little ragged caps and mittens for it was a wintry day they stole out of the house and made for the eastern gate and just as they reached it and passed through the whole east leapt into fire illustration the land of laughter all day they walked and many days thereafter and kindly people by the way took them in and gave them food and drink and sometimes a bed at night often they slept by the roadside but they didnt mind that for the climate was delightful not too hot and not too cold they soon threw away their ragged little mittens they walked for many days and there was no land of laughter once they met an old man richly dressed with shining jewels on his fingers and he stopped them and asked where are you going so fast little boys we are going to the land of laughter they said very gravely that said the old man is a very foolish thing to do come with me and i will take you to the land of riches i will cover you with beautiful garments and give you jewels and a castle to live in with servants and horses and many things besides and they said to him no we wish to learn how to laugh again we have forgotten how and we are going to the land of laughter you will regret not going with me see if you dont he said and he left them in quite a huff and they walked again many days and again they met an old man he was tall and imposinglooking and very dignified and he said where are you going so fast little boys we are going to the land of laughter they said together very seriously what he said that is an extremely foolish thing to do come with me and i will give you power i will make you great men generals kings emperors whatever you desire to accomplish will be permitted you and they said politely thank you very much but we have forgotten how to laugh and we are going there to learn how he looked upon them haughtily without speaking and disappeared and they walked and walked more days and they met another old man and he was clad in rags and his face was thin and his eyes were unhappy and he whispered to them where are you going so fast little boys we are going to the land of laughter they answered without a smile laughter laughter that is useless come with me and i will show you the beauty of life through sacrifice suffering for others that is the only life i come from the land of sacrifice and they thanked him kindly but said we have suffered enough we have forgotten how to laugh we would learn again and they went on and he looked after them wistfully they walked more days and at last they came to the land of laughter and how do you suppose they knew this because they could hear over the wall the sound of joyous laughter the laughter of men women and little children and one sat guarding the gate and they went to her we have come a long long distance and we would enter the land of laughter let me see you smile first she said gently i sit at the gate and no one who does not know how to smile may enter into the land of laughter and they tried to smile but could not go away and practise she said kindly and come back tomorrow and they went away and practised all night how to smile and in the morning they returned and the gentle lady at the gate said dear little boys have you learned how to smile and they said we have tried how is this better she said much better practise some more and come back tomorrow and they went away obediently and practised and they came the third day and she said now try again and tears of delight came into her lovely eyes those were very beautiful smiles she said now you may enter and she unlocked the gate and kissed them both and they entered the beautiful land of laughter never had they seen such blue skies such green trees and grass never had they heard such bird song and people men women and children laughing softly came to meet them and took them in and made them at home and soon very soon they learned to laugh all day they laughed and even in their sleep and they grew up here and married and had laughing happy children and sometimes they thought of the land of riches and said ah well and sometimes of the land of power and sighed a little and sometimes of the land of sacrifice and their eyes were wistful but they soon forgot and laughed again and they grew old laughing and when they died a laugh was on their lips thus are things in the beautiful land of laughter the web of circumstance charles w chesnutt some time we are told when the cycle of years has rolled around there is to be another golden age when all men will dwell together in love and harmony and when peace and righteousness shall prevail for a thousand years god speed the day and let not the shining thread of hope become so enmeshed in the web of circumstance that we lose sight of it but give us here and there and now and then some little foretaste of this golden age that we may the more patiently and hopefully await its coming is the game worth the candle james e shepard a mans life depends upon his emotions his aspirations his determinations a young man somebodys son starts out with the determination that the world is indebted to him for a good time dollars were made to spend i am young and every man must sow his wild oats and then settle down i want to be a hail fellow well met with every one with this determination uppermost in his life purpose he starts out to be a goodtimer perhaps some mother expects to hear great things of her boy some fathers hopes are centered in him but what does that matter i am a goodtimer from one gayety to another from one glass to another from one sin to another and the goodtimer at last is broken in health deserted by friends and left alone to die thus the man about town passes off the stage when you ask some of his friends about him the answer is oh john was all right but he lived too fast i like good times as well as anyone but i could not keep up with john was the game worth the candle two pictures came before my mind two cousins both of them young men one started out early in life with the determination of getting along easy shirking work and looking for a soft snap his motto was the world owes me a living and i am going to get mine he was employed first by one firm and then by another if anything that he considered hard came along he would pay another fellow to do the work and he took things easy it was not long before no one would hire him he continued to hold the idea that the world was indebted to him and furthermore he arrogated a belief that what another man had accumulated he could borrow without his knowledge he forged another mans name was detected and sentenced to the penitentiary and is now wearing the badge of felony and shame the convicts stripes is the game worth the candle the other cousin started out with a determination altogether different he believed with lord brougham that if he were a bootblack he would strive to be the best bootblack in england he began in a store as a windowcleaner and washed windows so well that they sparkled like diamonds under the sun as a clerk no customer was too insignificant to be greeted with a smile or pleasant word no task was too great for him to attempt thus step by step he advanced each day bringing new duties and difficulties but each day also bringing new strength and determination to master them and today that cousin is a man of wealth and an honored citizen blessed too with a happy home some young men start life with the idea that every dollar made requires that one dollar and a half shall be spent in order to be noticed they must make a big show give big dinners carriage drives and parties invite friends to the theaters and have a swell time must do like mr soandso they forget in their desire to copy that mr soandso their pattern has already made his fortune that he began to save before he began to spend but no his name appears often in the papers and they think also that theirs must so they begin their careers a few years pass the young men marry their debts begin to accumulate and to press them their countenances are always woebegone where once were smiles now are frowns and the homes are pictures of gloom and shadows the lesson is plain debt is the greatest burden that can be put upon man it makes him afraid to look honest men in the face no man can be a leader in the fullest sense who is burdened by a great debt if there is any young man who is spending more than he is making let him ask himself the question is the game worth the candle i know another young man who believed he could be happy by spending onethird of what he made and saving the other portion he said to me some day i want to marry and i want to treat my wife better if possible than she was treated at home i want to respect my fellow man i want to be a leader and i know i can only do so by saving a part of what i make it was my good pleasure a few weeks ago to visit the city where this young man is practising medicine he carried me over that town in an automobile he entertained me in his home he showed me other property which he owned ah his indeed was a happy home life to him was blessedly real a young man starts out in life with the determination to fight his way by physical force to the front ranks bruised disfigured or killed he is forced back even beyond the lines again a religiously inclined youth asked his pastor do you think it would be wrong for me to learn the noble art of selfdefense certainly not replied the pastor i learned it in youth myself and i have found it of great value in my life indeed sir did you learn the old english system or the sullivan system neither i learned solomons system replied the minister yes you will find it laid down in the first verse of the fifteenth chapter of proverbs a soft answer turneth away wrath it is the best system of selfdefense i know another young man starts life with a wrong idea regarding city and country life born in the country he is free his thoughts and ambitions can feed on a pure atmosphere but he thinks his conditions and his surroundings are circumscribed he longs for the city with its bigness its turmoil and its conflicts he leaves the old homestead the quiet village the country people and hies himself to the city he forgets to a large extent the good boy he used to be in the desire to keep up with the fashions and to make the people forget that he was once a country boy city life as is often the case breaks up his youth destroys his morals undermines his character steals his reputation and finally leaves the promising youth a wrecked man was the game worth the candle young men never be ashamed of the old logcabin in the country or the old bonnet your mother used to wear or the jean pants your father used to toil in i had rather be a poor country boy with limited surroundings and a pure heart than to be a city man bedecked in the latest fashions and weighted down with money having no morals no character i had rather have the religion and faith of my fathers than to have the highest offices i had rather have glorious life pure and lofty than to have great riches sir walter scott was right when he said sound sound the clarion fill the fife to all the sensual world proclaim one crowded hour of glorious life is worth an age without a name there are two old dutch words which have resounded through the world neen nimmer no never the fleets of spain heard it and understood it fully when they saw the sinking dutch ships with the flags nailed to the shattered mainmast crying neen nimmer which indicated that they would never surrender will the young men who are to be the leaders spend their hours in riotous living no never will they be false to duty no never will they shirk no never will they be disloyal to self to home to country and to god no never croesus was a rich man a king one day croesus said to solon the philosopher do you not think i am a happy man solon answered alas i do not know croesus that life is happy that ends well a few years later when croesus had lost his wealth his kingdom and his health and had been deserted by those who in his days of glory ran to do his slightest bidding croesus in anguish and misery exclaimed solon solon thou saidst truly that life is well and happy that ends well o black and unknown bards james weldon johnson o black and unknown bards of long ago how came your lips to touch the sacred fire how in your darkness did you come to know the power and beauty of the minstrels lyre who first from midst his bonds lifted his eyes who first from out the still watch lone and long feeling the ancient faith of prophets rise within his darkkept soul burst into song heart of what slave poured out such melody as steal away to jesus on its strains his

melodic sigh nobody knows de trouble i see what merely living clod what captive thing could up toward god through all its darkness grope and find within its deadened heart to sing these songs of

a race from wood and stone to christ the greatest menace of the south william j edwards in every age there are great and pressing problems to be solved perhaps no section of this country has been confronted with more difficult problems than the south i therefore wish to present what i consider to be the greatest menace of this section the one thing today in which we stand in greatest danger is the loss of the fertility of the soil if we should lose this as we are gradually doing then all is lost if we should save it then all other things will be added our great need is the conservation and preservation of the soil the increased crops which we have in the south occasionally are not due to improved methods of farming but to increased acreage thousands of acres of new land are added each year and our increase in farm production is due to the strength of these fresh lands there is not much more woodland to be taken in as new farm lands for this source has been well nigh exhausted we must then within a few years expect a gradual reduction in the farm production of the south already the old farm lands that have been in cultivation for the past fifty or fiftyfive years are practically worn out i have seen in my day where forty acres of land twenty or twentyfive years ago would produce from twenty to twentyfive bales of cotton each year and from to bushels of corn now these forty acres will not produce more than eight or nine bales of cotton and hardly enough corn to feed two horses in fact one small family cannot obtain a decent support from the land which twenty years ago supported three families in abundance this farm is not on the hillside neither has it been worn away by erosion it is situated in the lowlands in the black prairie and is considered the best farm on a large plantation this condition obtains in all parts of the south today this constant deterioration of land this gradual reduction of crops year after year if kept up for the next fifty years will surely prove disastrous to the south practically all the land in the black belt of the south is cultivated by negroes and the farm production has decreased so rapidly during the last ten or fifteen years that the average negro farmer hardly makes sufficient to pay his rent and buy the few necessaries of life of course here and there where a tenant has been lucky enough to get hold of some new land he makes a good crop but after three or four years of cultivation his crop begins to decrease and this decrease is kept up as long as he keeps the land instead of improving the tenants condition becomes worse each year until he finds it impossible to support his family on the farm farm after farm is being abandoned or given up to the care of the old men and women already most of these are too old and feeble to do effective work now the chief cause of these farms becoming less productive is the failure on the part of the farmers to add something to the land after they have gathered their crops they seem to think that the land contains an inexhaustible supply of plant food another cause is the failure of the farmer to rotate his crop there are farms being cultivated in the south today where the same piece of land has been planted in cotton every year for forty or fifty years forty years ago this same land would yield from one bale to one and a half per acre and today it will take from four to six acres to produce one bale still another cause for the deterioration of the soil is erosion there is no effort put forth on the tenants part to prevent his farm from washing away the hillside and other rolling lands are not terraced and after being in use four or five years practically all of these lands are washed away and as farm lands they are abandoned not only are the hillside lands unprotected from the beating rains and flowing streams but the bottom or lowlands are not properly drained and the sand washed down from the hill the chaff and raft from previous rains soon fill the ditches and creeks and almost any ordinary rain will cause an overflow of these streams under these conditions an average crop is impossible even in the best of years at present the south does not produce onehalf of the foodstuff that it consumes and if the present conditions of things continue for the next fifty years this section of the country will be on the verge of starvation and famines will be a frequent occurrence of course negro starvation will come first but white man starvation will surely follow i believe therefore that i am justified in saying that there is even more danger in negro starvation than there is in negro domination i have noticed in this country that the sins of the races are contagious if the negro in a community be lazy indifferent and careless about his farm the white man in the community will soon fall into the same habit on the other hand if the white man is smart industrious energetic and persevering in his general makeup the negro will soon fall into line so after all whatever helps one race in the south will help the other and whatever degrades one race in the south sooner or later will degrade the other but you may reply to this assertion by saying that the negro can go to the city and make an independent living for himself and family but you forget that all real wealth must come from the soil and that the city cannot prosper unless the country is prosperous when the country fails the city feels the effect when the country weeps the city moans when agriculture dies all die such are the conditions which face us today now for the remedy it is worth while to remember that there are ten essential elements of plant food if the supply of any one of the elements fails the crop will fail these ten elements are carbon and oxygen taken into the leaves of the plant from the air as carbon dioxide hydrogen a constituent of water absorbed through the plant roots nitrogen taken from the soil by all plants also secured from the air by legumes the other elements are phosphorus potassium magnesium calcium iron and sulphur all of which are secured from the soil the soil nitrogen is contained in the organic matter or humus and to maintain the supply of nitrogen we should keep the soil well stored with organic matter making liberal use of clover or other legumes which have power to secure nitrogen from the inexhaustible supply in the air it is interesting to note that one of the ablest chemists in this country prof e w clark of the united states geological survey has said that an acre of ground seven inches deep contains sufficient iron to produce one hundred bushels of corn every year for years sufficient calcium to produce one hundred bushels of corn or one bale of cotton each year for years enough magnesium to produce such a crop years enough sulphur for years and potassium for years but only enough phosphorus for years the nitrogen resting upon the surface of an acre of ground is sufficient to produce one hundred bushels of corn or a bale of cotton for years but only enough in the plowed soil to produce fifty such crops in other words there are enough of eight of the elements of plant food in the ordinary soil to produce bushels of corn per acre or a bale of cotton per acre for each year for years but only enough of the other two phosphorus and nitrogen to produce such crops for forty or fifty years let us grant that most of our farm lands in the south have been in cultivation for fifty or seventyfive years and in many instances for one hundred years it is readily seen that practically all of the phosphorus and nitrogen in the plowed soil have been exhausted is it any wonder then that we are having such poor crops the wonder is that our crops have kept up so well unless a radical change is made in our mode of farming we must expect less and less crops each year until we have no crops or such little that we can hardly pay the rent to improve and again make fertile our soils we must restore to them the phosphorus and nitrogen which have been used up in the seventyfive or more crops that we have gathered from them this is a herculean task but this is what confronts us and i for one believe we can accomplish it by the proper rotation of crops including oats clover cowpeas as well as cotton and corn and a liberal use of barnyard manure and cotton seed fertilizer all of the necessary elements of plant food can be restored to our wornout soil but the proper use of these requires much painstaking study if the negro is to remain the farming class in the black belt of the south then he must be taught at least the rudiments of the modern methods of improving farming he must have agricultural schools and must be encouraged to attend them the loss of the fertility of the soil is the greatest menace of the south how can we regain this lost fertility is the greatest question of the hour the enchanted shell h cordelia ray fair fragile una

you wish to travel fast i beg you not to fool with locomotion thats procured behind a georgia mule when i was teaching school in the backwoods of georgia i had one day to attend to some business in mudville an embryo city about eleven miles from my school now you must know that a country school teacher can do nothing without first consulting his board of trustees so i notified that honorable body that there was some business of vast importance to be attended to and asked them to meet me on friday afternoon they all promised to be on hand two hours bsun friday afternoon after school was dismissed they came in one by one until they had all gathered as the chairman called the meeting to order he said brederen de objick ob dis meeting is to consider de ways ob pervidin de means ob transposin de fessar to mudville now by the way the chairman of the board was undoubtedly intended by nature for a smart man he had a very strong weakness for using big words in the wrong place and thought it his special duty to impress the fessar at all times with his knowledge of the dictionary well after much debate it was finally decided that brudder whitesides would furnish de mule and brudder jinks de buggy and that i should start early the next morning the next morning i was up quite early because i wished to start as soon as possible in order to avoid the heat of the day i ate breakfast and waited six oclock seven oclock eight oclock and still that promised beast had not put in appearance knowing the proclivity of the mule to meander along as his own sweet will dictates especially when the sun shines hot i began to despair of reaching mudville at all that day but brudder jinks with whom i boarded seeing my melancholy state of mind offered to hitch up gypsy an antiquated specimen of the mule whose general appearance was that of the skeleton of some prehistoric animal one sees in a museum i accepted this proposition with haste and repented at leisure i could see a weary longsuffering look in that mules eye and i could imagine how his heart must have sought the vicinity of his tail when they disturbed his dreams of green fields and pleasant pastures and hitched him to an old buggy to encounter the stern realities of a dusty road verily verily i soliloquized the way of the mule is hard but putting aside all tender feelings i jumped into the buggy and grasping a stick of quite ample proportions began to urge his muleship on his way nothing of much consequence hampered our onward journey except the breaking down of three wheels and the excessive heat of the sun which great luminary seemed not more than ninetyfive miles away i arrived at mudville sometime between m and p m after having finished my business and having bountifully fed my mule on water and what grass he could nibble from around his hitching post i bought a large watermelon and started for home before i was out of sight of the town i began to have serious misgivings about reaching home before a very late hour in the morning by various admonitions and applications of the hickory i had been able to get my mule into a jog trot but on the homeward journey he would not even get up a respectable walk well we trudged on for two hours or more when to my dismay he stopped stopped still as the hour was getting late and it was growing dark i began advising him with the hickory that it was best to proceed but he seemed to have hardened his heart and his back also and paid me no heed there i sat all was as still as the grave save for the dismal hoot of the screechowl there i was five and a half miles from home with no prospect of getting there i began to coax my mule with some words which perhaps are not in the sabbath school books and to emphasize them with the rising and falling inflection of the stick across his back but still he moved not then all at once my conscience smote me i thought perhaps the faithful beast might be sick my mind reverted to balaam whose beast spoke to him when he had smitten him but three times and here i had smitten my beast about times i listened almost in expectation of hearing him say johnson johnson why smitest thou me times i got out of the buggy and looked at the mule he gazed at me with a sad faraway expression in his eye which sent pangs of remorse to my heart i thought of the cruel treatment i had given him and on the impulse of the moment i went to the buggy got out my large luscious melon burst it open and laid it on the ground before the poor animal and i firmly resolved to be a friend of the mule ever after and to join the humane society as soon as i reached atlanta as i watched that mule slowly munching away at my melon i began to wonder if i had not acted a little too hastily in giving it to him but i smothered that thought when i remembered the pledge i had just taken when he had finished he looked around with a satisfied air which encouraged me so i took hold of his bridle and after stroking him gently for a moment attempted to lead him off but he refused to be led he looked at me from under his shabby eyebrows but the sad faraway expression had vanished and in its stead there was a mischievous gleam born of malice aforethought i remonstrated with him but it only seemed to confirm his convictions that it was right for him to stand there i thought of my melon he had just devoured then i grew wrathy and right there and then renounced all my humane society resolutions and began to shower down on that mule torrents of abuse and hickory also but all to no effect instead of advancing he began to revance i pulled on the bridle until my hands and arms were sore but he only continued to back and pull me along with him when i stopped pulling he stopped backing and so things went on for the space of about half an hour i wondered what time it was just then the moon began to rise from which i knew it was about oclock my physical exertion began to tell on me and i hungered oh how i hungered for a piece of that watermelon and i hit the mule an extra blow as a result of those longings i was now desperate i sat down on the side of the road and groaned that groan came from the depths of my soul and i know that i presented a perfect picture of despair however i determined to gather all my remaining strength for one final effort so i caressed him up and down the backbone two or three times as a sort of persuader then grasping the bridle with both hands i began to pull pull as i had never pulled before and as i never hope to pull again and he began to back i continued to pull and he continued to back how long this order of things might have gone on i do not know but just then a brilliant idea struck me so forcibly as to come near knocking me down i took the mule out and by various tying buckling and tangling i hitched him up again upside down or wrong side out or well i cant exactly explain but anyhow when i got through his tail pointed in the direction i wanted him to go then i got back in the buggy and taking hold of the bridle began to pull and he began to back and i continued to pull and he continued to back and will you believe me that mule backed all the way home it is true we did not travel very fast but every time he would slow down i would put a little extra force into my pull and he would put a little extra speed into his back ever and anon he would glance at me with that mischievous malicious twinkle which seemed to say ive got you tonight and i would smile back a quiet selfsatisfied smile and give an extra pull but when we got home that mischievous malicious twinkle changed and he looked at me in a dazed sort of way and i smiled back quite audibly and do you know that mule has been in a dark brown study ever since he is trying to get through his slow brain how i managed to make him pull me home that night as i jumped out of the buggy the clock struck twelve and there at that solemn hour of the night as the pale moon shed her silvery beams all around and as the bright stars peeped down upon me from the ethereal blue and the gentle zephyrs wafted to me the odor of a hogpen in the near distance i vowed a vow an awful vow that so long as i breathed the vital air never no never again would i attempt to drive a georgia mule hayti and toussaint louverture w e b dubois it was in the island of hayti that french slavery centered pirates from many nations but chiefly french began to frequent the island and in the french annexed the eastern part thus dividing the island between france and spain by there were so many slaves and mulattoes that louis xiv issued his celebrated code noir which was notable in compelling bachelor masters fathers of slave children to marry their concubines children followed the condition of the mother as to slavery or freedom they could have no property harsh punishments were provided for but families could not be separated by sale except in the case of grown children emancipation with full civil rights was made possible for any slave twenty years of age or more when louisiana was settled and the alabama coast slaves were introduced there louisiana was transferred to spain in against the resistance of both settlers and slaves but spain took possession in and introduced more negroes later in hayti a more liberal policy encouraged trade war was over and capital and slaves poured in sugar coffee chocolate indigo dyes and spices were raised there were large numbers of mulattoes many of whom were educated in france and many masters married negro women who had inherited large properties just as in the united states today white men are marrying eagerly the landed indian women in the west when white immigration increased in however prejudice arose against these mulattoes and severe laws were passed depriving them of civil rights entrance into the professions and the right to hold office severe edicts were enforced as to clothing names and social intercourse finally after mulattoes were forbidden to come to france when the french revolution broke out the haytians managed to send two delegates to paris nevertheless the planters maintained the upper hand and one of the colored delegates oge on returning started a small rebellion he and his companions were killed with great brutality this led the french government to grant full civil rights to free negroes immediately planters and free negroes flew to arms against each other and then suddenly august the black slaves of whom there were four hundred and fiftytwo thousand arose in revolt to help the free negroes for many years runaway slaves under their own chiefs had hidden in the mountains one of the earliest of these chiefs was polydor in who was succeeded by macandal the great chief of these runaways or maroons at the time of the slave revolt was jean franзois who was soon succeeded by biassou pierre dominic toussaint known as toussaint louverture joined these maroon bands where he was called the doctor of the armies of the king and soon became chief aid to jean franзois and biassou upon their deaths toussaint rose to the chief command he acquired complete control over the blacks not only in military matters but in politics and social organization the soldiers regarded him as a superior being and the farmers prostrated themselves before him all his generals trembled before him dessalines did not dare to look in his face and all the world trembled before his generals the revolt once started blacks and mulattoes murdered whites without mercy and the whites retaliated commissioners were sent from france who asked simply civil rights for freedmen and not emancipation indeed that was all that toussaint himself had as yet demanded the planters intrigued with the british and this together with the beheading of the king an impious act in the eyes of negroes induced toussaint to join the spaniards in british troops were landed and the french commissioners in desperation declared the slaves emancipated this at once won back toussaint from the spaniards he became supreme in the north while rigaud leader of the mulattoes held the south and the west by the british having lost most of their forces by yellow fever surrendered mole st nicholas to toussaint and departed rigaud finally left for france and toussaint in was master of hayti he promulgated a constitution under which hayti was to be a selfgoverning colony all men were equal before the law and trade was practically free toussaint was to be president for life with the power to name his successor napoleon bonaparte master of france had at this time dreams of a great american empire and replied to toussaints new government by sending twentyfive thousand men under his brotherinlaw to subdue the presumptuous negroes as a preliminary step to his occupation and development of the mississippi valley fierce fighting and yellow fever decimated the french but matters went hard with the negroes too and toussaint finally offered to yield he was courteously received with military honors and then as soon as possible treacherously seized bound and sent to france he was imprisoned at fort joux and died perhaps of poison after studied humiliations april thus perished the greatest of american negroes and one of the great men of all time at the age of fiftysix a french planter said god in his terrestrial globe did not commune with a purer spirit wendell phillips said some doubt the courage of the negro go to hayti and stand on those fifty thousand graves of the best soldiers france ever had and ask them what they think of the negros sword i would call him napoleon but napoleon made his way to empire over broken oaths and through a sea of blood this man never broke his word i would call him cromwell but cromwell was only a soldier and the state he founded went down with him into his grave i would call him washington but the great virginian held slaves this man risked his empire rather than permit the slave trade in the humblest village of his dominions you think me a fanatic for you read history not with your eyes but with your prejudices but fifty years hence when truth gets a hearing the muse of history will put phocion for the greek brutus for the roman hampden for the english la fayette for france choose washington as the bright consummate flower of our earlier civilization then dipping her pen in the sunlight will write in the clear blue above them all the name of the soldier the statesman the martyr toussaint louverture the treacherous killing of toussaint did not conquer hayti in and some forty thousand french soldiers died of war and fever a new colored leader dessalines arose and all the eight thousand remaining french surrendered to the blockading british fleet the effect of all this was farreaching napoleon gave up his dream of american empire and sold louisiana for a song thus all of indian territory all of kansas and nebraska and iowa and wyoming and montana and the dakotas and most of colorado and minnesota and all of washington and oregon states came to us as the indirect work of a despised negro praise if you will the work of a robert livingstone or a jefferson but today let us not forget our debt to toussaint louverture who was indirectly the means of americas expansion by the louisiana purchase of his motto lottie burrell dixon but i cant leave my business affairs and go off on a fishing trip now the friend and specialist who had tricked john durmont into a confession of physical bankruptcy and made him submit to an examination in spite of himself now sat back with an i wash my hands of you gesture very well you can either go to maine now at once or youll go to well as im only your spiritual adviser my prognostications as to your ultimate destination would probably have very little weight with you oh well if you are so sure i suppose i can cut loose now if it comes to a choice like that the doctor smiled his satisfaction so you prefer to bear the ills of new york than to fly to others you know not of eh oh have a little mercy on shakespeare at least ill go and thus it was that a week later found durmont as deep in the maine woods as he could get and still be within reach of a telegraph wire and much to his surprise he found he liked it as he lay stretched at full length on the soft turf the breath of the pines filled his lungs the lure of the lake made him eager to get to his fishing tackle and he admitted to himself that a man needed just such a holiday as this in order to keep his mental and physical balance returning to the gaily painted frame building called by courtesy the hotel which nestled among the pines he met the youthful operator from the nearby station looking for him with a message from his broker a complicated situation had arisen in amalgamated copper and an immediate answer was needed durmont had heavy investments in copper though his business was the manufacture of electrical instruments he walked back to the office with the operator while pondering the answer then having written it handed it to the operator saying tell them to rush answer the tall lank youth whose every movement was a protest against being hurried dragged himself over to the telegraph key s open whats open wire well is that the only wire you have yep what in the world am i going to do about this message dunno maybe it will close bimeby and the young lightning slinger pulled towards him a lurid tale of the wild west and proceeded to enjoy himself and meanwhile what do you suppose is going to happen to me thundered durmont havent you ambition enough to look around your wire and see if you can find the trouble linemans paid to look up trouble im not was the surly answer durmont was furious but what he was about to say was cut off by a quiet voice at his elbow i noticed linemen repairing wires upon the main road thats where this wire is open if you have any message you are in a hurry to send perhaps i can help you out durmont turned to see a colored boy of fifteen whose entrance he had not noticed what can you do about it he asked contemptuously take it into town in an ox team i can send it by wireless if that is sufficiently quick durmont turned to the operator at the table is there a wireless near here he owns one youll have to do business with him on that said the youth with a grin at durmonts unconcealed prejudice it would be hard to estimate the exact amount of respect mingled with surprise with which the city man now looked at the boy whose information he had evidently doubted till confirmed by the white boy suppose youve got some kind of tomfool contraption that will take half a day to get a message into the next village here i stand to lose several thousands because this blame company runs only one wire down to this camp where is this apparatus of yours might as well look at it while im waiting for this onewire office to get into commission again its right up on top of the hill answered the colored boy here george i brought down this wireless book if you want to look it over its better worth reading than that stuff you have there and tossing a book on the table he went out followed by durmont a couple of minutes walk brought them in sight of the sixtyfoot aerial erected on the top of a small shack not much to look at but i made it all myself illustration his motto how did you happen to construct this and durmont really tried to keep the emphasis off the you well im interested in all kinds of electrical experiments and have kept up reading and studying ever since i left school then when i came out here on my uncles farm he let me rig up this wireless and i can talk to a chum of mine down in the city and when i saw the wire at the station was gone up i thought i might possibly get your message to new york through him they had entered the oneroom shack which contained a long table holding a wireless outfit a couple of chairs and a shelf of books on the walls were tacked pictures of aviators and drawings of aeroplanes a threefoot model of a biplane hung in a corner now if he is only in said the boy going over to the table and giving the call hes there he said eagerly holding out his hand for the message durmont handed it to him his face still held the look of doubt and unbelief as he looked at the crude homemade instruments suppose i might as well have hired a horse and taken it into town but the sputtering wire drowned his voice and get on your wheel and go like blazes tell em to rush answer this guy here thinks a colored boy is only an animated shoeblacking outfit its up to us to remedy that defect in his education see thus sang the wires as durmont paced the floor i said began the nervous man as the wires became quiet i again the wire sputtered and he couldnt hear himself talk when it was quiet he tried again but as soon as he began to grumble the wire began to sputter he glanced suspiciously at the boy but the latter was earnestly watching his instruments say shouted durmont does that thing have to keep up that confounded racket all the time i had to give him some instructions you know and also keep in adjustment well ill get out of adjustment myself if that keeps up durmont resigned himself to silence and strangely enough so did the wire walking around the room he noticed over the shelf of books a large white sheet on which was printed in gilt letters i will study and make ready and maybe my chance will come abraham lincoln durmont read this and then looked at the boy as if seeing him for the first time again he looked at the words and far beyond them he saw his own struggling boyhood climbing daily lifes slippery path trying to find some hold by which to pull himself up and as he watched the brownskinned boy bending over the instruments instinct told him here was one who would find it still harder to fight his way up because of caste ah the exclamation startled him the boy with phones adjusted was busily writing well has that partner of yours got that message down at his end yet yes sir and here is your answer from new york why its only been half an hour since i wrote it said durmont yes that horse wouldnt have got into town yet grinned the boy durmont snatched the paper read it threw his cap in the air exclaiming the day is saved boy youre a winner how much putting his hand in his pocket suggestively how much you owe to my help i dont know answered the lad sagely i offered to help you because you needed it and i was glad of the chance to prove what i believed i could do im satisfied because i succeeded durmont sat down heavily on the other chair his nerves couldnt stand much more in one afternoon to find himself threatened with a large financial loss to have this averted by the help of the scientific knowledge of a colored boy and that boy rating the fact of his success higher than any pecuniary compensation he had to pull himself together a bit his eyes fell on the motto on the wall he read it thoughtfully considered how hard the boy had worked because of that his hopes of the future based on that saw the human element in him as it had not appealed to him before and then turning something over in his mind muttered to himself its nobodys business if i do he got up and walking over to the boy said whats your name robert hilton well robert that motto youve got up there is a pretty good one to tie to you certainly have studied you have made yourself ready as far as your resources will permit and ill be hanged if i dont stand for the chance in the manufacturing of electrical instruments you could have great opportunity for inventive talent and in my concern you shall have your chance and go as far as your efficiency will carry you what do you say would you care for it id care for it more than any other thing on earth and am very grateful for the chance the chance wouldnt be standing here now if you had not had the inclination and the determination to live up to those words on the wall the months h cordelia ray january to herald in another year with rhythmic note the

will ring to hail the heavenly king the colored cadet at west point lieut henry ossian flipper u s a may th auspicious day from the deck of the little ferryboat that steamed its way across from garrisons on that eventful afternoon i viewed the hills about west point her stone structures perched thereon thus rising still higher as if providing access to the very pinnacle of fame and shuddered with my mind full of the horrors of the treatment of all former cadets of color and the dread of inevitable ostracism i approached tremblingly yet confidently the little vessel having been moored i stepped ashore and inquired of a soldier there where candidates should report he very kindly gave me all information wished me much success for which i thanked him and set out for the designated place i soon reached it and walked directly into the adjutants office he received me kindly asked for my certificate of appointment and receiving that or assurance that i had it i do not remember which directed me to write in a book there for the purpose the name and occupation of my father the state congressional district county and city of his residence my own full name age state county and place of my birth and my occupation when at home this done i was sent in charge of an orderly to cadet barracks where my plebe quarters were assigned me the impression made upon me by what i saw while going from the adjutants office to barracks was certainly not very encouraging the rear windows were crowded with cadets watching my unpretending passage of the area of barracks with apparently as much astonishment and interest as they would perhaps have watched hannibal crossing the alps their words and jeers were most insulting having reached another office i was shown in by the orderly i walked in hat in hand nay rather started in when three cadets who were seated in the room simultaneously sprang to their feet and welcomed me somewhat after this fashion well sir what do you mean by coming into this office in that manner sir get out of here sir i walked out followed by one of them who in a similar strain ordered me to button my coat get my hands around fins he said heels together and head up now sir said he leaving me when you are ready to come in knock at that door emphasizing the word knock the door was open i knocked he replied come in i went in i took my position in front of and facing him my heels together head up the palms of my hands to the front and my little fingers on the seams of my pantaloons in which position we habitually carried them after correcting my position and making it sufficiently military to suit himself one of them in a much milder tone asked what i desired of them i told him i had been sent by the adjutant to report there he arose and directing me to follow him conducted me to the bathrooms having discharged the necessary duty there i returned and was again put in charge of the orderly who carried me to the hospital there i was subjected to a rigid physical examination which i stood with the greatest ease i was given a certificate of ability by the surgeon and by him sent again to the adjutant who in turn sent me to the treasurer from him i returned alone to barracks the reception given to plebes upon reporting is often very much more severe than that given me even members of my own class can testify to this this reception has however i think been best described in an anonymous work where it is thus set forth how dare you come into the presence of your superior officer in that grossly careless and unmilitary manner ill have you imprisoned stand attention sir even louder than before heelstogetherandonthesameline toesequallyturnedout littlefingersontheseamsofyourpantaloons buttonyourcoat drawinyourchin throwoutyourchest castyoureyesfifteenpacestothefront dontletmeseeyouwearingstandingcollarsagain standsteady sir youve evidently mistaken your profession sir in any other service or at the seat of war sir you would have been shot sir without trial sir for such conduct sir the effect of such words can be easily imagined a plebe will at once recognize the necessity for absolute obedience even if he does know all this is hazing and that it is doubtless forbidden still plebes almost invariably tremble while it lasts and when in their own quarters laugh over it and even practise it upon each other for mutual amusement on the way to barracks i met the squad of beasts marching to dinner i was ordered to fall in did so marched to the mess hall and ate my first dinner at west point after dinner we were again marched to barracks and dismissed i hastened to my quarters and a short while after was turned out to take possession of my baggage i lugged it into my room was shown the directions on the back of the door for arrangement of articles and ordered to obey them within half an hour at the end of the time specified every article was arranged and the cadet corporal returned to inspect he walked deliberately to the clothespress and informing me that everything was arranged wrong threw every article upon the floor repeated his order and withdrew and thus three times in less than two hours did i arrange and he disarrange my effects i was not troubled again by him till after supper when he inspected again merely opening the door however and looking in he told me i could not go to sleep till tattoo now tattoo as he evidently used it referred in some manner to time and with such reference i had not the remotest idea of what it meant i had no knowledge whatever of military terms or customs however as i was also told that i could do anything writing etc i might wish to do i found sufficient to keep me awake until he again returned and told me it was then tattoo that i could retire then or at any time within half an hour and that at the end of that time the light must be extinguished and i must be in bed i instantly extinguished it and retired thus passed my first half

aurora rise going to school under difficulties william h holtzclaw when i was four years old i was put to work on the farm that is at such work as i could do such as riding a deaf and blind mule while my brother held the plow when i was six years old my fouryearold brother and i had to go two miles through a lonely forest every morning in order to carry my fathers breakfast and dinner to a sawmill where he was hauling logs for sixty cents a day the white man frank weathers who employed a large number of hands both negroes and whites was considered one of the best and most upright men in that section of the country in those days there were no public schools in that part of the country for the negroes indeed public schools for whites were just beginning to be established this man set aside a little house in the neighborhood of the sawmill employed a teacher and urged all the negroes to send their children to this school not a great many of them however took advantage of his generosity for this was at the time when everybody seemed to think that the negros only hope was in politics but my father and mother had great faith in education and they were determined that their children should have that blessing of which they themselves had been deprived soon however mr weathers had cut all the timber that he could get in that section and he therefore moved his mills to another district this left us without a school but my father was not to be outdone he called a meeting of the men in that community and they agreed to build a schoolhouse themselves they went to the forest and cut pine poles about eight inches in diameter split them in halves and carried them on their shoulders to a nice shady spot and there erected a little schoolhouse the benches were made of the same material and there was no floor nor chimney some of the other boys trousers suffered when they sat on the new pine benches which exuded rosin but i had an advantage of them in this respect for i wore only a shirt in fact i never wore trousers until i got to be so large that the white neighbors complained of my insufficient clothes at the end of the first school year there was a trying time in our family on this occasion the teacher ordered all the pupils to appear dressed in white we had no white clothes nor many of any other sort for that matter father and mother discussed our predicament nearly all one night father said it was foolish to buy clothes which could be used for that occasion only but my ever resourceful mother was still determined that her children should look as well on this important occasion as any of our neighbors however when we went to bed the night before the exhibition we still had no white clothes and no cloth from which to make them nevertheless when we awoke the next morning all three of us had beautiful white suits it came about in this way my mother had a beautiful white sunday petticoat which she had cut up and made into suits for us as there is just so much cloth in a petticoat and no more the stuff had to be cut close to cover all of us children and as the petticoat had been worn several times and was therefore likely to tear we had to be very careful how we stooped in moving about the stage lest there should be a general splitting and tearing with consequences that we were afraid to imagine at the exhibitions the next night we said our little pieces and i suppose we looked about as well as the others at least we thought so and that was sufficient one thing i am sure of there was no mother there who was prouder of her children than ours the thing that made her so pleased was the fact that my speech made such an impression that our white landlord lifted me off the stage when i had finished speaking and gave me a quarter of a dollar if there happened to be a school in the winter time i had sometimes to go barefooted and always with scant clothing our landlady was very kind in such cases she would give me clothes that had already been worn by her sons and in turn i would bring broom straw from the sedges with which she made her brooms in this way i usually got enough clothes to keep me warm illustration so with my mothers encouragement i went to school in spite of my bare feet often the ground would be frozen and often there would be snow my feet would crack and bleed freely but when i reached home mother would have a tub full of hot water ready to plunge me into and thaw me out although this caused my feet and legs to swell it usually got me into shape for school the next day i remember once when i had helped lay by the crops at home and was ready to enter the little onemonth school it was decided that i could not go because i had no hat my mother told me that if i could catch a coon and cure the skin she would make me a cap out of that material that night i went far into the forest with my hounds and finally located a coon the coon was a mighty fighter and when he had driven off all my dogs i saw that the only chance for me to get a cap was to whip the coon myself so together with the dogs i went at him and finally we conquered him the next week i went to school wearing my new coonskin cap exertions of this kind from time to time strengthened my will and my body and prepared me for more trying tests which were to come later as i grew older it became more and more difficult for me to go to school when cotton first began to open early in the fall it brought a higher price than at any other time of the year at this time the landlord wanted us all to stop school and pick cotton but mother wanted me to remain in school so when the landlord came to the quarters early in the morning to stir up the cotton pickers she used to outgeneral him by hiding me behind the skillets ovens and pots throwing some old rags over me until he was gone then she would slip me off to school through the back way i can see her now with her hands upon my shoulder shoving me along through the woods and underbrush in a roundabout way keeping me all the time out of sight of the great plantation until we reached the point a mile away from home where we came to the public road there my mother would bid me goodbye whereupon she would return to the plantation and try to make up to the landlord for the work of us both in the field as cotton pickers the brave son alston w burleigh a little boy lost in

temper of yours if you dont were lost dawson varsity coach of bliss university affectionately known and revered by two thousand undergraduates as skipper bill sat in the locker room with his arm around ted robertsons shoulders star halfback and punter of the varsity eleven around them moved the other varsity players substitutes second string men trainers and rubbers in the stands overhead every seat was taken for these were the last few minutes before the big game of the year the annual battle with sloan college on one side the sober blues and grays and blacks formed a background for huge yellow chrysanthemums and light blue ribbons the bliss colors and the same background in the stands opposite set off the crimson of sloan college the rival college bands of the two most important colored universities of the united states blared almost unheeded in the din while agile cheerleaders clad in white from head to foot performed gymnastics in leading rolling volumes of cheers all were in that tense nervegripping mood prior to that game in which victory or defeat meant success or failure of the seasons efforts of the teams of young giants that represented the two schools in the locker room however a different scene was being enacted every man was acting according to his own temperament and each in his own way attempted to hide the anxious thrill that every real football player feels before the big game jimmy murray quarterback and thrower of forward passes par excellence nervously tied and untied his shoe laces a dozen times tiny marshall left tackle who weighed two hundred and ten pounds tried to whistle nonchalantly and failed miserably while bull bascom fullback the only calm man in the room was carefully adjusting his shoulder pads around them hovered the odor of arnica and liniment mixed with the familiar tang of perspiration which has dried in woolen jerseys perspiration that marked many a long and wearisome hour of training and perfection of the machine that today received its final exam ted robertson the man around whom most of the teams offense was built sat listening to dawsons advice born with a fiery almost unmanageable temper his reckless dauntless spirit had made him a terror to opposing teams strong was the line that could check his plunges and fleet were the ends who could tackle him when once he got loose in an open field recognizing his phenomenal ability both coach and players gave him the credit due him and consciously or unconsciously relied on him as the teams best player but today sloan had declared that they were going to put robertson out of the game and threats had been freely uttered that before the game had been going very long he would be in the hospital this news added to the tenseness of feeling if robertson should be put out of the game or if he should lose his temper the chances of a victory for bliss were slim indeed for rarely had two teams been so evenly matched in skill and brain and brawn thus the final pleading of dawson to robertson to hold that temper a roar of cheers greeted their ears as the red jerseyed sloan team took the field led by murray the bliss players were likewise greeted by a storm of applause as they trotted out on the field and the varsity started through a brisk signal drill in a few minutes the referee called the rival captains to the center of the field sloan won the toss and elected to defend the south goal kicking off with the wind behind its back a breathless hush the shrill whistle of the referee the thump of cleated shoe against the ball and the game was on the teams wonderfully even in strength and in knowledge of the game surged back and forth the ball repeatedly changing hands as one team would hold the other for downs from the kickoff the sloan players began their attempts to injure or anger robertson vicious remarks were aimed at him while the referee was not near enough to hear when robertson carried the ball and after he was downed under a mass of players a fist would thud against his jaw or hard knuckles would be rubbed across his nose once when an opposing player had fallen across robertsons right leg another of his opponents seized his ankle and turned it though he fought against it his temper was slowly but surely slipping away from him for three hectic quarters with the tide of victory or defeat now surging towards bliss now towards sloan the battle raged as play after play of brilliance or superbrilliance flashed forth the stands alternately groaned or cheered according to the sympathies of each robertson a veritable stonewall of defense time and again checked the rushes of the sloan backs or threw himself recklessly at fleet backs on end runs when his own ends had failed to get their man on the offensive he repeatedly was called on to carry the ball and seldom did he fail to make the distance required a great weariness settled on robertson and it was with difficulty that he was able to fight off a numbness and dizziness that almost overcame him one thing sustained him it was a bitter resentment against those who sought to hurt him the fires within him had grown until they became a flaming devastating thing that burned its way into his brain it needed only a spark to make him forget the game school the coach and everything else yet even as he realized this he knew that if he did lose his temper bliss might as well concede the victory to sloan it was not conceit that caused him to know this and admit it but the clearness of vision that comes ofttimes in a moment of greatest mental strain finally with the score still tied neither side having scored the time keeper warned the rival teams that only three minutes remained for play his warning served to cause a tightening of muscles and a grimness of countenance in a last final effort to put over a score and avert a tied score the huge crowd prayed fervently for a score a touchdown a safety a goal from field or placement anything it was sloans ball on blisss fortyfiveyard line only a fumble or some fluke could cause a score every player was on his mettle burning with anxiety to get his hands on that ball and scamper down the field to a touchdown and everlasting fame in the annals of his schools football history in a last desperate effort the bliss quarterback called a trick play it started out like a quarterback run around left end the bliss left end ran straight down the field after delaying the man playing opposite him when the bliss quarter had made a wide run drawing in the sloan secondary defense he turned and like a flash shot a long forward pass over the heads of the incoming sloan backfield to the end who had gone straight down the field and who was practically free of danger of being tackled by any of the sloan backs too late the sloan players saw the ruse only robertson was between the swift running end and a score with grim satisfaction his face streaked with perspiration drawn and weary with the long hard struggle and the yeoman part he had played in it robertson saw that the man with the ball was the one player on the opposing side who had done most of the unfair playing in trying to put robertson out of the game all of the bitterness all of the anger in his heart swelled up and he determined to overtake the end prevent the score and tackle the man so viciously that he would be certain to break an arm or a leg robertson dug his cleats in the spongy turf with a phenomenal burst of speed rapidly overtook his man driving him meanwhile towards the sidelines at last the moment came by making a flying tackle which would be illegal but which he hoped the referee would not see robertson could get his man and get him in such fashion that he would have no chance of escaping injury robertson crouched for the spring a fierce light came into his eyes in a flash he saw the end whom he now hated with an intensity that wiped every thought from his mind except that of revenge lying prone on the ground but even as he gloated over his revenge the words of bill dawson came to him hold that maneating temper of yours in a lightninglike conflict the impulse to injure fought a desperate battle with the instinct of clean playing his decision was made in a moment instead of making the vicious flying tackle he ran all the faster but the end was too swift and had too great a lead amid the frantically jubilant shouts of the bliss rooters and the painful silence of the sloan supporters the end went across the line for a touchdown just as time was up a gloom pervaded the dressing rooms of the sloan team after the game robertson was in disgrace forgotten was the playing through most of the game forgotten were his desperate tackles that had saved the game more than once forgotten were the long runs and the hard line plunges that time and again had made first downs for his team only the fact that he had apparently failed in the last minute remained only dawson and robertson knew that it was not cowardice that most detested of all things in athletics in life itself had caused robertson to refuse to make that last dangerous illegal flying tackle but in the heart of robertson there was a strange peace being human he naturally resented the discernible thoughts in the minds of his comrades of many a hardfought battle but a calmness made him forgetful of all this for he knew that at last in a moment of the supreme test he had conquered that which had been his master throughout all of his life his temper all the slurs and coldness in the world could not rob him of the satisfaction of this the dog and the clever rabbit a o stafford there were many days when the animals did not think about the kingship they thought of their games and their tricks and would play them from the rising to the setting of the sun now at that time the little rabbit was known as a very clever fellow his tricks his schemes and his funny little ways caused much mischief and at times much anger among his woodland cousins at last the wolf made up his mind to catch him and give him a severe punishment for the many tricks he had played upon him knowing that the rabbit could run faster than he the wolf called at the home of the dog to seek his aid brother dog frisky little rabbit must be caught and punished for a nice bone will you help me asked the wolf certainly my good friend answered the dog thinking of the promised bone be very careful the rabbit is very clever said the wolf as he left a day or so later while passing through the woods the dog saw the rabbit frisking in the tall grass quick as a flash the dog started after him the little fellow ran and to save himself jumped into the hollow of an oak tree the opening was too small for the other to follow and as he looked in he heard only the merry laugh of the frisky rabbit hee hee hello mr dog you cant see me never mind boy i will get you yet barked the angry dog a short distance from the tree a goose was seen moving around looking for her dinner come friend goose watch the hollow of this tree while i go and get some moss and fire to smoke out this scamp of a rabbit spoke the dog remembering the advice of the wolf of course ill watch for he has played many of his schemes upon me returned the bird when the dog left the rabbit called out from his hiding place how can you watch friend goose when you cant see me well i will see you then she replied with these words she pushed her long neck into the hollow of the tree as the neck of the goose went into the opening the rabbit threw the dust of some dry wood into her eyes oh oh you little scamp you have made me blind cried out the bird in pain illustration then while the goose was trying to get the dust from her eyes the rabbit jumped out and scampered away in a short while the dog returned with the moss and fire filled the opening and as he watched the smoke arise barked with glee now i have you my tricky friend now i have you but as no rabbit ran out the dog turned to the goose and saw from her red streaming eyes that something was wrong where is the rabbit friend goose he quickly asked why he threw wood dust into my eyes when i peeped into the opening at once the dog knew that the rabbit had escaped and became very angry you silly goose you foolish bird with web feet i will kill you now for such folly with these words the dog sprang for the goose but only a small feather was caught in his mouth as the frightened bird rose high in the air and flew away the boy and the ideal joseph s cotter once upon a time a mule a hog a snake and a boy met said the mule i eat and labor that i may grow strong in the heels it is fine to have heels so gifted my heels make people cultivate distance said the hog i eat and labor that i may grow strong in the snout it is fine to have a fine snout i keep people watching for my snout no exchanging heels for snouts broke in the mule no answered the hog snouts are naturally above heels said the snake i eat to live and live to cultivate my sting the way people shun me shows my greatness beget stings comrades and stings will beget glory said the boy there is a star in my life like unto a star in the sky i eat and labor that i may think aright and feel aright these rounds will conduct me to my star oh inviting star i am not so certain of that said the mule i have noticed your kind and ever see some of myself in them your star is in the distance the boy answered by smelling a flower and listening to the song of a bird the mule looked at him and said he is all tenderness and care the true and the beautiful have robbed me of a kinsman his star is near said the boy i approach my star i am not so certain of that interrupted the hog i have noticed your kind and i ever see some of myself in them your star is a delusion the boy answered by painting the flower and setting the notes of the birds song to music the hog looked at the boy and said his soul is attuned by nature the meddler in him is slain i can all but touch my star cried the boy i am not so certain of that remarked the snake i have watched your kind and ever see some of myself in them stings are nearer than stars the boy answered by meditating upon the picture and music the snake departed saying that stings and stars cannot keep company the boy journeyed on ever led by the star some distance away the mule was bemoaning the presence of his heels and trying to rid himself of them by kicking a tree the hog was dividing his time between looking into a brook and rubbing his snout on a rock to shorten it the snake lay dead of its own bite the boy journeyed on led by an ever inviting star children at easter c emily frazier that day in old jerusalem when christ our lord was slain i wonder if the

was american through and through there was not one foreign element in his bringing up he was an unmixed child of the western plains born in the south reared in the north most of the presidents before him being reared nearer the atlantic had imbibed more or less of eastern culture and had european airs this man lincoln was so thoroughly democratic as to astonish both old and new england he never acted the president and was always a man among men the honored servant of the people from a fivedollar fee before a justice of the peace he had risen to a fivethousanddollar fee before the supreme court of illinois from a study of dilworths spelling book in his seventh year he had risen to write in his fiftyseventh year his second inaugural which is the greatest utterance of man and yet all of his days in school added together are less than one year his pioneer life had given him a vein of humor which became his lifepreserver in times of stress it had also given him a love for human liberty that was unaffected he felt that the enslavement of some men was but the advance guard the miner and sapper of the enslavement of all men from a poor captain of volunteers in the scandalous little black hawk war where he jokingly said he bled died and came away although he never had a skirmish nor saw an indian he had risen to the chief command in a war that numbered three thousand battles and skirmishes and cost three billion dollars having no ancestry himself being able to trace his line by rumor and tradition only as far back as his grandfather he became like george washington the father of his country born of a father who could not write his name he himself had written the proclamation of emancipation the fourth great state paper in the history of the anglosaxon race the others being magna charta the declaration of independence and the constitution if we accept the statement of cicero that the days on which we are saved should be as illustrious as the days on which we are born then lincoln the savior must always remain coцrdinate with washington the father of his country jackson was old hickory taylor was old rough and there have been various names given to the other presidents but washington and lincoln were the only ones whom the american people styled father child of the american soil cradled and nursed in the very bosom of nature he loved his country with the passion with which most men love their human mothers he could not bear the thought of one iota of detraction from her honor her dignity or her welfare against her dismemberment he was willing to fight to the end of his second administration or till the end of time he might tolerate anything else except disunion even the right of some of his fellowmen to enslave others of every concession which he made during his administration to friend or foe the sine qua non was union a house divided against itself cannot stand in this he left us a great heritage it is a lesson for both sections and all races of any section white men of america black men of america by the eternal god of heaven there can be no division of destiny on the same soil and in the bosom and in the lap of the same natural mother men may attempt and accomplish discrimination in a small way but almighty god and allmothering nature are absolutely impartial they have woven the fabric of life so that the thread of each mans existence is a part of the whole he who sets fire to his neighbors house endangers the existence of his own he who degrades his neighbors children undermines the future of his own together we rise and together we fall is the plan of god and the rule of nature we must lean together in the common struggle of life the syncline is stronger than the anticline in a great nation with an increasing fame the lesson of lincolns life must grow in importance as long as the human heart loves freedom his name will be a word on the tongues of men his name will be a watchword wherever liberty in her struggles with tyranny lifts her embattled banners no man of the ancient or the modern world has a securer place in the hearts and memories of men than this man lincoln who was born in obscurity who

how i escaped frederick douglass although slavery was a delicate subject and very cautiously talked about among grownup people in maryland i frequently talked about it and that very freely with the white boys i would sometimes say to them while seated on a curbstone or a cellar door i wish i could be free as you will be when you get to be men you will be free you know as soon as you are twentyone and can go where you like but i am a slave for life have i not as good a right to be free as you have words like these i observed always troubled them and i had no small satisfaction in drawing out from them as i occasionally did that fresh and bitter condemnation of slavery which ever springs from natures unseared and unperverted of all consciences let me have those to deal with which have not been seared and bewildered with the cares and perplexities of life i do not remember ever to have met with a boy while i was in slavery who defended the system but i do remember many times when i was consoled by them and by them encouraged to hope that something would yet occur by which i would be made free over and over again they have told me that they believed i had as good a right to be free as they had and that they did not believe god ever made any one to be a slave on monday the third day of september in accordance with my resolution i bade farewell to the city of baltimore and to slavery my success was due to address rather than courage to good luck rather than bravery my means of escape were provided for me by the very men who were making laws to hold and bind me more securely in slavery it was the custom in the state of maryland to require of the free colored people to have what were called free papers this instrument they were required to renew very often and by charging a fee for this writing considerable sums from time to time were collected by the state in these papers the name age color height and form of the free man were described together with any scars or other marks upon his person now more than one man could be found to answer the same general description hence many slaves could escape by impersonating the owner of one set of papers and this was often done as follows a slave nearly or sufficiently answering the description set forth in the papers would borrow or hire them till he could by their means escape to a free state and then by mail or otherwise return them to the owner the operation was a hazardous one for the lender as well as the borrower a failure on the part of the fugitive to send back the papers would imperil his benefactor and the discovery of the papers in possession of the wrong man would imperil both the fugitive and his friend it was therefore an act of supreme trust on the part of a freeman of color thus to put in jeopardy his own liberty that another might be free it was however not infrequently bravely done and was seldom discovered i was not so fortunate as to sufficiently resemble any of my free acquaintances to answer the description of their papers but i had one friend a sailor who owned a sailors protection which answered somewhat the purpose of free papers describing his person and certifying to the fact that he was a free american sailor the instrument had at its head the american eagle which gave it the appearance at once of an authorized document this protection did not when in my hands describe its bearer very accurately indeed it called for a man much darker than myself and close examination of it would have caused my arrest at the start in order to avoid this fatal scrutiny i had arranged with a hackman to bring my baggage to the train just on the moment of starting and jumped upon the car myself when the train was already in motion had i gone into the station and offered to purchase a ticket i should have been instantly and carefully examined and undoubtedly arrested in choosing this plan upon which to act i considered the jostle of the train and the natural haste of the conductor in a train crowded with passengers and relied upon my skill and address in playing the sailor as described in my protection to do the rest one element in my favor was the kind feeling which prevailed in baltimore and other seaports at the time towards those who go down to the sea in ships free trade and sailors rights expressed the sentiment of the country just then in my clothing i was rigged out in sailor style i had on a red shirt and a tarpaulin hat and black cravat tied in sailor fashion carelessly and loosely about my neck my knowledge of ships and sailors talk came much to my assistance for i knew a ship from stem to stern and from keelson to crosstrees and could talk sailor like an old salt on sped the train and i was well on the way to havre de grace before the conductor came into the negro car to collect tickets and examine the papers of his black passengers this was a critical moment in the drama my whole future depended upon the decision of this conductor agitated i was while this ceremony was proceeding but still externally at least i was apparently calm and selfpossessed he went on with his duty examining several colored passengers before reaching me he was somewhat harsh in tone and peremptory in manner until he reached me when strangely enough and to my surprise and relief his whole manner changed seeing that i did not readily produce my free papers as the other colored persons in the car had done he said to me in a friendly contrast with that observed towards the others i suppose you have your free papers to which i answered no sir i never carry my free papers to sea with me but you have something to show that you are a free man have you not yes sir i answered i have a paper with the american eagle on it that will carry me around the world with this i drew from my deep sailors pocket my seamans protection as before described the merest glance at the paper satisfied him and he took my fare and went on about his business this moment of time was one of the most anxious i ever experienced had the conductor looked closely at the paper he could not have failed to discover that it called for a very different looking person from myself and in that case it would have been his duty to arrest me on the instant and send me back to baltimore from the first station when he left me with the assurance that i was all right though much relieved i realized that i was still in great danger i was still in maryland and subject to arrest at any moment i saw on the train several persons who would have known me in any other clothes and i feared they might recognize me even in my sailor rig and report me to the conductor who would then subject me to a closer examination which i knew well would be fatal to me though i was not a murderer fleeing from justice i felt perhaps quite miserable as such a criminal the train was moving at a very high rate of speed for that time of railroad travel but to my anxious mind it was moving far too slowly minutes were hours and hours were days during this part of my flight after maryland i was to pass through delaware another slave state the border lines between slavery and freedom were the dangerous ones for the fugitives the heart of no fox or deer with hungry hounds on his trail in full chase could have beaten more anxiously or noisily than did mine from the time i left baltimore till i reached philadelphia the passage of the susquehanna river at havre de grace was made by ferryboat at that time on board of which i met a young colored man by the name of nichols who came very near betraying me he was a hand on the boat but instead of minding his business he insisted upon knowing me and asking me dangerous questions as to where i was going and when i was coming back etc i got away from my old and inconvenient acquaintance as soon as i could decently do so and went to another part of the boat once across the river i encountered a new danger only a few days before i had been at work on a revenue cutter in mr prices shipyard under the care of captain mcgowan on the meeting at this point of the two trains the one going south stopped on the track just opposite to the one going north and it so happened that this captain mcgowan sat at a window where he could see me very distinctly and would certainly have recognized me had he looked at me but for a second fortunately in the hurry of the moment he did not see me and the trains soon passed each other on their respective ways but this was not the only hairbreadth escape a german blacksmith whom i knew well was on the train with me and looked at me very intently as if he thought he had seen me somewhere before in his travels i really believe he knew me but had no heart to betray me at any rate he saw me escaping and held his peace the last point of imminent danger and the one i dreaded most was wilmington here we left the train and took the steamboat for philadelphia in making the change here i again apprehended arrest but no one disturbed me and i was soon on the broad and beautiful delaware speeding away to the quaker city on reaching philadelphia in the afternoon i inquired of a colored man how i could get on to new york he directed me to the willow street depot and thither i went taking the train that night i reached new york tuesday morning having completed the journey in less than twentyfour hours such is briefly the manner of my escape from slavery and the end of my experience as a slave frederick douglass w h crogman frederick douglass is dead how strange that sounds to those of us who from earliest boyhood have been accustomed to hear him spoken of as the living exponent of all that is noblest and best in the race the mind reluctantly accepts the unwelcome truth and yet it is a truth a serious a solemn truth frederick douglass is no more the grand old hero of a thousand battles has at last fallen before the shaft of the common destroyer and upon his wellbattered shield loving hands have tenderly borne that stalwart form to its last long resting place earth to earth dust to dust ashes to ashes this country will never again see another douglass this world will never again see another douglass for in all probability there will never again exist that peculiar combination of circumstances to produce exactly such a type of manhood man is in a measure the product of environment yet it would be injustice to frederick douglass to say that he was great simply because of environment he was great in spite of environment born a slave subjected in his youth and early manhood to all the degrading stultifying demoralizing influences of slavery he has left behind him after a public life long and varied and stormy a name as clean and spotless as driven snow take notice of this young men you who have ambitions you who are aspiring to public place position and power take notice that a public life need not be separated from unsullied honor i said frederick douglass was great in spite of environment had there been no slavery to fight no freedom to win he would still have been a great man greatness was inherent in his being and circumstances simply evoked it he was one of those choice spirits whom the almighty sends into this world with the stamp of a great mission on their very form and features said sam johnson with reference to edmund burke burke sir is such a man that if you met him for the first time in the street where you were stopped by a drove of oxen and you and he stepped aside to take shelter but for five minutes hed talk to you in such a manner that when you parted you would say this is an extraordinary man the same could doubtless have been said of douglass but it was not necessary to hear him talk to discover his unusual ability and surpassing intelligence there was in his very presence something that instantly indicated these an eminent divine said some years ago that douglasss escape from slavery was a very fortunate thing for the south as in any uprising of slaves he must have proved a very formidable leader he had said he the mind to plan the heart to dare and the hand to execute and added if you were to see him sitting in exeter hall in the midst of a sea of faces you would instantly recognize in him a man of extraordinary force of character such was the impression that douglass commonly made on people and such was the impression he made on me at my first sight of him it was in faneuil hall in the summer of the colored people of new england were assembled in political convention entering the hall in the midst of one of their morning sessions the first object that met my eyes was the old hero himself on the rostrum there he stood over six feet in height erect broadshouldered deepchested with massive wellformed head covered with thick bushy hair about half gray i judged him then to be midway in his fifties his face strongly leonine was clean shaven except moustache while those eyes that even in the seventies could flash fire lighted up the whole countenance and made the general effect such as not to be easily forgotten by a young man there stood the orator and the man and never since have i seen the two in such exquisite combination the old greek sculptor would have delighted to immortalize such a form in marble whispering to a tall white brother beside me the audience was half white i asked who sir is that man speaking that man that man is frederick douglass then looking down upon me with an expression of mingled pity and surprise in his face he said why dont you know fred douglass i need not say that that question brought to my mind feelings of pride not altogether unmixed with humiliation as the old orator swept on however in his own inimitable style sprinkling his remarks with genuine original wit i forgot everything else around me his voice a heavy barytone or rendered a little heavier than usual by a slight hoarseness contracted in previous speaking could be distinctly heard in that historic but most wretched of auditoriums i was particularly struck with his perfect ease and naturalness a seemingly childlike unconsciousness of his surroundings while like a master of his art as he was he swayed the feelings of that surging multitude in the most impassioned portions of his speech however it was evident to the thoughtful observer that there was in the man immense reserved force which on momentous occasions might be used with startling effect at first i had entered the hall to remain but a few minutes and consequently had taken my stand just inside the door how long i did remain i cannot tell but it was until the speaker finished at which time i found myself half way up towards the rostrum in the midst of that thickly standing audience such was my first sight and impression of one of the worlds great orators and beyond comparison the greatest man of the race yet produced on this continent his splendid physique so often admired was well in keeping with the strength and grasp of his masterly mind without the privilege of a days instruction in the schoolroom he acquired a fund of useful knowledge that would put to shame the meager attainments of many a college graduate his speeches and writing are models of a pure english style and are characterized by simplicity clearness directness force and elegance many of the interesting facts and incidents in the life of this great man are already well known his escape from slavery his arrival in the north his early marriage his settling down to work at his trade in new bedford his first speech in an antislavery convention that drew attention to his wonderful powers of oratory and led to his employment by the antislavery bureau to lecture through the north on the most unpopular question that up to that time had been presented to the american people his rise as an orator his trip to england and its magical effects on the english people his return to this country and the purchase of his freedom to relieve him of the apprehension of being seized and taken back into slavery his editorship of the north star his services to the government during the war in the raising of troops his securing of pay for the black soldiers equal to that of the whites the editorship immediately after the war of the new national era his popularity as a lyceum lecturer his mission to san domingo under grant his marshalship of the district of columbia under hayes his ministry to santo domingo these are some of the experiences which came into that eventful life if i were asked to sum up in a word what made frederick douglass great i should say a noble purpose fixed and unchangeable a purpose to render to mankind the largest possible service verily he has served us well faithfully unselfishly and now full of years and full of honors loaded with such distinctions as this poor world has to give he dies dies as he lived a brave strong good man no more shall we behold that manly form no more shall we listen to those eloquent lips upon which for over fifty years so many thousands have hung with rapture those eloquent lips that made his name famous in two hemispheres and will surely keep it so long as freedom has a history god grant that the mantle of this old hero may fall upon a worthy successor god grant that our young men contemplating his life and emulating his example may be lifted up to a higher conception of life of duty of responsibility of usefulness incident in the life of frederick douglass long after the civil war mr douglass once told the following story of his life to the pupils of a colored school in talbot county maryland the county in which he was born i once knew a little colored boy whose father and mother died when he was six years old he was a slave and had no one to care for him he slept on a dirt floor in a hovel and in cold weather would crawl into a meal bag headforemost and leave his feet in the ashes to keep them warm often he would roast an ear of corn and eat it to satisfy his hunger and many times has he crawled under the barn or stable and secured eggs which he would roast in the fire and eat this boy did not wear pants as you do only a tow linen shirt schools were unknown to him and he learned to spell from an old websters spelling book and to read and write from posters on cellars and barn doors while boys and men would help him he would then preach and speak and soon became well known he finally held several high positions and accumulated some wealth he wore broadcloth and did not have to divide crumbs with the dogs under the table that boy was frederick douglass what was possible for me is possible for you do not think because you are colored you can not accomplish anything strive earnestly to add to your knowledge so long as you remain in ignorance so long will you fail to command the respect of your fellow men animal life in the congo william henry sheppard at daybreak monday morning we had finished our breakfast by candle light and with staff in hand we marched northeast for lukunga in two days we sighted the mission compound word had reached the missionaries abmu that foreigners were approaching and they came out to meet and greet us we were soon hurried into their cool and comfortable mud houses our faithful cook was dismissed for we were to take our meals with the missionaries mr hoste who is at the head of this station came into our room and mentioned that the numerous spiders half the size of your hand on the walls were harmless but said he as he raised his hand and pointed to a hole over the door there is a nest of scorpions you must be careful in moving in or out for they will spring upon you well you ought to have seen us dodging in and out that door after supper not discrediting the veracity of the gentleman we set to work and for an hour we spoiled the walls by smashing spiders with slippers the next morning the mission station was excited over the loss of their only donkey the donkey had been feeding in the field and a boaconstrictor had captured him squeezed him into pulp dragged him a hundred yards down to the river bank and was preparing to swallow him the missionaries all with guns took aim and fired killing the twentyfivefoot boaconstrictor the boa was turned over to the natives and they had a great feast the missionaries told us many tales about how the boaconstrictor would come by night and steal away their goats hogs and dogs the sand around lukunga is a hotbed for miniature fleas or jiggers the second day of our stay at lukunga our feet had swollen and itched terribly and on examination we found that these jiggers had entered under our toe nails and had grown to the size of a pea a native was called and with a small sharpened stick they were cut out we saw natives with toes and fingers eaten entirely off by these pests mr hoste told us to keep our toes well greased with palm oil we followed his instructions but grease with sand and sun made our socks rather heavy the native church here is very strong spiritually the church bell a real big brass bell begins to ring at a m and continues for an hour the natives in the neighborhood come teeming by every trail take their seats quietly and listen attentively to the preaching of gods word no excitement no shouting but an intelligent interest shown by looking and listening from start to finish in the evening you can hear from every quarter our hymns sung by the natives in their own language they are having their family devotions before retiring our second days march brought us to a large river our loads and men were ferried over in canoes mr lapsley and i decided to swim it and so we jumped in and struck out for the opposite shore on landing we were told by a native watchman that we had done a very daring thing he explained with much excitement and many gestures that the river was filled with crocodiles and that he did not expect to see us land alive on his side we camped on the top of the hill overlooking nkissy and the wild rushing congo rapids it was in one of these whirlpools that young pocock stanleys last survivor perished in the pool we saw many hippopotami and longed to go out in a canoe and shoot one but being warned of the danger from the hippopotami and also of the treacherous current of the congo river which might take us over the rapids and to death we were afraid to venture a native bateke fisherman just a few days before our arrival had been crushed in his canoe by a bullhippopotamus many stories of hippopotami horrors were told us one day chief ngaliama with his attendant came to the mission and told dr simms that the people in the village were very hungry and to see if it were possible for him to get some meat to eat dr simms called me and explained how the people were on the verge of a famine and if i could kill them a hippopotamus it would help greatly he continued to explain that the meat and hide would be dried by the people and using but a little at each meal would last them a long time dr simms mentioned that he had never hunted but he knew where the game was he said i will give you a native guide you go with him around the first cataract about two miles from here and you will find the hippopotami i was delighted at the idea and being anxious to use my martini henry rifle and to help the hungry people i consented to go in an hour and a half we had walked around the rapids across the big boulders and right before us were at least a dozen big hippopotami some were frightened ducked their heads and made off others showed signs of fight and defiance at about fifty yards distant i raised my rifle and let fly at one of the exposed heads my guide told me that the hippopotamus was shot and killed in a few minutes another head appeared above the surface of the water and again taking aim i fired with the same result the guide who was a subject of the chief ngaliama sprang upon a big boulder and cried to me to look at the big bubbles which were appearing on the water then explained in detail that the hippopotami had drowned and would rise to the top of the water within an hour the guide asked to go to a fishing camp nearby and call some men to secure the hippopotami when they rose or else they would go out with the current and over the rapids in a very short time about fifty men bringing native rope with them were on the scene and truly as the guide had said up came the first hippopotamus his big back showing first a number of the men were off swimming with the long rope which was tied to the hippopotamus foot a signal was given and every man did his best no sooner had we secured the one near shore than there was a wild shout to untie and hasten for the other these two were securely tied by their feet and big boulders were rolled on the rope to keep them from drifting out into the current the short tails of both of them were cut off and we started home we reported to dr simms that we had about four or five tons of meat down on the river bank the native town ran wild with delight many natives came to examine my gun which had sent the big bullets crashing through the brain of the hippopotami early the next morning ngaliama sent his son nzelie with a long caravan of men to complete the work they leaped upon the backs of the hippopotami wrestled with each other for a while and then with knives and axes fell to work the missionaries enjoyed a hippopotamus steak that day also before the chickens began to crow for dawn i was alarmed by a band of big broadheaded determined driver ants they filled the cabin the bed the yard there were millions they were in my head my eyes my nose and pulling at my toes when i found it was not a dream i didnt tarry long some of our native boys came with torches of fire to my rescue they are the largest and the most ferocious ant we know anything about in an incredibly short space of time they can kill any goat chicken duck hog or dog on the place in a few hours there is not a rat mouse snake centipede spider or scorpion in your house as they are chased killed and carried away we built a fire and slept inside of the circle until day we scraped the acquaintance of these soldier ants by being severely bitten and stung they are near the size of a wasp and use both ends with splendid effect they live deep down in the ground and come out of a smoothly cut hole following each other single file and when they reach a damp spot in the forest and hear the white ants cutting away on the fallen leaves the leader stops until all the soldiers have caught up a circle is formed a peculiar hissing is the order to raid and down under the leaves they dart and in a few minutes they come out with their pinchers filled with white ants the line without the least excitement is again formed and they march back home stepping high with their prey the small white ants have a blue head and a white soft body and are everywhere in the ground and on the surface they live by eating dead wood and leaves we got rid of the driver ants by keeping up a big fire in their cave for a week we dug up the homes of the big black ants and they moved off but there was no way possible to rid the place of the billions of white ants they ate our dry goods boxes our books our trunks our beds shoes hats and clothing the natives make holes in the ground entrapping the ants and use them for food the dogs look like ordinary curs with but little hair on them and they never bark or bite i asked the people to explain why their dogs didnt bark so they told me that once they did bark but long ago the dogs and leopards had a big fight the dogs whipped the leopards and after that the leopards were very mad so the mothers of the little dogs told them not to bark any more and they hadnt barked since the natives tie wooden bells around their dogs to know where they are every man knows the sound of his bell just as we would know the bark of our dog there are many many kinds of birds of the air all known and called by name and the food they eat their mode of building nests etc were familiar to the people they knew the customs and habits of the elephant hippopotamus buffalo leopard hyena jackal wildcat monkey mouse and every animal which roams the great forest and plain from the thirtyfoot boaconstrictor to a tiny tulu their names and nature were well known the little children could tell you the native names of all insects such as caterpillars crickets cockroaches grasshoppers locusts mantis honey bees bumble bees wasps hornets yellow jackets goliath beetles stage beetles ants etc the many species of fish eels and terrapins were on the end of their tongues and these were all gathered and used for food all the trees of the forest and plain the flowers fruits nuts and berries were known and named roots which are good for all maladies were not only known to the medicine man but the common people knew them also cooperation and the latin class lillian b witten the few minutes that intervened between the devotionals and the beginning of the first period were always eagerly seized by the senior class in the l high school for those last furious attempts at learning the date of the battle of marathon the duties of the president of the united states and other pieces of information that the faculty set so much store by bored indifference was the sole notice they gave to the antics of the freshmen boys who were trying to get a websters unabridged dictionary on the floor of the aisle without attracting the attention of the guardian of the room one little group of seniors was especially busy cooperatively busy one might say this was one of the overflow divisions of eight students which made up a class in virgil in all of the athletics of their three years in school they had been taught the value of team work and coцperation one bright student had conceived the idea of bringing this same team work into the virgil class it worked beautifully sixty lines of virgil was their customary assignment sixty lines divided among eight students as everybody could see was about eight lines per student each pupil had his number and studied correspondingly number one translated the first seven lines with great care number two the second seven et cetera down the line then during the study period which preceded the latin recitation each one translated his lines for the benefit of the other seven while they attentively followed his translation with the latin text busy over those vindictive lines in which queen dido spurned by aeneas pronounces a curse upon his head and all his generation the eight seniors on this particular morning translated one for the other hate with a neverceasing hate all of the savage beauty of the lines was lost on them floundering in the maze of ablatives subjunctives and the like but they managed between them all to make out some sort of translation the composition work lent itself to team work much more effectively there were ten sentences given them each day to be translated from english into latin they were divided among the eight in the same manner as the virgil each one taking turns in doing the two extra sentences passed around from one to the other and carefully copied they made up a carefully done composition lesson the beauty of it was that the latin teacher called upon them to put these sentences upon the board each one being given a different sentence thus the similarity of the work could not be a subject of unpleasant comment by the teacher who never presumed to collect the notebooks the gong sounded for second period noise and bustle commenced the virgil class made for the latin recitation room with all the enthusiasm of prepared lessons time dragged today of all days the day of the annual football game between the juniors and the seniors so much more vivid than the wanderings of aeneas red and orange the colors of the senior and junior classes respectively were everywhere conspicuous but lessons had to be gotten through somehow so with open books making the final attempt to gather up loose ends in the translation they waited for the recitation to commence miss rhodes the young latin teacher had observed the class during the three weeks of the new term she had noted the fact that none of the class excelled the others that all of them sometimes made brilliant recitations all sometimes stumbled through passages in a way to cause the long deceased virgil to blush with shame the students could have explained that if she would always call upon them for the particular seven lines which had been their portion they could always be brilliant however they maintained a wise and discreet silence scientific observation and analysis is never wasted however will the class please pass their latin sentences to me miss rhodes requested at the beginning of the hour eight pairs of eyes were instantly fixed on her in amazed consternation eight pairs of unwilling hands fumbled among papers and slowly gave up the one paper which was the exact duplicate of every other paper hurry please class you may now write your translations of todays lesson for twenty minutes the clock ticked eight industrious students concentrated and slaved over didos curse translations which sounded plausible enough when orally stumbled through did not look well when written in the meantime miss rhodes looked through the sentences which they had given her her suspicions were confirmed the class unaware that they were harming only themselves were daily copying their sentences from each other stolen glances at the young and pretty teacher informed the students that her mouth had tightened her chin had suddenly become terrifyingly firm after an eternity had passed the period came to an end class is dismissed please reassemble in this room this afternoon at miss rhodes succinctly stated did they hear aright why this afternoon was the afternoon of the game it was incredible eight seniors and one of them the crack halfback of the senior team not to be at their own game it was not to be dreamed of in vain they protested if you expect to graduate you will be here at cheaters deserve no consideration half past two found the eight sad and wiser seniors again in the latin room again they applied themselves to translating latin into english english into latin while in the distance they could hear the shouts of the football fans the hours ticked by the game was over the juniors winners in one of the closest games of years over the seniors who lost because of the absence of their halfback who sat translating latin failing his class in their need he would never live down the shame just before dismissing this extra session of the class miss rhodes quietly said let me tell you from experience that the ability to make a good bluff is a rare gift good bluffs are always founded on consistent hard work slowly and sadly the virgil class passed out of the room realizing that the days of coцperative virgil were relegated to the dim suffering past the band of gideon joseph s cotter the band of gideon roam the sky the howling wind is their warcry the thunders roll is their trumps peal and the lightnings flash their vengeful steel each black cloud is a fiery steed and they cry aloud with each strong deed the sword of the lord and gideon and men below rear temples high and mock their god with reasons why and live in arrogance sin and shame and rape their souls for the worlds good name each black cloud is a fiery steed and they cry aloud with each strong deed the sword of the lord and gideon the band of gideon roam the sky and view the earth with baleful eye in holy wrath they scourge the land with earthquake storm and burning brand each black cloud is a fiery steed and they cry aloud with each strong deed the sword of the lord and gideon the lightnings flash and the thunders roll and lord have mercy on my soul cry men as they fall on the stricken sod in agony searching for their god each black cloud is a fiery steed and they cry aloud with each strong deed the sword of the lord and gideon and men repent and then forget that heavenly wrath they ever met the band of gideon yet will come and strike their tongues of blasphemy dumb each black cloud is a fiery steed and they cry aloud with each strong deed the sword of the lord and gideon the home of the colored girl beautiful azalia hackley the home of the colored girl beautiful will reflect her she will help her parents to buy a home that it may give her family more standing in the civic community taste and simplicity will rule for the home will harmonize with the girl if her parents are not particular about the trifles in the way of curtains fences and yards then it must be her special task to make the home represent the beautiful in her the god for all that is beautiful and good comes from god windows generally express the character of the occupants of a house the day has passed when soiled or ragged lace curtains are tolerated the cheaper simpler scrims and cheese cloths which are easily laundered are now used by the best people the colored girl beautiful will study the possibilities of her home and will attempt to secure the restful effects for the eye too much furniture is bad taste the less one has the cleaner houses may be kept the ornate heavy furniture and the upholstered parlor sets are passing away because they are no longer considered good taste besides they are too heavy for cleanliness and are harmful to the health of women who do their own work furniture of less expensive model with simple lines and of less weight is being selected this may be paid for in cash instead of on time as has been the custom of many people in smaller towns and in the country districts the furniture sold by the payment houses always shows its source in its heaviness and shininess the wall paper should be selected as one would select a color for clothes to harmonize with the color of the skin in all lights and for service color schemes in decoration are being followed and we have no more stuffy parlors often closed for days instead we have living rooms with cleanable furniture strong but light entirely suitable for winter and cool in summer no one has a parlor nowadays the best room is generally a living room for the whole family no more do we see enlarged pictures which good taste demands should be placed in bedrooms and private sitting rooms the tencent stores have done a great deal of good in educating the poor white and black alike these stores have everywhere sold small brown art prints of many of the great paintings to take the place of the gaudy dustladen chromos and family pictures pictures are hung low that they may be thoroughly dusted as well as to give a near view of the subject expensive carpets are also things of the past painted and stained floors with light weight rugs are more generally used these may be cleaned and handled without giving the backache to women many colored girls boast of having painted their own floors and woodwork much of this has been learned in the boarding school a tawdry home expresses its mistress as do her clothes next to the kitchen a fully equipped bath room is now the most important room in the house health and sanitation are the topics of the hour and a colored girl should know how to put a washer on a faucet as well as her father or brother a house without books is indeed an unfurnished home good books are the fad now they are everywhere in evidence in the uptodate colored home they are exhibited almost as handpainted china was in every inventory or collection one finds a bible a dictionary and an atlas the times are changing and the colored people are changing with the times cleanliness and health are the watchwords and order is heavens first law the knighting of donald lillian b witten with spear drawn sir cedric rode steadily through the forest while ever nearer and nearer came the dragon swift and sudden was the onslaught and great was the struggle until finally sir cedric dismounted from his black charger and stood victor over the huge monster who had committed so many depredations against the country side slowly and lingeringly donald closed the book the manybranched tree under which he lay changed into a grey stone castle with moat and drawbridge upon which through the day armored knights on prancing steeds rode from castle to village always on missions of good to the towns and hamlets never did donald tire of reading about arthur galahad merlin and the others but launcelot the bold was his favorite knight as he read of their deeds his black eyes flashed his nervous slim body quivered the deep rich red flooded his brown cheeks he was one of them took part in their tournaments rescued the lovely ladies and overcame wicked monsters for his king of all the stories a nevertobeforgotten one was of a little boy like himself who lived in a small cottage near a castle which harbored many knights this little boy idolized them even as donald did one day as the knights were returning from a strenuous days work one weary and worn stopped at the cottage and asked for a drink of water eagerly the boy ran filled his cup at the brimming spring and gave it to the knight thank you my little boy smiled the man already you are a knight for you have learned the lesson of service how donald envied the boy to serve a knight he dreamed even to see one would he had lived in the olden times when knighthood was in flower but having been born centuries too late he tried in every way to live as the knights had lived daily he exercised practiced physical feats restrained himself from over indulgence following out the program of those who would be knights with shining eyes he would often repeat his motto the motto of arthurs knights live pure speak the truth right the wrong follow the christ thus dreaming donald grew and everybody loved him dreamer though he was he ever kept before him the ideal of service tense with interest in the exploits of the black knight he was often tempted not to answer when his mother called him from his reading to go on errands only a second however would temptation last launcelot could never approve of a boy who acted dishonestly working playing and dreaming donald grew into a lovable boy adept in all of the sports of boyhood and with the manners of a prince he had reached the last year in grammar school the graduating class already the obligations of maturity were forcing themselves upon the boys and girls they for the first time in their school career were an organized group they were going to elect officers dignified officers nominations had been many and enthusiasm surged around the youthful candidates but the choice for president had narrowed itself down between donald and a laughingeyed girl with crinkly black hair as usual there were more girls in the class than boys but while the boys stood solidly as one behind the masculine candidate there were a few girls who put their trust in manly courage rather than feminine charm and were disposed to break loose from the suffragette camp public opinion thus gave the election to donald as the time for election drew near the interest became more intense and the various camps campaigned vigorously each striving to gain the majority vote one day as the school was assembling in their usual room they were stopped by the sight of their principal questioning one of the members of the class but this is your knife isnt it sternly inquired the principal yes sir responded john a trustworthy boy the son of a widowed mother whom he helped by working after school hours mr starks found this knife underneath his broken window last night it had evidently been dropped by the boy who in climbing out of his cherry tree accidentally smashed the window you know that i announced last week that the next boy who was caught trespassing upon mr starks property would be suspended from school for the rest of the year i am disappointed in you john this does not sound like you did you drop this knife last night no sir responded john no well speak up who had the knife i cant say sir but you must this is a serious matter one of the rules of the school has been broken then looking nervously around the room of girls and boys the principal commanded will the boy who dropped this knife last night speak or shall i be forced to find out the culprit for myself there was no answer every boy stood taut his eyes steadfastly before him in the thick silence that followed very well snapped the principal john who had the knife yesterday i cannot say sir responded john unwillingly you may do one of two things either you will tell the name of the boy to whom you lent the knife or you may be suspended from school for the rest of the year the silence was more intense one two three minutes passed you are dismissed said the principal slowly john left the room three days passed johns mother much disturbed bewailed the fact that he would lose this year out of his school life and perhaps would not have the opportunity of going again john thought of the responsibility toward his mother and then of that toward the boy whose fault he was concealing was he doing right or was he doing the easiest thing in not telling on the fourth day john sought the principal if it is necessary to tell the name of the boy who had my knife before i can return to school i will tell he anxiously said it certainly is necessary and john told there was great excitement in the graduating class the traditions of centuries had been broken one of their number had become a tattler john resumed his school work systematically and obviously shunned by the other boys but donald reflected over the incident after all he thought john did the bravest thing it would have been easier to appear heroic and to sacrifice his mother for the sake of a boy who needed to be punished the next day donald sought john accompanied him to school and showed the class that he regarded john as a hero instead of a telltale the boys divided into two camps some following donalds example and others loudly denouncing him illustration donalds sponsorship of john cost him the presidential election just as he had foreseen but he knew that he had lived up to the best within him and he was satisfied as he climbed into bed at the end of the day upon which he had been defeated and yet had gained a great victory his mother tucked the covers closely around him kissed him goodnight and lowered the light then she bent over him again and kissed him once more and whispered my brave little knight a negro explorer at the north pole matthew a henson matthew a henson my negro assistant has been with me in one capacity or another since my second trip to nicaragua in i have taken him on each and all of my expeditions except the first and also without exception on each of my farthest sledge trips this position i have given him primarily because of his adaptability and fitness for the work and secondly on account of his loyalty he is a better dog driver and can handle a sledge better than any man living except some of the best esquimo hunters themselves robert e peary rear admiral u s n exactly below zero when we pushed the sledges up to the curledup dogs and started them off over rough ice covered with deep soft snow it was like walking in loose granulated sugar indeed i might compare the snow of the arctic to the granules of sugar without their saccharine sweetness but with freezing cold instead you cannot make snowballs of it for it is too thoroughly congealed and when it is packed by the wind it is almost as solid as ice it is from the packed snow that the blocks used to form the igloowalls are cut at the end of four hours we came to the igloo where the captain and his boys were sleeping the sleep of utter exhaustion in order not to interrupt the captains rest we built another igloo and unloaded his sledge and distributed the greater part of the load among the sledges of the party the captain on awakening told us that the journey we had completed on that day had been made by him under the most trying conditions and that it had taken him fourteen hours to do it we were able to make better time because we had his trail to follow and therefore the necessity of finding the easiest way was avoided that was the object of the scout or pioneer party and captain bartlett had done practically all of it up to the time he turned back at ґ north march you have undoubtedly taken into consideration the pangs of hunger and of cold that you know assailed us going poleward but have you ever considered that we were thirsty for water to drink or hungry for fat to eat snow to quench our thirsts would have been the height of folly and as well as being thirsty we were continually assailed by the pangs of a hunger that called for the fat good rich oily juicy fat that our systems craved and demanded had we succumbed to the temptations of the thirst and eaten the snow we would not be able to tell the tale of the conquest of the pole for the result of eating snow is death true the dogs licked up enough moisture to quench their thirsts but we were not made of such stern stuff as they snow would have reduced our temperatures and we would quickly have fallen by the way we had to wait until camp was made and the fire of alcohol started before we had a chance and it was with hot tea that we quenched our thirsts the hunger for fat was not appeased a dog or two was killed but his carcass went to the esquimos and the entrails were fed to the rest of the pack april the farthest north of bartlett i knew at this time that he was to go back and that i was to continue so i had no misgivings and neither had he he was ready and anxious to take the backtrail his five marches were up and he was glad of it and he was told that in the morning he must turn back and knit the trail together so that the main column could return over a beaten path he swept his little party together and at three p m with a cheery goodby good luck he was off his esquimo boys attempting english too gave us their goodbys the captain had gone commander peary and i were alone save for the four esquimos the same we had been with so often in the past years and as we looked at each other we realized our position and we knew without speaking that the time had come for us to demonstrate that we were the men who it had been ordained should unlock the door which held the mystery of the arctic without an instants hesitation the order to push on was given and we started off in the trail made by the captain to cover the farthest north he had made and to push on over one hundred and thirty miles to our final destination day and night were the same my thoughts were on the going and getting forward and on nothing else the wind was from the southeast and seemed to push on and the sun was at our backs a ball of livid fire rolling his way above the horizon in neverending day with my proven ability in gauging distances commander peary was ready to take the reckoning as i made it and he did not resort to solar observations until we were within a hands grasp of the pole the memory of those last five marches from the farthest north of captain bartlett to the arrival of our party at the pole is a memory of toil fatigue and exhaustion but we were urged on and encouraged by our relentless commander who was himself being scourged by the final lashings of the dominating influence that had controlled his life from the land to ґ north commander peary had had the best of the going for he had brought up the rear and had utilized the trail made by the preceding parties and thus he had kept himself in the best of condition for the time when he made the spurt that brought him to the end of the race from ґ north he kept in the lead and did his work in such a way as to convince me that he was still as good a man as he had ever been we marched and marched falling down in our tracks repeatedly until it was impossible to go on we were forced to camp in spite of the impatience of the commander who found himself unable to rest and who only waited long enough for us to relax into sound sleep when he would wake us up and start us off again i do not believe that he slept for one hour from april until after he had loaded us up and ordered us to go back over our old trail and i often think that from the instant when the order to return was given until the land was again sighted he was in a continual daze onward we forced our weary way commander peary took his sights from the time our chronometerwatches gave and i knowing that we had kept on going in practically a straight line was sure that we had more than covered the necessary distance to insure our arrival at the top of the earth it was during the march of the d of april that i endured an instant of hideous horror we were crossing a lane of moving ice commander peary was in the lead setting the pace and a half hour later the four boys and myself followed in single file they had all gone before and i was standing and pushing at the upstanders of my sledge when the block of ice i was using as a support slipped from underneath my feet and before i knew it the sledge was out of my grasp and i was floundering in the water of the lead i did the best i could i tore my hood from off my head and struggled frantically my hands were gloved and i could not take hold of the ice but before i could give the grand hailing sigh of distress faithful old ootah had grabbed me by the nape of the neck the same as he would have grabbed a dog and with one hand he pulled me out of the water and with the other hurried the team across he had saved my life but i did not tell him so for such occurrences are taken as part of the days work and the sledge he safeguarded was of much more importance for it held as part of its load the commanders sextant the mercury and the coils of pianowire that were the essential portion of the scientific part of the expedition my kamiks boots of sealskin were stripped off and the congealed water was beaten out of my bearskin trousers and with a dry pair of kamiks we hurried on to overtake the column when we caught up we found the boys gathered around the commander doing their best to relieve him of his discomfort for he had fallen into the water also and while he was not complaining i was sure that his bath had not been any more voluntary than mine had been it was about ten or tenthirty a m on the th of april that the commander gave the order to build a snowshield to protect him from the flying drift of the surfacesnow i knew that he was about to take an observation and while we worked i was nervously apprehensive for i felt that the end of our journey had come when we handed him the pan of mercury the hour was within a very few minutes of noon lying flat on his stomach he took the elevation and made the notes on a piece of tissuepaper at his head with sunblinded eyes he snapped shut the vernier a graduated scale that subdivides the smallest divisions on the sector of the circular scale of the sextant and with the resolute squaring of his jaws i was sure that he was satisfied and i was confident that the journey had ended the commander gave the word we will plant the stars and stripes at the north pole and it was done on the peak of a huge paleocrystic floeberg the glorious banner was unfurled to the breeze and as it snapped and crackled with the wind i felt a savage joy and exultation another worlds accomplishment was done and finished and as in the past from the beginning of history wherever the worlds work was done by a white man he had been accompanied by a colored man from the building of the pyramids and the journey to the cross to the discovery of the north pole the negro had been the faithful and constant companion of the caucasian and i felt all that it was possible for me to feel that it was i a lowly member of my race who had been chosen by fate to represent it at this almost the last of the worlds great work benjamin banneker william wells brown benjamin banneker was born in the state of maryland in the year of pure african parentage their blood never having been corrupted by the introduction of a drop of anglosaxon his father was a slave and of course could do nothing towards the education of the child the mother however being free succeeded in purchasing the freedom of her husband and they with their son settled on a few acres of land where benjamin remained during the lifetime of his parents his entire schooling was gained from an obscure country school established for the education of the children of free negroes and these advantages were poor for the boy appears to have finished studying before he arrived at his fifteenth year although out of school banneker was still a student and read with great care and attention such books as he could get mr george ellicott a gentlemen of fortune and considerable literary taste and who resided near to benjamin became interested in him and lent him books from his large library among these books were three on astronomy a few old and imperfect astronomical instruments also found their way into the boys hands all of which he used with great benefit to his own mind banneker took delight in the study of the languages and soon mastered the latin greek and german he was also proficient in the french the classics were not neglected by him and the general literary knowledge which he possessed caused mr ellicott to regard him as the most learned man in the town and he never failed to introduce banneker to his most distinguished guests about this time benjamin turned his attention particularly to astronomy and determined on making calculations for an almanac and completed a set for the whole year encouraged by this attempt he entered upon calculations for subsequent years which as well as the former he began and finished without the least assistance from any person or books than those already mentioned so that whatever merit is attached to his performance is exclusively his own he published an almanac in philadelphia for the years and which contained his calculations exhibiting the different aspects of the planets a table of the motions of the sun and moon their risings and settings and the courses of the bodies of the planetary system by this time bannekers acquirements had become generally known and the best scholars in the country opened correspondence with him goddard angell the wellknown baltimore publishers engaged his pen for their establishment and became the publishers of his almanacs he knew every branch of history both natural and civil he had read all the original historians of england france and was a great antiquarian with such a fund of knowledge his conversation was equally interesting instructive and entertaining banneker was so favorably appreciated by the first families in virginia that in he was invited by mr jefferson then president of the united states to visit him at monticello where the statesman had gone for recreation but he was too infirm to undertake the journey he died the following year aged seventytwo like the golden sun that has sunk beneath the western horizon but still throws upon the world which he sustained and enlightened in his career the reflected beams of his departed genius his name can only perish with his language the negro race charles w anderson as a race we have done much but we must not forget how much more there is still to do to some extent we have been given opportunity but we must not cease to remember that no race can be given relative rank it must win equality of rating for itself hence we must not only acquire education but character as well it is not only necessary that we should speak well but it is more necessary that we should speak the truth paul cuffe john w cromwell paul cuffe was born in on the island of cuttyhunk near new bedford massachusetts there were four sons and six daughters of john cuffe who had been stolen from africa and ruth a woman of indian extraction paul the youngest son lacked the advantage of an early education but he supplied the deficiency by his personal efforts and learned not only to read and write with facility but made such proficiency in the art of navigation as to become a skillful seaman and the instructor of both whites and blacks in the same art his father who had obtained his freedom and bought a farm of one hundred acres died when paul was about fourteen when he was sixteen paul began the life of a sailor on his third voyage he was captured by a british brig and was for three months a prisoner of war on his release he planned to go into business on his own account with the aid of an elder brother david cuffe an open boat was built in which they went to sea but this brother on the first intimation of danger gave up the venture and paul was forced to undertake the work singlehanded and alone which was a sore disappointment on his second attempt he lost all he had before the close of the revolutionary war paul refused to pay a personal tax on the ground that free colored people did not enjoy the rights and privileges of citizenship after considerable delay and an appeal to the courts he paid the tax under protest he then petitioned to the legislature which finally agreed to his contention his efforts are the first of which there is any record of a citizen of african descent making a successful appeal in behalf of his civil rights on reaching the age of twentyfive he married a woman of the same tribe as his mother and for a while gave up life on the ocean wave but the growth of his family led him back to his fond pursuit on the briny deep as he was unable to purchase a boat with the aid of his brother he built one from keel to gunwale and launched into the enterprise while on the way to a nearby island to consult his brother whom he had induced once more to venture forth with him he was overtaken by pirates who robbed him of all he possessed again paul returned home disappointed though not discouraged once more he applied for assistance to his brother david and another boat was built after securing a cargo he met again with pirates but he eluded them though he was compelled to return and repair his boat these having been made he began a successful career along the coast as far north as newfoundland to the south as far as savannah and as distant as gottenburg in carrying on this business starting in the small way indicated he owned at different times besides smaller boats the ranger a schooner of sixty or seventy tons a half interest in a brig of tons the brig traveller of tons the ship alpha of tons and threefourths interest in a larger vessel a few noble incidents may illustrate his resourcefulness difficulties and success over all obstacles when engaged in the whaling business he was found with less than the customary outfit for effectually carrying on this work the practice in such cases was for the other ships to loan the number of men needed they denied this at first to cuffe but fair play prevailed and they gave him what was customary with the result that of the seven whales captured pauls men secured five and two of them fell by his own hand in he took a cargo to norfolk virginia and learning that corn could be bought at a decided advantage he made a trip to the nanticoke river on the eastern shore of maryland here his appearance as a black man commanding his own boat and with a crew of seven men all of his own complexion alarmed the whites who seemed to dread his presence there as the signal for a revolt on the part of their slaves they opposed his landing but the examination of his papers removed all doubts as to the regularity of his business while his quiet dignity secured the respect of the leading white citizens he had no difficulty after this in taking a cargo of three thousand bushels of corn from which he realized a profit of on a second voyage he was equally successful although without the privilege of attending a school when a boy he endeavored to have his friends and neighbors open and maintain one for the colored and indian children of the vicinity failing to secure their active coцperation he built in a schoolhouse without their aid because of his independent means and his skill as a mariner he visited with little or no difficulty most of the larger cities of the country held frequent conferences with the representative men of his race and recommended the formation of societies for their mutual relief and physical betterment such societies he formed in philadelphia and new york and then having made ample preparation he sailed in for africa in his brig the traveller reaching sierra leone on the west coast after a voyage of about two months here he organized the friendly society of sierra leone and then went to liverpool even here one of his characteristic traits manifested itself in taking with him to england for education a native of sierra leone while in england cuffe visited london twice and consulted such friends of the negro as granville sharp thomas clarkson and william wilberforce these men were all interested in a proposition to promote the settlement on the west coast of africa of the free people of color in america many of whom had come into the domains of great britain as an outcome of the revolutionary war this opinion was at this period the prevailing sentiment of england respecting what was best for the negro sir j j crooks a former governor of sierra leone in alluding to its origin says there is no doubt that the influence of their opinion was felt in america and that it led to emigration thence to africa before liberia was settled paul cuffe a man of color who was much interested in the promotion of the civil and religious liberty of his colored brethren in their native land had been familiar with the ideas of these philanthropists as well as with the movement in the same direction in england history of sierra leone dublin p this explains cuffes visit to england and to africa a daring venture in those perilous days and the formation of the friendly societies in africa and in his own country the united states when his special mission to england was concluded he took out a cargo from liverpool for sierra leone after which he returned to america before he made his next move cuffe consulted with the british government in london and president madison at washington but the strained relations between the two nations as well as the financial condition of the united states at the time made governmental coцperation impracticable if not impossible in he carried out the ideas long in his mind in this year he sailed from boston for sierra leone with thirtyeight free negroes as settlers on the black continent only eight of these could pay their own expenses but cuffe nevertheless took out the entire party landed them safe on the soil of their forefathers after a journey of fiftyfive days and paid the expense for the outfit transportation and maintenance of the remaining thirty amounting to no less than twentyfive thousand dollars out of his own pocket the colonists were cordially welcomed by the people of sierra leone and each family received from thirty to forty acres from the crown government he remained with the settlers two months and then returned home with the purpose of taking out another colony before however he could do so and while preparations were being made for the second colony he was taken ill after a protracted illness he died september in the fiftyninth year of his age at the time of his death he had no less than two thousand names of intending emigrants on his list awaiting transportation to africa as to his personal characteristics paul cuffe was tall wellformed and athletic his deportment conciliating yet dignified and prepossessing he was a member of the society of friends quakers and became a minister among them he believed it to be his duty to sacrifice private interest rather than engage in any enterprise however lawful or however profitable that had the slightest tendency to injure his fellow man he would not deal in intoxicating liquors or in slaves the black fairy fenton johnson little annabelle was lying on the lawn a volume of grimm before her annabelle was nine years of age the daughter of a colored lawyer and the prettiest dark child in the village she had long played in the fairyland of knowledge and was far advanced for one of her years a vivid imagination was her chief endowment and her story creatures often became real fleshandblood creatures i wonder she said to herself that afternoon if there is any such thing as a colored fairy surely there must be but in this book theyre all white closing the book her eyes rested upon the landscape that rolled itself out lazily before her the stalks in the cornfield bent and swayed their tassels bowing to the breeze until annabelle could have easily sworn that those were indian fairies and beyond lay the woods dark and mossy and cool and there many a something mysterious could have sprung into being for in the recess was a silvery pool where the children played barefooted a summer mist like a thin veil hung over the scene and the breeze whispered tales of faraway lands hist something stirred in the hazel bush near her can i describe little annabelles amazement at finding in the bush a palace and a tall and darkfaced fairy before it i am amunophis the lily of ethiopia said the strange creature and i come to the children of the seventh veil she was black and regal and her voice was soft and low and gentle like the niger on a summer evening her dress was the wing of the sacred beetle and whenever the wind stirred it played the dreamiest of music her feet were bound with golden sandals and on her head was a crown of lotus leaves and youre a fairy gasped annabelle yes i am a fairy just as you wished me to be i live in the tall grass many many miles away where a beautiful river called the niger sleeps and stretching herself beside annabelle on the lawn the fairy began to whisper illustration the black fairy i have lived there for over five thousand years in the long ago a city rested there and from that spot black men and women ruled the world great ships laden with spice and oil and wheat would come to its port and would leave with wines and weapons of war and fine linens proud and great were the black kings of this land their palaces were built of gold and i was the guardian of the city but one night when i was visiting an indian grove the barbarians from the north came down and destroyed our shrines and palaces and took our people up to egypt oh it was desolate and i shed many tears for i missed the busy hum of the market and the merry voices of the children but come with me little annabelle i will show you all this the rich past of the ethiopian she bade the little girl take hold of her hand and close her eyes and wish herself in the wood behind the cornfield annabelle obeyed and ere they knew it they were sitting beside the clear water in the pond you should see the niger said the fairy it is still beautiful but not as happy as in the old days the white mans foot has been cooled by its water and the white mans blossom is choking out the native flower and she dropped a tear so beautiful the costliest pearl would seem worthless beside it ah i did not come to weep she continued but to show you the past so in a voice sweet and sad she sang an old african lullaby and dropped into the water a lotus leaf a strange mist formed and when it had disappeared she bade the little girl to look into the pool creeping up annabelle peered into the glassy surface and beheld a series of vividly colored pictures first she saw dark blacksmiths hammering in the primeval forests and giving fire and iron to all the world then she saw the gold of old ghana and the bronzes of benin then the black ethiopians poured down upon egypt and the lands and cities bowed and flamed next she saw a great city with pyramids and stately temples it was night and a crimson moon was in the sky red wine was flowing freely and beautiful dusky maidens were dancing in a grove of palms old and young were intoxicated with the joy of living and a sense of superiority could be easily traced in their faces and attitude presently red flame hissed everywhere and the magnificence of remote ages soon crumbled into ash and dust persian soldiers ran to and fro conquering the band of defenders and severing the woman and children then came the mohammedans and kingdom on kingdom arose and with the splendor came ever more slavery the next picture was that of a group of fugitive slaves forming the nucleus of three tribes hurrying back to the wilderness of their fathers in houses built as protection against the heat the blacks dwelt communing with the beauty of water and sky and open air it was just between twilight and evening and their minstrels were chanting impromptu hymns to their gods of nature and as she listened closely annabelle thought she caught traces of the sorrow songs in the weird pathetic strains of the african music mongers from the east the warriors of the tribe came bringing prisoners whom they sold to white strangers from the west it is the beginning whispered the fairy as a large dutch vessel sailed westward twenty boys and girls bound with strong ropes were given to a miserable existence in the hatchway of the boat their captors were strange creatures pale and yellow haired who were destined to sell them as slaves in a country cold and wild where the palm trees and the cocoanut never grew and men spoke a language without music a light airy creature like an ancient goddess flew before the craft guiding it in its course that is i said the fairy in that picture i am bringing your ancestors to america it was my hope that in the new civilization i could build a race that would be strong enough to redeem their brothers they have gone through great tribulations and trials and have mingled with the blood of the fairer race yet though not entirely ethiopian they have not lost their identity prejudice is a furnace through which molten gold is poured heaven be merciful unto all races there is one more picture the greatest of all but farewell little one i am going going cried annabelle going i want to see the last picture and when will you return fairy when the race has been redeemed when the brotherhood of man has come into the world and there is no longer a white civilization or a black civilization but the civilization of all men i belong to the world council of the fairies and we are all colors and kinds why should not men be as charitable unto one another when that glorious time comes i shall walk among you and be one of you performing my deeds of magic and playing with the children of every nation race and tribe then annabelle you shall see the last picture and the best slowly she disappeared like a summer mist leaving annabelle amazed its a long way william stanley braithwaite its a long way the seawinds blow over the seaplains blue but longer far has my heart to go before its dreams come true its work we must and love we must and do the best we may and take the hope of dreams in trust to keep us day by day its a long way the seawinds blow but somewhere lies a shore thus down the tide of time shall flow my dreams forevermore negro music that stirred france emmett j scott you cannot defeat a singing nation a keenwitted observer has said in noting the victory spirit engendered by the martial music the patriotic songs and the stirring melodies of hearth and home that have moved the souls of men to action on all the battlefields of history send me more singing regiments cabled general pershing and admiral mayo sent frequent requests that a song leader organize singing on every battleship of the atlantic fleet since the morning stars sang together in scriptural narrative music has exerted a profound influence upon mankind be it in peace or in war in gladness or in sorrow or in the tender sentiment that makes for love of country affection for kindred or the divine passion for ye ladye fair music knows no land or clime no season or circumstance and no race creed or clan it speaks the language universal and appeals to all peoples with a force irresistible and no training in ethics or science is necessary to reach the common ground that its philosophy instinctively creates in the human understanding the war department was conscious of this and gave practical application to its theory that music makes a soldier fit to fight when it instituted through the commission on training camp activities a systematic program of musical instruction throughout the american army at the home cantonments and followed up the work overseas it was the belief that every man became a better warrior for freedom when his mind could be diverted from the dull routine of camp life by arousing his higher nature by song and that he fared forth to battle with a stouter heart when his steps were attuned to the march by bands that drove out all fear of bodily danger and robbed grimvisaged war of its terrors skilled song leaders were detailed to the various camps and cantonments here and abroad and bands galore were brought into service for inspiration and cheer the emotional nature of the negro fitted him for this musical program the colored american was a close up in every picture from the start to the finish and was a conspicuous figure in every scenario playing with credit and distinction alike in melody or with the musket no instrumentality was more potent than music in offsetting the propaganda of the wily german agents who sought to break down the loyalty of the negro the music he knew was intensely american in sentiment and rhythm it saturated his being and all the blandishments of the enemy were powerless to sway him from the flag he loved his grievances were overshadowed by the realization that the welfare of the nation was menaced and that his help was needed american music harmonized with the innate patriotism of the race and the majestic sweep of the starspangled banner or the sympathetic appeal of my country tis of thee were sufficient to counteract the sinister efforts of the missionaries of the hohenzollerns to move him from his moorings no labor is ever so onerous that it can bar music from the soul of black folk this race sings at work at play and in every mood visitors to any army camp found the negro doing musical stunts of some kind from reveille to taps every hour every minute of the day all the time the trumpeters were not blowing out actual routine bugle calls they were somewhere practicing them mouthorgans were going concertinas were being drawn back and forth and guitars banjos mandolins and whatnot were in use playing all varieties of music from the classic like lucia poet and peasant and il trovatore to the folksongs and the rollicking jazz music is indeed the chiefest outlet of the negros emotions and the state of his soul can best be determined by the type of melody he pours forth some writer has said that a handful of pipers at the head of a scotch regiment could lead that regiment down the mouth of a cannon it is not doubted that a negro regiment could be made to duplicate the charge of the light brigade at balaklava into the mouth of hell as tennyson puts it if one of their regimental bands should play as none but a colored band can play the vivacious strains of therell be a hot time in the old town tonight the negros love of home is an integral part of his nature and is exemplified in the themes he plaintively crooned in camp on both sides of the ocean such melodies as carry me back to old virginia my old kentucky home in the evening by de moonlight and swanee river recalled memories of the old folks at home and kept his patriotism alive for he hoped to return to them some day and swell their hearts with pride by reason of the glorious record he made at the front the negro is essentially religious and his deep spiritual temperament is vividly illustrated by the joy he finds in harmonizing such ballads of ancient days as swing low sweet chariot steal away to jesus standin in the need of prayer every time i feel the spirit i wan to be ready and roll jordan roll the negro is also an optimist whether he styles himself by that highsounding title or not and the sincerity of his make the best of it disposition is noted in the fervor he puts into those uplifting gems pack up your troubles in your old kit bag and smile smile smile theres a long long trail keep the home fires burning and goodbye broadway hello france just as the negro folksongs or songs of war interpreted with the characteristic negro flavor stirred all france and gave poilu and populace a taste of the real american music the marvelous jazz bands kept their feet patting and their shoulders eaglerocking to its infectious motion high officials are said to have been literally carried away with the jazz music furnished by the colored bands over there during the war general petain is said to have paid a visit at the height of the hostilities to a sector in which there were american troops and had the time of his life listening to a colored band playing the entrancing jazz music with some negro dance stunts in keeping with the spirit of the melodies he warmly congratulated the colored leader upon the excellence of the work of his organization and thanked him for the enjoyable entertainment that had been given him the stolid briton is scarcely less susceptible to the jazz than his volatile french brother for when another colored band from the states went to london to head a parade of american and english soldiers and halted at buckingham palace it is said that king george v and queen mary heard the lively airs with undisguised enthusiasm and were loath to have the players depart for the park where they were scheduled for a concert with a dance engagement under british military control to follow the colored bands scored heavily with the three great allied powers of europe by rendering with a brilliant touch and matchless finish their national anthems god save the queen la marseillaise and the marcia reale november this letter was written by a young first lieutenant colored in the th infantry company l nd division cleveland ohio november th my dearest mother and dad well folks its all over but the flowers yesterday it was war hard gruelling hideous today it is peace this morning i formed my platoon in line in the woods behind the line they didnt know why they were just a bunch of tired hardbitten mudspattered roughandtumble soldiers standing stoically at attention equally ready to go over the top rebuild a shelltorn road or march to a rest billet at i gave the command unload rifles they didnt know why and didnt particularly care then unload pistols and while they still stood rigid and motionless as graven images i read the order declaring armistice and cessation of hostilities effective at oclock the perfect discipline of these veteran soldiers held them still motionless but i could see their eyes begin to shine and their muscles to quiver as the import of this miraculous message began to dawn on them the tension was fast straining their nerves to the breakingpoint so i dismissed them you should have seen them they yelled till they were hoarse some sang others warhardened veterans who had faced the death hail of a machinegun with a laugh men who had gone through the horrors of artillery bombardments and had seen their fellows mangled and torn without a flinch broke down and cried like babies tonight something is wrong the silence is almost uncanny not a shot not even a single shell very faintly we can hear the mellow tones of the church bell in the little french town on the hill far to our rear all day long it has been singing its song of joy and thanksgiving it seems symbolical of the heart of france which today is ringing i dont know when im coming home but when i do i want a big roast turkey golden brown new spuds swimming in

stars a negro womans hospitality leila a pendleton mungo park a native of scotland was one of the first of noble brave men who devoted the best years of their lives to africa in when he was only twentyfour years old he went to west africa to find the source of the river niger one of the drawbacks of the west coast is its deadly climate and shortly after arriving at kano young park fell ill of fever and remained an invalid for five months while recovering he learned the language of the mandingoes a native tribe and this was a great help to him he finally started with only six natives on his journey had he been older and wiser he would have taken a larger company at one time they were captured by moors and a wild boar was turned loose upon them but instead of attacking park the beast turned upon its owners and this aroused their superstitious fears the king then ordered him to be put into a hut where the boar was tied while he and his chief officers discussed whether park should lose his right hand his eyes or his life but he escaped from them and after nearly two years of wandering in search of the nigers source during which time he suffered many hardships and had many narrow escapes he returned to kano the place where he had been ill at one time during his journey mr park arrived in the neighborhood of sego and as a white man had never been seen in that region before the natives looked upon him with fear and astonishment he asked to see the king but no one would take him across the river and the king sent word that he would by no means receive the strange traveler until he knew what the latter wanted park was tired hungry and discouraged and was preparing to spend the night in the branches of a tree when a native woman pitied him she invited him into her hut and with the hospitality for which the natives are noted shared with him her food by signs she made him understand that he might occupy the sleeping mat and as she and her daughter sat spinning they sang their native songs among them the following which was impromptu and composed in honor of the stranger the wind roared and the rain fell the poor white man faint and weary came and sat under our tree he has no mother to bring him milk no wife to grind his corn chorus let us pity the white man no mother has he to bring him milk no wife to grind his corn speaking of this incident park says trifling as this recital may appear to the reader to a person in my situation the circumstance was affecting in the highest degree i was oppressed by such unexpected kindness and sleep fled from my eyes and another writer says the name of the woman and the alabaster box of precious ointment the nameless widow who giving only two mites had given more than all the rich and this nameless woman of sego form a trio of feminine beauty and grandeur of which the sex in all ages may be proud record of the old fifteenth in france emmett j scott early in september the men of the th infantry were transferred from the th french division in which they had been serving and made an integral part of the st french division and then on the morning of september th they joined with the moroccans on the left and native french on the right in the offensive which won for the entire regiment the french croix de guerre and the citation of individual officers and enlisted men for the croix de guerre and the legion of honor for exceptional gallantry in action the action began at maisonsenchampagne it finished seven kilometers northward and eastward and over the intervening territory the germans had retreated before the ferocious attacks of the fifteenth and its french comrades a month later a new honor came to the regiment the honor of being the first unit of all the allied armies to reach the river rhine the regiment had left its trenches at thann sunday november and marching as the advance guard of the st division second french army reached the left bank of the rhine monday november the th is proud of this achievement it believes also that it was under fire for a greater number of days than any other american regiment its historian will record that the regiment never lost a man captured a trench or a foot of ground that it was the only unit in the american expeditionary force which bore a state name and carried a state flag that it was never in an american brigade or division that it saw the first and the longest service of any american regiment as part of a foreign army and that it had less training than any american unit before going into action negro

spear after supper the boys take up singing and dancing at this period they are taught also their duties to the gods to whom a certain portion of their meals is said to be offered each boy is taught the sacrificial ceremony they all clap dance and sing their song of praise when the boys have attained a certain advancement among other things they have sham battles with or boys on a side a district is given to one side to be captured by the other each side has a captain and at this stage of their development emphasis is placed upon the display of bravery and sometimes the contests assume aspects of reality when one side repulses another six times it is said to be victorious illustration in addition to being taught the methods of warfare the boys are taught the civil and military laws governing the vai people every vai man must know the law and as the penalties for violating the laws covering military expeditions are so severe the customs and laws relating thereto are of paramount importance to every vai man the members of the devil bush are not only taught everything pertaining to practical war but they are taught hunting as well they are first taught to capture small game and later the larger and dangerous animals like the leopard elephant and buffalo what the africans call a real hunt requires about a months work in preparation the boys dig a large pit and surround the ends and sides with the trunks of large trees with the pit of the apex in triangular form two fences are built about a mile long and with a mile between the two extremities the surrounding country is encircled by the hunters and the animals are driven into the pit the smaller animals are eaten and the larger ones are sent to the king as the valuable skins are preserved the boys are taught to skin animals neatly the ivories belong to the king and various small horns are kept for amulets and so on these hunts are usually accompanied with much singing and dancing after the cooking and eating of the game illustration the greegree bush is a society for the training of girls for future life just as the devil bush is for boys it is death for a man to be found within the limits of the greegree bush no matter what his purpose may be the sessions of the society are held near some town yet few in that town know the exact place no one is permitted to approach the scene usually girls are admitted at seven or eight years of age although women may be admitted the greegree bush has both an industrial and an educational purpose the girls are taught to embroider with gold and silver thread

pansy was getting some pretty hard blows she took them all goodnaturedly nevertheless and tried to give as good as she received much to the delight of her little boy friends a lady who was standing near afraid for the little girl chided the boys and said you shouldnt handle pansy so roughly you might hurt her and then pansy looked up in sweet surprise and said with amusing seriousness no they wont hurt me i dont break easy it was a thoroughly childlike expression but it had more wisdom in it than pansy knew she spoke of a little girls experience with dolls some of which as she had learned broke very easily pansy knew how delightful it was to have a doll that didnt break so easily though she was not a homely girl by any means yet she wanted it understood that she was not like a piece of china that was why the other children liked her so much because she knew how to rough it without crying or complaining at every turn pansy was not a crybaby there is all the time my dear boys and girls a great demand everywhere all through life for people who dont break easily people who know how to take hard knocks without going all to pieces the game of life is sometimes rough even among those who mean to play fair it is very trying when we have to deal with people who break easily and are always getting hurt and spoiling the game with their tears and complaints it is so much better when we have to deal with people who like little pansy do not break easily some of them will laugh off the hardest words without wincing at all you can jostle them as you will but they dont fall down every time you shove them and they dont cry every time they are pushed aside you cant but like them they take life so heartily and so sensibly you dont have to hold yourself in with them all the time you can let yourself out freely without being on pins as to the result young people of this class make good playmates or good workfellows as the case may be so boys and girls you must learn to rough it a little dont be a china doll going to smash at every hard knock if you get hard blows take them cheerily and as easily as you can even if some blow comes when you least expect it and knocks you off your feet for a minute dont let it floor you long everybody likes the fellow who can get up when he is knocked down and blink the tears away and pitch in again learning to get yourself accustomed to a little hard treatment will be good for you hard words and hard fortune often make us if we dont let them break us stand up to your work or play courageously and when you hear words that hurt when you are hit hard with the blunders or misdeeds of others when life goes roughly with you keep right on in a happy companionable courageous helpful spirit and let the world know that you dont break easily o little david play on your harp joseph s cotter jr o little david play on your harp that ivory harp with the golden strings and sing as you did in jewry land of the prince of peace and the god

may seem strange to those living in north america but a moments reflection will suffice to remind them that during these months the sun is south of the equator hence this natural result the strong southeast winds which are prevalent during the summer months often make it very unpleasant in cape town on account of the dust and one finds it most desirable occasionally to run out to one of the suburbs where cape doctor does not make such frequent and violent visits of the chain of beautiful and pleasant suburban towns following the railway north the most important as a summer resort is kalk bay one who has visited the beach at newport r i in the united states will upon visiting kalk bay see a resemblance unlike the long sweep of ocean at atlantic city the beach is narrow being rather a bay than an open ocean front instead of the cliffs as at newport we have the massive mountains standing almost perpendicularly on the east side at the foot of which the town is situated the principal vocation among the laboring men there is fishing in this respect it is very much like bermuda they go to sea and return according to the tide some days they are out by two and three oclock in the morning when they go this early they may be expected to return by noon or even before noon i was told that of the sixtyfive fishing boats on the bay fiftysix are owned by colored men there are six men to a crew five beside the captain who is the owner of the boat they sail out to sea drop anchor and fish with hook and line half of what is caught belongs to the captain and the other half is equally divided among the other five men they can scarcely supply the market so great is the demand for fish at the bay and in cape town we were informed that a captain has been known to make as much as eight pounds in a single day that is nearly forty dollars of course there are days when they have poorer luck some days the wind blows such a gale that they are unable to go to sea at all it is a beautiful sight to see the little fleet return hundreds of people will gather about the landing and await their coming farther up the bay a drag net is used on the day of our visit we were fortunate in being just in time to see a net land full of great fishes as the net is hauled near the shore the fishermen all get around it holding the lower portion of it down to keep the fish from escaping under it and holding the upper portion above the water to keep them from jumping over it as the fish are drawn into shallow water they become very active and notwithstanding the vigilance of the crew some will make their escape the captain would shout impulsively to the men i could not understand him as he expressed himself in cape dutch but from the contortions of his face and the frightened look of the men i guess he must have been using language that would not have been suitable in a church service a good haul some one remarked when the net was finally landed bishop atticus g haygood w h crogman it is indeed the peculiar glory of the truly great man that he cannot be restricted within the state lines or race lines wide as the sweep of his sympathies is the empire of hearts over which he rules to those of us therefore whose good fortune it was to be personally acquainted with bishop haygood it was never a surprise that his influence in both sections of country and among all classes of people was so large and so commanding he was a man of large sympathy that royal quality in the human breast which invariably distinguishes the generous person from the mean that divine quality which despite our prejudices and antipathies makes the whole world kin and is at the bottom of all christian and philanthropic endeavor a thousand instances of kindness on the part of the good bishop to persons of all sorts and colors might i suppose be cited here in support of the statement made with reference to his sympathetic disposition many of these little acts of pure benevolence never intended for the light are fast coming to light under the shadow cast by his death for as dark nights best reveal the stars so the gloom that at times envelopes a human life discovers to us its hidden virtues this much however the world knows in common of bishop haygood he was not a man who passed through life inquiring who is my neighbor his neighbor was the ignorant that needed to be instructed the vicious that needed to be reclaimed the despondent that needed to be encouraged wherever honest effort was being made for a noble purpose there he found his neighbor and his neighbor found a helper like the man of galilee he was abroad in the land studying the needs of the people and striving to reach and influence individual lives how two colored captains fell ralph w tyler a colored unit was ordered to charge and take if possible a very difficult objective held by the germans captains fairfax and green two colored officers were in command of the detachments they made the charge running into several miles of barbwire entanglements and hampered by a murderous fire from nests of german machine guns which were camouflaged just before charging one of the colored sergeants running up to captain fairfax said do you know there is a nest of german machine guns ahead the captain replied i only know we have been ordered to go forward and we are going those were the last words he said before giving the command to charge into the jaws of death the colored troops followed their intrepid leader with all the enthusiasm and dash characteristic of patriots and courageous fighters they went forward they obeyed the order and as a result sixtytwo men and two officers were listed in the casualties reported captain fairfaxs last words i only know we have been ordered to go forward and we are going are words that will forever live in the memory of his race they are words that match those of sergeant carney the color sergeant of the th massachusetts during the civil war who although badly wounded held the tattered shotpierced stars and stripes aloft and exclaimed the old flag never touched the ground men who have served under captains fairfax and green say two braver officers never fought and fell the young warrior james weldon johnson mother shed no mournful tears but gird me on my sword and give no utterance to thy fears but bless me with thy word the lines are drawn the fight

any other american regiment on planting artichokes from the life of scott bond daniel a rudd and theodore bond i was living at one time on a farm which i had bought near forrest city known as the neely farm it was also known as a fine fruit farm the land being upland was of a poor nature i bought the farm mainly on account of the health of my wife and children i paid old man neely for acres this farm was two and a half miles from my main bottom farm after moving on the neely place and getting straight i looked over the farm and finding that the land was far from fertile i decided to sow the whole farm in peas knowing peas were a legume and hence fine to put life into the soil i excepted several small spots that i planted in corn i got a fine stand of peas and looked as if i would make worlds of pea hay when the peas were ripe i took my mower and rake to harvest my hay crop this was the first time i had undertaken to cultivate this class of land i prepared to house the hay and after the hay was cut and raked i only got onetenth of the amount of hay i counted on i prepared the land that fall and sowed it down in clover i got a fine stand the clover grew and did well the next year i took two fourhorse wagons and hauled from the allen farm large loads of defective cotton seed i turned all this under and planted the land the next year in corn i made and gathered a large corn crop that year i was at that time taking a farm paper and i would usually sit at night and entertain my wife while she was sewing i read an article where a party in illinois had claimed that he had gathered bushels of artichokes from one acre of land that did not look reasonable to me at that time i said to my wife listen to what a mistake this fellow has made he claims to have gathered bushels of artichokes from one acre of land this seemed impossible to me in the next issue of this paper i read where another man claimed to have raised bushels to the acre this put me at a further wonder as to the artichoke crop i decided to try a crop of artichokes i had a very nice spot of land that i thought would suit me for this purpose i prepared it as i would prepare land for irish potatoes knowing that artichokes were like the irish potato a tuber i took a fourhorse wagon and hauled one and a half tons of rotten cotton seed and of this i put a double handful every inches apart in the drill i then dropped the artichokes between the hills i cultivated first as i would irish potatoes the plants grew luxuriantly and were all the way from to feet tall about the th of august i noticed the plants were blooming and it occurred to me that there must be artichokes on the roots i got my spade and began to dig i could not find a single artichoke i took my spade back home and decided within myself that both parties were mistaken when they claimed to have grown so many hundreds of bushels to the acre after a few days i went to my lower farm and started picking cotton and was as busy as busy could be all that fall gathering and housing my cotton crop as usual just before christmas i promised my wife that i would be at home on christmas eve in order to accompany her to our church conference i was on time according to my promise helped her to get her household affairs straight and the children settled i had bought my wife a beautiful cape she took the cape i took my overcoat and off we went in order to take a near route we decided to climb the fence and go through the artichoke patch as we had none of the children along i helping her over the fence recalled our old days when we were courting i remarked to her gee whiz wife you certainly look good under that cape she said do you think so yes i have always thought that you looked good by this time we had gotten to the middle of the artichoke patch i grabbed an artichoke stalk and tried to pull it up i made one or two surges and it failed to come but in bending it over i found a great number of artichokes attached to the tap root i asked my wife to wait a few minutes she asked me what i was going to do i told her i would run back and get the grubbing hoe and see what is under these artichokes she said doesnt this beat the band stop on your way to church to go to digging artichokes all right i will be back in a few minutes i came with my grubbing hoe and went to work i dug on all sides of the stalk then raised it up i believe i am safe in saying there was a half bushel of artichokes on the roots of this stalk i then noticed that the dirt in the drills the sides of the rows and the middles were all puffed up one could not stick the end of his finger in the ground without touching an artichoke i found that the whole earth was matted with artichokes i really believe that had i had a full acre in and could have gathered all the artichokes i would have gotten at least bushels i told my wife that now i could see that those people had told the truth when they said they had gathered bushels and bushels to the acre when i returned from church i at once turned my hogs into the artichoke patch i then climbed up on the fence and took a seat to watch the hogs root and crush artichokes i looked around and saw my clover had made a success the little artichoke patch had turned out wonderfully i said to myself just think of millions and millions of dollars deposited in all these lands both rich and poor soils and just to think how easy this money could be obtained if one would think right and hustle a song of thanks edward smyth jones for the sun that shone at the dawn

seem to be almost as dependent upon kind treatment and affection as human beings horses and dogs especially are the most keenly intelligent of our dumb friends and are alike sensitive to cruelty in any form they are influenced to an equal degree by kind and affectionate treatment if there is any form of cruelty that is more blameworthy than another it is abuse of a faithful horse who gives his life to the service of the owner when a horse is pulling a heavy load with all his might doing the best he can to move under it to strike him spur him or swear at him is barbarous to kick a dog around or strike him with sticks just for the fun of hearing him yelp or seeing him run is equally barbarous no highminded man no highminded boy or girl would do such a thing we should never forget how helpless in a large sense dumb animals are and how absolutely dependent upon the humanity and kindness of their owners they are really the slaves of man having no language by which to express their feelings or needs the poet cowper said i would not enter on my list of friends though graced with polished manners and fine sense yet wanting sensibility the man who needlessly sets foot upon a worm boys and girls should be willing to pledge themselves to be kind to all harmless living creatures and every boy and girl should strive to protect such creatures from cruel usage on the part of others it is noble boys and girls for us to speak for those that cannot speak for themselves and it is noble also for us to protect those that cannot protect themselves a legend of the blue jay ruth anna fisher it was a hot sultry day in may and the children in the little school in virginia were wearily waiting for the gong to free them from lessons for the day furtive glances were directed towards the clock the call of the birds and fields was becoming more and more insistent would the hour never strike the planting of the appletree had no interest for them little attention was given the boy as he read in a singsong spiritless manner what plant we in this appletree buds which the breath of summer days shall lengthen into leafy sprays boughs where the thrush with crimson breast shall haunt and sing and hide her nest the teacher who had long since stopped trying to make the lesson interesting found herself saying mechanically what other birds have their nests in the appletree the boy shifted lazily from one foot to the other as he began the sparrow the robin and wrens and the snowbirds and bluejays no they dont bluejays dont have nests came the excited outburst from some of the children much to the surprise of the teacher when order was restored some of these brownskinned children who came from the heart of the virginian mountains told this legend of the bluejay long long years ago the devil came to buy the bluejays soul for which he first offered a beautiful golden ear of corn this the bluejay liked and wanted badly but said no i cannot take it in exchange for my soul then the devil came again this time with a bright red ear of corn which was even more lovely than the golden one this too the bluejay refused at last the devil came to offer him a wonderful blue ear this one the bluejay liked best of all but still was unwilling to part with his soul then the devil hung it up in the nest and the bluejay found that it exactly matched his own brilliant feathers and knew at once that he must have it the bargain was quickly made and now in payment for that one blue ear of corn each friday the bluejay must carry one grain of sand to the devil and sometimes he gets back on sunday but oftener not until monday very seriously the children added and all the bad people are going to burn until the bluejays have carried all the grains of sand in the ocean to the devil the teacher must have smiled a little at the legend for the children cried out again it is so deed it is for doesnt the black spot on the bluejay come because he gets his wings scorched and he doesnt have a nest like other birds then to dispel any further doubts the teacher might have they asked triumphantly you never saw a bluejay on friday did you there was no need to answer for just then the gong sounded and the children trooped happily out to play david livingstone benjamin brawley when livingstone began his work of exploration in practically all of africa between the sahara and the dutch settlements in the extreme south was unknown territory by the time of his death in he had brought this entire region within the view of civilization on his first journey or series of journeys starting from cape town he made his way northward for a thousand miles to lake ngami then pushing on to linyanti he undertook one of the most perilous excursions of his entire career his objective for more than a thousand miles being loanda on the west coast which point he reached after six months in the wilderness coming back to linyanti he turned his face eastward discovered victoria falls on the zambesi and finally arrived at cuilimane on the coast on his second series of journeys he explored the zambesi the shire and the rovuma rivers in the east and discovered lake nyasa on his final expedition in hunting for the upper courses of the nile he discovered lakes tanganyika mweru and bangweolo and the lualaba river his achievement as an explorer was as distinct as it was unparalleled his work as a missionary and his worth as a man it is not quite so easy to express concretely but in these capacities he was no less distinguished and his accomplishment no less signal there had been missionaries and great ones in africa before livingstone the difference between livingstone and consecrated men was not so much in devotion as in the conception of the task he himself felt that a missionary in the africa of his day was to be more than a mere preacher of the word that he would have also to be a christian statesman and even a director of exploration and commerce if need be this was his title to greatness to him the end of the geographical feat was only the beginning of the enterprise knowing however that many honest persons did not sympathize with him in this conception of his mission after he declined longer to accept salary from the missionary society that originally sent him out working afterwards under the patronage of the british government and the royal geographical society his sympathy and his courtesy were unfailing even when he himself was placed in the greatest danger said henry drummond of him wherever david livingstones footsteps are crossed in africa the fragrance of his memory seems to remain on one occasion a hunter was impaled on the horn of a rhinoceros and a messenger ran eight miles for the physician although he himself had been wounded for life by a lion and his friends insisted that he should not ride at night through a wood infested with wild beasts livingstone insisted on his christian duty to go only to find that the man had died and to have to retrace his footsteps again and again his party would have been destroyed by some savage chieftain if it had not been for his own unbounded tact and courage to the devoted men who helped him he gave the assurance that he would die before he would permit them to be taken and after his death at chitambos village susi and chuma journeyed for nine months and over eight hundred miles of dangerous country to take his body to the coast livingstone was a man of tremendous faith in his mission in his country in humanity in god he wrote on one occasion this age presents one great fact in the providence of god missions are sent forth to all quarters of the world missions not of one section of the church but from all sections and from nearly all christian nations it seems very unfair to judge of the success of these by the number of the conversions that have followed these are rather proofs of the missions being of the right sort the fact which ought to stimulate us above all others is not that we have contributed to the conversion of a few souls however valuable these may be but that we are diffusing a knowledge of christianity throughout the world future missionaries will see conversions follow every sermon we prepare the way for them we work for a glorious future which we are not destined to see the golden age which has not been but will yet be we are only morningstars shining in the dark but the glorious morn will break the good time coming yet for this time we work may god accept our imperfect service of such quality was david livingstone missionary explorer philanthropist for thirty years his life was spent in an unwearied effort to evangelize the native races to explore the undiscovered secrets and abolish the desolating slave trade of central africa to what extent after sixty years have we advanced toward his ideals with what justice are we the inheritors of his renown ira aldridge william j simmons the name of aldridge has always been placed at the head of the list of negro actors he has indeed become the most noted of them and his name is cited as standing first in his calling among all colored persons who have ever appeared on the stage he was born at belaire near baltimore in in complexion he was dark brown and with heavy whiskers standing six feet in height with heavy frame african features and yet with due proportions he was graceful in his attitudes highly polished in manners in his early days he was apprenticed to a ship carpenter and had his association with the germans on the western shores of maryland here he became familiar with the german language and spoke it not only with ease but with fluency he was brought in contact with edmund kean the great actor in whom he accompanied in his trip through europe his ambition to become an actor was encouraged by kean and receiving his assistance in the preparation he made his appearance first at the royalty theatre in london in the character of othello public applause greeted him of such an extraordinary nature that he was billed to appear at the covent garden theatre april in the same character after many years successful appearances in many of the metropolitan cities he appeared in the provinces with still greater success in ireland he performed othello with edmund kean as iago in he appeared in germany in shakespearean characters he was pronounced excellent and though a stranger and a foreigner he undertook the very difficult task of playing in english while his whole support was rendered in the language of the country it is said that until this time such an experiment was not considered susceptible of a successful end but nevertheless with his impersonations he succeeded admirably it is said that the king of prussia was so deeply moved with his appearance in the character of othello at berlin that he spent him a congratulatory letter and conferred upon him the title of chevalier in recognition of his dramatic genius and informed him that the lady who took the part of desdemona was so much affected at the manner in which he played his part that she was made ill from fright on account of the reality with which he acted his part some idea of the character of his acting might be gained from the fact that the lady who played desdemona in st petersburg became very much alarmed at what appeared real passion on his part in acting othello though he was never rough or indelicate in any of his acting with ladies yet she was so frightened that she used to scream with real fear it is said that on another occasion in st petersburg that in the midst of his acting in scene two act five when he was quoting these words it is the cause it is the cause my soul let me not name it to you you chaste stars it is the cause yet ill not shed her blood nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow and smooth as monumental alabaster yet she must die else shell betray more men put out the light and then put out the light if i quench thee thou flaming minister i can again thy former light restore should i repent me but once put out thy light thou cunningst pattern of excelling nature i know not where is that promethean heat that can thy light relume when i have plucked thy rose i cannot give it vital growth again it needs must wither ill smell it on the tree kissing her o balmy breath that dost almost persuade justice to break her sword one more one more be thus when thou art dead and i will kill thee and love thee after one more and this the last so sweet was neer so fatal i must weep but they are cruel tears this sorrows heavenly it strikes where it doth love the house was so carried away with the manner in which he rendered it that a young man stood up and exclaimed with the greatest earnestness she is innocent othello she is innocent and yet so interested was he in the acting himself that he never moved a muscle but continued as if nothing had been said to embarrass him the next day he learned while dining with a russian prince that a young man who had been present had been so affected by the play that he had been seized with a sudden illness and died the next day mr aldridge was a welcome guest in the ranks of the cultured and wealthy and was often in the salons of the haughty aristocrats of st petersburg and moscow titled ladies wove knitted and stitched their pleasing emotions into various memorials of friendship in his palatial residence at sydenham near london were collected many presents of intrinsic value rendered almost sacred by association prominent among these tokens of regard was an autographic letter from the king of prussia transmitting the first medal of art and sciences the cross of leopold from the emperor of russia and a maltese cross received at berne in all his triumphs he never lost interest in the condition of his race he always took an interest in everything touching their welfare and though exalted to the companionship of those who ranked high in every department of life yet he never in any way forgot the humble race with which he was identified and was always solicitous for their welfare and promotion he was an associate of the most prominent men of paris among whom was alexander dumas when the great tragedian and great writer met they always kissed each other and dumas always greeted aldridge with the words mon confrиre he died at lodes in poland august fifty years james weldon johnson o brothers mine today we stand where half a century sweeps our ken since god through lincolns ready hand struck off our bonds and made us men just fifty years a winters day as runs the history of a race yet as we look back oer the way how distant seems our starting place look farther back three centuries to where a naked shivering score snatched from their haunts across the seas stood wildeyed on virginias shore far far the way that we have trod from heathen kraals and jungle dens to freedmen freemen sons of god americans and citizens a part of his unknown design weve lived within a mighty age and we have helped to write a line on historys most wondrous page a few black bondmen strewn along the borders of our eastern coast now grown a race ten million strong an upward onward marching host then let us here erect a stone to mark the place to mark the time a witness to gods mercies shown a pledge to hold this day sublime and let that stone an altar be whereon thanksgivings we may lay where we in deep humility for faith and strength renewed may pray with open hearts ask from above new zeal new courage and new powrs that we may grow more worthy of this country and this land of ours for never let the thought arise that we are here on sufferance bare outcasts asylumed neath these skies and aliens without part or share this land is ours by right of birth this land is ours by right of toil we helped to turn its virgin earth our sweat is in its fruitful soil where once the tangled forest stood where flourished once rank weed and thorn behold the pathtraced peaceful wood the cotton white the yellow corn to gain these fruits that have been earned to hold these fields that have been won our arms have strained our backs have burned bent bare beneath a ruthless sun that banner which is now the type of victory on field and flood remember its first crimson stripe was dyed by attucks willing blood and never yet has come the cry when that fair flag has been assailed for men to do for men to die that have we faltered or have failed weve helped to bear it rent and torn through many a hotbreathd battle breeze held in our hands it has been borne and planted far across the seas and never yet o haughty land let us at least for this be praised has one black treasonguided hand ever against that flag been raised then should we speak but servile words or shall we hang our heads in shame stand back of newcome foreign hordes and fear our heritage to claim no stand erect and without fear and for our foes let this suffice weve bought a rightful sonship here and we have more than paid the price and yet my brothers well i know the tethered feet the pinioned wings the spirit bowed beneath the blow the heart grown faint from wounds and stings the staggering force of brutish might that strikes and leaves us stunned and dazed the long vain waiting through the night to hear some voice for justice raised full well i know the hour when hope sinks dead and round us everywhere hangs stifling darkness and we grope with hands uplifted in despair courage look out beyond and see the far horizons beckoning span faith in your godknown destiny we are a part of some great plan because the tongues of garrison and phillips now are cold in death think you their work can be undone or quenched the fires lit by their breath think you that john browns spirit stops that lovejoy was but idly slain or do you think those precious drops from lincolns heart were shed in vain that for which millions prayed and sighed that for which tens of thousands fought for which so many freely died god cannot let it come to naught a great kingdom in the congo william henry sheppard i had studied the new dialect of the bakuba and had made every preparation for our expedition into the forbidden land of king lukenga i had met their people a far interior tribe and was interested in their apparent superiority in physique manners dress and dialect i asked to be allowed to accompany them to their country and king but they said it was impossible their king would never allow a foreigner to come into the interior nevertheless i determined to seek them out and after some weeks had elapsed i called our station natives together and laid plainly before them the perils of the journey i told them from the information which i had that the trails which had been made by elephant buffalo antelope and bakuba natives were many and they led over long hot sandy plains through deep dark forests across streams without bridges and through swamps infested with wild animals and poisonous serpents and above all the king had sent word throughout the land that we could not enter his country not a mans muscle moved and there was not a dissenting voice i had picked up the bakuba dialect from some of the kings traders and tax collectors who journeyed our way i received from them much information of the general direction leading north toward the capital the names of large towns on the way of the market towns the approximate distances apart the streams to be crossed and their names of the leopard buffalo and elephant zones and the names of some of the chiefs of the market towns etc two days later when all was in readiness tents loaded cooking utensils a bag of money cowrie shells some salt etc we left luebo led by the masters hand the trail lay northeast by north with a gradual ascent the country was well wooded and watered no stones could be seen anywhere and the soil was sandy there were many extensive plains with magnificent palm trees hundreds and thousands of them ranging from a foot high which the elephants fed upon to those fifty and sixty feet high the forest everywhere was ever green trees blossomed and bloomed sending out upon the gentle breeze their fragrance so acceptable to the traveler festoons of moss and running vines made the forest look like a beautifully painted theatre or an enormous swinging garden in the meantime word had come to the king of lukenga of our presence and as we neared his kingdom we were met by a party of fighting men my caravan had been resting in the village of a chief named kueta who had repeatedly urged me to turn back and as the righting men of king lukenga appeared the chiefs men fled to the forest i sat quietly however in my seat in front of my tent and my people began to gather around my chair the youngest of the caravan nestling on his knees very close to me the kings people drew near and the leading man spear in hand called to chief kueta in a voice that rang through the village now hear the words of king lukenga because you have entertained a foreigner in your village we have come to take you to the capital for trial i knew things were now serious so rising from my seat i called to the head man to meet me half way he paid no attention i called a second time and walked up to him and began to plead for chief kueta i understand you are sent by your king to arrest these people it is the word of the king said he i continued the chief of this village is not guilty he gave me warning and told me to go away to return the way i had come and i did not it is my fault and not kuetas the leader leaning on his spear replied you speak our language i do was my quick answer that is strange said he the leader and his men moved off some distance and talked between themselves in a little while he came back to me saying i will return to the capital and report these things to the king i said to him tell your king i am not a bad man i do not steal or kill i have a message for him wait a moment said i taking from one of my boxes a very large cowrie shell near the size of ones fist and holding it up i said this we call the father of cowries present it to the king as a token of friendship the men were soon off for the capital and we settled down hoping and praying for the best kueta told me that the head man was king lukengas son and his name was ntoinzide ntoinzide stood more than six feet of bronze color blind in one eye determined set lips and seemed a man fearless of any foe man or beast the villagers told me many things of the kings son both good and bad after some days the messengers reached the capital and reported to king lukenga we saw the foreigner he speaks our language he knows all the trails of the country the king was astonished and called a council and laid the matter before them they deliberated over the affair and finally told the king that they knew who i was the foreigner who is at bixibing said they who has come these long trails and who speaks our language is a makuba one of the early settlers who died and whose spirit went to a foreign country and now he has returned the messengers hastened to return and accompany me to the capital we had been longing and praying for days for the best with the kings special envoy were many more men who had come through mere curiosity as was their custom ntoinzide stood in the center of the town and called with his loud voice saying who i was and giving briefly my history the villagers were indeed happy they flocked around as the kings son drew near and extended their hands to me i arose from my chair and made these remarks i have heard distinctly all that you have said but i am not a makuba i have never been here before ntoinzide insisted that they were right and said that his father the king wanted me to come on at once to the capital the people were mighty happy kueta our host the townspeople and my people too their appetites came back and so did mine with a hasty goodbye gala hola to kueta we were off on the last morning our trail grew larger the country more open and the ascent greater until we stood upon an extensive plain and had a beautiful view in every direction of all the land as far as we could see we could see in the distance thousands and thousands of banana and palm trees and our escort of bakuba cried out muxenge muxenge meaning capital capital just before entering the great town we were halted at a small guard post consisting of a few houses and some men who were the kings watchmen they told me that on each of the four entrances to the capital these sentries were stationed a man was dispatched to notify the king that we were near in a short while the people came out of the town to meet and greet us hundreds of them and many little children too some of my caravan were frightened and would run away but i told them that the oncoming crowd meant no harm ntoinzide the kings son with spear in hand took the lead and the interested and excited crowd after getting a peep at me fell in behind we marched down a broad clean street lined on both sides by interested spectators jostling gesticulating talking aloud and laughing the young boys and girls struck up a song which sounded to me like a band of sweet music and we all kept step to it ntoinzide called a halt at a house which i presume was x feet in size you could enter the doors front and back almost without stooping the house was made like all the others of bamboo and had two rooms there were a number of clay pots of various sizes for cooking and six large gourds for water my caravan was comfortably housed i did not put up my tent but took my seat in a reclining chair under a large palm tree in front of my door the crowd was immense but we had them sit down on the ground so we could get a breath of air in the afternoon the king sent greetings and fourteen goats six sheep a number of chickens corn pumpkins large dried fish bushels of peanuts bunches of bananas and plantains and a calabash of palm oil and other food the prime minister ndola who brought the greetings mentioned that the king would see me next day also that the kings servants would take out of the village all goats and chickens which i did not want for immediate use for said ndola no sheep goats hogs dogs ducks or chickens are allowed in the kings town in the evening we started our song service and i delivered to them our kings message the crowd was great the order was good i went to rest with the burden of these people upon my heart and thanking god that he had led protected and brought us through close places safely to the forbidden land early in the morning we heard the blast of ivory horns calling the attention of the people to put on their best robes and be in readiness for the big parade i saw there was great activity in the town men and women hurrying to and fro soon two stalwart bakuba with their red kilts on and feathers in their hats appeared before my house and announced their readiness to accompany me before king lukenga they noticed an old brass button tied by a string around the neck of one of my men very politely they removed it saying only the king can wear brass or copper i was dressed in what had once been white linen coat trousers white canvas shoes and pith helmet the officials on either side took me by the arm we walked a block up the broad street turned to the right and walked three blocks till we came to the big town square thousands of the villagers had already taken their position and were seated on the green grass king lukenga his high officials and about of his wives occupied the eastern section of the square the players of stringed instruments and drummers were in the center and as we appeared a great shout went up from the people the kings servants ran and spread leopard skins along the ground leading to his majesty i approached with some timidity the king arose from his throne of ivory stretched forth his hand and greeted me with these words wyni you have come i bowed low clapped my hands in front of me and answered ndini nyimi i have come king as the drums beat and the harps played the kings sons entered the square and danced one after the other single handed brandishing their big knives in the air the kings great chair or throne was made of carved tusks of ivory and his feet rested upon lion skins i judged him to have been a little more than six feet high and with his crown which was made of eagle feathers he towered over all the kings dress consisted of a red loin cloth draped neatly about his waist in many folds he wore a broad belt decorated with cowrie shells and beads his armlets and anklets were made of polished cowrie shells reaching quite above the wrists and ankles these decorations were beautifully white his feet were painted with powdered canwood resembling morocco boots the king weighed about pounds he wore a pleasant smile he looked to be eighty years old but he was as active as a middleaged man as the sun was setting in the west the king stood up made a slight bow to his people and to me his slaves were ready with his cowriestudded hammock to take him to his place for his feet must never touch the ground his hammock was like the body of a buggy carried on two long poles upon the shoulders of many men through the shouts of the people i was accompanied back to my resting place it was the most brilliant affair i had seen in africa but my i was so glad when it was all over the town was laid off east and west the broad streets ran at right angles and there were blocks just as in any town those in a block were always related in some way around each house is a court and a high fence made of heavy matting of palm leaves and around each block there is also a high fence so you enter these homes by the many gates each block has a chief called mbambi and he is responsible to king lukenga for his block when the king will deliver a message to the whole village or part of it these chiefs are sent for and during the early evenings they ring their iron hand bells and call out in a loud voice the message in five minutes the king desired of his own heart to give me peanuts for my people i heard the messengers delivering the word and the next morning we had more peanuts than we could manage there was not a visible light anywhere in the whole town a chunk or two is always kept smouldering in the center of the house on the clay floor the housewife is always careful to have a handful of split dry bamboo near and when anyone is stung by a scorpion or snake which often happens they start up a blaze and hunt for the intruder and medicine when there is neither moon nor stars it is truly a land of awful darkness and is made more dismal by the yelping of the jackal on the plain the moon shines more brightly and beautifully than on lukengas plain and the beauty is enhanced by the thousands of majestic palms and the singing of birds with voices like the mocking bird and the nightingale i have sat in front of my house moonlight nights until and oclock every morning the courts and streets were swept men who had committed some offense were compelled to pull weeds and sweep the streets clean there is a rule in all bakuba villages that every man every day sweep before his own door the only littered places i observed were at the four public entrances of the town where markets were held daily at am noon and pm sugar cane pulp banana and plantain peelings and peanut shells when the kings drum taps the signal about pm at the conclusion of the sleep song there is not a sound again in the whole village all the natives we have met in the kasal are on the whole honest our private dwellings have never been locked day or night your pocketbook is a sack of cowries or salt tied at the mouth with a string but now and then something happens nsusa one of the boys of my caravan misappropriated some cowries i called him in the presence of two witnesses in question about the matter he acknowledged removing the shells and innocently remarked you are the same as my father and what is his is mine from the great lukenga plateau as far as the eye can look you see villages dotted everywhere you never find a family living alone isolated from the village the people live together for mutual protection from enemies and animals and usually everybody in a village is related in some near or distant way but it does not keep them from fighting occasionally the bakuba are monogamists a young man sees a girl whom he likes he has met her in his own town or at some other or perhaps at a market place or a dance he sends her tokens of love bananas plantains peanuts dried fish or grasshoppers she in turn sends him similar presents they often meet sit down on the green laugh and talk together i have seen the girls often blush and really put on airs he asks her to have him if she has no one else on her heart and tells her that he wants no one to eat the crop that is in the field but her the girl and the parents both agree on a set day when the market is in full blast with hundreds of people from everywhere the young man and girl with their young friends all dressed in their best robes meet and march indian file through the open market and receive congratulations from everybody the new bride and groom continue their march to the already prepared house of the young man a feast of goat sheep monkey chicken or fish with plenty of palm wine is served and all is ended with a big dance the women of the kings household select their own husbands and no man dare decline and no man would ever be so rude or presumptuous as to ask for the hand and heart of royalty the husband knows that he must cut down the forest and assist in planting corn millet beans pease sweet potatoes and tobacco hunt for game bring the palm wine palm nuts make his wifes garments and repair the house he is never to be out after oclock at night unless sitting up at a wake or taking part in a public town dance the young man before marriage sends a certain number of wellwoven mats and so many thousands of cowries to the parents of the girl as a dowry if they cease to love and must part even twenty rainy seasons from marriage the dowry or its equivalent is returned to the man the wife is expected to shave and anoint the husbands body with palm oil keep his toenails and fingernails manicured bring water and wood help in the field cook his food and take care of the children i have had many a man come and ask to buy love medicine they think charms and medicine can do anything i always told them of course that it was a matter of the girls heart and charms or medicine could not help out in their love affairs the bakuba are morally a splendid people i have asked a number of bakuba what was their real ideal of life and they invariably answered to have a big corn field marry a good wife and have many children we were astounded when we saw the first newborn baby it was so very light but in a few weeks the youngster rallied to his colors and we were assured that he would never change again no baby is born in the regularly occupied house a small house is built in the back yard and is surrounded by a fence of palm fronds no one is admitted into the enclosure but a few women the new youngster receives a bath of palm oil then the notice is given and all the friends of the family with jugs of cold water vie with each other in giving mother and baby a shower bath the drums beat and the dance in water and mud continues for hours until you get accustomed to it you would be horrified to see the mothers stuff their young babies the mother nurses the baby just as any mother but she doesnt think that sufficient so she has by her side a small pot of soft corn pone and a pot of water or palm oil she makes a large pill from the pone dips it in the water or oil and while the baby is lying on his back in her lap these pills are dropped in its mouth then the mother uses the forefinger to force the collection of pills down its throat as the baby resists and kicks water is poured down its throat to facilitate the process if the baby strangles the mother will shake him up and down a few times when the feeding is over he certainly looks stuffed the bakuba children have many games and but few toys the girls have wooden dolls made by their fathers and the boys make from bamboo bows and arrows they shoot mice lizards grasshoppers crickets caterpillars butterflies lightning bugs etc they make mud pies and play market and tie the legs of may and june bugs to see them fly around and buzz they love to play housekeeping they are also trained to do some work as bringing wood sweeping or looking after the younger ones there are no knives forks or dishes to wash baby talk is not used and the parents speak to the babies just as though they were speaking to grownups i have seen the children in the streets drawing with a pointed stick or their finger on the smooth sand men leopards monkeys crocodiles birds snakes and other animals the boys make a heap of clay and sod it and with great speed run upon it and turn a somersault lighting on their feet a string of them together will play leap frog and hideandseek is great sport with them in all these amusements they keep up a song there is one thing you will certainly see them doing both boys and girls and that is beating their clenched fists into the hard clay just as hard as they can drive a year later you will see them driving their knuckles against a log or a tree in this way they become hardened and are used as a weapon in fights when they are grown and too they can butt like a goat so in their family fights they not only use their fists but their heads i spent hours at king lukengas and other villages playing with the little folks and trying to find out what they were thinking about they had a name for the sun and moon names for very brilliant and prominent stars and ordinary ones the sun was the father of the heavens the moon was his wife and the stars were their children the sun after going down was paddled around in a very large canoe on the great water by men who were more than human and started in the skies again they knew that a year was divided into two general seasons the rainy eight moons the dry four moons though even in the rainy season it doesnt rain every day and very seldom all day at any time and in the dry season there is an occasional refreshing shower they knew the names of all the lakes rivers and small streams roots that were good for medicine or to eat they knew flowers and ferns were called by name the names of all the many varieties of trees birds and animals they knew i was surprised to know from maxamalinge the kings son that every month the king had all the little children of the town before him and he in turn would talk to them as a great and good father to his own children the king would have his servants give to each boy and girl a handful of peanuts when they were out of the kings quarters there was many a scrap over these peanuts i grew very fond of bakuba and it was reciprocated they were the finest looking race i had seen in africa dignified graceful courageous honest with an open smiling countenance and really hospitable their knowledge of weaving embroidering wood carving and smelting was the highest in equatorial africa pillars of the state william c jason young people are the
