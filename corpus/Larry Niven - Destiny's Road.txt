bednacourt junior at fourteen had grown tall enough to reach the highest cupboard she stretched up on tiptoe found the speckles shaker by feel and brought it down then she saw what was happening to the bacon she shouted jemjemjemmv jemmys elevenyearold mind was all in the world beyond the window junior snatched up a pot holder and moved the pan off the burner the bacon wasnt burned not yet not quite sorry jemmy said without turning junior theres a caravan coming you never saw a caravan junior looked through the long window northeastward dust maybe its the caravan here turn thisjenimy finished cooking the bacon junior shook salt and speckles on the eggs sparingly and returned the shaker to the cupboard brenda who should have been stirring the eggs and thonny and greegry and ronn were all crowded along the long windowthe bloocher familys major treasure one sheet of glass a meter tall three meters from side to side to watch what was after all only a dust plume they ate bread and scrambled hens eggs and orange juice brenda who was ten fed jane who was four months old mom and dad had been up for hours doing farmwork mom was eating poached platyfish eggs platyfish were destiny life their bodies didnt make fat mom was trying to lose weight jemmy wolfed his breakfast for all the good that did the rest of the children were finished too the younger kids squirmed like their chairs were on fire but you couldnt ask mom and dad to hurry they werent exactly dawdling but the kids urgency amused them the long window was behind jemmy if he turned his back on the rest of the family dad would snap at him junior emptied her coffee mug with no sign of haste very adult and set it down mom can you handle jane and ronny sevenyearold ronny gaped in shock before he could scream mom said ill take care of the baby dear but you take ronny with you he has to do his schoolwork ronny relaxed though his eyes remained wary junior stood her voice became a drill sergeants we set brenda thonny greegty ronny and jemmy surged toward the door there was a pileup in the lock while they sorted out their coats and caps and then they cycled through in two clusters out of the house streaming toward the road junior followed the younger three were halfrunning but junior with her long legs kept up with them she wasnt trying to catch jemmy who at eleven had no dignity to protect the sun wasnt above the mountains yet but quicksilver was a bright spark dim in daylight the line of elms was as old as bloocher house they were twentyfive meters from the front of the house the last barrier between bloocher farm and the road to jemmy they seemed to partition earth and sky he ran between two elms and was first to reach the road to the right the road curved gradually toward spiral town left northwest it ran straight into the unknown that way lay warkan farm where four midteens stood in pairs to watch the dust plume come near the warkan children had been schooled at bloocher house as had their parents before them then when jemmy was six the bloocher household computer died for the next week or two dad was silent and dangerous jemmy came to understand that a major social disaster had taken place for five years now jemmy and his siblings and all of the warkan children had trooped three houses around the roads curve to use the hann computer the dust plume no longer hid what was coming toward spiral town there were big carts pulled by what must be chugs jemmy saw more than one cart hard to tell how many children from farther up the road were running alongside their voices carried a long way but it was too far to make out words his siblings had filtered between the trees they lined the road waiting jemmy looked toward the warkan kids looked back at junior saw her shake her head he said aw junior what about class wait junior said of course there had been no serious thought of rushing to class not with a caravan coming theyd make up missed classes afterward computer programs would wait and a human teacher was rarely needed children began to separate at juniors age boys spoke only to boys girls to girls jemmy knew that much maybe hed understand why when he was older now he only knew that junior would speak to him only to give orders he missed his big sister and junior hadnt even gone anywhere if junior went to join the warkan girls the warkan boys would stare at her and rack their brains thinking of some excuse to talk to her so jemmy almost understood why the whole family simply waited by the elms while the wagons came near the wagons had flat roofs twice as high as a grown mans head they moved at walking speed you could hear the children who ran alongside carrying on shouted conversations with the merchants there were deeper voices too adults were negotiating with merchants in the wagons when the caravan reached the warkan farm the warkans joined them boys and girls together it didnt matter a few minutes later the troop had reached the bloocher children it was jemmys first close view of a chug the beasts were small and compact they forged ahead at a steady walking pace twenty to a cart they stood as high asjemmys short ribs their shells were the ocher of beach sand their wrinkled leather bellies were pale their beaks looked like wire cutters dangerous and each head was crowned by a flat cap of ocher shell they showed no awareness of the world around them the wagons stood on tall wheels their sides dropped open to form shelves and merchants grinned down from inside jemmy let the first two wagons pass him by junior had already forgotten him the rest of the children went with her though thonny looked back once no eyes were on him when he reached out to stroke one of the chugs the act seemed headily dangerous the shell was papersmooth the chug swiveled one eye to see him it was hard to tell who was what among the merchants because of their odd manner of dress as far as jemmy could tell there were about two men for every woman they enjoyed talking to children a man and woman driving the third cart smiled down at him and jemmy walked alongside he asked cant you make them go faster dont want to the man said we buy and sell all along the road why make the customers chase us a goldenhaired woman with a trace of a limp moms age but dumpier passed money up to a darkskinned merchant on the twelfth and last cart that was ilyria warkan the merchant reached way down to hand her a speckles pouch it was transparent big as a head of lettuce with a childs handful of bright yellow dust in the corner you never saw these pouches unless a merchant was selling speckles jemmy ran his hand down a chugs flank the skin was dry and papery belatedly he asked do they bite no theyve got good noses the chugs they can smell youre earthlife and they wont eat that might bite you if you were a fisher the merchants seemed to like children but nobody ever saw a child with the caravan did they keep their children hidden nobody knew the road was beginning to curve more children joined the caravan rachel harness and her mother jael and gwillam doakes a burly boy jemmys age and the very clannish holmes girls no more adults came unless you counted jael harness who hadnt got enough speckles as a child and was therefore a little simple jemmy could see people walking away far down the straight arm of the road the merchant woman caught him looking and laughed too many people now her words were just a bit skewed with music in her voice serious customers they see the dust they come to meet us give them more time to deal now we get no more till the hub how far to the hub twenty minutes no wait you cant take cross streets theyre too narrow the caravan would just have to go round and round following the curve as the road spiraled toward civic hall more like an hour and a half you could get there faster without the wagons no point the merchant woman said i would miss the cemetery too wouldnt i dont go in there jemmy said reflexively oh but i must ive heard about the spiral town cemetery all my life we follow the road around by almost a turn its all earthlife they say thats right jemmy said spooky destiny life wont grow where the dead lie the merchant said ive never seen a place that was nothing but earthlife she was strange and wonderful swathed in layers of bright colors it was a game getting her to keep talking jemmy asked have you seen city hall theres painted walls really bright acylic dad says she smiled indulgently he knew shed been there he asked where do speckles come from dont know hundreds of klicks up the road when we buy em hundreds of klicks kilometers where did they come from before the road was here she frowned down at him before the road sure we learn about it in school how james and daryl twerdahi and the rest took off in cavorite and left the road behind them but that was eight years after landing day so the man was listening too the woman said news to me boy the roads always been here jemmy would have accepted that accepted her ignorance if he hadnt seen the mans lips twitch in a smile in his mind for that instant it was as if the world had betrayed him then sevenyearold ronny was beside him saying im tired jemmy okay kid junjunjunior one wagon ahead junior stopped walking so did thonny and brenda and the warkan girls that junior had been talking to and the warkan boys all without consulting each other sandy warkan said twerdahl streets just ahead we can stop for a squeeze of juice at guildas and wait for the caravan to come round again school junior reminded them can wait the road itself was magical bloocher farm was soft soil and living things and entropy plants grew from little to big grew dry and withered changed and died animals acted strangely and presently gave birth to children like themselves tools rusted or broke down or rotted or ceased working for reasons of their own closer to the hub you saw less of life and more of entropy the houses were old losing their hard edges new buildings were conspicuous jarring at night there were lines of city lights with gaps in them things that didnt work were as prevalent here as among the farms but you noticed them more they were closer together but the road was hard and flat and not like anything else in the world the road was eternal the road was a fantastic toy things rolled easily on its flat surface here just short of twerdahl street and half a klick southeast of bloocher farm was a favored dip used by the highschool kids sandy and hal warkan had showed jemmy how to sweep the road to get a really flat surface so that balls or wheels could be rolled back and forth over the dip theyd go forever no time for that today they turned off at twerdahl street and some of the merchants waved goodbye rachel harness chattered to junior pulling her mother along rachels mother jael seemed to listen but answered rarely and when she spoke her words had nothing to do with what shed heard jemmy liked jael harness but junior and brenda found her a little queer children who didnt get enough speckles grew up like that but rachel was a bright active girl juniors age who treated her mother like a younger sister neighbors had helped to raise her but speckles were expensive rachel must have had a steady source of speckles since her birth one wondered who was rachels father the harness farm was to the right and that was where rachel was pointing junior looking and nodding jemmy couldnt hear them but he looked a silver bulge in the weeds it was killer the council had sicced varmint killer on the harness farm the old machine wasnt doing anything just sitting weeds and vegetation that had been crops ran riot here it wasnt all earthlife odd colors odd shapes grew in wedge patterns wider toward the southwest toward the sea more than two hundred years ago the great fusionpowered landers had hovered above crab island and burned the land sterile this land was to serve earthlife only but the life of destiny continued to try to retake the crab weeds tended to cluster reaching tentatively from an occupied base as if they did not like the fertilizer that made earthlife grow black touched with bronze and yellowgreen branches that divided divided divided until every tip was a thousand needles too fine to see one could rip up an encroachment of destiny weeds with a few passes of a tractor one day the harnesses neighbors would do that but destinys animals were another matter they lived among destinys encroaching plants and some were dangerous these were killers prey killer squatted in the wild corn a silver bulge the size and shape of a chug pulled in on itself the children watched and waited older children bullied the youngers onto warkan farms long porch where destiny creatures werent likely to be hiding one would not want a child to come between varmint killer and its prey they waited waited ssizzz even looking you might not see it jemmy just caught it the line flicking out like a slender tongue snapping back a drop of blood drooling down beneath the little hatch cover juniors hand was on his arm he obeyed remained seated but looked something thrashed in the weeds killers tongue lashed out again the caravan and the crowd were trickling away slowly but steadily off down twerdahl street the bloocher family gathered itself junior called sanity check if we skip guildas now we can get through school time and still beat the caravan to guildas vote reality sometimes called for hard choices they looked at each other lessons the planets l ki duicksilver norn destiny asteroids a sparse and narrow ring volstaag hogun in volstaags trailing trojan point he la black giant or brown dwarf inner comets missing school was not a p blem for the bloocher kids nor for the warkans either computers had infinite patience a teacher wasnt usually needed kids who didnt make up lost lessons would get a reputation but delays would have been more serious at harvest time the hann farm was one loop inward from the bloochers it was smaller than most maybe the first hanns had been cheated maybe not the land was fantastically fertile and hahn machines must have been among the best that had come from the sky or else the hanns made things grow by using intensive care treating each separate plant as an individual and maybe their machines lived longer than others because they were kept clean inside and out there were things jemmy would never learn things nobody knew he was already beginning to resent that nine children trooped into the hann front yard in late afternoon the yard was a rich lawn with islands in it round patches of dark soil three feet across marked with a big strangely shaped rock and two or three destiny plants or driftwood and a cluster of multicolored irises or deborah hann had a julia set growing on a dwarf redwood the destiny vine wound around the straight earthlife tree spraying out green spines that bifurcated in fractal fashion into a nearly invisible lacework mrs hann smiled at the children and starteзl to get up but junior had plenty of time to wave her back down deborah and takumi were old their knees were going they entered the hann house via the airlock curdis hann at sixteen fancied himself a teacher hi sandy do you know why these doubledoor things are called airlocks sandy warkan the oldest boy and nominally in charge of the boys said keeps the wind out curdis grinned in look it up the kids separated inside the airlock junior went with marion and lisette warkan downstairs to the cellar sandy and hal warkan went upstairs to join toma and curdis hann jemmy had never been up there that left jemmy in charge of the younger ones in the company room jemmy let greegry log in the kid was getting good at that the rest read over his shoulder as he typed find airlock diagrams etymology airlocks were for spacecraft they held air in against the vacuum of space as long as both doors couldnt open at the same time the first settlers had built airlocks into their houses against the ferocious coastal winds curdis had scored a point jemmy asked brenda whatve they got you studying path of the cavorite isnt it yes greegry said hey im supposed to be doing algebra jemmy asked you like algebra greegry grinned over his shoulder sorry dad jemmy wanted to know where the caravans came from okay if he asks i just want something to catch curdis brenda see what you can get brenda reached past greegry and typed find cavorite caravan road nothing i think these records are older than the caravans let me try thonny typed find cavorite road map the screen lit with visuals and thonny got up to give brenda his seat jemmy crossed to the smaller screen greegry lets get you going on algebra have you got a lesson on file greegry worked jemmy watched because he could use the brushup the program was a good one and greegry wasnt stumbling much jemmys attention strayed on brendas screen cavorite and columbiad settled on pillars of flame huge squat cylinders with flared skirts and bullet noses jemmy had seen this lesson before it looked real then and now but jemmy thought it must be a computergenerated cartoon how could a camera have watched these first ships land probes had been leaving earth since the s over the centuries they ranged farther past the gasgiant worlds over the suns poles out among the comets ultimately to the nearer stars humanity knew the local neighborhood well long before they could build a starship tau ceti was a yellow dwarf star not far from sol one of its planets showed the blue of an oxygen atmosphere only living things can maintain an oxygen atmosphere apollo was a star eight to ten billion years old redder and smaller than sol there the probes found another blue world they named it norn norn apollo held life but tau ceti was closer to sol and that worldavalonbecame the first interstellar colony the colonists aboard geographic had settled on a great island and called it camelot whatever lethal surprises waited on an unknown world they could be restricted by choosing an island that decision must have saved the avalon colony from destruction for a time cryogenic sleep didnt quite work ice crystals formed in the brains of the first colonists some died of it some woke braindamaged some lasted a few years then died of strokes survivors faced local predators and weird weather cycles whether avalon survived was in doubt over the decades the broadcasts had slowed then ceased the launching of geographic had nearly broken sol systems economy all things considered it was no wonder that sol system waited two hundred and twenty years to send forth another colony ship shes blowing smoke jemmy decided brenda tapped to pop up a window the author of the teaching program wasallison berkeley phd string of letters you think shes lying more like confused it bothers her shes looking for reasons herself brenda tapped and the lessons headings disappeared she didnt need to say well never know allison berkeley stringofletters must have died centuries ago lightyears away in ad argos arrived in apollo system the starfarers had already renamed the blue world no longer norn destiny was waiting they chose a narrownecked peninsula with a ridge of weathered mountains like malaya in size and shape as on avalon so on destiny they would isolate the problems cavorite and columbiad the landers were massive spacecraft designed to explore a solar system or a world they sat low on groundeffect skirts riding the fusion drive alone either ship could hover a meter high until the land beneath turned to lava or above a lake until the water boiled and rivers downstream ran steaming it was thus that they cleared the crab for farming and ranching argos had been long in the building the apollo project had sixty years to breed plants and animals of earth for life on destiny probes had shown them a shorter year redder sunlight a circular orbit and a mere ten degrees of axial tilt stable wind patterns and no ice caps a small moon that moved too fast to pick up much of a tide weather would not be a persistent problem they got that wrong but the dimmer reddened sunlight would the apollo project planners tried to breed plants to survive that cavorite and columbiad settled high on the wider southwestern side of the crab mountains fifteen miles inland the settlers wanted easy access to the sea but not too easy there might be bay of fundy tides despite the little moon or amphibious sea monsters they dredged the sea for avalon seaweed and used it to fertilize earthly crops and argos disappeared i can see why argoss crew got bored brenda said greatly daring heads turned but nobody spoke argos had betrayed them all marooned the settlers and their descendants to the end of time the crew of argos had been tried and convicted of mutiny in absentia later the lander cavorjte had abandoned base one destiny town lives that crossed between suns would drown in the mundane work of farming jemmy felt the same some days here is the farm there is the road take off go thonnys screen showed something like an octopus made of clouds curved arms a body that bulged in the middle an old view from orbit jemmy had seen that once and never found it again greegry wasnt having fun nobody does algebra for fun he kept leahng back through the text there was a block to keep him from seeking the answers file but jemmy had cracked that block long ago and maybe greegry had too the hanns had once had a window like the one at bloocher farm eternal winds had finally cracked it what they had now was brick set into the roadside wall and four panes cut from the old window and set in the brick and nothing much was going on out there this room was not where jemmy bloocher wanted to be he wanted to be where cavorite was at the far end of the road columbiad became the colonys power source cables ran into the base with a tent to protect the join cavorite was kept ready for an emergency evacuation of the crab inevitably some of the halfathousand first settlers thought more like interstellar explorers than like farmers forty of them followed an alternative paththe path less traveled by in groundcaptain radners words they waited eight years before the rest of the colonists had enough faith in their growing crops and enough surplus to make the trip worthwhile in ad there was a glut cavorite had carried half the colony from orbit down to the crab leaving spiral town the same craft carried forty in roomy comfort along with a hydroponics garden stores of seeds and fertilized eggs considerable medical facilities and lab equipment the animals were thriving too but none would be left on this first trip theyd have nothing to eat the plan called for cavorite to return and eventually to make a second journey scattering animals and birds along the path this trip cavorite would leave seeds and growing plants and one thing more a road sitting on the fusion drive alone cavorite would ride a meter in the air with flame mushrooming out around the skirt hot enough to melt rock that was the idea cavorite would move off along the foothills of the spine the crabs mountain ridge leaving a snails trail of cooling lava jemmy recognized what was onscreen a view from space taken ages ago from the mother ship before columbiad and cavorite landed water covered most of the planet destinys core was deficient in radioactive elements its shell was thick ages ago it had cracked an upwelling of magma had become a long relatively narrow ridge of continent most of the continent wrinkle lay north under the broad ice cap one end reached south of the equator then curled over a constriction nearly split the end off from the main body a spinal ridge ran along wrinkle along the constriction now called the neck and down the length of the crab peninsula splitting the crab into broad and narrow halves that was the land that the settlers settled as he and brenda watched the computer drew the road in neon pink down at the tip of the crab the road curved out from columbiad in a perfect little spiral where it got too big where bloocher farm was now it drew a tangent a straight line that ran toward the mainland parallel to the spinal ridge as it approached the neck it became a string of dots then trailed off are those dots all we get brenda asked him they made the road after everyone was down there wasnt anyone in the sky to take pictures except argos and they dont talk now the computer was drawing in spiral town filling in the curves of the spiral and spreading off down the straight section and fuzzing out into terra incognita brenda complained jemmy it just trails off they never came back they were going to but they never did everyone knew the cavorite story nobody knew how it ended brenda said the caravans must know where cavorite went the road goes there and so do they why not just ask okay thonny said obligingly mocking her jemmy tasted the idea traders wouldnt tell anyone anything but brendas right they know the road was a spiral and radner street was a radial path not quite straight the straggling line of children crossed the roads next inward arc and saw the last wagon receding they crossed the next arc ahead of the wagons soon thereafter they walked between fruit orchards the road curved more tightly now the intersection ahead was guildas place guildas place sprawled like three or four buildings pushed together around an open space a courtyard bird feeders stood in the corners and the courtyard swarmed with little birds the buildings were old of poured stone with every corner rounded by two hundred years of winds but the roof of the biggest building was new begley cloth sheeting dark silvergray walks led through the fruit orchards out back the orchard wasnt enough to keep guildas going the family had to buy fruit from farms farther out the bloochers supplied her with melons and grapes their neighbors supplied other produce and everybody stopped at guildas it wasnt as if farmers couldnt make their own juice but guilda smitt sold sherbet guilda had a working freezer and a storage battery and a roof covered with begley cloth to soak up the sunlight and turn it into electric power in the courtyard the boys and girls formed separate lines to get juice then settled at four big round tables close enough for eavesdropping jemmy would have liked to listen to junior reporting her conversation with the man who drove the second cart but then his siblings wanted to hear about his conversation she said the roads always been there and he laughed eightyearold thonny scoffed we know better than that they did too jemmy said guildas four daughters were replacing the juice junior stepped up and spoke to them they listened then moved briskly inside adults were gathering the courtyard was filling up other customers had gathered around guildas place to hear jemmy and junior tell of the merchants turning heads and sudden quiet alerted jemmy and he saw what the rest had seen a single chug pulling a small cart along the radial road with a single merchant walking alongside he was more than twenty and less than thirty hard to tell with those pointed features he had long black hair and a black beard trimmed short where other merchants wore several layers this one wore only a woven vest loose pants and an elaborate cummerbund with a wide pocket in it his feet were bare and his arms and shoulders he seemed to speak to the chug and the chug waited while he went inside they saw him speak to a massive woman whose wealth of dark hair was piled into intricate curves guilda herself when the trader came out he was carrying a massive drum of sherbet his arm and shoulder muscles rolled like boulders and jemmy envied him that he didnt acknowledge the regard of the girls he set the big drum in the cart all in one smooth motion and drove back up along the road conversation started again when he was gone hell meet the rest of the caravan coming the long way an old man said guilda herself came out she clapped her hands for attention then spoke rapidly sherbet and coins for any of you who helps me this day jemmy downed his juice and stood up sibs and friends were doing the same a horde moved into the fruit orchards wagons were in motion too bringing fruit from markets nearer the hub the bloochers sticking together fetched chairs and tables from nearby houses guildas contract was good stated and implied guildas neighbors knew when the caravan was in town chairs and tables were needed the loan would be repaid for the labor of the children and young adults now spilling out of the courtyard money would be paid tonight sherbet might come during a slack moment or days from now when the merchants were gone so chairs and tables were brought and stacked the ancient freezer ran at its humming maximum using power stored for months guildas extended family occupied her huge kitchen and there they turned fruit into juice and whipped it while it froze in midafternoon the caravan flowed around the curve of the road the wagons were nearly hidden within the crowd of customers every level of spiral town society had something to buy or sell or trade around the shell of customers seethed an outer shell of spiral town children now jemmy and his friends could deploy tables and chairs and silver umbrellas competing for speed competing for how many chairs a boy could stack and lift in the wake of the wagons guildas sprawled across the square and suddenly there was nothing more to do the caravan stopped near spiral towns hub and business was being done there sherbet was ready but the merchants were not the rules were known jemmy had never heard them perhaps theyd all learned them through osmosis this was one children would not interfere between merchants and the adults who wanted to meet them the front of guildas was the square the back was a slope of hill that became endersins ranch at its top spiral towns youth now began collecting on the grass behind guildas guildas daughters moved among them serving minuscule cups of sherbet sheeko radner guildas eldest and as tall as most men wove a contorted path pushing a tub on rollers doling out refill scoops the merchants were gathering out front yatsens far east would be gearing up to serve them dinner the square must have filled with amazing speed because merchants were already moving here to the grass slopes four merchants one was the brawny man who bought the drum of sherbet jemmy and the others made haste to make room and the four traders sat in a circle thonny eight was whispering to ronny seven jemmy couldnt hear he kept his dignity for a long moment then glared at them what theyve all got guns thonny said louder than he intended his eyes invading the merchants privacy see the fat one has his in that loose jacket and him and him have those holders in their pocket belts and the guy with the muscles thats you fedrick the fat one laughed at the guy with the muscles a wagon was pulling up in the radial street more produce for guildas sherbet sheeko radner waved prettily at a tableful of farmers the six obliged they followed her to the wagon and began lifting watermelons fedrick grinned at thonny he pulled an lshaped object from his belt jemmy too had been halfsure it was a gun the brawny merchant made as if to hand it to thonny but he was pulling it back even as the fat ones hand blocked him i cant let you handle this boy he said or something like that his words were twisted almost beyond recognition i can show you maybe six farmers carrying six watermelons were trooping toward the kitchen door the merchant named fedrick fired at the sixth the watermelon in davish scrivners hands exploded it splashed in all directions a sudden scarlet flower scrivner stared at his arms his clothes hardly believing that it wasnt blood for that moment he was too flabbergasted even to be afraid then amid a sea of laughter he turned he studied the tableful of merchants and the roar in his throat didnt emerge if it had been the fat one well but the grinning man now pushing a gun into his armpit looked like he could lift a wagonful of watermelons and he was coming forward with helpless laughter on his face and money in his hand it was for the children he told the farmer think theyll never see a sight like that again friend this should be the price to clean your clothes and a steam bath too really i did look to see there was nothing behind you but hill forgive me come share sherbet with us thonny said damn did you see that in truth jemmy would never forget it what the gun had done to a watermelon it could do to a man davish scrivner could have exploded like that would the merchant still have been laughing it never faded never lost a trace of color the watermelon exploding in scrivners arms the pulp splashing every part of him like blood the horror in his face as he gave up his hope of life it was there in his mind eight years later on jemmy bloochers last night in spiral town w arkan s tavern dr maners d you represent the crew f argos i do flow j the defendants plead on the charge f mutiny not guilty on the charge f sabotage not guilty on the charge f treason not guilty on the charge f grand larceny not guilty eric maners advocate for the crew of argos ad the bloocher clan gathered in wilderness for the third time in three days mountains stood above them the spinal ridge of the crab a stream ran foaming over rocks the water had cut a shallow channel across the road below and somebodymerchantshad built a bridge across that the new hann holding would be here four kilometers down the road from the bloocher farm on the inland side two hundred and forty years ago earthlife had been seeded over the entire peninsula in a random mix you could make bread out of these waisthigh grasses corn and rye and wheat and a sprinkling of sesame apple and orange and pomegranate groves grew randomly the tallest trees twenty and thirty feet high were both redwoods an earlymorning fog had burned off the bloocher clan rested beneath a handful of oaks the girls around junior the boys around curdis hann jemmy tended a cage that held destiny tree lace and a pophopper the pophopper was a destiny burrowing creature and no body knew how to take care of it after two days it looked to be dying here and there were patches of darker vegetation black trunks and branches and lacy extrusions touched with green and yellowgreen and bronze that was local life destiny life three patches below the clump of oaks had merged varmint killer rested within that patch killers surface was very like poured stone jemmy thought pocked with small apertures for lightthreads tiny glassbead eyes whips and pellets all retractable into an ovoid shell it sat like a statue or a rock but it had moved in the night killer had siblings a myriad tiny machines specks just bigger than speckles turned rock and ore into begley cloth within a cave in mount apollo similar machines made earthtime watches in mount chronos jemmy had looked at both kinds under a microscope in the places where tools branched out and in the ovoid shell itself jemmy saw an artistic relationship to varmint killer then again hed known in advance these machines had come from sol system aboard ai gos the bloocher clan watched for a time then greegry got bored and tried to climb a redwood and thonny began taking bets on when killer would move again junior had married curdis hann she was twenty then and twentytwo now it was time and past time and curdis was a good man and a boyhood friend to all of them still it made things awkward two years had passed since the communal tractor failed most of spiral town thought of it that way and blamed the driver and his ill luck but the terrible machine had sent its lightning like an ancient stored flame through william bloochers nervous system dad was a helpless cripple now his mind damaged too and jemmy his oldest boy was only nineteen so junior had charge of the bloocher farm andjuniors husband must live with the bloochers for now they must call junior margery now the margery margeryjuniors mother was mom to everyone even dad even curdis curdis hann became another brother at twentyone an older brother who didnt have property yet in a year jemmy would be twenty curdis and juniormargeiy would have their land the new hann then bloocher land would be jemmys to farm theyd picked a plot not far beyond the last reach of spiral towns farms where a stream ran down from the mountains it was infested with destiny weeds of course in the lazy days of midsummer theyd leased varmint killer from the council killer didnt require much supervision it didnt take orders anymore jemmy had led it here by offering it destiny prey wiggling in a patch of destiny weeds now it just sat in the weeds and waited it would not harm life of earth it sensed destiny life somehow jemmy had never heard an explanation that made sense it wasnt smart enough to see what a human being would that destiny life didnt have proper leaves photosynthesis went on in lacy extrusions from the branches and on the branches and trunks themselves if a creature of destiny moved killer killed it when no prey surfaced for a time it would kill some weeds then move on it wasnt doing much right now greegry had actually reached the top of the redwood his perch didnt look comfortable and jemmy wondered if he was afraid to descend there werent any branches on that long smooth trunk greegry called hey jemmy waved languidly theres a dust cloud way down at the end of the road jemjemjemmy curdis i think theres a caravan coming great curdis called caravans came three times every two destiny years midsummer first days of spring last days of autumn this was midsummer idle time neither sowing nor reaping season a good time for a caravan to visit killers long tongue lashed into the bronze vegetation and out then killer itself lurched into motion something must have come out of a burrow thonny said softly it wants the rest of the family jane called thonthonthonny you owe me four checks jane was only eight greegry called curdis theres someone on a bike hes stopping near our bikes ill go see curdis said he stood and junior joined him jemmy got up too but curdis gestured him back killer was in the destiny weeds they heard the snap snap snap of killers whip tentacles jane had crawled close to watch thonny was probably right it was trying to reach prey in a burrow a whip could be trapped that way the whip sounds came less frequently and here came curdis jogging weve got to move killer he panted jemmy see if you can get him to follow the pophopper jemmy picked up the cage the pophopper didnt look good whats up margery was in range by now that girl was from the council she called to all all fees forgiven if we take varmint killer to the tavern before sunset the caravans come early they could use the money jemmy moved toward the destiny weeds killer had to be approached with respect he stopped twelve meters away and lifted the cage into view you never got closer than ten meters because that was the range of its whips killer was motionless so was the pophopper the wind would be out to sea and that meant he was downwind jemmy began to circle the cage held high dad swore that it didnt matter killer couldnt smell it sensed destiny life by some other means curdis lost patience well have to catch another one greegiy get down from there thonny find a stick you get to the far side of that clumpthat clump way away from killerand you beat your way through anything jumps up whack it youre trying to scare it this way right greegry find a stick and go help thonny jemjemjemmy its dead curdis dump it and stand by with the cage get your gloves on jemmy opened the cage and dumped the little shelled corpse and the withering weeds hed put in with it he began picking fresh yellow and bronze lace killer wailed a long loud cry of warning then its whips began flailing around it lashing the destiny plants at root level it slid slowly through the dark patch lashing everything in its way though it was not moving straight toward jemmy jemmy eased back the decrepit machine didnt take orders anymore it sought destiny weeds and destiny animals when they were not about its tropism was weak and it went where it would a treesized destiny plant balked it killer pulled in its whips until it had rolled past plant life was only part of killers job a human curdiswould pull up the stumps killer left behind hyah curdis bellowed and three boys leapt on something that tried to sprint out from under them jemmy ran toward them thonny trapped its beak in a bag the others were sitting on the shell its short legs scrabbled in futility the destiny thing was a bit big for the cage they pushed its bulk in with the butt of a stick good enough its jammed in it cant crawl out junior said killer had slashed away most of the weed patch it rested now curdis picked up the cage and walked toward it killer began to move curdis retreated killer wasnt fast they moved down toward the road curdis and the cage the old machine following the heavy cage was passed tojemmy then to junior and back to curdis before theyd crossed three and a half kilometers to warkans tavern curdis had thonny and brenda making bike runs to get lemonade to the others the sun was still high and quicksilver a bright spark above it the dust plume that must be an oncoming caravan was closer now but not close other young adults were beginning to gather the warkan place was the bloochers neighbor down the road on the seaward side it was still part farm the four warkan kids and their parents ran the tavern in the evenings they kept a distillery and a truck garden going and an extensive orchard they did less weeding than most and parts of the warkan farm were often overgrown with dark destiny plants the taverns waiters and waitresses were in their mid and late teens they had to talk to each other if only to coordinate their tasks jemmy had worked through two caravan visits he hoped to again land that was allowed to become infested was subject to confiscation by the council but the warkans could afford to lease varmint killer frequently likely they would pay the council a premium to get killer to warkans tavern by sunset for the entertainment value mom and dad werent as friendly to the warkans as in time past they preferred harrys bar near the hub that catered to an older crowd but warkans tavern felt like home youngsters in the gathering crowd danced near killer or hovered well back and shouted advice while the bloochers led the machine through the garden gate and around back destiny life hadnt gained much of a foothold here jemmy had visited as a kid he knew this place better than curdis did he took the cage and led killer to the near edge of the pear grove earthlife found destinys sun a little cool a little red it was destiny life that sought shade these trees of earth had overly black shadows around their trunks destiny weeds older men and women were finding vantage places across the road there was plenty of room on the ridge a bonfire was a pale glitter the martjnas were roasting potatoes up there curdis found people for a murderball game from the ridge you could see down to the shore and farther out to where carders boat had been anchored since dad was a boy that had been the fastest thing on water before the motor died dads generation used to swim out to it with lunch bags use it as a raft then destiny devilhair weed moved in now weed blackened the water from the boat to the beach and further in a time now lost carders boat would carry a child anyplace he could dream now there were only the caravans and that too was a dream they were all on the ridge when the dust plume arrived this had changed since jemmy was a boy caravans no longer came into spiral town merchants did but not with their wagons caravans stopped about where bloocher farm began where the road turned it was better for everyone here the chugs had a straight run down to the ocean and chug droppings need not soil civic pavement the wagons began stopping along a kilometer of road they stopped well apart then the wagonmasters went among the chugs and released their harness twenty chugs pulled most wagons with here and there a chug missing from his high perch jemmy was able to count eighteen wagons close to four hundred chugs streamed across black salt grass then sand toward the ocean and in there was not much to be seen after that the merchants were opening their wagons that was of interest if you had money the teens on the ridge were generally disappearing in the direction of dinner and so did the bloochers jemmy took the speckles shaker down he measured a careful halfjigger and kneaded it into the bread dough pulled it into two loaves and put it in the oven he shook the speckles jar again reached up and put it away curdis he said we need more speckles margery shed heard its a big caravan this time wait till tomorrow theyll go cheaper mom had three pots on the fire she asked margery can you handle this yeah mom went into the dining hall and sat beside dad margery reached for pot holders curdis moved up beside her and whispered something she moved aside so that he could pull the heavy casserole out of the oven and take it to the table dad said saw the dust plume caravans in town curdis said and talked about moving varmint killer dad nodded and nodded and presently asked master granger there i saw him jemmy said master granger was an older man proprietor of the lead wagon though a younger woman drove he and dad had been friends jemmy and dad had taken granger and his driver to harrys bar before dads accident dad nodded and didnt suggest doing that again some days his mind worked better than others dad could barely get out of the house he wanted to know everything about today jemmy talked with some help from thonny while mom helped him eat the new hann the caravan chugs in a sandcolored wave rolling down the sand into the ocean mom and the girls were talking about marriages crops weather prices jemmy had heard this too often endless permutations endlessly the same he waited for an instants pause and jumped into it dad how far down the road have you gotten oh hell jemmy not far we used to visit the warkans swim there when the warkans were the farthest i hear tales but i dont think i ever got as far as where you were today the road he might never learn more of the road than hed learned from the schooling programs your uncle eezeek had to go down the road for awhile folk at haven took him in eezeek died years ago mom said but the merchants knew maybe somebody could get them talking quicksilver glowed among lesser stars just on the horizon a cart moved silently past the bloocher clan toward warkans tavern moved by electricity and an old motor it carried huge rolls of begley cloth sheeting from the cavern in mount apollo the most important product spiral town had to sell it ghosted past the tavern and stopped by the lead wagon normally roomy for the crowd it pulled in warkans was just adequate when a caravan was in town it wasnt just the merchants every human being between fifteen and twentyfive was at warkans tavern tonight the older spirals wore dancers on their feet no room to dance in here outside later on the road in the darkrooms normally closed had been opened the big bar would be inhumanly crowded and jemmy led his brethren into one of the outer rooms theyd be able to breathe here and varmint killer was sparkling darting spitting threads of green light and putting on a fine show outside the big windows tunia judda was here far across the big room tunia and jemmy had been watching each other for years their parents were friends and something might come of that but they hadnt spoken of anything permanent theyd dance on the road later tonight jemmy played at catching her eye never worked women probably did the same thing men did get a friend to do the looking a few merchants were already here jemmy knew he shouldnt stare but they dressed in layers in bright colors and patterns each man carried a gun and each woman too rachel harness had grown up lovely and a little twisted shed been feeding herself and her specklesshy mom since she was a little girl when the rest went to their homes for dinner rachel and her mom had stayed on the ridge to picnic and to watch we didnt see a trace of the chugs for over an hour she told the girls at her table unmindful of the clear fact that boys were listening too the merchants were all settling in pitching tents setting up cookfires they didnt look worried at all then here came the chugs a great long wave of them all the chugs at once the merchants all dropped what they were doing and climbed up on their wagons they settled on their bellies and pulled their guns out the merchants waited for service with more patience than locals did they were listening to rachel harness with discreet amusement men and women both now here camei dont know any word for them rachel said they look like big toothy fish swimming through sand a merchant a man turned in his chair and spoke to rachel sharks theyre all along this coast rachel didnt quite know how to handle that she pretended she hadnt heard but she was blushing fins all along both sides of them low down along the belly nasty beaks they were faster than the chugs but the chugs had a head start they came plodding back to the wagons and hid under them the merchants started shooting for ten minutes they shot at the the sharks they killed maybe ten before the rest turned tail warkans beach is going to stink in three days time next to the man who had spoken a merchant woman spoke to rachel willys new to the train forgive him rachel nodded graciously but sure im rachel hillary its a good bargain for the chugs rachel pull our wagons get our protection the lungsharks are the reason we carry guns will anyone sell me speckles the merchant woman turned in some annoyance the noise level had dropped many were turning to the doorway or turning away pretending nothing had happened everyone knew that merchants didnt sell when they were at dinner but everyone knew evleen she was nine when her dad died after that she didnt get enough speckles until someone noticed deprived late like that she didnt have the look of a speckleshy she looked like any eighteenyearold girl but it had touched her mind the merchants were trying to ignore evleen so were the spiral women wouldnt any of them stop her but no man could speak to her sojemmy turned back to his table look for conversation start a quarrel any kind of distraction but his attention snagged on a familiar facea merchant hed seen that man beforeas the man reached out and pulled evleen into his lap the merchant was big and brawny his speech was slurred by a merchants accent and something more hard to believe that he could get himself drunk so soon after shooting down a pack of what had the woman called them sharks evleens response was friendly she and the brawny merchant said a few words to each other the merchant pulled out a transparent pouch of speckles jemmy was on his feet he had to do something he had no idea what he would say to the man suddenly it didnt matter because thonny was shaking the mans arm shouting into a thick silence and then the mans arm swung out and thonny went down with his arms across his face jemmys hand closed on the merchants shoulder from behind evleen went flying the merchant was up and turning one hand under jemmys chin and he l fted his scruffybearded face was half the universe and now jemmy remembered him eight years ago hed carried a tub of sherbet from guildas place hed blasted a hole through a watermelon for all the children of spiral town to see vivid as hell jemmy remembered the watermelon exploding like blood all over davish scrivner fedrick he was hideously strong and jemmy hadnt ever been this frightened evleen was trying to get up she cried nooo jemmy i dont want to be like rachels ma his feet were off the floor a wall was against his back in an instant his throat would be crushed fedrick was in his face and he remembered remembered the gun in fedricks belt here jemmy had the gun butt jemmy had seen what such a weapon could do to a melon he lifted and turned it and pulled the trigger the sound was deafening the gun lurched injemmys hand fedrick gaped in horror and let him loose jemmy dropped to the floor he looked down at what hed done and it was worse than he could have imagined there was a hole in fedrick in his left side pumping blood blood spilled down his shirt and pantaloons a man fedricks size had fedrick by the shoulder and that mans horror was a match for fedricks fedricks eyes turned up and he started to fall the other man took a moment to ease him to the floor evleen gibbered in fear staring wideeyed at fedrick now the big trader let go of fedrick and fedrick fell and jemmy saw what evleen saw the hole in fedricks back looked as big as jemmys head the silence was ending and men were starting to stand up jemmy ran the near door was past several merchants and they were all getting up jemmy ran through tables of spiral women instead a lone merchant gaudy in gray and yellow had his belt for an instant before jemmy ripped loose he almost took the stairs pictured how many guns would pick him off if they all had a clear shot ran around and out the warkans front door the window above the front door was one that opened he remembered addard and sandy and telema warkan shouting through it heads together long ago jemmy jumped and had the sill pulled himself up pulled the window open and was back inside on the landing halfway up flat on the floor catching his breath while traders and spiral men swarmed below him and outside he crawled the rest of the way to the second floor through addards room to the balcony down the outside stair to the truck garden the truck garden was a jungle in spots killer was busy at one end jemrfly worked his way through shadow and weeds at the other end into the less cultivated regions of the warkan farm making away from the road l eavetaking probes have gone before we expected an earihiike world norn and from orbit it seems all that we hoped ive renamed it destiny daryl twerdahl defensive ecology warkan farmland trailed off toward the sea the land was barren rock and sand it would barely support destiny life and it barely hid jemmy bloocher the old fence was another ancients miracle corrosion had not touched it in more than two centuries it ran for over a mile between bloocher and warkan land all the way into the shallow waves the fence was three grades of mesh laid over each other filters to stop anything from seeds to sharks to chugs spiral children learned early those fine strands would cut flesh the first settlers must have been analretentive about property rights or was this another attempt to confine destiny the fence would cut a chugs mouth merchants never released chugs close to the fence but the fence didnt stop destiny seaweed here at the shoreline a grove of black and yellowgreen devilhair ran into the sea and out as far as carders boat weed had nearly swallowed the boat had entirely swallowed the fence by using the fence as a frame the weed gained access to sunlight and the seas nutrients too jemmy reached the beach at a run he swarmed over the humped weed onto bloocher turf and kept running adrenaline raged in his blood he wanted to run until the breath seared his lungs but every spiral knew where he must come any of them might tell a merchant he spared a moments glance for the settlers miracle offshore theyd never find him there and for good reason a swimmer would never reach carders boat hed be tangled in the weed and drowned he stopped his chest heaving then he made himself crawl through the rows of wheat uphill toward the house it seemed quiet merchants would have flooded the house with light and noise jemmy went in through the root cellar then up into the kitchen softly softly loaves of bread were still in the oven he left them for the moment more stairs well lighted there was light under his parents door and under juniors margerys margery and curdis he eeled into his room and stood in the dark thinking the warkans had their reasons to let the fence go like that but the bloochers had no excuse for such slovenliness not his business now jemmy bloocher wasnt going to be running bloocher farm after all what could he take just the backpack and the hiking gear in it real shoes a flash a canteen blankets thick hikers gloves because much of destiny life was armed with thorns or poison he added underwear and socks and shirts going by feel in the dark he was already wearing a jacket what else anything he left behind now was gone forever pen and a pad of paper he heard the front door slam only minutes now he thoughtand his own door slammed back against the wall and light blazed in his eyes jemmy was standing with his hands spread wide and showing empty when the ceiling lamp came on curdis lowered the flash jemmy he said thought it might be some thieving merchant jemmy said ive killed a merchant curdiss eyes only narrowed but jemmy heard juniors gasp she wedged herself around curdis and squeaked jemmy swallowing the scream because theyd wake their parents curdis turned out the lamp were too close to the warkan place he said why would youeven junior caught herself and was silent the dark was welcome jemmy said i have to run thonnys voice spoke from the hall he was trying to save me even so jemmy that was crazy i know crazy jemmy brenda curdis said briskly just hide for a while get your camp gear and youve got it already hide in the hills wait for the caravan to go away we dont know anything didnt see anything cant guess they come three times every two years everyone knows where bloocher farm is everyone knows who i am three times every two years you just arent here caravans come you go bloocher ffarm curdis stopped that was the sticking point all right margery was bloocher farm for now but in half a year she and curdis hann would be farming the new hann holding the head of bloocher farm had to deal with merchants if only for speckles jemmy said curdis i want to take the speckles bread thats in the oven okay thonny youll have bloocher farm when curdis and margery move out theyd have to postpone moving he thought until thonny was older curdis must see that already if merchants want to search the farm for a fugitive go them one better lead them down to where the fence goes into the sea its covered with enough weed to feed a caravan the chugs would have a head start on the sharks and well get the shore cleaned off to boot thonny nodded eyes glassy mouth open curdis said hold it jemmy caravans use the road jemmy hadnt thought quite that far the merchants only just got here theyll stay awhile thonny said jemmy if you can get around them they cant catch you chugs dont move fast theyll send someone to block the road curdis said thonny and brenda and margery came into jemmys room and found seats on the bed the bureau the footlocker this was going to take some thought one step at a time curdis said the merchants will search spiral town theyll demand that and nobody will stop them you cant hide in town ive got to leave have you thought of just hiding in the hills jemmy said we hike the hills but merchants must know that whole range end to end and if they found mecurdis they wouldnt have to take me to trial bang and plant a tree whod know youd be pretty conspicuous on the road too how do you think youll get around them its our road too thonny said tentatively brenda said yeah lets go for a walk in the dark one could just see thonnys disgusted look but curdis tasted the notion go for a nice long walk down the road me and thonnyjemmy you go over the hills you can stay hidden in the brush for a few days cant you meet us im coming too brenda announced curdis ignored her meet us somewhere down the road jemmy then ill trade packs with you from then on youre curdis hann me you come back by road with thonny ill come back through the hills if im caught hey im just off camping ill come back by way of the new hann margery said youre tending our own land curdis nodded it would give him legitimacy if he were caught im coming too brenda repeated margery said all right brenda margely darling youll need her to talk to merchant women thonny suggested bicycles good said curdis we can let things settle for a day or two and still beat jemmy to where shall we meet there arent that many bicycles on the road ill find you jemmy said curdis sat in the dark moving his lips while they watched him presently he said the merchants search spiral town and dont find you your camping gear is gone sos our store of speckles so you buy some more margeiy jemmy said i wouldnt take your speckles you would if you were going forever instead we can bring you home after the merchants have searched the farm and spiral town you take my place here theyre searching the hills by then but at worst they find just me camping on my own land after theyre gone you can grow a beard or something lie about your age marry someone move to another farm well have time to work that out i like it junior said i wish i could come youre in charge here curdis said gently they were deciding his future margeiy said okay thonny and brenda and curdis on bikes dont look at me like that thonny youre brother and sister not betrothed oh hell what curdis you cant pass for jemmy curdis had straight black hair yellowdark skin eyes with an epicanthic fold hmmmjemmy said i only have to pass for curdis coming back going out is when theyll be looking to be sure hes not me me escaping going out youre innocent let them look they closed the curtains and turned on the lights margery posed jemmy next to curdis examined them and said no and brenda was a girl but thonny moved up next to jemmy shorter by three inches and margery said maybe on a bicycle they took all of jemmys clothes out of the bureaus and carried them in armloads into thonnys room they began putting together matching outfits you can switch scarves and hats margery said and they tried it right thonny you stay on the bike when youre not on the bike you dont lean on the bike dont lean on a wall dont lean stand up like a man be careful coming back camp out on the new hann land until someone comes for you jemmy coming back youre thonny you always lean on the bike or a wall dont be seen standing straight up curdis you wear those dancers going out but you put those highheel shysterstomper boots in your bike bag youre taller than thonny going out youd better be taller than jemmy coming back curdis nodded in the semidark now how did it happen the killing hush jemmy brenda junior wanted brendas version then thonnys and never bothered with jemmys then she told them all take your time going and coming stop and talk to everyone thonny brenda if a merchant asks you about the killing you tell him i was there i saw it all babble but you havent seen jemmy since then and you dont think you ever will jemmy you heard everything thonny said you tell it that way coming back once again jemmy moved along the shore two more fences to cross he went back up through rows of lettuce the wayne holding where he crossed the road it was deep into its first curve gasoline alley then the next inward loop of road then baker street the graveyard had been well beyond the town for two good centuries but spiral town had reached it at last jemmy stepped from the empty shops of harrow street into a grove of willows destiny life wouldnt grow among the graves the spiral town graveyard covered more than a square mile with nothing but earthlife long lank grass clover and trees up to years old jemmy drifted like smoke among the trees there was cover to hide him the eyes he expected might be imaginary after all a lifegiver of spiral town would be buried with a handful of seeds his will might name the variety of tree if several sprouted tenders would transplant all but one and a marker would be fired into the bark for the lifegiver within its roots the oldest trees were huge chosen for majesty oaks banyans redwoods majestic trees hadnt always survived well and variety had come into fashion for a long lifetime the lifegivers bore nut trees and fruit trees then someone had decided that the practice was disrespectful or something but an extensive grove still bore fruit and nuts jemmy picked a handful of cherries a few plums an orange he stuffed his pockets then settled in the shadows of the gnarled old trees to eat the markers around him were all above eye level jemmy tried to read them but they were only a glitter in the dark holograms need light when the holomarker gun failed it would be a major tragedy it was settler magic irreplaceable on an ordinary night jemmy would have been asleep by now though he felt that he might never sleep again he was weary his life had lost all direction in one deafening blast now the bark against his back was too comfortable it would be easy to stay where he was thonnys hat was a bit small a bit tight he took it off and waved it at the flies buzzing his ears the buzzing went away then came back sounding like sleep had he been dozing he surged to his feet swung his pack onto his back and was in motion if he sat down again theyd find him asleep in the graveyard come morning the slopes above spiral town resembled chaparral the dwarf forest of california it was earthlife laced with surviving destiny life too thick and too hostile to hike through the bare rock above would not hide a fleeing murderer but plants only covered the slopes up to fifteen hundred feet above the road and stopped quite suddenly frost line the teaching programs would have called it but destiny never got that cold the destiny plants ran out of something else air pressure water soil nutrients something earthlife grew higher up but sparsely jemmy was at the frost line when lights came on above him hed ducked back into the chaparral before his mind quite caught up lights glared and men moved around a great ragged hole in the side of mount apollo the lights within the cavern showed great dark silvergray sheets peeling away like the pages of a thousand books everywhere along the walls and roof a man moved to the back of the cavern and pulled then nearly hidden under layers of begley cloth sheeting he staggered toward a cart it was jemmys first sight of the apollo caverns children werent allowed here even older children argos had carried several experimental von neumann devices a phrase every child learned and few could define begley cloth was one a handful of selfreproducing machines just big enough to be dots had been dropped into a hole in a hillside for two and a half centuries they had been eating into mount apollo carving out a fairyland underground as they followed veins of silicon and some small set of metals hed seen the list in one of the teaching programs and made it into sheets that would turn sunlight into power fringed with wires to carry the power to machines also the dots made more of themselves the sheeting was spiral towns most dependable trade good and the caravan was in town he should have avoided mount apollo at all costs but he damned well didnt dare wait for daylight he scuttled along the border between the chaparral and the bare rock above hunching like a chug until he was out of sight of the apollo caverns and far beyond by night the new hann holding was just another patch of wilderness and jemmy couldnt tell where he crossed it it might have made a nice resting place merchants might see it that way too jemmy kept moving he walked through the night rarely did the road come in view at daylight he crawled into a manzanita grove and let his mattress inflate on tilted ground in a glare of sunlight sieved through red manzanita trunks and the branches and lace of some tall destiny tree sleep was hard to find he slept with evil memories eyes and mouth wide in horror fedrick felt what jemmy bloocher had done to him blood flooded his vest the fistsized hole in his back from time to time he woke and with his eyes closed against the filtered light thought how much he had lost somewhere around noon he ate half the speckle bread it was his last speckles for the foreseeable future what would satisfy the merchants just how badly did they want his blood would a facesaving gesture satisfy them or his exile or would they take reprisals against bloocher farm grow a beard or something lie about your age many someone and move to another farm theyd been pressed for time trying to decide what to do now even so jemmy hadnt liked hearing that even if it worked even if the merchants let it work how was it better than just moving on down the road either way the man who had been jemmy bloocher was gone better maybe if he died here in the hills many forms of destiny life were poisons hadnt that been trolihair the last time hed stopped at a stream it was hairfine silver stuff softlooking threads with very sharp tips hed given those clumps a lot of room being scratched by trollhair was an easy death a long slide into sleep his family need never know jemmy never came to meet us what had sent his thoughts straying toward suicide jemmy realized with a start that he was sleeping in the shade of a fool cage there were fool cages growing among the manzanita all around him four feet of trunk flared into a thorny oval cage of black wicker decorated with bronze and scarlet lace and a few tiny bones in the cage a destiny bird could perch on any of a number of destiny plants and find lace to eat some plants grew gaudy lace displays so that birds would transport their seeds but the lace within a fool cage was a lure and a trap a bird could perch on the upper branches of a fool cage but any breeze that rattled the branches would cause them to trap a birds feet pull it in most destiny birds had learned to stay away these bones belonged to earthlife curdis and thonny and brenda would expect to find him on the road jemmy rolled his mattress got his pack on and crawled until the plants were thick enough to hide him walking upright the water table was lower now the plants reached no more than three hundred meters above the flatland and the road jemmy traveled by night by day there were plants to hide him he slept away from water a stream might make him a target at night the star fields were gaudy gorgeous quicksilver was brilliant but tiny and only showed for a few minutes after sunset kismet destinys massive little moon cast no more light even at the full any meteor might be cavorite in reentry or argos among the asteroids making a few seconds burn the land at night was black a man could hurt himself thinking he saw more detail than was there he could only glimpse the road in patches and the sea far beyond once he saw a boat moving parallel to shore once a house or shed that looked abandoned he hadnt yet seen a human being then again he didnt intend to there were earthlife birds everywhere a hundred varieties of song at morning and evening hawks hovering on updrafts by day owls hunting by night hed seen the shells and bones the predators had made of destiny birds and hed seen fool cages everywhere with earthlife bones and beaks in them the coming of columbiad and cavorite had been good for the fool cages they were good for jemmy any bird still flapping inside a fool cage must be fresh and edible he found a smallish turkey on the second night and he pulled on his thick gloves and reached in through the thorns and strangled it after dawn he felt safe building a tiny fire in a circle of rocks the perpetual wind was enough to whip the smoke away on the third night he collected three little birds pigeons maybe at the fourth dawn he crossed above a waterfall then crawled downhill into brush the stream had cut a gorge that ran down to the road and through it someone had built a little bridge over the water three men and a woman had set up camp near the bridge the chugs were gonein the water likelybut the wagon nearly blocked the bridge jemmy slept away from the water from time to time he crawled back to the waterfall to spy on the merchant guards their eyes would see only the falling water a tiny distant moving man would be lost in all that motion right they werent cheerful as merchants usually were the woman was middleaged and snappish the younger men obeyed her with little grace he was moving back to the stream in midafternoon careful as ever when he heard a familiar shout brenbrenbrendaa he crawled to the edge of the falls and looked down the falls drowned out speech thonny and curdis were talking to the guards to the men the woman was talking to brenda the merchants manner had grown cordial he crawled closer staying in the thicket of fool cages he got down to where the water wasnt so loud then sage and tumbleweed were growing too close together and he feared merchant guards would see them wiggle he heard thonny shout curdcurdcurdis thats the last coin weve got and the sound of merchant laughter and brendas laugh too three bicycles moved on across the bridge and down the road now all jemmy had to do was catch them they would have gained from better planning how on earth was he going to catch bicycles jemmy was seething with impatience but hed have to be crazy to move now in daylight with merchants just below him he crawled back among the fool cages and tried to sleep they must know theyd have to wait the next stream they were past the merchant guards why not stop theyd wait at the next stream and hed see them and know it was safe to come down and if he didnt see them no way could he sleep he crawled up to where plants thinned out to bare rock and he kept crawling where water next crossed the road they werent waiting jemmy made sure of that then moved on what stopped him next was more than a stream the plant interface dipped an arrowhead shape pointing at the road jemmys gaze followed the tree line down along rock that had run like wax frozen lava ran up to the ridge a thousand feet above him and down almost to the road itself ending in a broad patch of green earthlife trees and water gleaming between interesting jemmy could picture the giant landers cavorite and columbiad hovering on either side of the crest moving parallel on pillars of violet flame bright enough to blind any witness burning off the life of destiny then return to seed the slopes with earthlife one of the ships must have paused here yes and he could see why above him the ridgeline bent by forty degrees cavorite on the broad side had waited for columbiad on the narrow side to round the curve water at the point of the lava triangle then a thick stand of earthlife trees then the road the far side of the road was a thriving village there were shops along the road and a setback wide enough and long enough for a whole caravan and a wide stream running to the sea spreading into a delta at the end who were these people it had never occurred to jemmy that there was this much of civilization beyond spiral town somewhere the merchants went for their goods and to trade what they got from the spirals and in between and how could he cross bare and slippery rock he couldnt he was going to have to go down on the road twerdahl and h d t crew are running away we isolated ourselves on th island for a reason whatever our problems well solve them here julius radner council chairman where the wall of ancient lava converged to a point there was a shine of water then leafy earthlife trees from high up it appeared that the forest ran right to the road as jemmy descended it became clear that he was approaching a swamp he wasnt eager to wade into that the trees were cypress and mangrove on a wide spread of shallow water there were no competing destiny trees but the trees were festooned with what he first thought were snakes snakes everywhere motionless black snakes winding through webs of yellowgreen lace vines one was a variety he didnt recognize but the others werejulia sets the same vine the elder hanns cultivated the hanns must have played the bonsai trick stunting the plant by pruning and by keeping it half starved these were huge in places they were strangling the mangroves something rippled along the water a snake a real one this time another moved among the vines something bigger shied from it a man jemmy sank slowly into a crouch then tried to ease behind a tree the manboybroke through to the open with evident relief looked around didnt see jemmy jemmy stepped out of hiding and thonny jumped you all right fine thonny said how was it easy going how did you make out there are merchants at the bridge thonny was excited enjoying himself immensely they asked about a merchant that got killed in spiral town we changed the story a little fear rose up in jemmys throat changed how uh well we talked it over curdis says im the traders best witness i mean thonny bloocher is im your oldest brother and i saw it all brenda wouldnt see as much because it was all men and brendas a girl and so she wouldnt have watched men quarreling right so so they would have turned us back and how would you find us on the road so i didnt say im thonny bloocher im tim hann with those eyes one of the merchants said that i got insulted curdiss idea yeah the real tim hann would have been curdiss older brother but he died a year old tim hann im tim hann great anything else jemmys fury rendered thonny mute if he couldnt get thonny talking any other way jemmy was ready to hold him under water this was his lffe they were playing for he said look if im tim hann i have to sound like tim hann did tim hann see the killing thonny nodded where were you across the room near the fireplace did jemmy bloocher do it fine with the merchants gun what does he look like what did you change i didnt lie it was just a better fight curdis was listening i can ask him yeah what were they like these merchants you met we saw three men at the bridge with a woman they searched us we bought some stuff from them they lost interest when we said we were broke youre still broke going back okay theyll expect me to know them coming back thonny thought it over then shrugged okay where are we what are all these people doing here i dont know living here i peeled off before we got close to anyone uhhuh four or five of them saw us together older people moms age they dress like well like jael harness did they wave throw rocks do they think were weird they pointed at us and started shouting maybe at us maybe at the houses women too curdis and brenda went on toward them but i did what curdis told me i peeled off didnt let any of them get a close look tied the bike to a tree you just go through the swamp get on the bike and go join them jemmy began to wonder if he sounded properly grateful he said sounds like it all went like somebody planned it and smiled and hugged his brother that pleased thonny he asked how did you make out jemmy tried to tell him theres practically nobody on the road i mean at night i only went at night stay with the frost line and you wont be seen theres plenty of water springs if you see a bird flapping in a fool cage thats your dinner if it isnt moving leave it we trading backpacks they did that jemmy said i made some fires did you see anything smoke tiny fires in rock pits i left some fire pits you break them up when you finish with them they looked at each other jemmy said thonny thanks its okay thonny adjusted his backpack grinned at his brother and began to climb hats jemmy shouted he sailed thonnys hat up to thonny thonny sailed his down to jemmy it flew over his head and settled on the water jemmy waded into the gloom the water was kneedeep and tepid jemmys hat was sinking out of sight jemmy retrieved it and put it on it streamed water soaked like a sponge but he had no other way to carry it he was glad to have it back the air smelled alien wet and thick with greenery and rot he crawled over tremendous roots the water was thighdeep now icy around his ankles crotchdeep was this the right direction seen from overhead the grove hadnt seemed this big now he feared hed never reach the road something limbless slid through the water again nearer now julia sets hung thickly from the branches from time to time a vine lifted a wedgeshaped head and flickered its tongue to watch and sniff for clumsy prey bright and colorful they were and they shied from him too some snakes described in teaching programs were poisonous interstellar travelers wouldnt have brought poisonous snakes would they these were earthlife brought for decoration someone in sol systems planning section must have liked snakes but jemmy didnt and the thought of being touched by such a thing hed reached the road but the dark water was waistdeep and the road was a smoothly curved rim of gray rock at eyebrow level his hands slid over it he couldnt get the grip that would pull him out cursing he wrestled his way up a banyan then far enough along a branch to drop to the road he rested on his knees panting and dripping his hands on its warm surface the road he was home by its look by its feel this was the road that ran past bloocher farm but the houses on the far side were angular little boxes with drastically peaked roofs three girls were coming toward him they looked much alike pale skin and narrow noses and hair the color of butter sisters or cousins jemmys age they dressed in older clothes of mismatched color that didnt quite fit who were these people where had they come from exiles from spiral town when and where had thonny left his bike the girls shouldnt get the idea that this new tim hann didnt know could be worse boys would ask him embarrassing questions tied to a tree that would be down in the swamp but thonny wouldnt have left his bike that way and if hed peeled off as soon as they saw locals he must have left the bike up the road toward spiral town up the road by nearly a mile it tilted four big robust trees seemed to be right up against it jemmy walked toward them followed at a distance by the girls the huge roots of five seven banyans were actually lifting the edge of the road there thonnys bike hello one of the girls called are you timmy hann jemmy freed the bike and wheeled it around he didnt know what to do but theyd spoken they couldnt be much surprised if he talked back he said tim hann correcting their pronunciation im loria everybodys down by the beach she wasjemmys height the tallest of the girls narrow nose narrow chin wide eyes that held his owfl her clothes looked like shed dressed in the dark in garments borrowed half from spiral town half from merchants can i ride your thing bicycle she waited theyd never seen a bike before had they on whim jemmy handed it over to her he held it steady while she got on and showed her how to set her feet on the pedals he avoided touching her they talked to boys but they might take that more seriously he rolled the bike forward gave her a chance to find the feel of it then let go she stayed up he ran alongside still up learning to steer but not quite fast enough she was going to fall into the swamp he lunged for the seat of the bike brushed her where she sat tried again and had it pulled back leaning into it and stopped her short of the edge his fingertips burned i fforgot to talk about bbrakes he said loria listened looked where he pointed nodded and tried again a few false starts and she wobbled in among the houses laughing faster than he could follow one of the girls said im tarzana thats gl glind bednacourt were all bednacourt the bednacourt sisters narrow noses narrow chins wide dancing eyes tarzana took his arm glind took his other arm and they walked him between the houses the houses were two deep with truck gardens between the mudflat beyond grew black destiny sandweed that thinned out near the ocean fifty or sixty people were milling around braziers set on the bare mud others were down by the water jemmy felt the blood freezing in his arteries they were all st rangers hed never seen so many strangers together he hadnt guessed what that would do to him but the girls were urging him forward a few were examining thonnys bike while loria turned the pedals and the handlebars brenda there hed found his sister half a dozen men were out on the water riding floating slabs glind what are those boards brenda was with other girls at the shore and a couple of men too watching them some of those had boards and two of the men on the water were women it was confusing an optical illusion hed seen them as all men because they were together all wearing sleeveless shirts curdis was in a group around one of the braziers he waved enthusiastically and called timtimtimmy thanks for the reminder curdis theres a thousand kinds of trees and a thousand kinds of snakes and destiny vines you could build a city on and that gives timtimtimmy a reason for going in there typical you dive into a jungle and ignore the people drew you really surprised us we had no idea you were here tim this is drew bednacourt pleased drew bednacourt said smiling he was whitehaired and muscular dads age and a white scar ran down his dark chest into his short pants you surprised us too his handshake was hard horny curdis said youre not that surprised jemmy saw what he meant most of the locals werent talking to the spirals they were fishing or cooking or floating on boards in the water drew said weve seen merchants all our lives the caravan went through two weeks ago theyll be back in a week with whatever haven and the spirals leave tarzana looked jemmy over hes already wet dad tim want to go for a swim do you know how to ride jemmy asked ride then he saw two men stand up on their boards while a wave hurled them forward he had to try that they sat in a circle on the sand eating in near darkness the red of sunset had faded the only light was quicksilver a brilliant spark at the oceans rim jemmy was exhausted the long day might have worn him out but the surfing lesson was the finishing stroke in the morning he was going to hurt he listened halfdozing while curdis and brenda talked to the bednacourt girls and cloochi boys the girls were sisters born a year apart tarzana nineteen loria eighteen glind seventeen drew their father was cooking over the brazier with their mother wend who had been surfing harl and susie cloochi were older wend bednacourts parents the girls began passing out food jemmy didnt guess how hungry he was until he bit into a chicken leg then he ate like a starving wolf whatever the girls brought him chicken and corn and earthlife fruit destiny crab and destiny seaweed quicksilver disappeared in a blink now the only light was stars and a funny blue glow in the rolling waves harl cloochi said im an old man curdis is quicksilver brighter than it used to be i can never he sure its like quicksilver disappears in a blink and then the nights as black as inside my stomach im only twentytwo curdis said youre spiral youve still got machines that t ach they say theyre wearing out tim brenda remember anything about quicksilver from the schooling disks brenda did quicksilvers closest to the sun that must he why its so bright its not very big quicksilver destiny volstaag hogun hela there was something else about quicksilver something jemmy had read and forgotten and now it wouldnt come how did you come here curdis asked susie cloochi answered my father told me his family got in a fight with the spirals mother was carrying me already they took some seeds and stuff and came down the road and found twerdahi already here jemmy exclaimed twerdahl laughter susie said this place we name it twerdahl town after the founders the ones who took cavorite and disappeared jemmy laughed at himself i thought you meant the twerdahls themselves your turn youre the first spirals weve seen in ages what are you doing here the silence stretched brenda or curdis might have answers ready but jemmy couldnt know that and in the dark he couldnt see their faces he took the chance and said following the path of the cavorite i want to know where they went tarzana breathed cavorite but youve got the teaching machines old susie cloochi said dont they tell you all fatigue fled jemmy said some cavorite left with forty crew i know some of the names twerdahi tucker granger lyons doheny spiral town was founded in but they called it base one then cavorite left in you know they left a spiral of road behind them they never came home maybe they never planned to maybe something killed them susie cloochi said my family never went home a good many families here never did folk do leave spiral town from time to time might it be that the cavorite crew just wanted to get away snakes jemmy said they looked at him snakes tim his mind had wandered then closed its teeth onsnakes in the swamp it just came to me miz cloochi cavorite must have left those someone aboard cavorite must have liked snakes and swamps said brenda jemmy looked back toward the swamp cant you see it theyre drifting along flame mushing out violet under the skirt he couldnt really picture that hed never seen a flame that hot nobody had they could go faster if they were just trying to get away but theyre just drifting along leaving a trail of melted rock behind them suddenly theyre looking at a swamp what can they do they can boil the water kill the destiny weeds but that wont make it into road they could go around it uphill but that wouldnt leave a road for anything with wheels rocks brenda said theyd have to roll a line of rocks down across the water curdis said we had tractors in spiral town big machines for pulling a plow or pushing down a tree they dont go anymore cavorite might have taken one jemmy nodded putting it into the picture push a row of rocks across like steppingstones then hover till the rock melts and the water boils wait till the swamp cools down then seed no ttim thats a humongous thermal mass you dont throw seeds in boiling water he nodded right they go on making road week or two later they come back and seed some trees maybe a year and leave the snakes and anything else i didnt see damn curdis said all right what damn they werent just runaways the cavorite crew i always knew forty crew was too tidy when youre running away you dont wait for your numbers to come out neat like that the road was the point if cavorite came back this far to seed a swamp why not come all the way back to spiral town the bednacourt sisters led them to a structure that was all one big room a lot of us slept here after the storm washed away some houses two years ago loria said elsewise its the house of healing there was nothing like a bed the bloocher clan slept on the wide expanse of floor covered in their own clothes in a moment when brenda was surely asleep curdis spoke in the dark i had to turn down an offer from loria offer ah what did you say i said im married and brendas too young but timmys not jemmys ears burned in the dark the sun hadnt risen over the mountains yet the morning was cold the water was colder for the first moments then jemmys body stopped noticing he and tarzana fought their boards through the waves and paddled out to where others were sitting six in a row they waited talking little sound carried very well over the water jemmy asked dont you get sharks around here the pause lasted long enough that jemmy thought nobody had heard him then one boy said i dont think they like the taste of the river sometimes one comes around we get a lot of sharks when a caravan stops and three hundred chugs get their attention wave tarzana said the idea was to be moving as fast as the wave when it arrived paddle without falling off when the board catches the wave stand up jemmy had tried standing up yesterday today he didnt kneeling on a board as a wave hurled it toward the beach was tough enough curdis asked the twerdahl folk for work and work was found he and brenda and jemmy knew how to garden knew how to pull destiny weeds if we leave about now curdis said in midafternoon well get to the guarded bridge about sunset i think they like us here brenda said doubtfully uhhuh i dont guess margeiys worried about us yet but brenda i told the merchants wed be coming back today jemmy held up a hand hold it sunset they saw thonny around noon lets let them see you around sunset at noon and sunset two views of tim hann could look quite different curdis continued sunset not dawn theyd never believe we marched in the dark did the merchants tell you about twerdahi town not a word curdis said in some irritation nothing about people living down the road big surprise big joke so said jemmy we found a surprise and stayed an extra day thats what theyll expect give them another day to forget what tim hann looks like curdis grinned i like it here too i didnt have the nerve to try those boards tim how is it jemmy shook his head its like i cant tell a twerdahl how to ride a bicycle i cant tell you what surfing is like want us to show you brenda yeah brenda showed an aptitude for surfing curdis gave up early he didnt like falling off in front of strange males the bednacourt girls returned to the house of healing with them that night when the bloocher clan curled into their blankets the girls didnt leave voices in the dark men and women talking together that was loria youre good people you have things to teach us some of what comes off the road are parasites we all do farm work curdis said we learn to look for what needs doing glind we dont let anyone stay a minute if hes alone any man alone must be running from something a woman curdis a woman alone might be running from well a man tarzanas voice loria the only women weve ever seen on the road were merchants but there was a man called himself haines and he was a murderer who hid in the swamp he stole from the truck gardens when he could until destiny food and no speckles turned him into a skeletal zombie and then they flushed him out sounds like mattoo haine curdis said he killed his wife and oldest son when i was little nobody wanted to tell twerdahls that if criminals could get past where the road straightened spiral town let them go there was a silence jemmy savored then he spoke into the dark it must have started this way tim tarzana grown men and women dont talk to each other in spiral town when your grandparents came maybe they didnt bring lights they could talk together in the dark where they could be just voices mmmm he must have fallen asleep soon after jemmy taught bicycle riding all morning cooking over a grill fascinated him he helped some but watched more in midafternoon they retrieved their bikes from twerdahl riders again curdis said time to leave jemmy said im not going what tell the merchants tim wants to know where cavorite went tim hann is on the road he saw curdis studying him and guessed his thoughts is jemmy crazy how crazy he didnt know jemmy like a brother and the jemmy bloocher he thought he knew wouldnt have killed a merchant curdis said theyll take a harder look at tim hann if tim comes back alone i dont think im coming back curdis i cant run bloocher farm i cant talk down a merchants price while im hiding my face and if spiral town gets in another faceoff with the caravans you see curdis did theyd have to stand without the bloochers youd stand for the bloochers but youd be hiding curdis its unacceptable give thonny two years hell be fine running bloocher farm thonny doesnt have to hide anything thats two years before margery and i can get our own farm forgive me uhhuh curdiss eyes were unfocused still thinking okay the caravanll be starting back this way tomorrow or so i figured wed meet them just when they were getting organized and wed get you through that way if you stay theyll be here in oh four days tim are you staying here or pushing on i dont know you could keep ahead of a caravan even on foot sure or let them catch you in a few weeks but now youre a twerdahl with itchy feet mmm is this really your choice yes me too brenda said curdis blew his top brenda shouted back then cried jemmy watched them dwindle pedaling hard up the road when he returned to the house of healing that night loria came with him oven ma er the northwest coast is mountainous the southeast coast is wider and rich in beaches well set clown at the far end f the peninsula and explore anthony lyons geology twerdahl town didnt seem to know about bread there was grain growing along the road there were rocks about children of all ages found tim hann strange and interesting and some would do what he suggested he showed the younger children how to gather grain the older helped him carry rocks upthrusting banyan knees had flaked a great flat shelf of lava from the road four were able to move that it became the base of tim hanns oven his first experiments came out scorched but two days after his sibs left him tim hann served bread at dinner the morning of the third day the first of the board riders took their boards from where they were propped against the long wall of the house of healing tim hann trailed the others watching them trying to balance the board on his shoulder as they did the board was a few inches shorter than tim himself carved from wood that grew in the swamp it was heavy and awkward playful gusts of wind kept swinging it about far up the road toward spiral town there was dust jemmy stopped and squinted a plume of dust far off he thought he knew what it meant wend bednacourt carried her board like a wand she wasnt stronger than he was but she had the balance the other riders were running but wend trailed back a little she said my daughters have taken an interest in you tim i know but all the others it had taken jemmy two days to notice that the bednacourt women were the only womeh who would talk to him in spiral town that was normal but here is it something im doing tim do they say marry in spiral town yes of course wend shied back a bit to avoid the wild swinging of his board hows it done theres a ceremony you invite tim how do you decide this was no casual conversation jemmy set his board down and sat on it thinking it through we kids all pretty much know each other time the girls stop talking to us if im interested in a girl he decided not to mention tunia judda why maybe ive got a friend who dated her or knows her or a friend of a friend hed learned quite a lot about tunia and the judda family or my sister or maybe a cousin probably knows her can tell me you dont talk to her her no not until were dating thats hed never thought of it this way like a contract like youre buying seed corn or a rooster like we buy each other on spec the older woman also sat on her board so two nights ago loria spoke to you he could feel himself blushing she did what did she say she told you we talked said wend he couldnt lie he wouldnt know what to hide he said loria came with me back to the house of healing she brought a blanket i rolled up in mine i was tired there wasnt any light of course so i couldnt see her face and she couldnt see mine talkings easier that way somehow i just thought wed talk until i fell asleep she said do you want to make babies with me what did you take that to mean he looked at lorias mother it means rub up against ffuck how could it mean anything else yes tim we say that when we want to talk about marrying raising children how to take care of them how many you can afford no look she touched me i would have but i was a little slow maybe she was a little distance away and i couldnt see her face i didnt see it coming do you want to make babies with me and then a hand came out of the dark and had my knee i pulled and she came to me and we did it the other board riders were all dut on the water leaving them alone pointedly wend bednacourt was smiling but not at him and last night i couldntfind loria all day she went with some others spice hunting avoiding me i told her it was my first time wend there are things were not born knowing its dark in the house of healing i hit her jaw with my elbow before i got the knackof moving slowly touching everywhere darkness had its good points she wanted to let you talk to the rest of us what happened last night tarzana she came back to the house of healing with me after dinner i didnt know what she had in mind so i didnt push i was hoping shed tell me why loria if she didnt want to see me why but i didnt know how to ask she said tim do you want children i reached out and got her hand and she said no tim and i stopped his memory raced on ahead tarzanas voice in the dark you do want children dont you hed laughed and said what from way over here arent you interested i was he said lightly hiding disappointment it was as if tarzana blew hot and then cold offered and then pulled back loria had done that too then relented hed have been angry if a spiral girl did that here he might be missing some signal some custom loria says she asked you but you didnt answer tarzana said she asked he told tarzana smugly i think i answered he snapped back to the present we werent talking about the same thing at all were we no said wend uhhuh how could he not be flattered and horrified these waters were deeper than hed expected loria knows i didnt know anything she just went ahead with it wend said why didnt she just leave when she knew i had the wrong idea her mothers lips twitched upward maybe she liked the wrong idea a girl might shes seen every twerdahi boy and man every day of her life she could wait for a caravan but thats so wend smiled everyone does that youre different you can do things we cant not just the bicycle tim that only came with you but the oven are all twerdahl women like this he chose to ask instead so why didnt loria tell tarzana why dont i ask her that he couldnt stop grinning big joke on her sister so why didnt tarzana leave big joke on loria on tim hann wend where does that put me i cant be dating both of your daughters a weird impulse made him add can i no but you dont have to make up your mind right away good he said wonderful meaning it then he said wait yes i do is that what i think it is the dust plume had settled some while they talked but it was still there wend said theyll he here late tomorrow speckles are cheap after they leave spiral town if theyve got any left we usually wait unless were out i never told you why i left spiral town not just following cavorite jemmy told her caravan merchants guns fedrick blowing a watermelon to bits eight years later caravan fedrick again fedricks gun fedrick dying on the floor tim hann was the mask that hid a merchantkiller nobody in twerdahl town knew that but they all knew he was a stranger come straight down the road ahead of the caravan anyone in twerdahl town might blurt that out to any merchant he didnt tell her his name she listened and nodded he was expecting her to shrink from him but she didnt i think id best keep moving down the road he said even if they send someone ahead i can outride him on a bike how will you feed yourself i found you further down the road maybe there are people too speckles you cant go to merchants tim what do you think youll do trade for speckles with locals they had to buy theirs from merchants idont keep more than i need for my family most people dont okay i get stupid and die at least its not right away wend i dont really want to leave she said marry loria or marry tarzana marry into the family well tell them youre one of us do you mind changing your name huh when a wanderer marries a local no i dont mind its rare but it has happened i dont mind all right three days now youve been a twerdahl let a merchant see you on a board first hell see you as a twerdahi whatever you do next am i good enough a clumsy twerdahl would catch a suspicious eye ive watched tim youre good with the board and cooking let me do some of the cooking right i need to buy some things i dont know what you use for money money jemmy was only carrying a few coins the price of three or four meals he showed them to wend when she shook her head he gave them to her it would be bad if merchants found those on him then he asked what do you do if you want something ask give something back with a caravan with them too but they want to know what theyre getting i bet they do what do you need more clothes shoes speckles a board i guess nobody has all of that i need the whole town to cover for me to make the merchants think im one of them wend what if i give twerdahl town my bike ill talk to them she said over dinner the dust crawled toward twerdahl town the ovens in the bloocher kitchen outclassed tim hanns first pile of lava chunks jemmy was sure he could improve his oven sitting on his board his feet wiggling in the sand he started making sketches a few boys watched over his shoulder and made comments the bednacourt girls came to him all three weve been talking loria said with wend tarzana said mother amplified glind men of jemmys age surrounded them and they were all listening loria pulled him to his feet lets surf the towns teen boys followed them into the water once beyond the waves the boys who tried to join them were sqmehow cut off discouraged they watched from a distance while bednacourt girls surrounded tim hann like three predators tim preempted the conversation your mother explained some things i guess i was a fool a fool doesnt get what he wants loria said we talked it over said tarzana loria youre fianced both of us tarzana dating us youd say but that cant last forever tim glind so no sex tarzana until you make up your mind tim smiled at glind and said thats easy for you to say glinds eyes dropped tarzana hastily said no now tim you shouldnt even be fianced to two women its only because youre from up the road loria hands off glind tim i never asked glind to make babies with me why bring her im not as tough as i look meaning that two girls should be able to ward off an attack glinds hands thrashed water turning her board tim called big joke glind glind i dont mind you talking for your sisters i dont mind waiting either i want to know what youre like both what i cant figure out glind turned her board to face him again he said i cant figure how you and you and you too glind decided id make a good husband how do you know they didnt answer i told wend did she tell you the merchants want me if i can pass for a twerdahi theyll pass me by did she tell you why they want me tell everyone glind said coldly at dinner an arc of strangers faced him as they carried their boards in surfers straggled in behind him jemmy felt like a bug on a pin he saw no point in waiting he began to talk it went better than hed expected there were faces like masks people who wondered when tim hann would next loose violence about him but many more grew raucous as twerdahi town worked schemes to befool the traders tim hann joined the bednacourt girls he had wondered if his problem would solve itself at this time but loria and tarzana set themselves at his sides and no other woman of twerdahl town wanted his company he was fianced twice in early afternoon wagons began moving past twerdahls clustered about the open sides jemmy watched from a board on the water loria floating beside him waved broadly out to sea and shouted outside green water was humping out there big wave coming for his ears alone loria said we surf when the merchants are in dad says it distracts them merchants are hard to distract you want them to remember you like this surf kneel arms in the water sweeping like oars sliding down down the great green hill of water tim hann stood up and held his balance he heard loria shout walk it forward and didnt have strength to laugh he could feel what she meant though he was too high on the wave he needed to point the board down to slide faster the problem was that he couldnt move his feet he got a fair distance he seemed to fly forever before the wave rolled over and flipped him and the board hed never glanced at the wagons the wagons parked far down the road nearly out of sight the chugs were an ocher wave rolling down the sand raising dust in a great khaki cloud theyll stir up the sharks loria shouted and waved him toward the beach the surfers were getting out of the water jemmy went to help with the cooking faintly from down the road they could hear the popping of gunfire harl cloochi had managed to hook some huge deltawinged destiny fish younger men came running when they saw it flopping in the shallows wrestled it into submission and brought it up it covered one of the grills from end to end the merchants returned on foot they brought no wares but some of them carried fruits and a great yellow squash produce bought in spiral town the merchants had noticed tim hanns oven master granger wanted to use it to cook the big squash jemmy guessed that they would ruin the oven if they werent careful it was nothing but lava chunks held together by their own weight so he made them wait while he punctured the squash with a big fork to let steam out and helped them roll the squash in and built up the fire again smiling like an idiot and trying not to shy away from master granger master sean granger was an older man proprietor of the second wagon though a younger woman drove theyd shared dinner with dad and jemmy at harrys bar twice before dads accident jemmy didnt dare not meet his eyes that should do it thank you master granger said to him i should get back to cooking said tim hann he had set himself in charge of watching the great fish cook he saw too late that in the cool of coming night the merchants were all standing around the cookfires but their eyes passed right over tim hann the cook or through him hed made the right move after all what would you call this thing master granger asked of nobody in particular berda farrow said hells angelfish nice she said i didnt make it up thats its name we see them a lot i miss sub clams granger said in a month the otterfolkll have a mess of them for us jemmy smiled more people down the road he called to wade curdis trying not to overdo the accent berda wade we should turn this monster wade was a strong man in his thirties he and berda and tim hann turned the fish easily the merchants backed up to give them room were lucky there granger said if otterfolk were people theyd eat the best fish themselves wade turned to stare tim hann didnt look around twerdahls didnt like to interrupt merchants but wade spoke anyway these otterfolk who are they we never see anyone but you and us the merchants laughed inordinately jemmy looked about him at merchants mingling with twerdahlsany of whom could blow his secret to bitsand contrived to be busy destiny fish was tough and chewy unless it was cooked slowly cooking was creation itself it seemed to put the universe in perspective the otterfolk theyre not people a younger merchant said they live in the ocean we trade them tools and stuff for fish there are some destiny fish we can eat and they tend the earthlife fish too you only come through three times a year wade persisted why dont they come trade with us cant they hate sub clams though used to kill them till we came along sub clams eat destiny turtles but theyre good eating for us that is tim decided the fish was done hed never seen hells angelfish before but like many destiny fish the meat came apart in layers tim hann cut and other twerdahls served a merchants accent said criminals tim hann served a perfect strip of fish to an exotic and lovely merchant woman boiling potatoes now and the big squash in a bit he said to her precisely because spiral men didnt talk to women but jemmy bloocher had heard that younger merchants voice before barking some order at fedrick and the other voice was old harl cloochi its just a damn rumor of course but we almost never see a spiral so how do we know theres some truth in it the merchant said spiral town takes care of their own criminals i spoke as witness once at a trial in spiral town they banged the yutz afterward ah all right but harl if a killer gets to the road before they catch him how can they chase him down most spirals never get out of town at all a runner doesnt have to stick to the road and even if he did how far did he go its a long long road so they just let him go i suppose they chase him awhile longer if he did something sticky then they just tell us and let him go and leave him for us let the road towns deal with their dregs well that and speckles deprivation appreciative silence the merchants voice said a lot of the communities along the road think the same way thing is harl were not executioners for someone elses dregs and some of what they call crime isnt all that serious when a yutz wants to ride the wagons sometimes we see if hell work out even criminals a man on the run can make a damn good labor yutz and theyd walked out of range late in the night after the merchants went back to their wagons han cloochi took tim hann aside he asked was the man you killed a labor yutz i never heard the words until tonight well there was a labor yutz killed in spiral town a few days ago jemmy waited he came from way down the road merchants wont talk about that drunk or sober but kashi says he had the manners of a shark and thats why he got himself killed they kept him around because he could lift his own weight in gear and shoot the teeth out ofa lungshark one at a time labor yutz jemmy said tasting the words see the point nobody killed a merchant they wont search that hard for whoever killed a labor yutz and they may even think he earned it uhhuh thanks harl from bottom to top thank you so whatre you going to do tim hann drew a deep breath of smoketinged salt air he said stay tke old surfer destiny circles a cooler sun our year is only threefifths as long as earths weve divided it into eight months f lour weeks each the days run nearly twentyfive hours our descendants may well choose a different calendar henry judd planetologist twerdahl towns entire male population took twelve days to build them a peakroofed house no bigger than the family room at bloocher farm in spiral town a marriage was made by recording it in computer records but here the building of a house was a marriage tim bednacourt saw how the house could expand under the overextended roof once he and lonia began having children autumn moved into winter it was a busy time everything edible seemed to be ripening at once everything must be picked and stored or preserved working refrigerators were rare in spiral town but in twerdahl town they didnt exist fruits could be boiled for preserves vegetables blanched meat smoked and any of it could be eaten at once they ate like chugs winter was colder than winters in spiral town they lost some of autumns fat they kept a cauldron simmering for tea on a small fire pit that never went out there were blanched vegetables smoked meat snakes from the swamp and destiny fish a dozen kinds of jam were eaten straight or with meat or on bread from tims oven the sea was too cold for swimming or surfing the water of the cypress swamp stayed tepid there were three funerals that winter two elders whom tim had barely met and a little girl who sickened and died in two days twerdahl town set them in the swamp along the edge of the road the first time tim got the shivers but the dead were feeding earthlife trees and creatures what matter if those were denizens of a swamp tim bednacourt had no warning come dawn of a bright morning in early spring tarzana and glind were pulling him and lonia out of bed the house theyd built had no locks and the sisters had no sense of privacy lonia had tims arm and tarzana had the other and glind was talking too and there was no resisting lonia explained breathless as the laughing girls pulled tim into a run there were near three hundred twerdahls there were fiftytwo weed cutters once there had been sixty twerdahis were more careful counting knives than each other tim noticed but the point was that there werent enough knives so they ran knowing that their elders would wake later and follow at their leisure to take the knives away it looked like all the teens and twenties of twerdahl town were swarming toward the toolhouse they raced to be first through the big doors they pushed past each other clutching weed cutters one elder at least was up julya franken was standing benevolent guard over blades heaped on a table early arrivals had picked them over no seven were alike though there was a set of six and there were several sets of five that had been six some were just big enough to use for cooking or eating a few were big enough to swing twohanded tim and the girls snatched up blades and ran for the swamp the youth of twerdahi town left their clothes in neat piles and scrambled down into the water they slashed exuberantly at thick green hawsers fringed with lacy spines the destiny julia sets and python vines that were killing earthlife trees tim could hear shouted warnings from elsewhere in the swamp not everyone had learned to stay clear of slashing blades tim disengaged himself even from loria who made joyful howling noises as she swung a quartermeter serrated kitchen knife at the biggest vines tim slashed slashed with a midsized broadbladed knife moving straight inland through the hiphigh water snakes avoided him but there were too many for his comfort he slashed loose a branch to prod them away now orange daylight glowed through the trees ahead until he faced a rising lava slope he was alone if thonny and jemmy bloocher had left evidence of themselves a third of a year ago it was best that tim bednacourt find it first nothing nothing of jemmy bloocher showed here he turned back toward the voices glind was gathering headsized spongy clumps of fiber and stuffing them in a net bag fairy loofa she told him got enough i think so cutting vine was exhausting work when they got tired they worked nearer the road so that an elder could claim the knife twerdahls in their thirties and forties were arriving in clumps and they took their time taking up knives it was a game of showing off strength and tim couldnt quit until loria did but the road came nearer and nearer they saw tarzana pass her blade to her father two older women who tended the bean gardens sharlot and emjay clellan watched them for several minutes then jumped down and claimed their knives tim and loria crawled up onto the road and joined tarzana and glind and a host of bodies lying and drying on the sunwarmed surface of the road the vines would recover of course twerdahl town made no serious attempt to exterminate them everybody quit around noon gathered and stacked the blades jumped back into the water and bathed and scraped each others backs with fairy loofas it was fun the first break theyd had from work in some time and it got theni clean before the spring caravan arrived at last nights sunset theyd heard distant gunfire the wagons cruised past while twerdahl town did business at their windows trading harvest fruits for speckles and tools chatting to learn what the others had prices would be cheaper coming back from spiral town tim stayed in the house while loria dealt with merchants the summer caravan was long gone who would know him here but loria took it for granted that tim would not confront the spring caravan windows were scarce in twerdahl town this house had only two tim watched through the diningroom window as the wagons drifted off up the road loria was back i got speckles for fresh corn i didnt want to wait we were nearly out it feels like im hiding she looked at him you are hiding the sun was low and quicksilver had already blinked out when a rattle of gunfire drifted down the road an hour later the merchants were back among them tim was stirfrying vegetables in a wok big enough to bathe a twoyearold using a spoon as long as his forearm an elderly merchant woman tried to strike up conversation but gave up quickly who could possibly expect him to pay attention to anything but cooking loria was unhappy why he was hidden in plain sight in the house he would be missing dinner in hiding in the dark it wasnt her they were hunting if they were hunting anyone at all the vegetables were done the nearest man wasnt as strong as berda farrow a middleaged mother of four with long limbs and stringy muscles so it was berda who helped him move the wok aside tim pulled the big omelet pan onto the fire he poured eggs in a quart or so berda stayed a moment to watch him work then smiled and went off to chase children berda had taught him this under her eyes tim had made twoegg omelets all one morning until there was no feeling in his arm the eggs stuck at first or burned he used too much oil or too little under berdas supervision he began adding fillings she watched him perfect his technique then graduated him to a wok with a double handle ten eggs at a time all the territory around twerdahl town was infested with chickens they nested out of range of sharks nothing else seemed to hunt them wherever you went there were nests twerdahi town ate a lot of omelets he tilted the pan then lifted the omelets edge to let eggs run underneath he tipped cooked vegetables across the omelet the corner of his eye caught a grinning merchant woman holding a shaker he took it sprinkled the omelet with speckles then handed the shaker hack with a nod and smile twerdahls put speckles in almost anything made with eggs but twerdahls wouldnt trade for speckles and then give them back merchants would get none in their dinner if they didnt bring their own tim flipped the omelet over itself cavorite he finished the maneuver before he looked around who had spoken two merchants didnt notice him the otterfolk saw it come past they remember i got one of them to draw it for me its not easy to tell the older man said when you dont know how it works you dont know what to draw either anyway they were just drawing in sand i copied it sure you did joker but they drew what they thought you wanted and you copied what you thought you saw skip it yutz isnt that omelet ready yet right tim briskly turned the omelet onto a plate should be perfect jean cut this up for us will you a halfgrown girl began cutting the huge omelet and serving it onto plates loria came out of nowhere set a slice of broiled meat beside tim and took a stack of empty plates she brushed sensuously past tim and breathed into his ear i am so sick of hearing about cavorite and was gone tim poured oil and more eggs into the pan in the morning the wagons went on to spiral town and twerdahl town returned to the work of harvest two weeks passed loria was at work on a tossed salad she brushed past him back to back slowly a suggestive caress yum the bednacourt kitchen was bigger than the hanns but two at work still had to touch two could make a virtue of that tim drained the rice brown rice with flecks of color in it bell peppers and onion and bits of bacon no speckles today theyd all had enough last night lunch for four including wend who was somewhere about or five if tarzana showed up the bednacourts were a close family loria was closer to her mother and sisters than to her husband it didnt bother him spiral men were cliquish too that was tims problem he was a clique of one he didnt have quite the same concerns didnt speak quite the same language as twerdahl town had he chosen loria or had the bednacourt women played some complex game with tim bednacourt as the prize loria had taught him surfing as hed taught her the bicycle while tarzana drifted with other men glind had never been alone with him at all loria had become the default option caravans in sight glind said tim felt loria stiffen weve already got our speckles she said you didnt wait no answer glind turned from the road and said for tims benefit they like to travel at harvest time the feasts are wonderful wheres tarzana met a merchant man i think he asked not a labor yutz to see if she knew the term merchant how will gerrel feel about that loria looked at him queerly glind serving out salad didnt notice feel tim anyone can mix it up with the merchants hey she looked up they tell us about something called hybrid vigor we get better babies if we dont make babies with just each other did they teach you about that in spiral town sure hybrid vigor and gene drift tim grinned at loria was that it was that what you saw in me she blushed glind grinning said we wonder its such a good story maybe its just no i read about hybrid vigor and gene drift in the teaching programs i could go off with a merchant woman and nobody will care and i wasnt supposed to know that he was watching his wifes face she was irritated and unamused loria you know why i cant get close to merchants she nodded even so im glad we lock up the knives he teased her his mind ran on when did twerdahis start doing that why was there a time of knives and blood and now they pass them out to cooks every evening and count them better not ask abruptly loria asked where did you hear that labor yutz last summer have you ever talked with haron welsh what the old surfer the one who does stunts he was a labor yutz twice once before i was born talk to him haron welsh wasnt cliquish tim hadnt seen him at the vineslash he lived alone he worked his own patch of garden he surfed alone in late morning he was a small dark silhouette in a cold drizzle alone on the water tim waited on the beach the old surfer let several good waves pass he must be watching the endless passage of the caravan haron caught a wave finally as the old man stood up in the shallows tim shouted and waved a towel in one hand a fat mug of silver fern tea in the other the old man thought it over then pulled his board to land he used the towel and dropped it then took the mug you were a labor yutz tim said haron drank the hot tea down straight and handed back the cup only then did he speak whore you tim bednacourt you dont know anything haron picked up his board and turned toward the water stopped spiral yes they got teaching things in spiral you learn thats right huh what do you know that i dont well ive been as far as the neck tell me about it the old man started to turn away tim said ever seen columbia the rest of twerdahl town had no interest in columbia or cavorite no tell me about columbia tim spoke to the back of harons head columbia was a huge squat tower in a nest of cables with a brick building against its side to protect the join the original cables were as thin as angeihair pasta replacement cables were as thick as a mans fingers made of copper or silver bought from merchants clusters of black conical pits each the size of a boy were attitude jets once they had spit fire the hatch ten meters up and the old stairway built to reach it were made of poured rock wonderfully precise power had flowed from columbia for two and a half centuries tim spoke of spiral towns machines all wearing down getting less and less power as columbias energy grew more sluggish the old man listened and gave nothing back and tim spoke more than he intended he spoke of boyhood dreams studying engineering and plasma physics running the power system as apprentice and journeyman until they would let him enter columbias interior to turn on the old ships motors and rise in a blaze of light and a tearing away of the ships prison of cables rise into the sky and fly the eldest bloocher boy the one who would inherit could never do any of that the old mans attention was wandering from some attic storage in his memory tim pulled something random did you know that earths sun was hotter than ours harons eyebrows arced why didnt they fry earth was farther away of course the sun probably looked smaller and brighter so itd dazzle you quicker and the light would have been more blue maybe the sky had more blue in it tim was guessing at some of this but destinys sun is a little smaller than sol and maybe two billion years older huh and why would any of this crap make a fingernails difference to anyone jemmy bloocher had asked that too there were answers earth took almost twice as long to go around sol we have eight months in a year they had twelve but theirs were longer the clocks still measure earth days and earth years yeah the spiral town clocks cant anyone make a clock for destiny time nobody i know hey have you ever been sunburned haron considered few times ive stayed out all day surfing next day im bright red and everything hurts cant wear clothes cant go outside next day itch two days after that im peeling like a snake in spring yeah yeah on earth you could do that in a hour tim said they had to wear hats and spread goo on their skins to thin the sunlight or theyd get cancer too much hed never quite got this straight too much of the light thats too blue to see haron seemed to find that funny too blue to see he set down the board nearly naked to the wind he didnt shiver all right you know something not like these yutzes what do you want did you ever see cavo rite no did you ever find out where cavorite went do the traders know harons eyes went distant his lips moved but nothing came out the neck tim prodded we got to the neck the road goes right across is that where the otterfolk are them theyre all along the shore of the big bay they dont talk they cant go anywhere you went twice you must like it not so much that tim waited they dont know anything here surf in summer gather and eat in fall huddle hungry in winter time of year tells them what theyre doing everything theyre doing it feels so cramped harons voice was rising but he caught himself doesnt matter anyway the merchants asked i had to go why first time they gave us two knives haron grinned second time i was trained already four knives ah hed been bought the otterfolk they cant go anywhere haron said theres only the bay anywhere else they die thats one reason id go again because the otterfolk cant what are they like were not supposed to talk to them but you can sneak away they draw pictures in the sand you try to tell them things that way but its haron frowned its not enough for what haron shook his head he picked up his board and ran into the water merchants and twerdahls mingled on the sand tim bednacourt worked anonymous in their midst for a long moment quicksilver burned at the edge of the sea just below the cloud deck then it winked out an hour of sunlight left merchants watched tim bednacourt cutting onions carrots bell peppers mushrooms picked in the cypress swamp that looks good the older woman said tim smiled four merchants came all a few inches shorter than tim all exotic and elegant dressed in many colors many layers ife noticed the younger man first dark with a thin mustache tim had seen him before an older man with brown hair and a forked beard turning gray a blackhaired woman his own age another very like her but no older than tim skins browner than tims all four their eyes were dark and a bit tilted parents son daughter he could be wrong about that or their ages or almost anything any fool might pretend to know all about merchants nobody really knew the young man said i remember you we were talking about otterfolk i noticed you trying to listen and cook i remember youre joker he nodded the older woman asked would you like to see them for yourself caught by surprise tim laughed sure its not likely is it im senka she said these are damon and rian my husband and daughter im tim bednacourt she was examining him it made him uncomfortable how long have you lived in this place twenty years born here making himself a year older than jemmy bloocher the man asked do you ever wonder what the rest of the world looks like well sure sometimes i look off down the road and tim he jumped loria she said you cant cook in the dark you need help it wasnt dark yet but yes love i got a little behind you cut ill start these an hour of light left tim added oil to the wokalready hotthen vegetables the action became brisk the merchant trio watched then wandered off loria asked what did they want they didnt say but something oh yeah sounds like they need a labor yutz or two the big vegetable omelets had become almost reflex tim finished one and shouted for the nearest older child whose name he could remember did you talk to haron tried what happened to him this batch is finished loria said and went briskly away food wandered toward him from other cookfires tim ate as he cooked sausage roasted ear of corn half of a passerbys chunk of bread a slice of his own omelet when it was too dark to see he settled himself on the sand heavens fire still burned where sky met sea his arms and shoulders hurt he didnt usually push himself this hard where was loria why hadnt she expected him to talk to haron it was her own suggestion someone was at his side he turned hoping to see loria or any bednacourt who could explain what loria was angry about it was a young merchant woman her clothes still a patchwork of color in the dying light she handed him the edge of a half melon they broke it together he kept half the juice running down his fingers rian she said youre tim hello rian senkas daughter she sat beside him in the dark her face was all planes and angles a lovely but abstracted shape eyes a bit tilted like almonds this is my first trip she said from where he asked we dont talk about that we dont take labor yutzes past the neck too bad he thought then he stared past the neck shed been born on the mainland rian leaned close enough that he could feel her breath on his cheek one of our cooks has died she said we need another uhhuh want to come with us as a labor yutz yes tim smiled politely rian why dont you tell me how your cook died she hesitated well we were too far from the other wagons petey was a cowboy say cowboy he liked to be right there on the sand shooting when the sharks came at us made us shoot around him few days ago the sharks got ahead of us a bit they got petey tim said what he should have said first ive only been married two months yes to loria bed bednacourt she carrying a guest yet this question seemed excessively personal but tim supposed it might matter to merchants interested in hiring a womans husband he said not yet so come tim shook his head she was trying to study his face in the dark nobody has to be down there on the sand with the sharks tim not a labor yutz anyway they never reach the wagon roofs she thought he was afraid you know she said the otterfolk must have been the first unhuman tool users anyone ever saw cavorite wouldnt have just sailed past she was right he thought and they can draw pictures of cavorite he said he couldnt say loria doesnt even want me talking to you let alone rian would wonder why and tim didnt know but that left only a killing in spiral town as his excuse and what would he tell her instead he said i wasnt the only cook you have four van barstowe limps a caravan yutz has to walk you know drew bednacourt drops things and hes surly you and van youre the best do you like my company tim at dinnertime there were knives everywhere you looked and where was loria right now no look rian we all grow up knowing about hybrid vigor but loria doesnt think like that my life wouldnt be worth living if he stopped talking because the merchant wdman was up and moving away he wondered if hed jumped to conclusions company shed said only that hed made an embarrassing mistake the house was empty long after he was in bed loria slid in and tickled him awake there was a ferocity to her lovemaking and she wouldnt let him talk she didnt want to talk afterward either they made love again unless he fell asleep first but sunlight blazed through the bedroom window and someone was pounding on the door tim pulled himself out of bed squinting why didnt loria answer come he called he pulled on some pants and went into the common room sharlot clellan drew bednacourt harl cloochi and berda farrow all elders of twerdahl town came in from the glare of sunlight they ushered in three merchants wearing wild colors two men one woman tim recognized the dark man named damon whats it all about he asked harl said tim these are damon and milo and halida elders of the caravan they came to us last night not just to us you understand but to all of twerdahl town tim this may sound odd the door opened again loria and tarzana tim repeated what is this loria dear weve had an offer harl said right did you know they came to tim last night tim what did they offer you she could have learned that last night job as a labor yutz cooking the elder twerdahls stared at the merchants you went to him first damon smiled and shrugged we looked for a better bargain he was reluctant tim couldnt read lorias expression the merchant woman halida said to tim your elders and mine theyve been talking we offer a long knife for every twenty days youre gone loria is that a good price dammit tim tarzana tarzana said yes sounded like it haron got less his first time damon said we want you cooking for us tonight tim that means you join us now youll be with ibnrushd wagon my familys wagon dont take too much with you no more than you can carry dont take speckles weve got plenty and tim he smiled the more we discuss it the farther well have to chase the wagons it was happening faster than he could think and he was still playing catchup loria lets talk he said and pulled her into the bedroom dawn light blazed through the window it was easier to read her face in here whats going on cant you tell oh a little theyd have had me cheap if id gone with them last night now theyve got to pay off the whole town but loria do they think im for sale i have a house and a wife and a secret that any of three hundred people might speak the old people theyve already taken the knives loria said bleakly she swept the blanket off their bed flung it high and let it settle on the floor we have to pack i knew theyd have you you can do things nobody else can tim didnt i try to keep you in the house he saw she was crying at least i gave you a great sendoff didnt i i didnt know i was going t great sendoff damn right can you come with me her head snapped up amazed youd what want me yes no no i cant yutzes are always men what do you want loria i want you to come back but if youre coming back like haron welsh then dont shed stacked his possessions on the blanket coat and shirts no hat twerdahls never wore hats the skillet from bloocher farm had become twerdahl town property and retrieving it would be a mistake she took his pouch of speckles if a yutz carries speckles they think its caravan property she said she considered then added one of the few things shed brought from the bednacourt house it was an old wooden toy model of cavorite vague in detail worn by handling in places thats yours he said she said youd have something like this if you really grew up here take it loria what happened to haron welsh the way he sees us changed hes uncle haron but we dont call him that anymore he thinks hes too good to talk to us dont come back that way tim whats your name jemmy bloocher all right loria rolled the blanket and tied it into a compact bundle go on he could have smoothed it over made his peace with loria he knew it then and he believed it later but the caravan was already moving and twerdahi town wanted knives and otterfolk remembered enough of cavorite to draw pictures on the road you dt stop your wagon to do business not unless its a favored mark or a decent ocfer stopping makes you look eager keep talking and let the chugs move on until the mark takes your ocfer shireen b r hd the wagons were rolling steadily away from twerdahi town when three merchants and tim bednacourt walked into a haze of fine dust the morning wore on swamp trailed off into grasscovered hills they crossed a wide and sluggish stream on steppingstones too conveniently placed to be natural halida named it whelans crossing the wagons didnt seem to he getting closer the merchants werent hurrying they ambled along chatting among themselves with his burden of possessions tim was still hard put to keep up now they were asking questions about life in twerdahl town tim tried to distract them with questions of his own ive never watched merchants cooking what do you use you will see i am damon ibnrushd ibnrushd is eight from the lead six from the tail we and lyons family carry the cookware do you cook with the same kind of thing you sell to twerdahl yes good is there always firewood always except at the tail a stone bridge arched over deep water tim asked did you build all of these bridges laughter who else gradually they drew alongside the last wagon now they were pass ing a line of chugs each chug spared tim one long dismissive glance they stood almost hip high those shells looked heavy theyd weigh about half as much as tim the top of the beak was an extension of the skullcap shell with a lower jaw to meet it that beak would deliver a hell of a bite tim suddenly realized that he was seeing the same odd blemish on each chug they were marked with an e inside a d carved into the shell on the right side dole halida said dole enterprises nineteen chugs pulled dole wagon twenty pulled the next they were marked with a bird of earth an owl eighteen pulled the next marked with an ellipse and a dot in the center wu family had bad luck this trip damon said softly as he smiled and waved at two men in the drivers alcove the wagons tim said theyre all alike damon nodded halida smiled spiral children noticed early eggs were alike seeds were alike babies were alike but crafted things were not things that were all alike were ancient machines from the time of landing settler magic like computers and microwave ovens or they were the woodandiron wagons of a caravan wagons were painted in flamboyant fashion a match for merchants clothing when the side opened to form a counter and sunscreen each wagon became a shop different from every other shop but the counters were up the wagons were closed and this was tim bednacourts first good look at wagons they were identical down to the last centimeter as if made all at the same time from identical components by identical workmen the drivers alcoves denied their similarities they were painted too and furnished with pillows and little shelves and niches that held mugs or pieces of carved wood from arcs of drivers benches that would be roomy for four merchants watched tim pass they didnt speak but they smiled they smile for you halida said we might have had to eat our own cooking the chugs werent paying much notice to passersby or the road or anything but their own steady motion fourth wagon from the end the chugs were marked with two vertical bars on an s halida climbed four shallow steps to the drivers bench the drivers shifted to give her room she looked down at tim and said milasevik we carry tents and bedding they walked on ibnrushd was sixth from the end out of thirteen wagons a summer caravan would have been fifteen to twenty senka smiled at tim from the drivers bench rian merely watched the last chug was marked with a crescent and sixpointed star damon ignored the steps he was into the drivers alcove in a smooth pullandjump maneuver a gesture invited tim to do the same tim dropped his pack into the alcove then scrambled over the side practice he promised himself milo called up to him milo spadoni second in line we carry ammunition we and tucker he walked on the drivers bench would hold four and it was full senka rian an elderly lady tim didnt know and mans brother tim said hello joker tim joker said damon said tim bednacourt this is shireen ibnrushd you obey her in all things mother tim is a wonderful cook very pleased tim said the old lady smiled tethers from each of the chugs were tied to knobs on a halfcircle of rail but the women werent bothering with them the chugs seemed to know what they were doing damon ibnrushd said youre a yutz now but not a labor yutz your rank is chef there are three other chefs and me and marilyn lyons lyons wagon carries the rest of the cookery you take orders from me or marilyn but if any other merchant tells you to lift or carry something you dont have to you can draft a loose labor yutz if hell put up with it but any merchant might give him another job and this is yours damon stooped and dug under the bench senka ibnrushd slid aside for him he came out with what tim recognized as a gun and a broad belt in his other hand he handed the gun to tim have you ever fired a shark gun tim bednacourt said no he took the gun suppressing the flinch and held it as if he didnt know which part was the handle it looked exactly like the gun that had killed fedrick he felt queasy hold it like this damon showed him never point at anything valuable and never at a person keep your fingers off the trigger unless youre serious these are bullets bullets were the size of tims thumb a ball of metal in a case made of what might be compressed vegetable fiber you load it like this it doesnt work without bullets the gun took eight never be caught with an unloaded gun twice never at sunset or sunrise lets get up on the roof and ill give you some practice pull and jump damon was on the roof tim set his hands pulled and jumped lunged too far as the wagon rolled and nearly fell off the roof was flat at its corners were coils of rope cloth had been nailed along a tencentimeterhigh rim some of us like to get down on our bellies prop up on our elbows and shoot that way damon said im not going to teach you that you cant swing far enough something could come at you from the side see that tree not far inland a slender destiny fisher tree leaned far over tip almost horizontal lace blowing and shredding in a brisk breeze suppose you want to shoot the tip off that stand facing right by a little about thirty degrees right youre righthanded both hands on the gun fold your left fingers over the right like this now your right arm is straight but your left elbow bends lean forward a little because the gun is going to kick back pull the trigger the noise was an assault the gun kicked in his hands something burst into view from trees nearby a caricature of a bird feathery and twolegged and big as a man it ran in circles squawking madly then off down the road tim braced his arms pointed and fired again the gun didnt snap up as high arms pull against each other damon suggested hmm tim tried that it felt good natural the fisher tree was some distance behind him now but he set his feet held his aim on the tip of the tree blam it was flying dust he hadnt fired the gun hadnt kicked that boardman yutz damon said on lyons wagon he didnt throw you off did he thats the first mistake youll make something distracts you you pull shoot a hole in something here damon took the gun he set himself the fisher tree was far behind them now damon fired and the chewed tip jumped like that he gave the gun back pick something closer the road swerved gradually inland and the land was drying out tim chose a lone thickholed destiny teapot aimed for the bole braced his feet his arms blam dust and splinters sprayed from the edge he aimed above the bole at a smaller target the spout he scored another hit good and enough damon said come sunset you can shoot sharks he bent and lifted a square patch of roof came up all the wagons have attic storage if a predator ever got this far heres refuge well stow your pack here and he reached into the hatch and brought out a transparent speckles pouch here tim took the pouch damon dropped a handful of bullets into it close it like this keeps water out the space below the trapdoor might hold four or five friendly people but it was packed with bedding pillows clothing tarpaulins and a big square box tim had to push to get his pack in refuge damon do i throw stuff out to make room for persons damon laughed its never happened we got used to using it for storage but its supposed to be a hideyhole all right yes throw it to the sharks if they get this far he thumped the box dont throw away the bullets damon showed tim how to manipulate ropes on the wagons roof to open the sides tim took it through the full routine while damon watched whats next cooking what do you do best omelets stirfry vegetables takes eggs damon looked down the road ground cover had grown sparse tim asked would there be nests around here the old woman spoke unexpectedly oooh id think so why was that funny but damon smiled well send out some yutzes in midafternoon the wagons rolled drunkenly across wide fiat stones in a shallow stream when the seventh wagon was across they all stopped tim watched the women release the chugs he couldnt quite see how it was done loose a line from its knob on the rim of the drivers alcove snap it like a whip then retie it it looked easy it looked purposeless senka and rian moved briskly along the arc of knobs when they met at the center several chugs could be seen to be loose and moving toward the beach the younger women stepped daintily down to the road then helped shireen down damon and tim stayed to open the wagons side then dropped to join them damon and the women were all armed even shireen all of ibnrushds chugs were loose now the other wagons spread far apart up and down the road had released theirs weve got time to set some fire pits damon said he pulled shovels from the wagon tim come on down to the beach the labor yutzes know what to do the sea was two hundred meters away most of the women and not many men walked down to the beach taking no notice of two hundred and fifty chugs rolling down behind them in two slow waves the chugs veered wide of the freshwater flow and its delta mouth there were old fire pits to be dug out men dug women supervised chugs flowed around them and into the waves yutzes brought dry vegetation earthlife and destiny trees and weeds tim saw two men dragging a lacefestooned log and jumped to help they set it on tinder in a dugout pit one of the men asked youre tim from ibnrushd im bordn from lyons wagon bordn not boardman whatever the merchants tell you thiss hal from lyons too but hes a chef the women were starting their fires hello bordn hal are all yutzes men bordn laughed hal said all i ever saw a pregnant yutz could be awkward you dont see children either on a caravan still talking the two men had him by the elbows and were walking him up toward the wagons before he could quite catch on with no discussion and no sign of haste every human being in sight was ambling uphill toward the wagons they climbed onto roofs and settled in senka damon and joker were already in place hal and bordn urged tim up and followed damon greeted them senka passed around a pitcher of water flavored with lemons rian ibnrushd wasnt in sight she must be visiting another wagon a forest rolled out of the water black and bronze and yellow a forest of seaweed and motion working within it chugs thrashing fish were dropping out of the weed and chugs left the line to snap them up before they could reach water halfseen chugs were steadily pulling the beached forest apart eating the crabs and fish and shellfish as they were exposed tim watched in fascination as if at a signal the chugs all began moving inland leaving the weed behind then things began coming out of the water they didnt look particularly scary they were heavy and flat the waves didnt topple them they crawled onto land paused a moment then moved after the chugs faster than a walking man there were twenty in sight when the first reached the beached seaweed the family ibnrushd and their visitors took their positions save your bullets damon told tim you too joker tim had only been given six it must be very natural he thought for a new yutz to waste bullets so tim held his pose and his fire a shark was three or four times the size of a chug and flatter built lower to the ground its shell was smaller and more simplified than the ornate points and edges of a chug shell its big head was mostly beak and shell cap and a backwardpointing prong for counterbalance the beak was all points and curved edges built for ripping the eyes faced forward in deep recesses even so these were clearly the chugs relatives chugs carried shields with edges and points that could gash a predator sharks carried weaponry the sharks paused at the seaweed forest they were nosing into the weeds seeking the same prey that served the chugs the chugs were halfway to the wagons moving as fast as tim had seen them move one then several sharks crawled over the weed in pursuit of the receding chugs guns began to fire bullets thudded into the few sharks in the lead poking holes in their shells or spraying seawater and blood from the rough graygreen skin below not many this time damon said that near one in the middle thats your target tim flatfooted leaning forward just a bit hands pulling against each other with the gun butt between tim fired bullets thudded into the beasts shell maybe one or two were his he saw a shark still coming swiveled and used up his bullets on that one four sharks were down and the rest were running for the water they werent fast a man could outrun them but who would tire first man or shark you all stopped shooting tim noticed as soon as they turned tail why not kill them all the yutzes looked to damon who said if we killed off all the sharks who knows what wed get instead we dont know what goes on under the water think of us as priests of evolution senka ibnrushd said another twenty years theyll run at the first sound of a gunshot maybe they wont chase chugs at all here tim damon held out a handful of bullets youve got good selfcontrol take some time tomorrow get some practice for now we dont have much daylight most of the merchants and yutzes began setting up tents those of ibnrushd and lyons wagons set up to cook dinner the evening was turning misty marilyn lyons glowed in the evening light she was two centimeters taller than tim and weighed more too she dressed in brilliant greens and lavenders dramatic against her white skin and black hair she pulled cookware out of the storage compartments of lyons wagon hefting gear with no visible effort while she rattled off directions a little faster than tim could follow teapot cook pot randall hal get these on the fire and fill them with water add the turkeys when the big pot boils you cleaned them good wok wok tim you want both of these and take this she didnt hand it to him she pointed two flattened cylinders half a meter tall both glossy glaring red in a niche beneath lyon wagon tim wrapped his arm around one and caught a familiar scent the speckles always comes back here always tim said right that fire thats yours to work on the yutzes have the eggs and the veggies are in dodgson wagon boardman youre with tim tim any questions why did the founders thaw these flies laughter shook her whole body they must have been crazy anyone want ovens randall took the pots and moved briskly away bordn gathered up cooking tools forks and knives and spoons and spatulas and set them in a flat shell that must have come off the back of a recordsized shark he followed tim towing the shark shell cookware stored aboard ibnrushd and lyons wagons was little different from what tim had practiced with in twerdahl town that was a relief vegetables were what the merchants could buy in towns and carry in wagons meat was what they could kill yutzes and merchants had been out hunting while the wagons were in motion lyons wagons two woks were bigger than he was used to no problem a big wok could cook the same omelet as a small one he was given oil yutzes from other wagons had the vegetables he needed bordn had brought knives spatulas a whirring thing to whip eggs but the eggs were tremendous he asked bordn is this some destiny sea thing bordn grinned ostrich eggs big bird supposed to be from earth lot of em running around here you maybe saw the mom and maybe youll eat her tonight cause we shot three this afternoon damn what do the eggs taste like better cook one first and find out hi rian boardman the merchant girl nodded regally tim he smiled at her evening how goes dinner just another damn intelligence test tim said i never saw ostrich eggs before rian smiled and moved on one ostrich egg was bigger than a tenegg omelet the taste was different and tim used more seasoning after his first attempt speckles of course a little lemon rind yes veggies and eggs never stuck to the woks other chefs were at work around other fires quicksilver winked out below the setting sun as in twerdahl town people passed carrying food gave him slices of fruit and big flat grilled mushrooms and ostrich meat and carried away slicedup veggie omelets ostrich was delicious heavier woks heavier omelets tim was working harder than he was used to he thought of himself as strong bigshouldered but this was wearing him out shireen ibnrushd accepted a wedge of omelet she tasted it tim isnt it yes you have a nice hand with eggs she put something in his hand smiled and wandered off dried cherries he noticed tents being pitched and beds laid within the tents were manylobed and flaps were generally left open some of the merchants were already asleep before sunset as in twerdahl town cooking ended at sunset hed wondered but now cookware had to be carted to the river washed partfilled with water and set back on the fires to boil clean damon led him away to the ibnrushd tent he would not have found it on his own in the dark it was a cross four lobes meeting at a communal circle of cushions shireen snoring in one of the lobes in the center a low table damon and senka wanted to talk but they must have seen he was ready to collapse he rolled himself in blankets in one of the lobes and persuaded himself he was asleep but their voices ran through his dozing mind telling merchant secrets and the memories came back in later years b etween r f fincontoured legs run down each side teeth rim the broad mouth each splitting into a myriad points a l d prong on the skullcap shell forms a beak or more aptly a ram the cap b tt against the main shell for greater strength theyre air breathing they can come right up the beach at you james twerdabi flightcaptain cavorite in the morning bordn reached through an open flap and shook tim awake to make breakfast dawn was a red glare above the mountains tim was stiff and tired he did what the other yutzes were doing blow up the ashes and add wood wipe out the woks and add dough that has been rising through the night cover them set the woks on the coals now a destiny seaweed forest is rising from the waves and its back to the roofs while the chugs feed chugs move up the beach sharks follow as far as the seaweed no shots are fired when the sharks return to the sea the chugs have reached the wagons and the bread is done the bread never sticks to the woks while merchants get the wagons ready and hook up the chugs the chefs and yutzes put away the cookware they pass out bread along a wagon train already in motion he met rian walking back to ibnrushd wagon almond eyes dark oval face intricately shaped hair lovely and strange she studied him then said you look worn out where do we go next the shire little town she turned and was walking with him toward the front of the caravan does the shire have a graveyard id think so just drop me off there tim said here have some bread thank you tim you can sleep once the breads handed out but the tents were already stowed where on the roof he smiled two more wagons four loaves to hand out then sleep just past noon it rained six people crowded the wagons dark steamy interior amid cookware brought for sale and strange stuff collected in trade the chugs plodded on while rain played flurries of drumbeats on the roof the rain left little time for hunting up dinner nobody found any eggs that day come evening tim and the other yutzes wokked vegetables with yesterdays red ostrich meat and served it over barley wrestling the heavy wok was no easier the second night when he tottered off to ibnrushd tent yutzes and merchants were playing musical instruments and having a wonderful time he wondered how they did it he felt his way through the tent by touch and hearing toward shireens snoring then turn left curled on blankets eyes closed he listened to the merchants music it came to him that he was learning more about cookery than about the path of cavorite and then it came to him that he was being watched he opened his eyes rian just rian she asked did you wonder why i didnt come to you last night no she seemed to expect something more so he said i thought you must be with somebody in another wagon she laughed be with he said nothing did merchants say that another way maybe a twerdahl wouldnt know either rian said it could have been you i offered nobody turns me down more than once flash of annoyance gently superciliously he said im a married man he couldnt read her face in the dark he only saw her turn and move into another room of the tent tim let his head fall on his arm and slept moving up and down the wagon train looked easy anyone could do it but the wagons never stopped moving tim was tired all the time the stored vegetables were running out the only fruit left was apples chickens and ostriches were scarce in these parts the caravans yutzes took the lack as opportunity they fished or hunted or went off into the chaparral to search for anything edible it was more fun than the continual repair work on the wagons where earthlife grew likely you could eat some part of it bordn showed him roots to dig up fruits to pick spices sage and mustard apples and pears and oranges potatoes and yams watercress the road ran a klick above the shore more or less never dipping very near sharks couldnt possibly get that high and it wasnt convenient for tending the chugs cavorites crew hadnt learned about chugs when they made the road hadnt planned for caravans either afternoon of the fifth day they reached land that looked halfcultivated and twelve houses clustered halfway between the shore and the road you couldnt call it a town farther they called themselves they were friendly to the point of effusive the merchants supplied food and the farther folk cooked it their style of cuisine was more like twerdahl town than spiral town the merchants supplied the speckles several men and women of the caravan didnt use their tents that night but none of them were yutzes on the sixth morning tim bednacourt was no longer tired late afternoon no ostriches no chickens no eggs bordn had killed four rabbits others had caught fish hal showed tim how to prepare and grill a destiny shieldfish on a grill carried from ibnrushd wagon the fish massed thirty kilograms its canoeshaped shell was probably the dorsal surface the fins on its flanks and underside were shaped to move water but they bent in the middle and at the base little legs with elbow and shoulder joints tipped with twenty centimeters of horn blade with those and its long pointed beak and the shell for a shield the creature might fight one enemy while another wasted its efforts on the shell tim snap out of it lets get this on the grill they cut the fins off at the shoulders but left the shell on they set it on the fire shell down and trimmed off the fins while that side cooked whats the shire like tim asked hal said hundred people tiny but theyll cook for us and well trade our stuff for rice and nuts tim do not try to sleep with any woman of the shire tim just nodded theyre very serious about that tim didnt find that remarkable what if a woman asks wont happen yutzes dont ever get asked its merchants who get the action but not in the shire how far is it hal said well be there in four days barring bandits bandits guns arent always for sharks the way hal was grinning tim wasnt sure how much to believe he asked how far away are the otterfolk we get to haunted bay in another fifteen days from haunted bay there are otterfolk offshore all the way to tail town another six or seven youve seen them otterfolk yeah bordn passed handing out the last ear of corn they ate then turned the fish the grills looked like iron but they were frictionless settlermagic stuff nobody but tim ever worried that food might stick it never did tim expected the level of civilization to drop with distance from spiral town but wherever there was humanity there would always be a few ancient hoarded miracles ask hal about otterfolk hes from tail town bordn said oh hal said theyre easy to like dont touch unless they invite you because they bite they cant help it they like to hear us talk or sing they cant talk themselves once started on a topic hal tended to talk until some outside force stopped him tim listened and wondered jemmy bloocher was very far from his thoughts these days it had grown too dark to cook senka ibnrushd circulated with apples and lingered to watch him eat she said tim the families dont like quarrels in the caravan are you angry with my daughter about something mph no i think rians angry with me i turned her away that night on the beach oh tim that was just ill speak to her senka dont ibnrushd family found me a married man and thats what i told rian she stared were you trying to annoy her she annoyed me does she think im stupid she rubbed up against me to get me at a lower price i see i now tim do you mean youre thinking of not rubbing up against anyone until youre back in twerdahl i asked loria if she could come tim where are you from she knows now wait she cant be sure could she in the flicker of firelight what could she see of his face or hear in his voice over the breaking waves she was his youngest aunts age and wise with the wisdom of merchants and he couldnt guess where hed made his mistake what did twerdahls know that spirals did not that loria wouldnt have warned him about tim hadnt thought so fast since jemmy bloocher killed a labor yutz he made an intuitive leap and rode it all right i hear what they say what do they say senka demanded love a merchant never get over it he was guessing but not wildly it was a thing loria might have concealed and a thing a merchant woman might like hearing senka was nodding but you cant spend the whole circuit wondering about cavorite and otterfolk can you youll wonder what youre missing lorias wondering right now back in twerdahl town she searched his face you asked her to come she must be flattered tim but we wouldnt take her i wasnt thinking would you like a visitor tonight she might not see his nod yes very much her hand caressed his ear and then she walked into the dark haron welsh had come home with no interest in twerdahl women that was lorias fear a man wasnt expected to resist a merchant woman and tim was burning to learn why and yes he was burning in the night a woman came to him he knew a womans rich scent that wasnt lorias that wasnt quite human the dark hid everything but that she talked they talked voices in the dark puffs of her sweet breath on his face it made him selfconscious for a time and then somehow it felt right they moved together and peeled layers of gauzy cloth off each other then he was talking to a woman while they made love it felt kinky delicious jemmy bloocher was a virgin when he left spiral town what he knew of sex was what the older boys told later he learned what the married men were willing to say loria bednacourt had taught tim hann and all the glory and joy of the stories was real but senka knew things he had never heard spoken they were making a lot of noise his hoarse shouts her wild laughter in a moment of quiet he heard a distant chuckle jokers and a querulous mumble shireens in the morning she was gone and he must move breakfast was always the same fires woks and bread dough chugs and sharks quicksilver didnt show at all for these few days it would be behind the sun put the gear away then share out the bread the caravan was in motion before he saw any of the family senka greeted him cheerfully from the steering bench shireen and joker leered rian wouldnt look at him tim bednacourt had kept no secrets last night the morning looked like coming rain he lay on the roof and thought when loria let him go with the caravan she hadnt asked him to be faithful it seemed nobody would expect him to do that nobody outside of spiral town spirals and merchants never mixed they even danced separately in the road outside warkans tavern what was wrong with spiral town hybrid vigor merchants mated with everyone along the road they were trained at love and everyone came to know it except in spiral town on the strength of that alone for a moment senka had guessed what he was it was the eighth day since tim bednacourt had joined the caravan something was different the hunting parties never moved out of sight and what they brought back was skimpy the drivers released their chugs in order first to last so that they could bring the wagons closer together on the eighth night tim fell asleep hoping that senka would come but he slept dreamless and woke alone on a gray and drizzly morning hed halfexpected that shed acted to keep peace in the caravan now that problem was solved and after all the woman had a husband and if damons knowledge of lovemaking matched her own tim bednacourt had better make breakfast on this ninth morning the wagons got an early start chefs handing out bread must walk farther to reach the lead wagon tim had trouble describing what hed noticed but bordn knew what he meant open territory theyre thinking about bandits he said again the hunters stayed close through the day and again the wagons released their chugs first to last to draw the wagons together but the first chugs slowed and waited so that the entire line of chugs entered the water in a wave again on the tenth morning the wagons too close together must hook up their chugs each wagon in turn lead wagons got an early start tim mounted to the driving alcove joker rian and senka crowded the bench shireen must be resting in the cabin tim climbed to the roof it had been cozy all five of them huddling in the cabin with rain drumming outside better than this joker climbed up to join him he opened the hatch and burrowed within the rain had become a steady fall and tim asked him shall we go below no here tim took what he was handed two handfuls of bullets for his silk pouch and then a hat with a brim half a meter across with a great gaudy feather stuck in the band no not a feather an orangeandscarlet destiny weed such as hed never seen before a stalk that split repeatedly into a tremendous plume the guns were crude cast iron but these bullets showed sophistication bullets could not be carefully hoarded ancient treasures after all somewhere on the road someone was making bullets the drizzle suddenly turned into a torrent it was too noisy to talk it wasnt cold but tim would have preferred the cabin the chugs ahead faded into a silver blur chugs plodded out of the blur aft joker waited for the lull then bellowed this is bandit country bandits love to hit us in the rain what do i look for joker stared was tim bednacourt specklesdeficient tim shouted joker suppose i look out into that murk and i see something human is that a merchant or a yutz or a local or a bandit how do i know what do i shoot oh all right look for the hats a hat with no cockade is a bandit shoot it these cockades molt so they dont lasts more than one trip hard to steal there arent any locals cant bandits just pick their own cockades they dont grow here tim if you see a cockade dont shoot weve got patrols ahead and behind fathers in the lead patrol could a bandit strip the hat off a dead merchant joker sighed i guess you just have to give him first shot or follow my lead the rain turned noisy again tim could see the wagon ahead and a hint of the wagon behind and its chugs plodding endlessly out of the rain what do you know about these bandits tim theres nothing to know whatever you learn it wont be true the next time you come by now go guard the other side tim crossed to the right side of the roof joker stayed on the left the rain continued steady rian climbed out of the drivers well and took a position at the aft edge of the roof crosslegged with a gun in her lap in the dark to the side of the road something moving the rain slacked for a moment clearly those were manshapes running tim stood aimed looked again four men wearing broadbrimmed hats no cockades he fired into them as the rain blasted down squeezing the trigger as fast as he could rian was next to him propped on her elbows and firing as his gun ran empty joker held his position on the left one man was running for the edge of the road tim couldnt see the others rian had stopped shooting tim was reloading when something twitched at his collar tim dropped below the rim to finish loading too noisy to hear the roar too rainy to see the flash but someone was shooting back tim could see bodies in the road as the chugs passed them he could count four oh damn one was dressed as a caravan yutz it was randall randall was dead in the road they got us rian said tim said hell no we got them three to one or better rian wriggled across the roof and was talking urgently to her brother ibnrushd wagon was slowing and incredibly the chugs behind were pulling dodgson wagon around to pass and now tim saw that the line of chugs ahead of him was broken fourteen ibnrushd chugs were pulling ahead of the rest joker crossed to tim weve got some time he said the bandits cut our harness they only need to do that to one wagon the caravan cant wait for just us theyll wait for the rest to pull ahead then jump us then well have a fight they got us they got ibnrushd wagon tim asked have you got ten meters of rope for what tie those loose chugs up again i wouldnt need so much if they werent still pulling ahead theres a pretty good chance youll be shot joker shouted but he was already digging into the hatch he came out with a coil of rope double it up tim took it it was heavy it was thick would a double strand of it hold the weight of ibnrushd wagon could he carry it that far hed need both hands no gun hold up tim said his mind seemed to be racing the bandits had come from the inland side but that was then and this was now and the caravan was moving into a new position four bandits to cut the rope at least one more to lay down covering fire three now dead a second group of bandits must be waiting ahead to take advantage if the first group actually stopped a wagon just tell me how many bandits there are joker your best guess anywhere between ah six and fifteen there have to be two groups right i hope youll shoot anything that tries to shoot me tim said yes dont lose your hat tim rolled over the left seaward side that second group could be anywhere between one and ten and it could cover either side of the road tim kept his eyes to the left as he dropped to a squatting position and duckwalked the chugs would shield him from the inland side if he could stay low six chugs were trying to do the work of twenty and making slow progress of it dodgson wagon had come up from behind and its chugs were moving alongside ibnrushd wagon on the seaward side that would shield him too tim glanced around ibnrushds lead chug saw no threat and ran fourteen loose chugs were following armstrong wagon moving no faster than they had pulling a wagons weight he heard a whine left and behind and cut left before his mind caught up left and behind a bullet grazed the road and spun away if that was aimed at tim the gunman must be right and ahead and now tim had the last pair of freed chugs between that gun and himself he held for a moment then shifted now he was between tjtlat pair and the one on the right was protecting him with its shell that one grunted and looked at him harness still linked the fourteen tying his rope to the harness was hard clumsy work until he realized that he could drop the coil of rope then it was easy except that his squatting position was killing his knees and now he must nerve himself to run back across that wet black empty space slip on that slick surface and hed be meat for the taking but his hands were free now he drew his gun peered around the last chug and fired three quick shots at his first glimpse of motion and ran the coil of rope now trailed as far as the six chugs still pulling ibnrushd wagon tim scooped it up and tied it and pulled the knot taut rolled under the harness and out between two chugs past the caravans tail men in featherless hats were stripping randalls corpse one stood up with a gibbering yell and held aloft lyons wagons big glarered can of speckles damn why had randall been carrying that to protect it tim moved back toward the wagon in an agonizing duckwalk he was coming to hate the bandits wouldnt let it go at that would they one lonely rope was holding ibnrushd wagon from disaster cut that and hed reached the wagon seaward side joker was looking over at him tim rolled underneath between the wheels and looked out from a prone position here came the bandit and he too was in a squatting run he had a knife no hat tim shot him and he rolled over then backed away on hands and knees through the rain leaving a knife as long as his arm he collapsed before hed left the road the rear wheels were getting too close tim scrambled ahead of them hands and knees the bandits knife came in range and tim fished it up the rope held until the caravan made camp again they released the chugs a wagon at a time to pull the wagons close when the chugs left ibnrushd wagon for the shore one remained behind tim had never before seen a chug lying down he went to look its head turned at his touch under its cap of shell its eyes were too far apart to see in one direction but the cap tilted and one eye studied tim bednacourt there were eight holes in its shell it was the chug tim had been hiding behind chug armor hadnt evolved to stop bullets joker damon and rian set down what they were carrying equipment to repair the harness tim you did well rian said thanks rian will it die yes it cant feed itself shoot it she shook her head and set to work cutting harness damon said theres no quick death for a chug i saw daddy try once the brain its more a strand than a bulge and bullets dont turn off its heart for a damn hour it saved your life tim and theres no way to pay back but you saved ours rian said tim glowed with the compliment i should do things about dinner he said on the ninth night tim bednacourt stayed up far too late trying to learn the songs the merchants and yutzes sang joker was a singer too between songs they talked about the fight and tim bragged without embarrassment he listened when the others spoke they were talking largely for him enjoying lecturing the novice this clan they try to chop the harness on one wagon bordn told him then the rest of the caravan has to go on but the tail guard stays with them maybe we kill some bandits and maybe we lose a wagon but this clans only been here three years so joker said bandits all start as criminals theyre forced out of wherever they lived did something dreadful people along the road shy from strangers so they wind up with each other if they can steal speckles they can keep going they dont care who they get it from caravan village each other sooner or later they run out then they turn stupid theyll attack anything then they die out and a whole new nest of the bastards has to grow up somewhere else so whatever they have of techniques it gets forgotten and then invented again see tim saw hed had time to think he didnt ask which among them had learned to shoot prone hed watch he didnt ask about cockades and nobody else even referred to them hed never seen the gaudy sprays before today when did merchants wear those hats when bandits were expected sure and maybe when it rained spiral town had never seen cockades but anyone along the road would know of them hed given himself away again hed been trained all of the yutzes had been trained to shoot standing up rian and joker shot prone while the yutzes stood to draw fire the caravans had been at this a long time lost sleep didnt hamper him the next morning his body had caught up with the stresses of a caravan chef and the morning was glorious repair and maintenance mankinds wastes have seeded potassium the length f the crab birds and animals f earth can survive on what gets into the plants but h are the fish surviving my research shows that none f destinys predators have learned to store fat i believe that they have learned to avoid eating earthlife those h djd starved f h and shellfish evolved on earth are potassiumshy b t theyre competing only with other potassiumdeficient earthlife wayne parnelli marine biology by morning light the caravan assessed its wounds two men and a woman of wu wagon had bullet wounds and were being tended in doheny wagon the bandits who attacked wu wagon had also killed a chug and damaged a wheel haft the wheel was ruined ibnrushd wagon had severed ropes and again a hacked wheel while bread was baked and distributed the rest of the wagons hooked up their chugs and began to move two wagons remained behind with the damaged wagons tim was reluctant to ask so are we being abandoned three yutzes chortled bordn said no but tim the caravan cant stay in one place chugs wouldnt get anything to eat so the wagonsll just roll down the road by a caravan length and then everyone will spend the day doing repairs what about bandits weve got tucker wagon theyve got spadoni which are they i cant tell the wagons apart yet oh youd better know that in every wagon theres extra stores joker said like milasevik and wu carry tents and bedding doheny thats the infirmary doheny is where you run if youve got time to run its a better hiding place than the shop sections of the wagons you go there if youre hurt too its in front because anything dangerous hits the front of a caravan first doheny front wagon tim repeated spadoni and tucker store arms dont we all have guns bordn hesitated shark guns and ammunition are in tucker whats in spadoni isnt for yutzes dont be caught wandering around spadoni wagon and of course every wagon is part shop yesterdays bandits had a penchant for attacking wheels merchant men and yutzes came streaming back from the main caravan to help set up repair facilities they did wheels first undamaged wagons wanted their wheels reground presently they were all rolling wheels back down the road by midafternoon wu and ibnrushd were ready to move they rolled just far enough to join the rest of the wagons then repair and maintenance work continued all up and down the caravan a few merchants were not to be seen tim had seen activity around spadoni wagon he might guess that they were somewhere about armed guarding the caravan armed with what it didnt seem like a good day to stroll past spadoni wagon in midafternoon the chefs dug their fire pits and the chugs ambled into the sea nobody had been particularly concerned about hunting dinner was skimpy largely fish and stored vegetables tim became aware that rian was watching him she said i might have known mother would have you if i didnt i should have taken you on the beach you would have come then rian made him edgy hadnt she flatly rejected him without his ever having offered tim said loria would have brained us both why would loria bednacourt hurt you or me hang on tim spent a minute turning two earthlife salmon and thinking then he said carefully you think twerdahis are all alike we arent loria doesnt share she wants her side of the bed all of it if shes in the kitchen nobody else is cooking her man is hers from his heart out to all twentyone digits it was nearly the truth loria would share with her sisters but shes not a merchant again he saw how this would go will you find me tonight i will she said tartly if you dont stay up till dawn singing when she was out of hearing he sighed shed expected him last night what kind of signal had he missed better not to know than to guess wrong a yutz could be in a world of trouble if he rubbed up against a merchant woman who didnt want him loria was far behind him and she would expect this of him and hate it but jemmy bloocher still haunted him anything he did with a merchant woman might speak his secret tim bednacourt is a spiral but then senka ibnrushd must already know and he burned in the morning rian was there her back against his sound asleep he watched her for a time savoring her touch without moving smelling her hair feeling good rian was lean and flexible and smooth she made love with her mothers ferocity and her mothers perception for a mans erogenous zones and how they could be made to react but rian paid more attention to what she was doing the taste of semen surprised her he was ticklish just above both hipbones she was delighted she made momentary mistakesan elbow whacking him just under the eyeand caught herself like an apprentice were merchant women trained somewhere and the men too faint noises told him other yutzes were awake rian woke when he moved scrambling into his clothes he asked her whats spiral town like she looked at him sleepily we wonder he said its so close why dont you go he improvised i think the older people dont want the spirals to know twerdahl town is that close why maybe the spirals would want to tell us how to live rian yawned maybe so anyway ive never been in spiral town they used to let us halfway in they dont anymore but they still buy from us not even gran shireen ever saw columbia she said wistfully damon andjoker werent in the tent tim thought nothing of that while turning bread out of the woks he noticed how many men werent staying around for breakfast there were times when a yutz might ask questions and times when he must listen a fresh yutz must be taught this seemed different this morning the merchants moved in a closed and purposeful pattern and a yutz could not make eye contact tim could see activity far down the road around spadoni the weapons wagon then men were moving uphill and everyone was pretending not to notk e trader secrets it took longer to hitch up the chugs of course butas yesterday the caravan only moved one generous caravan length then all the women and yutzes began a cleaning program wagons were emptied out and every compartment cleaned yutzes polished metalwork until for the first time tim saw wagon trim gleaming clothing was laundered a handful of merchant women hung around tucker wagon they were still taking bandits seriously dinner was skimpy again but nobody seemed to mind everyone ate in a hurry talking around mouthfuls of food tim never twitched anymore at the sight of men and women talking together still something odd here tim assembled a dinner for shireen ibnrushd who smiled down at one and all from her perch in the wagons drivers alcove she thanked him and he said they all seem indecently cheerful isnt it wonderful theres always a time like this once on a circuit all the men gone just the yutz men and the merchant women and no locals oh they were talking in couples many of them the yutzes had cleaned up dinner before the sun dipped into evening clouds with quicksilver just behind in fading dusk there was some singing some storytelling but a good deal of pairing up and disappearing into tents patriss dole of dole wagon sang with tim and taught him words and harmony to one of the ballads her own voice was very good theyd never spoken until tonight they spent some time watching the sky patriss was sure shed found argos a steady star with a blue tinge in the plane of the planets wouldnt the argos mutineers be carving up asteroids by now tim saw a meteor from the west not bluebright enough to match vids hed seen of cavorite rising to orbit but still they went to dole tent too late too dark to be introduced to the other occupants just as well they explored each other by touch in nearperfect darkness made love and talked and loved again hed hoped she would speak of where the merchant men had gone she didnt and he didnt ask krista wu had died of her wounds in the night they buried her upslope with a handful of apple seeds thirty men didnt rejoin the caravan until near sunset the next night they were tired and dirty and laughing among themselves and again there was no eye contact for a yutz they had shot a deer or killed it with something stranger it seemed chewed almost in half grilling venison in the dusk tim could watch the merchants gathering at spadoni wagon the tools they were carrying that tim had never more than glimpsed were gone when they broke into twos and threes to get their dinner shortly after dawn the caravan was rolling through tilted grasslands twenty merchants and yutzes walked past slowly moving wagons though they all carried shark guns nobody seemed to be worried about bandits eight were hunters they carried the long knives twerdahls called weed cutters the rest were fishers most of them carried line and poles but tim and hal had been given longhandled nets when they were clear of the wagons the hunters turned off inland the fishers continued now lifeless meltedlooking bluffs loomed on both sides of the road cavorite must have crossed a ridge here and recrossed and hovered to carve a level path when they reached the end of the cut tim peered over he could see a path of gray rock leading steeply downslope through dense chaparral a waterfall of molten rock long since cooled merchants spoke a murky jargon among themselves even longterm yutzes used familiar words in strange ways joker ibnrushd and eduardo spadoni talked at length in low angry voices both of them waving ahead and shoreward the few phrases tim heard didnt tell him anything when tim got tired of that he dropped back among the yutzes they were talking about catching fish a great weight of words for a task that seemed exceedingly simple tim listened and tried to learn while they marched for most of a morning the road emerged from between the bluffs now it split no the road ran straight ahead miles from the sea but just for a moment tim looked away to rest his eyes at the edge of vision a curve off to the left suggested itself a cut through the low scrub forest away from the road sparse vegetation was what hed seen nothing more but he knew cavorite had curved from its path rising into the sky had flown downslope to explore charring the soil returned and continued the road they were approaching a river and a bridge the wagons were two hours behind them hal was telling dannis stolsh we ran back as far as doheny wagon i had two bites in me the size of walnuts not one of us went past doheny we just swarmed up and in you wouldnt believe how fast it was crowded in there and all men too and bryne doheny trying to bandage the holes we could hear the little monsters batting against the walls tim didnt know enough to get a handle on this and he didnt want to interrupt the merchants were still quarreling eduardo spadoni waved downslope and barked something sharp he strode away fast and joker lagged to give him room in a minute that put him alongside tim tim wanted to see his face he asked joker is it a nickname now jokers anger wasnt showing he wore that bland look secrets he pronounced his name differently from what tim had been saying and spelled it out dzhokhar an old name not meant to be laughed at my uncles name is the same but the family calls him joe dzhokharr tim tried to imitate jokers pronunciation what did hal mean bites the size of walnuts joker stared then barked sudden laughter i remember that some turkey hunters ran into a hive of firebees in the salt dunes ten days down the road from here i could see men running back and climbing all over doheny wagon and wedging their way in then the chugs they all folded into their shells in a wave that ran right down the caravan i just gaped but father he got us inside we all had to hide in the wagons and some of us got bit stopped us for three hours so tim are you glad you joined a caravan oh yes water roared around rocks plunging down toward a sea lost to distance and mist the river was wide here the massive bridge was watersmoothed boulders embedded in smooth homogenous rock poured rock like several structures near the hub of spiral town tim showed his awe and hid his recognition over the bridge they went then downstream spreading out after that nobody got much exercise the men with poles dropped their lines into still pools in the white water they sat on smooth rocks and talked or dozed when anyone shouted tim or hal moved briskly to get the net under whatever was flopping on a line the fish were earthlife three or four species dannis spread a sheet well back from the stream and cleaned the fish on that the mist cleared for an hour in the afternoon tim could see all the way to the sea there was a rectilinear feature along the shore houses many the shire right why didnt they build along the road they dont like us joker said theyd die without us so they keep their manners theyll cook us dinner if we bring the food they dont fish or hunt much so they dont get enough fat theres another thing about the shire joker said you dont rub up against shire women hed already heard that tim said a yutz wouldnt anyway here a merchant doesnt either the shire was spread along five or six klicks of shore four klicks downslope from the road over that distance a dozen men carried forty pounds of fish in a net hammock following a worn dirt path that in no way resembled cooled lava there wasnt any beach waves smashed against rock cliffs and only spray showed above the edge from a central building the houses reached two arms out along the bluff they were squarish with peaked roofs like the houses of twerdahl town differences became clearer as they came near these were smaller some had been shored up they were all the same color weathered wood roofs werent as high walls leaned the hunting party beat them down theyd killed something as big as a small man its head was shot to shreds and puncture wounds showed along its body too they were showing it to admiring shire folk when the fishers arrived boar pig hal told him a score of children swarmed around the carcass and the hunters from the caravan adults hung back except for a dozen elder men those elders came to meet the fishing party the merchants bias against haste might have worked against them fresher fish would have made a better gift the shire elders chose not to notice they exclaimed over the fish as they had the boar gave both to the womens care and took the merchants off to the big central building that tim had already dubbed city hall it was older than the other houses and better built and it had once had windows the shire women were setting up to cook dinner when tim announced himself as a chef they just looked at him then closed a circle with tim outside tim was starting to feel left out the children d dnt want to talk only to look he watched the women at work for a bit ignoring hals grin did they think did hal think would rian think that he was interested in them the shire women enveloped themselves in shapeless robes it was hard to see what they were like one woman seemed bent and twisted and too young for it one or two who might be in their teens and twenties moved like they were in their thirties and forties the way they moved and stood formed groups with merchants and yutzes and shire men outside they closed themselves off from strangers men and women alike and only the shire elders spoke to the elder merchants jokers warning hals warning seemed superfluous the shire had agriculture at any rate there were mushrooms big as a mans hand corn and squashes and potatoes and unidentifiable flowery green stalks it was all set steaming between blankets of destiny ferns over a bed of coals the pig got the same treatment an hour later the fish did too the shire men were settled in conversational circles idle but for their busy hands they ignored the men of the caravan and tim respected their wish but hal stood above one old man for a time then called tim bordn youve got to see this the old man was seated against the tilted wall of a house his skin was dark and seamed his curly hair gone nearly white his legs were thin and knobby there was something distorted about him maybe something about the line of his jaw hed been working on the pale inner surface of an oval of hard gray stuff nearly a meter long using tiny pointed picks now he grinned up showing good white teeth set nearly at random basking in hals admiration thiss geordy bruns hal said the picks left dark scratches or else geordy bruns had rubbed lampblack into them for shading hed carved a seascape clouds and sea and dark bluffs the same bluffs tim could see to the northwest a man in the middle distance his back turned looking up at a tinier human shape on the bluff tim turned the picture in his hands a woman its amazing he said how much youve shown with so few lines geordy bruns nodded happily tim handed it back carefully and asked what is this the shiremans voice was rough his accent twisted scrimshaw thiss a lungsharks backplate tim studied it the polished surface had a pearly iridescence hal said theyre littler but elsewise theyre not so different from a chugs you can go to a caravans campground and pick up a hundred most of the shire men were working scrimshaw carvings scenes differed skills did too geordy bruns showed a finished plate a line of basrelief skulls all destiny life all clearly derived from some common ancestor the middle one was certainly a chug another man had carved a crude view of landing day as two featureless cylinders descended on inverted candle flames a man tims age was instructing a younger one in technique practicing on a chipped shell they stopped uneasily until tim stopped watching them the rest of the caravan arrived near sunset the men of the shire distributed dinner some of them ushered the children into their own circle when geordy bruns stood to take his meal tim saw that his back was twisted these women might know only one way to cook but it worked fish pig potatoes and mushrooms and greens they all tasted wonderful tim became certain that theyd used a different destiny plant to flavor each coal bed he should have watched more closely and finally it came to him to wonderbordn tim where on earth are the chugs well they cant use the bluffs can they we turned them loose a couple of klicks up the road where they can get to a beach its still a good run for them sharks we stayed to shoot a few thats why some of us are late quicksilver was gone and the sun was a last sliver of light on the sea against the dying red sky the silhouettes of human shapes showed their origin clearly tim saw it the common thread in their stance in their walk the shire folk were distorted too many were sick one way and another like jemmy bloochers father crippled twisted hed been seeing it half the afternoon how they set wide privacy bubbles around traders and yutzes both beauty being in the eye of the beholder did they think outsiders were the twisted ones and the traders were being meticulously polite tim watched rian and senka together senkas walk was always an invitation and rians too not tonight senkas walk was clumpy jarring rian tottered alongside imitating her two cripples keeping their balance with each others help with jaws set in anger against what the universe had done to them rian caught him looking and winked the shire elders and the merchants emerged from conference master tucker and damon ibnrushd accepted fish from two shire men then vegetables from another pair arms well extended with their plates keeping their distance the senior yutzes knew the drill too whatever was wrong with the shire folk was it contagious that was in the teaching programs too humankind had evolved alongside tens of thousands of parasites the parasites kept pace easily they died faster so they evolved faster in africa and asia the parasites ruled mankind had come later to australia and the americas and the polar ice caps parasites that preyed on humans were fewer there the destiny expedition had brought no parasites at all but disease and parasites would evolve eventually given enough prey ways to fight infections diseases and plagues were in the teaching programs he couldnt ask a merchant of course tim bednacourt had never seen those teaching programs he could hardly ask the children boys and girls were moving among the yutzes and merchants and tim couldnt shy from them they were friendly and curious unlike their elders but he couldnt quite make sense of their accents so tim bednacourt began to sing he picked a song the yutzes had taught him a ballad of terror and courage grendels in the mist no sex in it no gender references a simple chorus shouted at the top of ones voice it sounded splendid in the dusk other voices joined him one by one yutzes a few merchants now a womans voice now another now a girl the full moon had risen above the mountains quicksilver would have been brighter but the moon cast as much light quicksilver was a point the moon showed a clear disk in its light you could walk around obstacles and make out human shapes but not faces not even body language communication wasnt easy but they could sing now the shire women were singing and the men listened city hall was crowded and blazing daylight outlined the door with the wagons six klicks uphill the entire caravan had stayed for the night the building was one huge room with alcoves at the corners the sleepers all tended to gather at the center tim wriggled his way out of a knot of women and men and made his way out children cheered as he emerged into the morning and he waved back and froze he was in the crater left by cavorite it hadnt showed yesterday evening it showed vividly in daylight city hall had been built on a foundation of melted and recooled lava a concave dish cavorite must have come straight down cavorites crew had examined this site and found it good but why not bring the road right down to the shire he was on their track one day hed know the caravan cruised past the shire the next morning of the shires alleged hundred people nearly forty adults and fifteen children had climbed six klicks uphill to walk alongside the wagons to haggle or just to watch tim moved up and down the line passing out bread hed wondered if doheny wagon would be empty but bryne and lucia doheny were selling toothbrushes dental floss bandage cloth and crudely blown bottles of clear fluid tim recognized these the bottles held flavorless nearly pure alcohol merchants sold them in spiral town as antiseptic kids too young for it watered it with fruit juice and drank at secret parties the shire folk were paying off in scrimshaw one artist left a carved plate at dionne wagon and staggered away with a stack of uncarved shark plates as high as his eyebrows geordy bruns had traded a plate for flour and dried meat and another for dental tools tim saw him dropping back as if tired the trouble with the merchants way was that some good customers hadnt the strength to keep up tim joined him to see what he still had it was the plate with the skulls on it geordy pointed them out proudly platyfish juggernaut chug lungshark sand trap shark otterfolk tim said wait and jogged ahead sixth from the end was ibnrushd wagon damon looked at tim curiously as he clambered through the drivers alcove to the roof tim dug into the roof trap and had what he wanted geordy looked through tim hanns worldly possessions they werent much any valuables of jemmy bloochers had stayed in twerdahl town he said this it was an old wooden toy model of cavorite vague in detail worn by handling in places tim said done and took the plate of skulls haunted bay interesting rectilinear formations on the floor f th bd f water like a buried city nearly crumbled to d t wayne duquesne systems integration in a clearing in a wood of beech and elm there lived two families and a still the homes and wilsons lived on opposite sides of the road the wilsons made cheese from sheep and goat milk the homes made alcohol they didnt bother with glasses they passed around big widemouthed jars of a whiskey as good as any jemmy bloocher had tasted in spiral town it went fine with yellow cheese and roasted mutton when it ran out they switched to rawtasting fruit brandies thatseemed to be in infinite supply tim missed being drunk among drunken companions but too much would set him talking when a bottle passed tim tilted it to his mouth gave it a few seconds then talked nonstop while hanging on to the bottle until someone yelled for it his cousin farank drank like that hogging the bottle younger merchants were pairing off with younger homes and wilsons the elders stayed to play host and hostess joker ibnrushd was finding pleasure in layne wilsons company astrid and carol wilson sisters were holding court among the yutzes the two yutz surgeons from doheny wagon were topping each other with stories of weird injuries theyd treated tim was as usual listening bordn noticed he spoke of autumn rites in twerdahl town he hadnt seen these himself so he asked tim for details and tim obliged good man bordn tactful hed helped tims cause without meaning to tim gave the best description he could of twerdahl towns weedcutting and bathing ceremony but he didnt know enough of the rationale behind it all to sound quite sober tim enjoyed himself greatly as the hours passed being halfsober among drunken friends was a kick younger merchants had gone off with home siblings and cousins but layne wilson and joker were the heart of a raucous oneup punning contest tim made a clumsy pass at layne took a backhand swing from joker fell sprawling rolled and scuttled back on all fours mumbling apologies as he went that was probably enough of that he joined a singing circle among the yutzes it covered sounds that were coming from the huts and tents and bushes and it held until astrid wilson lost interest carol wilson had gone off with someone where was hal tim showed off the scrimshaw plate hed bought in the shire pointing out each skull for astrid with help from several other yutzes and listening contentedly as they described the creatures from life tim might look like he was drinking more than he was but what hed had still set his mind buzzing he looked about him at yutzes and merchants and locals and none of them seemed the least interested in just another yutz chef it could make a man wonder the guilty fly where no man pursues jemmy bloocher had killed a yutz during a murderous quarrel did any merchant even remember did any care so tim bednacourt pretended to be something he was not and it seemed he had the knack but jemmy bloocher had never had the chance most men most women in spiral town and anywhere on the world of destiny would live among a few hundred people all would see them growing up all would know their every secret loria knew who tim bednacourt was he missed loria terribly rian ibnrushd was in a cluster of home cousins looking hemmed in tim wondered if she needed rescue she caught his eye and he went to join them by morning light rian looked hungover and disheveled but her smile was enchanting conspiratorial you look like something pulled out of a pickling vat she told him tim felt fine rian was seeing what she expected last night had been wonderful d fferent he had thought man would end up with one of the locals but theyd wobbled off to the tent together then rian had forgotten that she was a skilled was there a word sexist shed lost a bit of dexterity and shed lost herself in sensation sex was a game nobody lost she helped him into his clothes and he enjoyed being just a little clumsy yutzes and merchants and locals all looked a bit seedy the caravan got a late start they left a variety of goods behind new tubing for the still melons and rice pouches of speckles they went away with fruit brandy and little clear bottles of alcohol antiseptic and big wheels of yellow cheese mason home from dionne wagon stayed anthon wilson joined milasevik wagon as a yutz when next tim saw rian she was asleep on the roof above and below the road were shallow grass slopes dotted with sheep the source of the cheese theyd eaten last night the road had angled inland since before they reached the shire three days ago they were a good two klicks inland now and half a klick above sea level the shore ahead and below curved around in a vast halfcircle tim couldnt judge its actual size rian tim asked what if you got pregnant on the road then i get a baby raised by the caravan her eyes opened tim its a secret by now he knew better than to probe further rian do you think cavorite was avoiding the sea rian mulled the question and presently said maybe why maybe not go get us some tea tim being this far inland gave access to the grassland grazing for sheep and or forage for goats on the hills beyond whatever goats might be last night hed eaten what he was told was goat cheese but this must have been a blackened lifeless slope until cavorite seeded the land with grass and returned to leave halfgrown sheep and goats tim reached back into memory for the map of the crab a composite photograph from eleven hundred klicks high the text called it with sketches of spiral town and the road overlaid those added lines were fiction though drawn by people long dead who never knew where cavorite had gone it was worth remembering that cavorite had flown that the crew had seen patterns a bicyclist or merchant could only guess at what had they seen that they put the road so high level terrain here suitable for the road bluffs at the seas edge or a color in the water that matched a breeding ground for lungsharks or worse the lessons said that you could see seabottom contours through many meters of water if you were high enough looking straight down two hundredodd years ago best to keep that in mind too was the sea higher in that age were there storms to make the shore a death trap something had persuaded cavorite to leave the sea water and tea leaves and a glass jar were kept on the wagon roof during the day it would be warm and fragrant and ready to drink tim filled five big mugs and shared them out then refilled the jar merchants had their secrets and questions about cavorite were not welcome tim kept his silence hed learn about cavorite hed learn why merchants would rub up against anyone along the road except in the shire and spiral town the secrets in spadoni and tucker wagons didnt interest him but hed learn why merchants kept them hidden there were questions he hadnt thought of asking yet and hed learn those too a river ran in scurves broad and shallow across the caravans path tim could see no sign of a bridge tim lay on the roof with his head over the drivers alcove he pointed ahead and asked how do we pass that damon looked up from where he was cleaning their guns the spectre youll see they were all clutching big mugs of sunwarmed tea joker was driving shireen beside him their heads a little below his neither looked up as the old woman prattled lucia doheny she doesnt have a family its just her she did though joker said oh yes doheny wagon was the infirmary before i was born but it used to be at the tail until lucias man and father and boy and girl were killed by i cant recall an animal tim asked bandits bandit town i suppose wasser township damon snapped without turning around a few moments later he said theyre gone now of course thats their graveyard upslope its what reminded me there was nothing to mark a graveyard here and nothing to mark a town ahead or behind unless a certain linearity to the chaos downslope yes wasser said shireen they were buying stuff as we went past not buying much all crowded around doheny there at the tail but we didnt notice anything until they all pulled knives lucia was on the roof that saved her brenda small saw what was happening back there and we came they killed morris and boris and tore their way in and got wendy and and i cant remember the little boy but we got there in time to save lucia damon so lucia reinforced doheny wagon built it like a safe turned it into a refuge oh and its heavier than the rest of the wagons so doheny always has twenty chugs even if they have to come off another wagon shireen a lot of wasser township got away they bothered us for years after damon we burned their village though most of their graves werent marked but we flattened those too both front wheels went over a bump when the rear wheels bumped tim was at the roofs edge to see what happened the road humped just a bit in a little ridge cavorite must have stopped here and then resumed and what was the ship doing in between but doheny wagon was arcing around off the road spadoni wagons chugs were following doheny around one curved arm of the river that seemed far more interesting to tim damon what are they doing damon looked around turning off for haunted bay damon is that whole stretch of coast haunted bay sure baytown is just downslope the bay stretched around in a ragged arc and tim remembered the maps he suddenly realized what he was seeing the arc was a hundred and ten klicks around he remembered that the middle of that arc unseen was the neck beyond that he was looking at the mainland the trail down didnt match the curves of the spectre river but it had its own switchbacks it was unplanned not made by cavorites flame the road ran straight beneath the river and on out of sight as if there had been no river when the road was made tim wondered if they would leave the wagons but the chugs must be fed and they were two klicks uphill from their clientele so the whole caravan came picking their way down there was a bridge dohenys chugs were already plodding past it the river was wide here and the bridge was too with two sturdy feet in midstream this didnt look like cavorites work impressive but crude the nearest houses were not far below the bridge theyd been noticed women and children were coming up to meet them joker and senka and rian descended to keep shop while damon drove the river splayed out into a salt flat cut by bifurcating streams twenty or thirty before they reached the sea near a hundred houses crowded this side of the river on the far northwest shore was nothing but sand beach and a line of posts and an eroded shape like a shallow dish set on the sand tim knew that shape cavorite must have settled on its drive flame the southeast shore was sand inland was a stand of earthlife trees just a bit too green and regular as if tended possibly a graveyard better leave that alone but there were scrub trees growing elsewhere dusty green among the destiny colors tim saw that he could make fire pits and find firewood that was how they would cook no problem if haunted bay didnt cook for them out on the water those tiny shapes were boats twenty thirty more narrow pointed at both ends with white sails above the houses spoke a community of two or three hundred they were squarish well made built wide of the river delta and well back from the sea leaving a beach scores of meters wide tim counted more than thirty boats none were on the water now where were the men tim damon said keep the children occupied will you mmm so their mothers can buy in peace they buy when were leaving now they just want to see what weve got in twerdahl town and elsewhere they might have wanted that too their wish had not been granted there why here but tim only asked what are they expecting a magic act can you do that no i could show off my surfing nope not that either there were no surfers on the water and in fact haunted bay was as flat as a sheet of glass barring the boats and a thousand white riffles show off a bicycle tim bednacourt didnt have one and perhaps shouldnt know about them he shrugged elaborately and damon grimaced get them to lecturing you youre good at that the children exclaimed over tims scrimshaw three or four had seen otterfolk skulls or claimed to and one said hed seen a shark skull he got them talking about themselves a little girl pointed thats where we live see the little house between two big ones tim asked why are they only on this side of the river she stared at him astonished an older boy said we cant build houses on the other side thats where the otterfolk come to trade mother says they like the water near river mouths salty but not real salty tim watched and nodded houses along the river had access to fresh water southeast that stretch of beach would feed the chugs in between was the delta diluted salt water is that where the otterfolk live the girl nodded vigorously an older girl said there and there waving toward thousands of square klicks of water west and northwest joker was suddenly among them dropped from the wagon roof wont have to worry about sharks here he said waters too fresh for em hi carlene hi joker joker set to stowing items that ibnrushd wagon was getting in trade tim asked the little girl you know joker since i was little mom says hes my father whats it like being a yutz so far so good i havent really had time to find out carlene whats that huge dish dish he pointed on the other side oh meetplace the girl laughed so hard that all the other children started laughing too meetplace is where we trade in the dish itself yes kids get to go too sometimes wherere the otterfolk now the oldest boy pointed at the bay watch she said they watched boats running back and forth and riffles of white and there cried the boy and tim saw nothing then a white riffle appeared and tim saw a black dot in its center only for a moment just as the boy said their heads pop up and make a little wave he asked when do you trade is it soon oh no not while the caravans in damn merchants and yutzes local women and children all pitched in to dig out fire pits and fill them with twisted wood from upslope coals were burning nicely and vegetables were cooking when the boats came in it all happened in some haste thirtyodd boats ran aground while the men pulled the sails down then jumped into waistdeep water to pull them up onto the sand that looked like fun and tim plunged in to help there were men on either side and he did what they did grip one of four handholds set at water level lift and pull fish flopped around two peculiar objects in the bottom of each boat a flat wooden fin with a bar for a handle and a bigger heavy fiat thing with no handle you couldnt sail a boat with those things lying in the bottom theyd get in the way hmm the merchants and yutzes only watched as the sailors and tim pulled the boats ashore now the sailors pulled straight up on the masts pulled them out and set them on the sand and set the big wooden fins there too to get at the fish they spread the sails on the sand and began scooping fish onto them the smell of fish was everywhere the women began to clean fish and array them in fire pits the men flocked off not toward the houses but toward the mudflats below two came jogging back to get tim who stood dripping wet two fishers midteens jogged up toward the houses the rest plunged into the several channels of clear water that ran through the delta the boys came back with armfuls of towels fishers were taking off their clothes dipping them and wringing them dry the boys were setting their towels on trays not on the mud tim hadnt seen that as a problem and the fishers were setting their wrungout clothes on those same trays narrow things near a meter wide scores of them sitting everywhere along the flats they didnt look carved and they werent quite flat and tim manfully resisted the urge to turn one over the fishers were staring at him not unfriendly just curious tim looked back they were built like he was and they must have seen the same because they were turning away curiosity satisfied damn hed guessed right he was the first naked man theyd ever seen from a caravan what had the haunted bay women been telling their men the smell of dinner lured them back as they pas ed a boat tim pointed at wooden fins lying on the sand what are those thats the rudder one of the youngest fishers said you steer with that thats the keel it keeps the boat moving straight when the wind is from the side tim had learned not to ask twice he studied the boat instead he could see that there were mountings on the bottom of the boat and hinges at the stern fins to guide the flow of water the locals cooked the yutz chefs served tim found several merchant ladies in a crowd of local men in the silver glare of quicksilver he served out the vegetables he was carrying he took the chance to ask senka have you ever seen otterfolk senka smiled at him not close he went away and thought and came back with a sizable earthlife fish deboned and cut up for serving senka and her grandmother were perched on dunes to eat tim asked shireen you must have seen otterfolk the old lady grinned at him pictures senka laughed suddenly you think theyre a hoax a joke he hadnt he remembered the grendel hunts in spiral town the new kid was always told he would be the bait but tim hann wouldnt know about those he said joker once told me id see otterfolk you did from high up hed seen a momentary black speck in a sudden white riffle on the bay and a shape carved on a sharks shell he came back to serve a corn pudding senka ibnrushd studied him without humor and this time he didnt speak you dont go near otterfolk she said fishers took you to the mudflat because you swam with them dont do that again and dont think it means you can go there alone dont cross the river until the caravan does tim we never have to say these things most yutzes are afraid of otterfolk why arent you tim shrugged that off i know people who are afraid of guns and swimming what tales did children hear about otterfolk that never reached spiral town dangerous topic change it senka doesnt anyone go near the otterfolk well yes here and at tail town but they know the rules cant i shireen spoke not rules you write down rules you learn from when youre a baby if you live along this shore boy it isnt the locals who make the rules its the otterfolk stay clear of the otterfolk tail town cavorite blew up on the neck half the crew got out in time and they moved back up the crab yes its only a story b t cant you see h the whole neck was fused tail town tale tim crawled around the tea table and out of the tent his sleeping hosts didnt stir why had senka assigned him the alcove farthest from the entrance come morning a yutz chef had to crawl past everyone else he hadnt wondered until now but had there been yutzes who robbed merchants dawn flamed off the mirrorsmooth water of the bay the mirror broke in a frothy wave as an army of chugs pushed a jungle of weed onto the beach no sharks appeared only the tucker and spadoni merchants even bothered to draw their guns the chugs finished feeding and straggled into position the wagons began moving away from baytown their sides dropped open to welcome the younger men and women of haunted bay older folk must be staying with the children chefs moved bread yutzes moved merchandise merchants bought and traded the locals werent holding out for bargains today the upward slope was robbing them of breath it didnt slow the chugs it didnt slow tim though once it would have the locals followed the caravan onto the bridge and across the spectre thirteen wagons and hundreds of people but the bridge never quiv ered at the far end they turned back every one the caravan continued along a rising path in the afternoon merchants went out to hunt a dozen yutzes were sent to harvest what was to be found the chefs went with them armed with shovels the way continued gently upward it might have been a cow path widened by wagon wheels but picks and shovels had shaped it in places and here a landslide had been cleared away along the way were fruit trees and fields of grain halfstrangled by destiny weeds without weeding parties destiny life would have won tim was sure they must exist he was glad not be drafted into one the chefs didnt stay with the pickers hal held rank here and it was hals task to make ready for dinner they stopped at a springfed stream they found wood for fires they found traces of old fire pits on the slope dug them out and shaped the detritus into seating arrays beds of coals were glowing orange by late afternoon when the yutz and merchant parties arrived the chugs pulled to a halt and the drivers turned them loose the beach was more than a klick downhill with a twohundredmeter drop the chugs seemed to crawl forever before they reached the sea nobody followed them down to guard them cooking on a slope of rock and dirt was awkward none of the current crop of chefs had done it before save hal mistakes were made dinner was late they served some potatoes raw in the center bordn fell while carrying a haunch of boar the meat rolled until it disappeared into chaparral and bordns ankle swelled to the size of a grapefruit most merchants didnt seem angry or even surprised tim watched dying red light on the bay a school of lungsharks would find a good meal here if they could tolerate diluted salt water for a bit but the chugs flowed out like a long wave breaking and dined undisturbed in the ruins of a seaweed forest and presently crawled uphill to the wagons next day the path rose to rejoin the road they had to stop earlier because the chugs must travel farther otherwisewell dinner went better for last nights practice even with bordn incapacitated the slopes below the caravan were bare of houses and structures of any kind for that whole day and the day following meals were red meat and chancemet vegetables the third day fizzed with suppressed excitement marilyn lyons su pervised dinner and cleanup then pulled tim and hal into the lyons family tent shed never touched either of them before and tim didnt ask why she chose to now she no longer feared that rubbing up against a yutz or two would cost her respect or authority they must be nearing the end of something on the fourth morning it was clear that the land was narrowing the road dropped again it could hardly do otherwise though the wagons were riding the rocky crest of crab island as it sloped down toward tail town on the maps crab island had broad and narrow sides unequally bisected by the crest the peaks here at the northwestern end of the mountain chain had melted like wax the road ran almost level angling down but its width pulsed like a heartbeat wide where peaks had been narrow where there had been a lower crest the range looked like a candle castle it was ugly as sin and cavorites crew must have known it even as they were melting mountains into road where lava had run from melting peaks the roads edges angled up in the narrow places the edges angled down to sheer cliffs it would be easy to fall heights didnt seem to bother chugs lowbuilt as they were tim riding crosslegged on the roof tried to put it out of his mind below and ahead was a community bigger than the town of haunted bay houses sprawled off down the shore but the bulk of the town crossed the ridge to touch both shores its pattern was angular and ordered tim couldnt make out individual features yet yutzes ambled along the road stopped to talk walked on others perched on rocks and let the wagons go past yutzes learned that from merchants let your goal come to you merchants didnt hurry and a yutz worked hard enough but why were there so many a split boulder was moving placidly toward him and hal was on it tim waved but hal was watching the town below hal would be getting off there oh that was it these five or six yutzes must be from tail town they were saying goodbye to friends beyond tail town the land narrowed unmistakably he was seeing the isthmus and the mainland beyond it was hidden in distance and mist but he was seeing the mainland with his own eyes and missing an opportunity too hed view tail town and the neck in detail when the caravan drew near tim got up and crawled to the wagons aft edge and that was his first sight of the narrow coast of the crab peninsula cliffs ran straight to the sea sheer rock in a sixty to seventydegree slope with glossy runnels where lava had flowed from the peaks he was not seeing very much of the hidden coast the crest curved a little and that curve hid everything but hmm forty klicks of beachless coast facing north if it was all like this then small wonder that the colony had set spiral town on the crabs fat side but he was seeing more than any spiral had seen springs flowed out of the mountainside a hundred waterfalls merged on their way down a big blocky structure intercepted the biggest falls at the mountains base the falls joined in a river that flowed northwest into a tiny perfect circle of blue water just inland from the bay hals rock was below hal got up he spoke a few words to the ibnrushd family then drifted back tim waved ahead hal thats your home hal pointed along the shore there they all look alike but my home is tenth along bayshore ride from tuckers lake tim looked the circle right where the last drink runs tuckers lake was just the size of the crater across from baytown a landing crater left by a hovering cavorite the river must have filled it afterward tenth along the widest street well they did all look alike peaked twostory houses but they were bigger and finer than the houses of baytown with wider streets tim chose his words carefully dont other towns along the road seem a little well crude tim they do i thought id been had but theyre all different you know and i knew id get home with tales to tell those are boats arent they do you fish some are the fish different outside haunted bay tims eyes flicked forward just for an instant no merchant was in sight sure cooking styles different too youve noticed and we dont get bandits here at this aft edge of the wagon hed be out of earshot he said or sharks nope not the otterfolk kill them so how about otterfolk no hell you live with otterfolk well not live hal said and caught himself worth a try now change the subject where do we camp who cooks im going home you youll trade off this eye and youll eat with the autumn caravan you go through town and camp on the neck we do the cooking i mean the locals the merchants some of them like the restaurants autumn caravan puzzled tim looked toward tail town again and then beyond the road crossed the neck or became the neck and continued inland following neither shore along the road just beyond the neck he saw a dark line the next caravan tail town didnt huddle like haunted bay the streets were wide enough for thirteen wagons pulled by more than two hundred chugs and customers to walk alongside along the low ridge that the crest had become were structures bigger than any house at the outskirts were big boxes with no windows storage places a lot of trading must go on in tail town nearer the center were public buildings with wide stretches of grass and gardens around them pipes aquaducts must be fed by the last drink river tim had come to expect that the level of civilization would drop with distance from spiral town tail town was nearly a match for spiral town and hal seemed to take it in stride tim didnt notice when hal disappeared the houses ended suddenly and the wagons were slowing inverted boats lay in a line along a beach of fine white sand twentytwo boats of the same type hed seen in baytown with handholds at the waterline and detached wooden fins lying beside them tracks ran out of the water into a shed and the nose of a twentythird boat poked out we lose you here damon said tim jumped and the merchant laughed he sat down crosslegged on the roof well cross the neck and the wagons will be repaired and the chugs will be turned loose youll join the autumn caravan and go back tim a yutz goes around the full cycle youll see some of spiral town before you turn back if thats what you want but you could just go as far as twerdahl town tim pretended to think about that he asked whats spiral town like like they dont want us but they want speckles damon said we used to take our wagons deep into spiral town now they stop us at the first curve but theres a wonderful inn you really should see warkans tavern ill ask loria damon grinned tim asked we dont cross the neck i wanted to do that itd be a rite of passage tim we shoot anyone who crosses the neck unless hes a merchant tim had guessed as much thats one serious rite of passage now hal says the town serves dinner for two caravans do we help cook the locals do a seafood grill youll love it anything else comes from us and we serve two caravans is one serious cookout if tail town wasnt so big they couldnt do it at all what have we got root veggies not much fruit but some the boar meats gone pickings have been skimpy since baytown rabbits use it all now tomorrow therell be a few new yutzes theyll have to learn jemmy bloocher had fled from the summer caravan in twerdahl town hed stopped and married and when the summer caravan caught up hed been tim hann of twerdahl town cooking in firelight and fading sunset winter came and went and the spring caravan brought strangers who picked up tim bednacourt and carried him the length of the road but the road continued an unknown distance into the continent and cavorites trail went with it and the autumn caravan would carry him back should he let rian give him a gorgeous sendoff or senka or would they be busy in tail town tonight or should he wait to meet the women of the autumn caravan his mind could see no threat hed serve these strangers as hed served the spring caravan and live his life out in twerdahl town his adrenal glands were screaming bloody murder senka set him a few errands up and down the caravan while the wagons ran onto the neck for two klicks and a bit the wagons stayed on the broad side the bay side of the midline hump they were a hundred meters apart when damon loosed his chugs to join the others a little early today with the sun still half up the sky the autumn caravan had turned theirs loose too half a thousand chugs all flowed into haunted bay spreading out so that one long wave entered the water had a chug ever investigated the other ocean haunted bay continued around the shore curving into distance and mist otterfolk must be out there all the way around the curve of island and mainland both lines of wagons faced each other across the neck the neck was road softly contoured gray rock crazed with cracks big cracks served for the barbecue fires little cracks could break an ankle a frozen lava pool ran from sea to sea rounded edges dropped into two oceans a ridge ran down the middle the last remnant of mountain range there was no trace of life save for the wagons cavorite drifted back and forth until the whole of the neck glowed red and orange to bar any living thing that might cross from the mainland humanitys rule of the crab was not to be challenged under direction of the chefs yutzes carried the caravans stores of fruit and vegetables to the midpoint tables were arrayed there a permanent feature the chefs laid fires and started root vegetables and pots of beans gaudy merchants watched them from the far caravan where were the chugs theyd been underwater too long a woman walked across to join them she was hefty formidable like marilyn lyons her robes blazed with color cloth that had not yet felt the dust of the road im willow hearst she had a carrying voice randy and i work hearst wagon hearst and jabar wagons carry the cooking gear and the chefs go back to your wagons and get your possessions well sort you out when you come back well still have plenty of light three more merchants had left the autumn caravan would they give further orders but they were swinging wide of the cookfires headed for town jokerjoker where are the chugs joker smiled and pointed toward the fogshrouded mainland see they cant climb back out they can walk underwater against the current theres better forage on the mainland where fisher boats havent stirred things up and then theyre home to stay tim with a hell of a tale to tell presuming chugs could talk the autumn caravan wont take chugs that are marked its beautiful tim told him weve done it this way for two hundred years the autumn caravan picks three hundred or so youll see them straggling in all night they havent learned yet the ones that get here last they wont be taken willow hearst had told them to leave and the yutzes were all going back to the spring caravan could they abandon dinner at this stage hal wasnt here to tell him tim was senior chef but the vegetables were cooking nicely the fruits were arrayed and some were stewing and what remained could wait the party of three was close now they were all older men elders of doheny spadoni and tucker were coming to meet them they would dine in tail town and talk of things even the younger merchants shouldnt hear tim looked again and recognized master granger he let his placid yutzs face turn gently aside while his eyes followed the old man yes that was his fathers sometime friend master sean granger tims adrenal glands had known all along his mind was only just catching up not three caravans two in summer it was twenty wagons in autumn and spring some were left for repair the people of the summer caravan whom hed eluded once had come back as the autumn caravan tim mingled with the other yutzes villagers were passing the spring caravan pulling a string of little mandrawn wagons tim sniffed great masses of sea life the merchants swung wide tim edged close to inspect the fish pulling other chefs with him good haul he told one of the men we say good catch the tail towner said and the elder merchants were past and the yutzes were among the wagons tim climbed into ibnrushd wagon and onto the roof opened the trapdoor pushed his head into the dark and set the tea bowl under him before he let the terror have him he felt like he might throw up sean granger was no threat the old man would remember jemmy bloocher as a little boy and tim bednacourt as a twerdahi town chef but younger merchants had seen jemmy bloocher kill a man in warkans tavern hed kept his possessions in his carry pack in a moment he could snatch it and run where anyone caught crossing the neck would be shot the far side of the crab would kill any swimmer tail town sprawled from haunted bay to the other sea there was no path back that didnt run through tail town he couldnt join the autumn caravan he couldnt run not until dark there was nowhere to hide did he dare to serve them dinner yes with dark falling but be ready to run at a moments fright run where fingertips stroked his arm wrist to elbow tim straightened to kneeling position he didnt look around and he didnt flinch he reached back and let his fingers trace a slender neck and jaw and nape smooth he leaned back rian good senka was just too good at reading minds he asked do i get a spendid sendoff hey didnt marilyn lyons use you up i damn well needed all the help i could get he admitted she laughed tim there are women in the autumn caravan too i havent met them witnesses women who would look straight at a murderer and know him half a year later can i give you a splendid sendoff a breathy laugh you might not impress a lady if i get to you first given the choice he turned their breath mingled its a choice ill risk it then he wasnt just randy and it wasnt because hed never see rian ibnrushd again never see any woman until he could reach twerdahl town and loria but he would have done it just to forget the risks hed face tonight it was a splendid sendoff she gave him theyd never made love in the open or in daylight perhaps they were even seen from other roofs even now he didnt see rian naked they kept most of their clothes on as his breath slowed it came to him that this was the lesser risk the darker the better when he joined the other caravan and if he had a decent excuse for delay well an indecent excuse was better than none an unworthy thought tim rian whispered time he nodded and kissed her and reached into the trap for his pack dont take the gun she said guns go with the wagons youll get a new one what about these clothes she laughed theyre yours he pulled the gun from his tunic pocket and dropped it into the hatch he pulled out his travel pack opened it and spilled it across the flat roof bctter see if ive got everything no second gun see the bandits long knife his trophy from the attack was wrapped in spare clothing the carved shell was too he unwrapped iti bought this with something of mine no speckles either see he wrapped the shell again and shoved it into the travel pack donned the pack and dropped over the edge of the wagon run now or serve dinner rian dropped beside him flushed and lovely she took his hand and off they went across the neck with the other stragglers shed made his choice what the hell he was ravenous all at sea if these creatures are anything like sapient they must be left alone w ll granger is most emphatic on th point cordelia gerot xenobiology willow and randall hearst met them as they arrived she was even more large and magnificent close up her husband was shorter slender and dapper rian was amused and hiding it they showed him to hearst wagon third from the front tim and randall climbed to the roof randall ceremoniously passed him a glarered shaker of speckles then a gun and some bullets sharks dont get this far into the bay he said still nobody likes surprises stow your pack if you need a rest stop its over the hump id better what remained of the crest was shallow but taller than hed thought tim paused at the top he was seven meters up and the neck and the bay and the far ocean rolled away to infinity the bay was flecked with white the wagon trains the fires burning in cracks in the lava the tables in the middle were all on the bay side of the hump the far side was narrower and dark how long had caravans been using this place as a toilet and a garbage dump too even since cavorite passed ever since there were caravans surely the smell wasnt intense but it was inescapable and ancient along the road there was always concealment to make a rest area here nothing but distance no problem really if people stayed apart what could anyone see but it seemed strange that nobody had put up a building or a wall no hiding place we shoot anyone who crosses the neck as he rejoined the cookforce randall hearst joined him randall wanted to know about bandits about his impressions of the shire the health of the various communities and recent news of twerdahl town tim answered as best he could while he served out toast spread with red fish eggs then roasted potatoes if randall wanted to know what had changed since hed last seen the road then his questions might tell tim something the fish eggs would go well in an omelet he decided he hadnt seen bird eggs in many days chaff covered the bay to left and right as far as he could see it hadnt been there when last he looked tim remembered the chugs twice the usual number of chugs had pulled up a forest of seaweed on the mainland side of the neck it had floated back now which way did the current flow on the narrow side of the neck riffles broke on the bay raised by a brisk wind or by dark heads rising the heads stayed dark dots on the water watching merchants were eating apart from the yutzes trading news of the road no doubt and keeping merchant secrets hearst miller ibnrushd and lyons families discussed cooking and the chefs merchants from the weapons wagons fell silent when a chef approached tim ate as he served as any chef must sliced orange a potato bordn was hobbling around with a stick he and tim ripped apart a big earthlife crab and shared it these yutzes had all come with the spring caravan they knew tim bednacourt and none had been at warkans tavern in the fading light all he had to do was avoid notice locals must have brought this barrel of fresh water tim drank deeply hed need it he carved huge fillets of tuna and gave head and bones to a yutz to dump over the hump he sliced up one fillet and ate a slice and carried the rest of it among the benches a merchant gaudy in gray and yellow caught his eye tim knew him instantly hed snatched at jemmy bloocher as he ran from warkans tavern and had his belt for an instant before jemmy tore loose tim bednacourts reflexes kicked in ahead of his mind tuna he said offering the platter and the sweet potatoes are ready did you get any of the fencecutter crab looking at other folk of milliken wagon the weapons wagon making it a general offer we got some the merchant helped himself to a tuna fillet if theres more wed love it is anybody making tea its getting chilly ill start some tim was sweating as he walked into the growing dark a merchant would starve if he couldnt catch a chefs eye tim couldnt avoid notice there was no help for it but to be a chef he set a big pot of water on for tea the speckles can was as big as a fivemonthold baby there was no color like it on destiny barring murals in the spiral town civic hall it couldnt be opened the caravan considered it unstealable and tim felt they were right he shook speckles over a pot of beans in a spare moment he oversprinkled a bowl of beans and ate it fast wincing at what the excess did to the flavor merchants used a lot more speckles than spiral town did or anyone else theyd found along the road that bowlful would keep him healthy for a while the fishers had brought in a clamshell the size of a grown man armed with siphon tentacles each the size of tims arm that had curved teeth in the ends sub clam tim sliced it into strips ate one and carried the rest among the benches he set the empty platter aside and walked over the hump quicksilver had set a quarterhour before the sun mere traces of red still lit the west and the hump blocked that yutzes dumped their loads at the midden tim walked a distance away from them before he did his private business then he kept strolling toward the autumn caravan the sea was black and empty he couldnt guess which way the current flowed tim had dropped his pack over the back side of hearst wagon instead of stowing it here it was tim donned it crawled under the wagon and with nobody about walked toward the water if anyone saw him hed be fifty meters away and running hard nobody saw he slid down the smooth lava slope and entered the bay without much of a splash the water was warm after the first instant warmer than the wind on his ears taking his time he put his shoes in his pack then began to swim if he stayed right up against the road nobody could see him without walking right up to the edge but how would he explain himself then he chose to swim well out into the bay before he turned southeast it seemed to take forever to swim past the barbecue had he been missed fires were the only light and they were almost gone tents were up if he was seen hed be taken for a wind riffle or an otterfolk the rim of the neck was unclimbable tim would have to swim all the way to the tail town beaches and so would anyone who came in after him tim hadnt seen anyone swim merchant or yutz since hed left twerdahl town hed have felt quite safe but for the otterfolk otterfolk were a mystery hed been led to believe that they were fanatical about their privacy now a creature had invaded their home drowning him would not be much trouble at all but their heads had kept popping up to watch the caravan it wasnt as if he had a choice he swam a current was helping him along there was still no sign of pursuit when he crawled onto a pebbly beach in a line of boats he was shuddering with cold hed planned it out this part he crawled among the boats and began to examine one as he hadnt been allowed to do in baytown in the shadows of boats under a starless sky he was quite blind he explored with his hands the flat piece with the handle the tiller would fit here in notches at the tail end of the boat the other flat piece would fit here in the middle of the underside it slid in from the pointed end if he put them on now and tried to get out into the water theyd break off against the sand the tiller he could slide it in after he was afloat the other that would have to be inserted from underwater he saw that taking a boat would leave a gap in the line the boat in the shed no it was probably in there for repairs so a heave uprighted the last boat in line no gap he set the tiller and the centerpiece in the bottom it was a heavy sonofabitch four handles on the bottom meant four men could lift it could one man drag it he could if he was desperate the boat moved in surges he dragged it down the sand until it floated then pushed it out hard and swam after it clambering in was harder than hed expected but he made it hed thought of swimming around tail town and then ashore hed still have to do that if he couldnt control the boat the boat would be easier travel now he felt very conspicuous one lone stolen boat on this great flat expanse get the sail up and get going but he needed the tiller to aim the boat so mount the tiller in the dark using the mountings hed felt out so carefully in the dark the sail was bound against that horizontal beam he hadnt spent enough time feeling the lines out and it cost him this line would raise it after he untied these then tie it down where he got it up the boat had turned under him to face the wind the sail hung slack he felt conspicuous as hell he moved the tiller it wasnt steering anything he lowered himself off the stern and kicked until the bow came around reached up and swung the tiller hard over the sail billowed as sails did at baytown and he heaved himself into the boat as it flew back toward shore he turned the boat into the wind kept the tiller turned when the boat wanted to just stop and drift and now he was flying back toward loria and twerdahl town yes but how on earth did fishers do this okay it took four men one on the tiller while three raised the sails most of tail town was quite dark torches still burned in the larger buildings tim searched the water for otterfolk but there were none in sight did they sleep as dawn showed above the crest boats were putting out from the beach beyond tail town tim had sailed past tail town in the night he watched them having little better to do sails came up five six boats took to the water raised sail then foreshortened turning toward his position it looked choreographed merchants armed with guns might be aboard but tim didnt believe that fishers would be dangerous enough he was a thief if they caught him the least he could expect was to be turned over to the caravan the autumn caravan would know him by daylight jemmy bloocher a row of dark heads appeared ahead their eyes glittered black facing forward at water level as they neared he saw that their heads were as big as his own capped with a shell that dropped to form the upper part of a beak like a chugs head their beaks were cablecutter traps more like a lungsharks mouth than a chugs but they were clearly related to both species he watched for a bit they did nothing he waved nothing im he hesitated then shouted imjemmy bloocher thats one small step for a man they were waiting for something he v as about to sail past he couldnt see it but he felt how the boat slid sideways across the water losing forward momentum those fishers would catch him unless he could get the centerboard down he was tired of banging his shins on it he swung the boat into the wind and saw the sail go slack the otterfolk flicked into motion and were with him again he picked up the centerboard and slid it into the water hanging on to it until he felt hands take it from him then it was a matter of waiting he watched more boats take sea room and turn toward him the floor of the boat thumped and bumped the boat began to turn by itself the otterfolk knew how this worked tim twisted the tiller to help them put the wind in the sails the boat took off but sluggishly he looked down to see what hed expected four otterfolk their short thick forearms wrapped around the handholds at water level damn he could reach down and touch them he didnt but he leaned far over to look his arm far back to hold the tiller in place hed halfexpected to see smiles their beaked faces were immobile yet it was clear they were having fun they were smaller than he was but hed known grown men as big as the otterfolk sixty kilograms he judged and very alike except for their shells left and aft was the one he was studying its legs were short ending in big splayed fins its arms were short too they pulled its body hard against the handhold its body hugged the hull it twisted to look up at him it seemed wonderfully agile where the shell didnt bind it its shell was smooth streamlinedand painted painted in unreadable hieroglyphs in brilliant scarlet and orange and green the other riders were painted too tim couldnt read the patterns though they looked more like simplified pictures than an alphabet but hed seen those colors before where forward left that one had been injured tim could see a healed split along his shell under paint that turned the crack into a coat of arms the accident had bent the shell and bent the otterfolks body too tim believed he had known they were sapient the instant he looked into their eyes but the paints told a more emphatic tale they were artists a creature barred from using fire could never make such paints wait now that was the red of a speckles can settler magic the walls of civic hall in spiral town had murals in those colors and others too the otterfolk would have used more colors if theyd had them somewhere was a source of red and orange and green acrylic paint and the otterfolk had access twenty or more sails were chasing him now tim wasnt really concerned those other boats must be carrying otterfolk too to slow them the handles on a boat werent placed for fishers convenience after all the day passed like a dream this was sensory deprivation lying in the bottom of a boat holding the tiller in one position sometimes finding the will to lift his head look over the side check his position once he looked just as the leftforward rider reached out snatched a platyfish from the water bit off two big bites and dropped it to be caught by the rider behind him then one of the riders flipped a big earthlife bass over into the boat around midday the rearmost pair dropped off the boat picked up a little speed and then he had another pair of riders later the front pair dropped away and were replaced he was hungry he was thirsty hed eaten and drunk as much as he could hold last night and it wasnt enough when quicksilver blinked out his arms were racked by cramps he tried steering with his feet and found he could make it work that left his agonized hands free to fillet the bass into sashimi the fleet came ever closer the sun sank the sky darkened in an hour he couldnt tell the land from the sea he could tell where the wind was once staring into the dark he perceived the land far too close he steered hard about and sensed that the wind was blowing straight at the land he could keep himself aimed if destiny didnt change the rules on him sailing an unfamiliar boat was dangerous enough in daylight sailing at night was suicide would he even know if the shore was about to smite him if hed seen a way tim would have surrendered but the fishers would smash their boats and his if they caught him in the dark and in the morning would they have him surrounded quicksilver peeked above the mountains a brilliant point against a sky already showing yellowwhite sails had come very near but they hadnt surrounded him yet with quicksilvers added light tim angled closer to the beach closer yet as the sun itself glared between peaks tim didnt intend to be caught hed beach the boat and run when they came close enough the waves were tiny twenty centimeters high breaking only ten meters from shore he was sailing only a few meters beyond that point and that was very near the beach he could see an endless reach of sand without a shack or wall or footprint anywhere nothing but sand and weed and painted shells otterfolk shells a score in view to left and right now that he thought to look tim edged the boat closer yet that wasnt an otterfolk graveyard was it sharks had bones chugs had bones but there werent any otterfolk bones on that beach just shells painted in acrylic colors all set on the beach beyond the tide line like headstones maybe until one shifted suddenly and again the boat rocked damn he was too close his centerboard was grinding against sand he turned hard and back a bit as the sail tried to go slack the centerboard wasnt grinding anymore because his four riders had dropped off and the boat was riding higher he angled for open sea before he thought of the other boats they were all turning he had some sea room now and he looked back for the particular shell that had moved it covered a hollow shapes too small to see crawled out from under the edge otterfolk were riding waves to shore he saw them clearly for the first time four limber shapes with short finned limbs and long bodies he halfrecognized the markings those had been the riders on his boat he worked it out later thus fishers were too skilled and a fisher boat was too predictable boring a thief in a boat he didnt know how to use making mistakes and learning as he went made for an exciting ride four riders piling on a thiefs boat would slow it fisher boats chasing it being less interesting would carry fewer riders of course the thief would be caught otterfolk might choose to ride two at a time to give a thief a longer run but tim always believed that the destiny natives had minds but no language negotiation had to be basic threatened the thief sent a basic message tim had threatened to beach his boat on the birthground the otterfolk must respond perhaps they fouled the fishers centerboards or tillers or clung to the handholds in hordes until the boats couldnt move at the time tim couldnt guess why the fishers had abandoned their chase but sailing near shore now seemed a very dangerous thing otterfolk shed their shells that was clear they made nests in sand and left the shell to shade the emerging young that was a likely guess otterfolk would kill any creature found on that shore that seemed very likely he stayed well out to sea until he was nearly to baytown the sky was red with aftersunset and quicksilver burned right at the water baytown fisher boats were at sea ahead of him as he came nearer they all turned toward him tim aimed his boat inland toward where a dishshaped crater lay on the beach the wind was blowing out to sea he couldnt aim directly toward shore but he could approach in a switchback pattern when the centerboard grounded and heeled over he went overboard the lightened boat bobbed up and righted he swam for shore with boats converging behind him he crawled out winded and ran for the crater on rubbery legs he paused once and stooped to lift the rim of a painted shell that would almost cover his chest his vision grayed and he went to his knees but the cavity under the shell was empty the otterfolk children gone he heaved himself up and kept running chest heaving and halffell over the rim of the fused sand dish arcs of wooden bench lined the inland half of the dish the wood was ancient and weathered soft sand lined the bottom on the sea side and the slanted rim had been painted with hieroglyphs in yellow orange green scarlet indigo the shell he was holding was very like those hed found scattered over the mudflats that held towels and soggy clothes for the baytown fishers would he have found paint if hed turned one over it was too big for his pack he shoved it up between his shirt and rain tunic against his chest he was burning priceless seconds fishers had gone overboard they were in the water trying to save his stolen boat by attaching lines they meant to tow it a few shouted at him the words blurred the tone unfriendly the fivecolor cartoons along the rim of meetplace were old but still vivid if he studied them hed see what those simplified figures represented but baytown women were wading the mudflat in his direction and tim thought it best to leave the speckles can th k f us as priests f evolution caravan proverb he climbed as far as the caravan trail before he looked back they wouldnt follow him in the dark it was already too dark to tell thirst was near killing him well he was new at this he followed the caravan trail to the spectre river he watched from cover while the last of the light died before he crept to the water and drank his fill then he kept climbing he woke sheltered in bushes just below the road on the wrong side of the spectre river he woke joyful he was free anyone could outrun a caravan he watched baytown wake he watched the boats put to sea any tiny fleck of white on the water might be otterfolk it was all a wonder but the thing he wanted most was to go down did he do wrong to run he was frantic to question them all those discarded otterfolk shells fishers must be in constant contact with otterfolk why did the merchants let baytowners inspect their wares the day before they bought they didnt do that anywhere else along the road except in tail town itself did the otterfolk tell the locals what they needed how all his traveling had only bought him more questions he saw no way across the spectre the bridge lay too close to baytown baytown knew that he had stolen a boat they knew he had landed on the forbidden beach the shadow of the mountains was withdrawing from baytown and sunlight would soon touch the mountains where he hid the flat road itself hid nothing and grew nothing if he tried to hunt what lived in the brush baytown fishers would see brush moving on the mountain he didnt dare even reach up into a fool cage but the slopes above the road bloomed with earthlife crops that hadnt been harvested since cavorite passed he crept among them like a snake and gorged on fruits and berries he collected beans several kinds of nuts and a few root vegetables the beans he set soaking in a bottle he cooked after dark in a rock fire pit tall enough to hide the light then he climbed in the dark until he reached bare rock in the morning the spectre had become a thousand springs crossing was easy now there were none to spy on him at all nobody lived on this long stretch between baytown and the distillery tim stayed high at the interface between earthlife growth and bare rock fruits and grains grew here and the occasional fool cage with something trapped inside rotten bird meat would still make bait for catfish he didnt hunt someone might hear gunfire he walked wide around the occasional wild pig once he speared an unwary rabbit with his weed cutter he was never able to do that again hed traveled this way before he watched the road for signs of pursuit merchants must know about bicycles and tim couldnt outrun those hed be wary for a while but nobody followed in ten days he was halfway home hed been seeing birds as big as men he hadnt seen one fly but they ran like the wind ostriches the land was flat up to an abrupt frost line where bare rock suddenly rose nearly straight for five or six hundred meters he was halfway between the neck and spiral town he judged high on the spine of the crab a klicks stretch of chaparral of tiny earthlife oranges and berry bushes and destiny thorns barred him from the road far ahead he could see a vertical white thread of waterfall the long stretch of lonely coast was ending the homes and wilsons were friends of the caravans and so was every community beyond how would they treat a yutz found wandering loose tim would have crept past the distillery and dairy but it seemed to him that he was becoming clumsy nothing serious hed left the otterfolk shell behind three mornings in a row the shell was proof of some terrible truth that he hadnt yet fully understood it served as a platter too it kept food out of the dirt he needed it this morning hed lost time doubling back to get the shell again and hed found his fire pit sitting like a signature he threw the rocks into the bushes as usual but this was getting scary he didnt want to end like jael harness there was no sure way to recognize speckles deficiency he could keep track of the days eleven now and so what he could move more carefully look around himself more often avoid some mistakes that way more likely hed just forget the question and gradually all the patterns in his mind would go too he was a couple of caravandays downroad from the distillery for now hed keep to the heights hed reach the falls tonight and go down in the morninghide the gun firstapproach the distillery by the road unless they found him first every child knew that planets glowed by reflected sunlight quicksilver was brilliant before it passed behind the sun these last few days with its shadowed side turned toward destiny quicksilver had been nearly invisible but now it was crossing the sun half an hour before sunset tim could just glance at the westering sun and glimpse a black dot on the solar disk before he snatched his gaze away children did that adults yelled at them for it a child who tried such a thing with earths hotter brighter sun would blind himself tim could blind himself if he blinked the sun too near noon if he let the sun get too far down the sky the dot would blur out but hed caught it so he sat on a boulder and waited for his vision to come back and wondered why he was wasting time loria waited ahead a caravan was crawling up his tail the falls hed seen was still ahead and tim bednacourt sat on a rock waiting for dark because he needed rocks to build his fire pit and water to cook he hadnt seen loose rocks earlier in the day here was a convenient spring near a convenient landslide a raw cleft in the rock spilling stones just small enough to lift easily this boulder would do for a backstop and when he brushed the coals away it would stay warm for hours hed sleep with his back against it hed stopped to gather berries and blink at the sun hed washed himself thoroughly and his clothes too to make himself presentable dawdling here rather than hoping to find more rocks ahead his vision was coming back tim looked down and saw char marks he slid off the boulder and into the brush to think it through marks of a fire of course he hadnt looked for char marks on the rocks he used he made his fires in the dark vulcanism and landslides made these stonefalls but hed found stones conveniently clustered these past ten days spaced a scant daywalk apart for a man carrying a pack and stopping to hunt and gather and cook hed been pulling his fire pits apart after use and so had someone else it seemed someone who built much bigger fire pits not just a wanderer several men together now what dont hunt hed gathered fruit and some barley did he dare cook the barley nobody had seen his fires had they hed been more than careful the mountain was bare above where he built his fires no human lived there someone close might have whiffed smoke but nobody had seen it rising in the dark he built his stone circles tall nobody could have seen fire within tim hanns fire pits not unless he were floating in the sky at dusk he built his stone circle and his tiny fire there was the risk that he had been seen that he was being followed or tracked best he remain predictable until he could see another way he lay not against the firewarmed boulder but in the bush where he could watch it a tiny moon silvered the crest and left all else black the bandits hed fought had been up the road by many days past the little distillery and past the shire too so the scorched rock hed found might mark a wanderer or two he told himself but not one of that band of bandits but any wanderer must attack caravans for their speckles tim bednacourt carried no speckles could he buy a bandit off with what or evade them the only way to evade bandits was to know where bandits were here were two faces of one problem how could jemmy bloocher avoid being found hed taught himself to do that how could tim bednacourt find bandits who didnt want to be found theyd be living as he lived but more of them taking refuge at the frost line changing identities tim waited for sleep with his eyes on six hundred meters of split rock above him he tried to picture bandits not bandits attacking a caravan three times a year but living between caravan passings settled in little groups gathering and hunting stealing speckles from locals or fighting each other for a dwindling supply his mind must have gone on working while he slept he woke in darkness he felt quite lucid he donned his pack he moved to the stream and drank until his belly was taut as a drum then he began to climb the crest mountains were glossysmooth wherever fusion flame had touched rock but the cooling rock had split here a vertical split ran nearly to the peaks the spring flowed from the split hed been looking up at the rock face for so long that it was branded in his memory good thing too he couldnt see but he could follow the split by touch no telling how high he was when he began to be afraid climbing in the dark was crazy the notion had come to him in his sleep fully formed he was climbing in the dark because he would be conspicuous in daylight against gray rock with no plant growing anywhere the little moon continued west a trace of light touched the mountain face now the cleft narrowed but tim was able to pick out handholds and footholds then those ran out all his muscles were shaking with fatigue theyd throw him off the cliff if he kept this up down a bit and over a rock face was trying to split off leaving a ledge not as wide as hed hoped he lay with his back pushed hard against the rock and was asleep before the trembling stopped dawnlight and terror hed forgotten where he was the slope stretched a vast way down he was exposed and conspicuous on a rock cliff hunted by men with guns far away the shadow of the crest mountains crept steadily from the sea onto shore in early summer hed been on shore looking up at where he was now what had he seen backlit by a rising sun that hadnt cleared the peaks this whole face of the mountains would be black he would be invisible nobody would look this high anyway tim bednacourt began to climb again cracking had put ledges over his head to block him but cracking gave him handholds and footholds he rested on the trunk of an incredible scruboak tree that had sunk roots into the last of the main split when the sun lit the southwestern face of the range he was on the narrow side of the crab peninsula nothing grew at the crest and little grew lower down flame had scoured this side of the range too nobody had since bothered to weed out destiny life this was the steeper side a straight drop to angry waves and not many plants had the tenacity to cling to the rock but some did tim could make out destiny colors black and bronze and yellowgreen but earthlife greens too he couldnt see a way down there was nothing to eat up here he found a flat spot to sleep out the noon hours he made several klicks that day picking a way along the crest his eyes on the alien beauty of the wild shore at evening he didnt bother with fire he chewed a handful of barley and waited for full dark then he slipped between two peaks and looked down a bright orange light glared below him just at the road left and above a mere orange spark glowed too he blocked the fires with his hand and let his eyes adjust from worlds end to worlds end the road was a grayblack line through black rubble the shore was more vivid there was white phosphorescence in the waves a faint yellow smudge far to his right fires along a beach the autumn caravan must be past tail town by now if the caravan had sent out a yutzhunter tim would have seen his fire too and closer it wasnt there the caravans hadnt sent hunters that bright fire must be huge to be so steady the distillery it would be just below him their dinner fire as for the orange spark he must be looking down into somebodys fire pit hed found what he sought two cookfires burned on the mountain this night the homes and wilsons gathered at their dinner and a handful of wanderers above dangerously close to the first the homes and wilsons would have to be warned and surely theyd feed a wanderer some speckles he slept on the mountain cold but quite safe in a cleft between two peaks dawn gifted him with an amazing view shadow covered the crabs broad side but here were details never seen by a caravan below the road was a wide stretch of meadow destiny black was not having much luck against earthlife green half a hundred head of sheep grazed four big buildings near the road must be the wilson dairy barn and dwellings the caravan had partied on home turf that big cookout area in a horseshoe of one large and several small buildings around the home establishment was more meadow but it was the yellow of wheat high on the mountain were those goats of wanderers and bandits there was no sign he was hungry but he delayed going down hed fought hard for this view and it was very pleasant he could follow the line of road a long way before the curve of the crest hid it far to the left the shire he couldnt be sure to the right nothing nothing the line of a caravan far far away at the western edge of the home meadow was a single monumental tree in a regular array of white dots tim heard a gunshot faint and distant crisp and clear the sound jerked his head straight toward brush that was mostly destiny black three manshapes were charging downhill behind a gigantic bird tim started down the rocks at the edge of hearing were voices quarreling in shouts and gasps he kept his mind on not falling to his death and only spared the occasional stolen glance for men dealing with a wounded bird the ostrich was stumbling now slowing the men would have caught it if it werent running through clumps of vengeance thorn it turned suddenly one man froze one tripped and as the bird came at them screaming the third man steadied himself tim heard another gunshot the bird fell over and thrashed tim couldnt hurry and he couldnt hide he kept moving the men pulled the bird downhill a good distance to the nearest tree there they hung it and tore the feathers off and butchered it as far as tim could tell not one ever glanced his way he climbed down as far as the plants grew and rested guns belonged to caravans a gun not in the hands of a caravan meant bandits it seemed to tim that the surest way of avoiding bandits was to know where they were here was a most convenient trio of bandits all tim had to do was follow them burdened by the butchered ostrich restricted by lesser brush the bandits werent making any great speed he could hear them he could almost make out the words two bulletsget more months till we weed cutter next time they were circling four or five acres of greenbronzeblackthorn one of them wanted to chop it out tomorrow the others thought that a joke too much work get the next caravan to do it vengeance thorn was nasty stuff the fractally dividing thorns could punch through shirt or pants then leave invisibly small needles embedded in flesh tim had marked this patch from above it reached right to the road he could follow these bandits as far as the road but what then watch where they went of course but hed be seen if he followed but following bandits wasnt the point was it knowing where they were that was the point going the other way around the patch would bring him to the brook that fed the distillery tim wanted a drink if he met someone named wilson or home he could tell a tale of bandits and maybe get something to eat he drank his fill and filled his bottle and washed a little the stream ran past a stretch of green grass and a huge ancient earthlife tree and stones in lines and rocks not firepit rocks but the home and wilson graveyard many communities along the road used headstones instead of holograms the graveyard intrigued him and he waited there hoping to see a familiar face somehow names and dates had been written into the stones the oldest dates were sixty years back the lifegivers werent all named wilson or home wanderers marrying locals would take local names but a bachelor from a caravan would keep his own and a married couple would keep theirs nobody had come sating his thirst let his hunger shine brighter he could smell cooking now he followed the smell downslope he was following the sour smell of the distillery too here tim had passed this building had glanced inside months ago the big doors were open now and tim stepped inside to see the huge tanks and arrays of pipes the distillery was deserted maybe it didnt need much tending a woman came out of a smaller building next doom and turned away her long soft brown hair flying she hadnt seen him in the shadowed building layne wilson even at this distance the first familiar face hed seen tim was about to announce himself when he saw the red flash in her hand there was a window not glass but a wood plank propped open near the ceiling he had to climb on a cask to see out a dozen people were at work around the fire pit three men were setting up an ostrich to roast while chatting with layne tim knew the men he knew the butchered ostrich and the brilliant red can layne wilson was shaking over a pot first he hid there was space behind the distillerys huge pressure vessels he crouched with gun in hand if anyone discovered him think now was there a legitimate reason why three homes and or wilsons might camp high above a dairy or distillery was there any way an honest distiller or dairyman could put his hands on a merchants gun or on a speckles can the possibility that tim bednacourt was behaving like an idiot grew stronger with every hour shy of speckles what he couldnt figure out might only mean that his cranial nerves werent firing what would he look like if they found him now living where no human lived a spy hidden in shadow with a bullet for anyone who saw him might these dairy keepers and distillers take him for a bandit and execute him out of hand it crossed his mind now that goats might require tending and wilsons would need to gather their milk that a gun dropped by dead merchants or dead bandits might be held for the next caravan by honest men or might migrate up and down the road as barter would it be better to simply ask for help but foriy randall yutz chef with lyons wagon had been carrying the lyons speckles can when he was shot dead tim had seen a bandit whoop and raise it high and run with it now layne wilson was using a big flattened acrylicred shaker in her cooking roasting ostrich kept getting into his brain and scrambling his thoughts likely his brain wasnt at its best anyway but the more he thought about it the less crazy it seemed caravans passed three times a year who were the bandits when there were no caravans to rob did they rob locals but tim had heard no horror tales seen no elaborately barred doors was there some kind of treaty what if a caravan came late or charged too r uch for speckles or brought too little what could locals do about that twerdahls would give or trade whatever a merchant wanted as theyd traded tim bednacourt he eased out from behind the still and caught a scant cupful of what was dripping from the spigot and moved back into place he sipped and thought bandits couldnt run around with that great red can that was the point of it where could they keep it safe layne wilson returned with the speckles shaker she entered the smaller building and left without the shaker waiting for dark would make sense but it had grown noisy out there dinner was well in progress theyd never notice anything if they saw him theyd he was still dressed as a merchant he took the time to turn his tunic inside out and turned the collar down now his color was graybrown and the big pockets were hidden from a distance it might serve he should have done that days ago now they might take him for one of their own now all in one smooth glide hepulled himself back barely in time as a man and a woman wobbled into the distillery poured a halfliter of whiskey from the collector pail into a jug and went out with their arms around each other now out from behind the still get his balance adjust the shell and backpack walk out through the open door and straight across to the other building and in it smelled of metal a smithy that didnt take genius he was looking at an anvil dark as it was he wouldnt have missed the speckles can it must be in a cupboard or something something easy layne had been quick then again caravans did come three times every two destiny years there had to be a hiding place something hard to find and hard to get into damn he didnt have forever hed be lucky to get out of here alive let alone wait now that anvil was on tracks and behind it below floor height something bright red the weight of an anvil would guard that cavity it was hard to open and hard to close but they were between caravans so layne just hadnt bothered tim picked up the speckles shaker he ignored four guns that must have come from caravans but he took three speckles pouches full of bullets he wrapped it all in his tunic and walked out he hadnt thought beyond this it came to him that his patterned green shirt wasnt any less conspicuous he was running now into the graveyard known turf could he get up into the tree noise behind him hadnt changed they werent after him yet but terror was in him and he kept running past the vengeance thorn walking wide around thorns he couldnt see in the dark an ostrich leapt to its feet and ran squawking away damn if anyone was already looking theyd come straight here chop a hole in the thorn patch with his weed cutter a hiding place while his mind toyed with the notion his body was still running uphill flat out despite starvation and speckles deficiency and whiskey and terror his mind was catching up and his body was right he had to go up up because he had to build a fire to cook he didnt need to build a fire pit the three goatherds hadnt torn theirs apart an ostrich had distracted them theyd even abandoned a can of milk he set some barley cooking and used the speckles can liberally before he drained the milk earth he was hungry was it sour or was that just how goat milk tasted dead of night nobody seemed to be coming after him then again he couldnt carry the speckles can there was no clear way to open it hed never tried pounding it on a rock he tried it now he couldnt even dent it he couldnt steal the speckles inside without stealing the whole can even though the damn thing was nearly empty to be seen with it was to be guilty guilty guilty and how could he not be seen he couldnt wait any longer he ate the barley halfcooked then he lay on his back and waited for his intelligence to come back it would take days of course sometimes it never returned but the answer he needed was looking down at him how could anyone not be seen with the lyons speckles shaker by being where there were no eyes the shire obedience be damned were not on a h anymore suzanna barnes astrophysics argos he was where the springs began to join into waterfalls not far below the frost line and several klicks above the shire just below was a fool cage knocked down and torn apart and feathers around it on a hillside covered with tiny earthlife oranges and berry bushes and black destiny weeds a klicklong stretch of such stuff barred him from the road no problem he could follow the falls and rapids down and then the switchbacks of the caravan trail two klicks farther houses spread out along the shore tims first impulse was to creep past the shire the shire had nothing he needed the caravan didnt seem to be chasing him no telling when pursuers from the distillery would catch on though at least he didnt have to wrestle that damn speckles can it wasnt that you couldnt get speckles out there were holes in the top for the tiny seeds you couldnt get them out fast and it wasnt that slow because the chef holding the can had to feed seventy people on the other side of the crest tim had spent most of an hour shaking speckles into his spread shirt then finally hed thought of firing a bullet into the can thatworked now he had four times what hed need to get as far as twerdahl town he had left lyons wagons empty speckles can in plain sight for anyone who could get to the blind side of the crab hed watched bandits fanning out from the distillery eight of them split into pairs to cover the road and the heights in both directions none at the shoreline what did the distillers think had happened to their shaker they seemed to suspect a lone thief but if lyons wagons shaker marked the thief then tim bednacourt didnt have the shaker and he still didnt want to be caught alone on the road or off it hed been traveling at the frost line seekers from the distillery were ahead of him traveling by road and above he didnt want to catch up with them the question wasnt how to get around but how to approach the shire he picked out another fool cage knocked down and torn apart amid scattered feathers now that he was looking for them he could follow a broken chain of them down along the falls some big carnivore had learned to find food this way time to move tim was not trying to hide now he followed the broken fool cages down he rather hoped the shirefolk would approach him he was on a slope fighting through waistdeep brush while he circled a stand of fisher trees being strangled in julia sets when he heard brush crackling a moment later he saw a disturbance in the brush he dropped below the branches among the trunks of the low bushes while he wriggled the gun free of his tunic pocket a huge dark shadow came at him out of the fisher trees in a thunder of broken branchlets head held low tiny mad eyes tim squatting on his haunches fired until the gun was empty it fell thrashing before it had quite reached him four men conspicuously armed with spears and fish clubs came to meet him tim had time to hang the heavy carcass from the tip of a sizable fisher tree it was a boar pig and hed cleaned it yours dinner he said loudly and smiled they didnt smile back and they were still advancing tim shrugged out of his pack no sudden moves now hands in sight the shell fell too and ill bet youve never seen this before one hand held high he lifted the otterfolk shell and turned it to show the paint that got a reaction a chorused ooo feed me tim said and ill tell you all about this otterfolk said one yeah i seen those colors tim said geordy bruns the old man studied him youre one of those yutzes from the spring caravan i traded you a shell i still have it geordy set down his spear and came forward tim gave him room and he searched through tims pack he found the carved shell and inspected it for damage he searched further and said you run from the merchants you take any speckles no you cant steal the cans i ate some before i went pouches they lock em up wheres the gun theyd heard the shots he said hidden all right come two of the others took the carcass geordy led off the fourth man trailed behind tim spear in hand geordy suddenly whipped around and said in the morning youre gone all right we cant give you speckles we need what we got all right shirefolk still formed circles elders younger men older children women with children women without smaller circles within the larger groups circles of opportunity womenwithout were chefs womenwith drifted from their circle to help or give orders elders were an arc around tim bednacourt and the circle of men was a loose arc around those men left it to fetch or carry under direction of the women chefs they seated tim bednacourt on a dune and expected him to stay there several of the womenwithout took their turns bringing him food dinner was pork and a variety of vegetables tim tasted speckles in the rice pilaf he talked about the road but not about bandits he described tail town and the neck they were watching him they hadnt done that when he was with a caravan the elders and the young men and the children would meet his eye the women would not but they lingered near when no task called listening he told of dropping into the bay and swimming back to tail town that made even the women stare for just a moment he wasnt being treated as a caravan yutz the women were watching him askew not a gaze just a mutual awareness as with women and men in spiral town did the merchants see spiral town this way genders and cliques forming defense perimeters against the stranger i think the boats are for giving rides to otterfolk he said then the otterfolk pay off in fish and he told of shells along a beach and newborns crawling into the world while otterfolk warriors swam ashore to defend them in the dark of quicksilver there was only firelight womenwithchildren had gone to their beds older children were gone too and womenwithout drifted off to the river to clean cookware and the few remaining elders were all men tim taught them a song hed learned on the road then the men escorted him off to the big building in the crater it was one big room seventy merchants and yutzes had all slept on the floor in a tangled pile when the caravan was here now he had it all to himself he stretched out in the middle of it all with his pack for a pillow until the men bade him goodnight and were gone then he left his pack and moved himself into a remembered corner he lay down again with two walls to guard him and his weed cutter under his hand hed slept some during the day for the first in many nights he wasnt cold the painted otterfolk shell no longer scratched his back it had served his need the question was whether to run now the shire seemed uncommonly friendly to a man alone from the midpoint of the crab peninsula to the corner of haunted bay there were no dwellings single men or women couples whole families running from failure or crime or politics or boredom must have filtered down the road in the wake of cavorite the distillery dairy was as far as theyd got except for two sizable communities on haunted bay but that was one serious leapfrog why wasnt he finding a house or three every step of the way because only strong communities could treat with bandits as equals bandits didnt seem to bother the shire and the shire was friendly to a man on the run though they watched him like a possible thief had they been similarly friendly to messengers from the distillery when he heard the rustling bandits was his first thought he stood up in a crouch they were in here with him the gigglestwo threedidnt sound dangerous but he hadnt heard the door or seen moonlight there must be another door hidden a womans voice spoke with just a trace of impatience runner another voice hes gone bitterly disappointed no why would he a nearly incoherent wail oh who knows what lives in a strangers brain he knows the merchant women we dontdress like they do tim had been tiptoeing toward the center toward his pack hed gambled his life when he brought a butchered boar to the shire and the bet still stood he asked whats it all about a third voice much calmer didnt speak directly to him we can hope hed like some company tim said sit down with me i have a thousand questions shall we make a light laughter and protest oh no the rustling came close circled him it was seriously dark he guessed at anywhere from four to a dozen he slid his weed cutter under his pack and sat on that he said i know not to touch you but im wondering how this all started people along the road dont all do as you do silence ragged breath then the merchants tell us we cant rub up against a stranger ever since the first caravan came and rashell star turned down wayne the speckles man rashell the star and she slapped him bobbitted a hundred years ago more so we keep ourselves to ourselves men and women both and we teach our children too we know what happens if the merchants dont bring speckles the woman who had spoken was quite breathless and a silence followed tim said look they told me you dont mix with strangers four hands reached out of the dark tim jumped at the first touch then he patted the hands and asked its the merchants idea laughter someone took his hand and guided it under clothing and that was a womans breast big what on earth they were swathed in layers of clothing it came off in great soft piles that made a fine extensive bed they stripped him insistently and explored him first with their hands whispering to each other he never knew if he would touch clothing or skin and now it was mostly skin once he got the idea tim began searching shapes in the dark his wandering hands found delightand perfection no twisted spine or twisted foot here a nose like the prow of a ship here an ear that pro truded interestingly he knew them both womenwithoutchildren who had served his food without meeting his eyes regular features no strangeness no flaws wasnt that what they were looking for too no point in making babies with a flawed or twisted visitor he counted six and they still wouldnt talk to him though they whispered to each other tomorrow he wouldnt know them tonight the shapes and scents of the women were his whole environment tonight they were taking his genes maybe he dreamed it a hand shook his shoulder and a voice whispered merchant man why did the founders wake the flies without opening his eyes he asked am i supposed to know youre supposed to know everything hed thought that about caravaners hed thought about flies too meat has to rot he said and was asleep again he woke alone and stiff everywhere he dressed in customary haste as if he must bake and serve breakfast then he took the time to search out a second entrance it was set in a corner a miniature maze baffled against light from outside he hesitated before going out the first caravan shed said there never would have been a first caravan without customers already in place so the first caravan found this isolated community halfway along the crab rashell the star wayne the speckles man likely two or three or six merchants had tried to make babies with the wrong people in spiral town men and women married before they got pregnant and it might have been that way in the shire then merchants hadnt yet earned their current reputation the shires need for external genes didnt show yet somebody got slapped or bobbitted whatever that was then what today the shire was not dying but tim had seen some effects of inbreeding here the merchants and yutzes werent getting laid what did anyone gain by continuing this nonsense he stepped outside knowing that there would be nobody to ask the men were gone the women wouldnt meet his eye any more than they ever had and they wouldnt let him help with breakfast they fed him fruit and speckles bread then watched him walk off along the beach along the beach until it curved out of sight then up into earthlife trees a tiny version of the graveyard grove in spiral town he stuffed his pack with citrus fruit and kept moving he retrieved his gun and specklesfilled bullet bag he hadnt stopped moving for an instant anyone who tried to follow him would be blowing hard if someone was waiting above him well now he had the gun speckles was in his system he expected to feel more alert and he did just his imagination too much of that could make him careless make him miss something so think it through four days up the road that was where the spring caravan had been attacked two days at the rate he was traveling it now seemed that bandits turf ran all the way from there to the distillery two pairs of thieftakers ran ahead of him traveling by the road and by the frost line he might have tried a boat or gambled that they couldnt swim instead he climbed he climbed until hed reached the crest bandits might know the blind side of the crab but hed seen no sign of them hed travel that way until he was past farther t w e r d a h t o w n columbiad is losing temperature ionization and humidity controls well have to hld public meetings elsewhere we feel betrayed when a subsystem fails us anything worth bringing across interstellar space was meant to last forever ansel milliken landholder he traveled at the frost line at dusk he dipped into the snarl of plants below for fruits and any vegetables he could eat raw a fool cage gave him a pigeon the second night he risked a fire and a gunshot for some spiny destiny beast that thought he looked edible two days two nights and at noon hed reached the naked v of frozen lava above twerdahl town two lines of houses ran for several klicks between the mudflat and the road with acres of cultivated land between twerdahl town hadnt looked this big the first time hed seen it coming straight from spiral town falls ran down the v converged in streams then ran across the flats into green and black swamp tim hadnt noticed the first time hed seen this place how gradually the swamp formed a wide band of dark wet topsoil bloomed sparsely in a flood of sunlight black touched with bronze and yellowgreen rice rice would grow well here hed tell them to plant rice if he could find seed rice or buy it from the caravans pulling up destiny weeds would be no trouble they didnt like this much light he found a memorable place to hide a gun and bullets he secreted his three speckles pouches in the hidden pockets a merchant favored for the rest of the day he watched surfers rode the waves people worked the gardens and fished a man rode a bike along the road three people came out of the swamp carrying a snake fires burned along the salt flats no sign of messengers from the distillery twerdahl town might not be involved in that but wait for sunset after sunset tim discovered that he wasnt willing to go down quicksilver gave no light it was merely the brightest star climbing down slick lava in the dark could get a man killed but wading through a snakeinfested swamp insane hed go down in the morning hed been hiding too long it was becoming a reflex at dawn he started down there was brush to cling to along the edge of the lava shield he could see boards out on the water he hadnt surfed in a long time by the time he got down sunlight penetrated even into the swamp he waded in black destiny vines were growing all over everything high time for another weed cutting of course that only meant that the autumn caravan was coming soon meanwhile he must crawl through black vines and black water slashing at snakes with his own weed cutter at the road he washed as best he could then he climbed out and dripped the bicycle was coming back tim watched it come had it gone as far as farther he didnt recognize the man on the bike but he would when the man got closer the biker saw him tim called hello i the bike wheeled hard right and disappeared among the houses tim strolled after it along a dirt path between houses no chance of catching a man on a bike he was yelling suddenly tim knew the voice one of the grant boys the oldest a skinny nineteenyearold two rows of houses and cultivated land between tim turned downroad he knew his own house there at the end and he started to trot loria came out tim called loria she froze behind her came a man a big man carrying a baby behind them tarzana bednacourt pregnant and then gerrel farrow the man touched lorias arm and spoke the four moved briskly between houses and were gone tim gaped now what go into the house to wait whatever was going on it would be over presently meanwhile tim could clean himself up and get fresh clothes he hadnt given much thought to what he must look like but he had to know this all felt very wrong he walked between rows of orange and grapefruit trees between houses and onto the mudflat he was facing half of twerdahl town most of them were carrying farming or fishing implements and that wasnt strange but they carried them like weapons he thought again what must he look like he dropped his plumeless hat and combed his hair back with his hands it might help im tim bednacourt he shouted men and women moved to put tim bednacourt at the center of an arc loria and the man with the baby were standing way too close together mutual protection in frieze the man was ander cloochi son of the towns master farmer tim was moving from exasperation toward panic berda farrow you taught me to cook tarzana dont you know me loria we know you susie cloochi said tim what happened to you long story but ilook he dropped his pack and was about to open it when everyone took one step forward its a shell he babbled scrimshaw ander motioned him to go ahead tim untied the pack onehanded and dumped it he didnt need to conceal anything in the pack he fished out the shell and pointed out the pictures chug shark this is done on a lungshark shell thats an otterfolk i had an otterfolk shell too but i gave it away what happened to me everything you can imagine susie and then some ive sailed a boat i can cook in styles you never imagined ive seen the blind side of the crab you dont seem to be specklesshy susie cloochi said and suddenly he knew what he looked like he was wearing a trader yutzs glarebright clothing though it hung in rags and dirt hed traveled on the far side of the ridge for a long hungry time he was gaunt worst of all he was here with the caravan twenty days away a wanderer not following a caravan was a bandit and a thief but they couldnt know about the stolen speckles can in a way that made it worse a specklesshy bandit might do anything the corner of his eye caught motion way uproad around the toolhouse he couldnt spare the attention test my mind he said test my memory i gave you the bicycle tedned grant was riding ander gerrel you helped me build that oven i taught you bread i remember getting married loria ander cloochi is there something youd like to tell me were married now im still new among you tim said so i have to ask loria burst out laughing it didnt seem she could stop ander said no loria cant have two husbands but you both you all knew id be back but not now damn it tim wedloria would have had time to decide is this what happened to haron welsh lorias laughter had trailed off she wouldnt meet his eyes now but she nodded went off with a caravan came back found out he wasnt married and you thought hed tell me nod ander put the baby in her arms and stepped in front of her so youre here what happened to you tim at the neck they trade yutzes the autumn caravan was every trader who ever he was so tired and so miserable tim felt he was about to faint he didnt dare ever watched me shoot a man i had to run i took enough speckles to get me here at the corner of his eye motion three or four older people at the door to the toolhouse he recognized julya franken by her long white stilllovely hair and remembered when he had last seen her shed been handing out blades on the day of the weed cutting the four went into the toolhouse youre not specklesshy susie cloochi decided you took enough speckles tim stooped and picked up his open pack and ran straight at tedned grant from who tedned tedned was a skinny boy man who flinched from big waves or wrestling or quarrels or confrontations still he was no runt with all eyes on him he tried to get his fists up tim knocked him aside and dodged between houses he emerged between high rows of corn with nobody in sight paths ran between the garden plots he pelted uproad counting tedned was behind him not catching up tedned had run his bike between houses rather than meet tim in the road there ahead those houses when tim had next seen him the bike was gone tedned must have dropped his bike and kept running yelling into every house he passed and here were the houses and one was the younger grants house and the bike was leaning against a wall tim was too late to board the bicycle as tedned came running up it wasnt as if tim had choices he couldnt make for the water not yet he left the bike and ran at tedned tedned got his arms up and tim punched between his elbows a quick one to the solar plexus the heel of his hand to the nose now the bike they had let grit get into the gears it started slow he pedaled past tedned who was curled up and trying to find his breath twerdahl towns defenders were pouring between the houses now and others would be running along the mud but tim was ahead and moving considerably faster than a running man he could see the toolhouse the last building uproad well short of the toolhouse he turned again between the houses out onto the mud off the bicycle before it got mired because tim bednacourt was no thief downroad a horde was running toward him though they seemed out of breath uproad only four and they all looked as old as julya franken but they bristled with weed cutters he might have escaped them he thought if hed turned toward the road but then what hed stopped alongside the surfboards lined up along the wall of the elder bednacourts house tim snatched up the biggest and held it over his head as he ran for the water they tried to follow him of course a few were better surfers than he was and they were hot on his tail but he wasnt surfing now once beyond the waves he need only paddle paddle for his life slipping over the water on and on the ache in his shoulders grew until it swallowed everything else while the current carried him southeast ultimately his pursuers were too far from twerdahl town for their comfort too close to spiral town and they turned back one by one carder s boat black for photosynthesis sagan and schklovskii were right gerot xenobiology he thought he was going to die he thought he didnt care there was nothing to drink there was nothing chasing him anymore there was nothing to do but paddle a thousand times lie turned his eyes toward shore a wave would carry him in he could live between twerdahl town and spiral town live like a hunted animal until his mind turned animal too when he could make his arms move he paddled when he rested the shore still drifted past him by infinitesimal degrees his shoulders were one long moan of pain the sun burned into his neck and his arms and the backs of his calves he lay in salt water the board floated two centimeters below the surface if he let his head rest on the wood he could drown the offbalance weight of his pack drove him crazy but never quite crazy enough to drop it overboard when he remembered this part of his life he never knew how long anything took he was drifting in a stupor with his chin propped on his arms on the second night or the third he was flying cavorite in his mind the long slow drift from the landing site down to the neck and beyond day and night shifts stop to rest or to shed the heat from riding a fusion flame or to look at anything interesting side jaunt to haunted bay because cameras in the sky found seabed geometries suggesting an undersea city trying to see why they ran the road so high twerdahl town filled the whole space between the road and the beach cavorite had flown close to shore when it made the road there as it moved down the coast the road ran higher near the neck it ran as high as it could get right along the crest as if twerdahl and his crew had become afraid of the sea he toyed with an odd notion when had cavorite learned of the otterfolk teaching programs named thousands of extinct species of life on earth all species die or change over millions of years a meteoroid impact had rendered all the dinosaurs extinct barring those that sired the birds but many species died because man was good at changing his environment there was a shadow among shadows ahead of him had cavorite laid the road to protect the otterfolk he remembered though that the hub in spiral town was far far inland cavorite was hovering over burntout alien wilderness when it drew the lines of spiral town the twerdahls must have run their loops of road to within a klick of shore stayed near the water for forty klicks farther then eased upslope toward the peaks again avoiding the sea the landers had charred the land and boiled the lakes but a flame couldnt reach below the sea future generations would follow the road spiraling outward until they gradually approached whatever came out of the sea theyd have time to prepare cavorites crew feared the alien ahead of him then passing on the left he moaned and tried to work his arms he could make them move but he couldnt paddle he slid far back half off the board and kicked against the current toward shore gripping with dead arms and kicking with all his remaining strength his breath a stuttering moan a raft of destiny devilhair with an angular shadow in the middle was trying to creep past him he gained a centimeter at a time then the current was pushing his board not past the vastness of black weed but into it and he could rest hours later the cramping in his arms faded he found he could grip the board with his knees and pull handfuls of weed toward him sliding the board across the weed until floating devilhair lifted his board above the water now he could let his head rest on waxed wood for the first time in two days by morning light it looked tremendous it loomed far above him shaped like two slender fisher boats with a deck across iheir tops carders boat sure enough sunlights touch turned the heat in his neck and arms and calves into a flame he pulled himself and the board across the black weed into the shadow of the boat that pain eased but what was hurting his hands destiny devilhair had covered his palms with myriads of black needles barely big enough to see as specks carders boat loomed vast he could not imagine such a thing stowed in a starships cargo hold settler magic was compact never bigger than it had to be he used his shirt to shield his hands he dragged his board across the devilhair around the stern and into sunlight children had used this as a raft before the weed grew too thick they must have left a ladder somewhere but the weed hid everything on this sunlit seaward side the weed had grown right up the side a black shroud marked with yellowgreen and a boat halfvisible beneath he climbed the weed with bare hands and feet it didnt quite reach the rim it kept ripping loose somehow he got a hand on the rim and pulled himself over the impact of his fall was so strange but what mattered was the cabin and the steps down the weird surface gave back no impact he crawled like a ghost down into the cabin into shadow in shadow the burning went away and he could think about his thirst there was a sink water ran he twisted his head under the spigot and drank he remembered to be afraid of it old water in an old container but it tasted like spring water like life itself he drank until the weight of his belly pulled him to the weird floor he didnt want to die on a table he found what must have been lunch for six or eight then a garden of earthlife yeasts and bacteria then this dead powdery residue there was nothing to eat aboard carders boat carders boat was not of this world the floor and walls of the cabin ate his footfalls and gave back no sound and no recoil carders boat was nearly massless an airy foam under a taut skin they hadnt stowed carders boat aboard an interstellar spacecraft theyd stowed a tank of something that foamed up and hardened and maybe a boatshaped membrane to foam it into and a few compact settlermagic machines like this sink that seemed able to make drinking water and the lighted interior walls the hulls silvergray surface was begley cloth sheeting from mount apollo pressed into place after the boat was inflated his hunger had subsided to a dull ache his fingers and toes were black with tiny needles he could barely move them for the pain climbing the weed had cost him there was a bath water still ran when the salt was off him some of the itching went away he left his clothes soaking and moved naked about the cabin a small patch on a counter almost burned him it glowed dull red with heat he found a dial to turn it off a teapot and a frying pan were both chained to the wall above the counter there were hooks for more cookware but the cookware was gone he found boxes and chests of spiral town workmanship here and on deck one held a big stack of towels that shredded in his hands one held fishing gear sturdier lines and sturdier poles than the caravan used he looked over the side and saw only black devilhair how could he fish through that and one chest held clothing floppy kneelength swimsuits and elbowlength windbreakers in a strange old style tinted in shiny pastels these had held up very well jemmy tried to pull one apart hoping hed fail and the seams held if there were seams he couldnt find them carders boat was a small frog on a wide lily pad events came isolated afterward he was never able to order them properly he was still wandering naked about the boat when he found the fishing gear hed kept his weed cutter he put that together with a jointed fishing pole four meters long and some translucent line and had a fourmeter weed cutter he began to chop devilhair it hurt his healing hands flying mites lived in the weed and the blade set black clouds rising something leaped he stabbed and had a destiny amtrak eel on the point a moment later it wriggled free when the gap in the weed wasnt very big then the gap was bigger before anything leapt again and he jabbed and flungheavyand a little lungshark flopped on dry weed he worked the blade under the shell and was able to flip it into the boat he killed it and fihleted it and cooked it with speckles it fed and calmed the ravenous animal in his belly he lay on deck to watch the fires of sunset and briefly quicksilver it must have been next morning that he baited a hook with the sharks remains thought it over and threw the offal overboard destiny life would not keep a man alive he didnt want to catch more he went back to cutting weed he perfected the jabandflip he got another amtrak eel that way he was ready when a flounder appeared earthlifeand he got it aboard he baited three l ooks with what was left after hed eaten there were sockets in the deck to brace a fishing pole he lowered the lines into the great open patch hed cut in the weed around carders boat earthlife fish lived deep down he ate himself stupid and remembered to add speckles the skin on his neck and legs peeled off in flakes laterit had to be laterhe was wearing swim trunks and a windbreaker and a floatation vest fished from a locker he slept through noon and worked at night quicksilver had become a white glare he kept chopping every day there was less weed around the boat it was trying to grow back but he stayed ahead of it there was a ladder after all under the thickest part of the weed he cleared it a few people watched from shore day after day then a great crowd came down from warkans tavern when quicksilver was almost behind the sun brilliant at sunset they never waved they just watched day after day one day they were sparse another day gone he found the anchor cable by chopping devilhair from around it he tracked it up from the water to a housing in the boats nose there was a switch he flipped it the housing hummed to itself gearing up then it pulled and the boats nose sank he watched fascinated the boat was too light to sink he thought but could it pull itself underwater right to the floor of the ocean he never thought of turning the motor off something in the sea bottom gave first the boat surged savagely the deck slapped him silly the anchor lurched up while he was still too dizzy to care laterquicksilver was rising well before dawnhe saw that the weed that linked the boat to shore had stretched into a line the current was pulling him southeast he chopped weed until all that was left was the little patch on the starboard side on which his board still rested at some point the boat tore loose and he drifted free he had no way of rowing or steering carders boat nonetheless his life had changed jemmy bloocher was moving again tim hann had lived ten days tim bednacourt lorias husband had lasted half a year tim bednacourt the caravans chef was a hunted bandit he couldnt remember when jemmy bloocher came back it just felt right the land slid northwest then away the current along haunted bay ran southeast toward spiral town jemmy had thought the water would carry him around the point and down the crabs barren shore those cliffs were unclimbablehed seen thatbut he could wait drift down along the neck see what the shore was like along the mainland the mainland there was nothing left for jemmy bloocher on the crab peninsula but the mainland cavorite had gone there leaving road for others to follow the caravans home was in the mainland he came to understand that hed guessed wrong he was far out at sea mist hid the land but for the projecting peaks of the crest those slid northwest then awaynorth and eastthen very distant now drifted southeast again he was moving in a great curve the sea flowed like a wide bathtub whirlpool of which haunted bay was only the drain none of this bothered jemmy bloocher his speckles and the ocean would feed him for a while as the days passed he watched a vast sea and a serrated edge of land and a towering black storm far down the coast in his mind he traced cavorites path he was noticed of course on all of destiny there couldnt be two objects like carders boat one morning a few otterfolk had him in view the next morning there were more he couldnt tell how many because they spent most of their time underwater but he could see five or six at a time at noon they drifted away or drifted deep to fish he came to believe that otterfolk didnt like direct sunlight on another morning he came on deck into a flurry of earthlife flatfish he ducked two and another smacked him on the cheek there must have been a whole school flopping on deck he stood at the edge of the deck and raised his arms and shouted stop they stopped he brushed flopping fish overboard picking those who might live to swim away he kept a dozen qtterfolk watched for half a day while he filleted and cooked the catch he didnt have to fish for a while another day his line pulled a sub clam up to the surface there were beaked faces all over the water watching the thing was heavier than he was too heavy to lift into the boat did otterfolk play practical jokes or were they testing an alien intelligence how was he to free his hook he pulled the sub clam onto the remaining patch of weed it rested on its shell its siphon tentacle writhing as it fumbled at the slick fishing line trying to tear it if he climbed down there the weed would drown him could he balance on the board while he worked weed surrounded the surfboard but he could pull the clam into reach of it but if he did find some way to get the sub clam up to the boat otterfolk knew that humans ate sub clam meat they might not know that it wouldnt keep him alive he used his fourmeter weed cutter to chop at the meat around the hook until some of it came free he pulled up twenty pounds of sub clam then he compromised he sliced two pounds of it free and threw the rest back into the weed alongside the shell where scavengers swarmed around it the otterfolk got the idea or else they didnt like waste he was never offered another sub clam he could remember the sub clam shell in view beneath a blazing quicksilver long before dawn an earthlife duck was flapping in the shell with both its wings broken it took all of his will to cook it before he ate it afterward he wondered if there was a way to teach mercy to otterfolk using gestures alone the neck was where the peaks disappeared below the mist layer beyond they rose again marching into the mainland toward a distant storm storms formed and went away didnt they this one didnt he was still drifting toward it after he couldnt remember how many days the clouds towered higher than the peaks of the crest at night he could see lightning playing within how old was that storm he fantasized that it was a permanent feature of destiny jupiters red spot had lasted centuries destiny storms didnt normally do that but if one had then cavorite would have gone to see he was passing the neck then the morning he found that the pickedclean shell of a sub clam held a neatly placed tuna still flopping they couldnt have thrown such a mass could they they must have guided and chased it across the weed and precisely onto the shell neat he was working out how to hook it when he saw sails hed thought the mist would hide him maybe it only hid him from the neck while a fisher at sea could still see his mast maybe they hadnt told the merchant guards on the neck but carders boat was conspicuous the fisher sails showed clearly now theyd get here hours before sunset he raised the ladder from above weed halfenclosed the surfboard from a boat theyd never see it hed left his mark in choppedaway weed but a fisher might think it just grew this way he gaffed the tuna pulled it up took it into the cabins shadow and cleaned it he threw the offal onto the weed to draw scavengers lying on deck with only his eyes above the rim he watched four sails come closer he didnt know the men in the boats none of them wore merchants clothing jemmy took his four meters of weed cutter to the cabin and waited he could hear them moving about he heard their voices querulous and awed otterfolk watched from afar the fishers were gone at sunset they hadnt been able to find a way up more boats came the next day carders boat had drifted by then but theyd come straight as arrows they threw something over the side a rope ladder with hooks on it when one of them started to climb up jemmy cut the ropes and heard him splash they sailed off the next day nobody came the land came near an unfamiliar coast halfseen through mist the storm came nearer too hed eaten tuna until it went bad and he had to throw it overboard now hed grown hungry enough to want it back the otterfolk had gone away hed caught nothing using tuna for bait earthlife fish must be scarce around here but the current would carry him back toward the neck where tail town fishers didnt seem to go hungry but hed be giving the fishers and the merchants another shot at him he could hardly hear himself think for the howling of the wind and often the pounding of the rain he had to shelter in the cabin most of the time but he thought about drifting back along the neck conspicuous as any fifteenmeter craft from another world and he thought of ca vo rite flying into a storm that wouldnt go away he couldnt remember making a decision it was just there he took all the clothes hed found aboard though it was only shortsleeved windbreakers and trunks and a pair of work gloves it all went into his pack along with fishing line and hooks he showered no telling when hed do that again he drank all the water his belly would hold he knelt on the board in a pelting rain the devilhair hadnt actually eaten into the wood he peeled it away in big patches wearing the gloves hed found aboard then gloves and shoes went into his pack and he began paddling with great overhand sweeps of his arms he had imagined the path of cavorite but it felt very real to him had he imagined the days aboard carders boat events in his head were isolated he had trouble connecting them hed been on this board forever rain lashed at him and withdrew and fell again it could not be much past noon could it but it was dark as night save for the slashing of the lightning thunder and rain filled his hearing now there was another sound growing he couldnt see sign of a beach ahead but he could hear above the thunder and the rain waves rising and smashing down throwing spume storm waves if this storm had been here long enough to draw cavorite but he had no reason to think that was true did he the storm might be only weeks old but if hed guessed right then there had to be a beach waves like this pounding rock cliffs for centuries or millennia would have smashed rock to sand the waves were lifting him and dropping him he got to his knees this oncoming mountain of water looked like it and he paddled hard then stood up and walked the board forward sliding down down the nothing ahead was taking shape alienlooking black cliffs he veered the board the wave was trying to break twerdahl town surfers had given him a name for what he was doing now but he couldnt remember he rode the board parallel to shore with a wave breaking behind him and curling over him he was losing ground always closer to black rock but that was sand it had to be sand at the foot of those black cliffs he veered straight toward land and ran ahead of the wall of water as far as he could before the wave broke over him he crawled onto a narrow band of black sand he lay for a time just breathing choking on seawater hed still had the wit to hurl his pack at the rocks it was beyond the waves but the waves were playing with a shattered board rolling it in and back out shredding it his fourmeter weed cutter must be under the sea the border of sand had narrowed when the moons lined up you could get tides a meter high if this beach disappeared he could drown yet the black cliffs loomed alien and dangerous a type of rock hed never seen on destiny he donned his pack it was incredibly heavy the clothes within soaked with seawater presently he found something like a way up the windfarm something in the ocean is absorbing or precipitating potassium what it is doesnt matter we couldnt possibly counteract it in time well have to k elsewhere cordelia gerot xenobiology ferocious winds and stinging rain held him crouched and crawling and nearly blind lightning sputtered continually like settler magic gone bad it was all black and gray rocks tilted at all angles and it had gone on forever he slid on slippery smooth surfaces in places he found a surface like foamy rock traction was good but it lacerated his knees and would have torn bare hands and feet to ribbons his shoes and gloves were worth his life here it was another world as alien as pictures of volstaag and hogun taken by crawler probes yet there was life all around him the rocks were cracked everywhere and wherever there were cracks wherever mud could accumulate dwarf forest clung to the cracks and the flats jemmy found he could cling to the spiky plants and follow the cracks shadows blew past him on the wind like kites with broken strings he couldnt spare attention for what must be fragments torn from destiny plants but he had to keep ducking to protect his eyes so he never got a good look now flurries of shadows dipped and darted about him as if a malevolent whirlwind sought his death he ducked a shadow and it slashed his pack hed barely glimpsed its shape it was not an earthlife bird he could huddle close to the blackandbronze plants birds had to veer from the plants and jemmy got a better look at them what seemed to be feathers certainly werent they looked more like a chicken than an eagle more compact less likely to fly he ducked slashing claws and peered after the bird as it wheeled and came for him again how many legs did that thing have furtive creatures were looking him over from within the brush maybe his scent would keep them clear but it wasnt stopping the birds a lovely brilliant creature posed on a rock to watch him crawl toward it in the sputtering bluewhite light it stood out like a bonfire scarlet and yellow with bands of electric orange when he came close it stood upright and spread short wings and now there were threads of blue in the pattern it looked too big to fly it was patterned like a butterfly iridescent in this light it turned its head sideways to look at him and snapped a beak like needlenosed pliers he stopped a few meters away wondering what defense could give it such confidence it never gave ground destiny birds veered clear of it and so did jemmy he was crawling blind along a curve like a huge snake he forced his eyes open and found hed run up against a smoothly curved surface a tube of rock he crawled into it out of the rain it ran for meters before it became too narrow as soon as he stopped moving he was asleep thunder shaped nightmares hed wake with a scream he couldnt hear and remember where he was and sleep again later slept out and hungry in a black coffin of rock he wondered what built tubes human engineers built pipes aquaducts but here he pictured huge worms that ate rock he crawled out into a world much like the one hed left and kept moving water had drained from his pack it was lighter briefly starvation and battered senses left him lightheaded it was only a day since he had eaten but many days since hed eaten anything but fish fruit and vegetables were a fading memory there were potholes in the rock everywhere he went and he drank rainwater to fill his belly he had no idea what he was crawling toward an orange glow gone now as he crawled along the edge of a patch of forest there again orange to his left and a touch of heat on his cheek he crawled toward that the warm rain wasnt warm enough it was draining the heat out of him easing him into death he was shuddering with fatigue and hunger lightning sputtered continually the world was dark and bluewhite and it wasnt much better than being blind he couldnt recognize a single plant or tree in the destiny forest the air stank buj orange flashed and drew him until warmth bathed him and he turned himself like a roasting boar carcass to soak it in the wind went up carrying the rain away from him for a while then he could stop curiosity brought him closer to the heat crawling over naked slippery rock he looked down into a sea of redorange light it made him back up hed found what was only found in teaching programs lava molten rockvolcano destinys crust had ripped here that happened often on earth but nowhere else on destiny an alien place indeed where no food grew for earthlife such as himself he should go while he still had strength wind howled in his ears beneath the crackle of lightning it wasnt easy to walk but he just couldnt crawl any more his whole body screamed if he tried he walked directly into the wind peeking between his fingers he didnt remember why hed figured something out he couldnt exactly remember but this was right keep the wind in his face plants drew him color against the dark they covered the shallow slopes ahead of him they stood out like settlermagic paint green orange black black stalks split and split again to become orange thorns whose tips divided down to tiny green needles bristly plants hugged the ground knee high and twice as wide as they were tall nothing grew around or between them there were paths between the rows the slope was gentle and the rain had eased suddenly everything was easier jemmy was too far gone even to be thankful the plants tore at his legs when he wobbled off the path he bore it twice or thrice then bellowed in rage and tried to pull one up the plants roots clung like a demon he tried another and a third then quit and now hed found a wider path rock not too slippery to walk on the broad band of smooth rock continued level maintaining a constant width alongside the hiphigh forest even blinded by rain he couldnt lose his way plants all in one variety like something tended if there were otterfolk on the sea could there be sapient natives on land farmers a world older than earth might have had time to father more than one sapient species he walked his mind dreaming disconnected hed done this before it didnt dawn on him it seeped up into his mind from magma spilled from a ripped planet he had wandered onto rock melted by fusion flame and refrozen he was on the road again above the wind and thunder he heard his own wild laughter a pulsing yellowwhite light began to intrude on the lightning growing bright as he followed the road he couldnt even feel surprise when he found the door someone fed him broth later a bowl of rice with vegetables in it in between he must have slept the stone walls felt thick as mountains they blocked the thunder down to a suggestion a background it was one big room bunks ran away from him in an infinite rectangular array the occupants slept or talked quietly he heard nothing of that one moaned and protested in her sleep just audible above the whisper of thunder and jemmy knew that he could hear again he kept falling in and out of sleep he halfwoke when the lights brightened he was too tired to move but he watched as men and women rolled out of their beds they all wore shorts scarlet and yellow with a narrow orange stripe and nothing above the waist most of them pulled voluminous slickskinned blouseandhood garments over their heads all in the same scarletyelloworange pattern with strings dangling everywhere they went out in little clumps storm sounds rose then fell as the door shut rose again and fell two doors airlock who are you he blinked up at a halfbearded halfnaked man had he slept the man shook him who are you jemmy bloocher from now on youre andrew dowd remember that andrew dowd no no andrew dowd have you been getting enough speckles andrew dowd he tried to imitate the mans pronunciation it wasnt quite tail town speech but closer to that than anything else dowd was not quite dawd not quite dode andrew not ander the man was hairy everywhere a pelt of tightly curled black hair over chest and arms and face and head his beard was half a finger joint long too short to be a real beard his hair was the same length his ribs and muscles stood out like an anatomy diagram wiry strength and no fat at all he listened carefully to jemmys pronunciation then said better why why am i andrew dowd why do you want to know i was jemmy bloocher tell you later when you were out there did you see anything like pools of water glowing blue nothing like that good why there are pools where the water acts as neutron traps for uranium we call em kb pools theyre radioactive as hell wed have to put you outside ifwillametta halfbeard stood up he too wore shorts in screaming colors and a stick shoved through a loop at the small of his back willametta wore shorts just like halfbeards and the same brush haircut in blond as he saw when he managed to pull his gaze away from her fits shed be senka ibnrushds age late thirties but senka ruled a merchant wagon willametta was master of nothing as lean as halfbeard and worn out he could see a sharpfaced patrician loveliness beneath the fatigue she lifted jemmys head and slid her knee underneath in that position she fed him spoonfuls of vegetable stew it was nice it might have been erotic too but jemmy was just too tired his attempt to impress her by feeding himself got as far as trying to free his hands from under a sheet too weak too hungry to bother he hadnt eaten much when his protesting belly made him stop he asked where am i youre serious smiling willametta curled over to see his eyes yeah this is the windfarm who found me henry saw you first willametta said i thought andrew would be angry hes a trusty he keeps track of us but then she stopped maybe tomorrow you can feed yourself andrew questions yammered in his head two andrews trusty where are the toilets where are my things andrew you were carrying speckles speckles means youre ready to run the probes kill you if they catch you he looked up at her we stashed the speckles clothes too the trusty will give you a poncho when you can work she handed him an oddly shaped pan this you piss in until you can get up the room faded when his strength came back he looked under the sheet and found that he was wearing scarletyelloworange shorts way too big with a drawstring he woke when everyone came in glistening wet they left their ponchos at the far end where the airlock was the kitchen and tables were there too and they ate without much talk though jemmy could sense eyes on him willametta fed him again they dimmed the lights jemmy snapped awake the brightening of the lights was like dawn flashing through a curtain suddenly swept back hed never seen artificial lights this bright the others were all tumbling out of their beds a sudden whiff of bread they were tearing a loaf apart they ate fast while they dressed voices id kill a probe for a jar of strawberry jam what size and a trickle of laughter they pulled ponchos out of a box at the far end of the big room a machine that had throbbed all night just audible through the muted roar of the storm there were glareorange ovals on the backs of the ponchos a blue thread along the sleeves they werent all alike not quite halfbeards had a broader orange curve down the front a bigger oval patch in back they flowed out through the massive airlock jemmy counted as they cycled through five women and fourteen men including halfbeard three stayed behind there was the woman who couldnt get out of bed and complained a lot there was a small muscular man with straight black hair and a bristlyblack angry jaw and an older woman whose tunic markings matched halfbeards the woman loomed over him for a time studying him she was tall and dark broad across shoulders and hips she must weigh more than jemmy did despite being just short of gaunt her big breasts slack and empty by her size and her air of command she reminded him oddly of marilyn lyons and willow hearst of the spring and fall caravans she was of their kind but starved to the bone jemmy found himself avoiding her eyes he was just as glad when she and the angry man disappeared through a door he lost interest and dozed later he remembered sounds like quarreling or lovemaking or storm sounds mingled in his dreams the smells of cooking woke him the man fed the bedridden woman who appeared to be pregnant not sick at the big womans orders he fed jemmy and took jemmys bedpan there was no day or night out there jemmy andrew could hear thunder it never quite stopped but there was day and night in here hed lost his sense of time aboard carders boat maybe he could rebuild his memory of the voyage from the phases of quicksilver hed guessed right about the storm heated air rises from a sea of molten rock a rip in the worlds crust air at ground level flows in to replace it air moving inward on a spinning ball must spin a hurricane pattern that must have been running for centuries if cavorites crew had come to see oh that was it air flows in so face the wind to get out take the easy way out and youll end on the easiest path to run a road assuming that cavorites crew meant to lead the road right into a storm why would they do that hed found plants arrayed in rows then the road then a plantation house what would be grown here he could feel the answer tapping at his mind it was right on the tip of his tongue prison cuisine stable storm like jupiters red spot or uranuss dark spot but we havent had as long to observe it theres got to be a heat source under it and it has to be geothermal it may be a potassium source alan waithe geologist morning the big woman and her paramour stayed behind again the man gave jemmy a fistsized chunk of bread then water they both sat on jemmys bed and watched him eat get up she said jemmy rolled out of bed landed on his hands and knees mostly hed stopped hurting but he was weak she watched him pull himself to his feet he asked wheres the toilet shimon go with him there were doors at this end of the room marked with silhouettes of a man and a woman yesterday afternoon these two had disappeared into the womens room for an hour or two the mens room was bigger than hed guessed with urinals toilets basins towel racks showers and a tub partitions around showers tub and toilets had been ripped out and the marks painted over badly the walls were smooth stone like the rest of the barracks he turned a spigot burning hot water roared into the tub shimon was amused he helped jemmy climb in he even got a towel for him and then he watched as jemmy got himself clean howd you get that scar on your hand he asked jemmy tried to explain his voice was rusty hed almost forgotten how to form words hed burned himself holding a gun wrong when he fired at an advancing line of sharks and now there was a ridge of pink between thumb and wrist and shimon nodded and gave every sign of being fascinated when jemmy tottered back to bed shimon was supporting him with a hand on his elbow under the womans critical eye lying down was bliss the woman said im barda you do what i say you do what anyone says if he wears the orange i call you barda you call me barda i call you andrew gatherers like shimon here call me trusty unless were alone they call you trusty you use their given names its good if you can learn their family names too barda winslow she thumped her chest shimon cartaya she thumped shimons willametta haines amnon kaczinski the big guy duncan nicholls you call him duncan nick denis bouvoire if you need some machine unjammed theres a dennis levoy too dont get them mixed up rita and dolores nogales the twins you noticed them the huge pale guy yes amnon twins no most men notice rita and dolores theres a dark guy who looks young and old crippled maybe but quick rafik doe came here at fourteen near ten years ago he wont give his real last name to anyone records say he killed a whole trader family with a yutz gun you notice anyone else no whatve you guessed the other trusty hes andrew dowd barda slurred her speech like halfbeard and he tried to imitate that it might buy his life prison workers who asked a stranger to lie would want to be sure he could you wear the orange too youre both bosses trustees im supposed to be him is he supposed to be sick if he gets sick they make someone else trusty if someone finds you now youre just someone we pulled out of the storm naked can you walk he felt fifty feet high and made of glass but jemmy walked down as far as the box and back he set his hand unobtrusively on a bedpost to hold himself up and asked pulled naked out of the storm right where are my clothes supposed to have gone what dyou think torn off by the wind bettershredded by the plants good what really happened to them dont worry about it i saw a big bird the same color as your clothes firebird she said the biology lessons say that when something is colored like that to stand out its a signal could be a horny bird making himself easy to find or a flower calling a bee could be its poison and its warning all the bird eaters away stop jam inedible you wear the firebirds colors so the destiny predators wont bother you she nodded now andrew i want to know all about you come on down to the kitchen she took his elbow and they walked everything that wasnt beds or washrooms was down at the airlock end there was considerable space here the huge stove a line of hanging cookware locked bins the dining table and benches an enormous heap of black twisted logs drying for firewood and the chugging box the box was bigger than a coffin it was settler magic but it bore signs of later crude repairs below a glass hatch was a churning storm of brilliant colors it was a dryer for wet clothes barda gestured and he sat at the table shimon set out a heap of vegetables from a bin barda sat across from jemmy and began to chop and peel i can help jemmy said i was a caravan chef you just watch i dont want you fainting she listened while she worked her expression didnt give away much he could watch her muscles tense and relax and watch the knife move she was very fast running on automatic and her emotions went straight to her knife hand he couldnt watch shimon who busied himself tending the stove feeding the pregnant woman and watching jemmy suspiciously when jemmy told of killing fednick the knife didnt pause she knew of the caravans but she listened sharply to what he had to say of towns along the road and cooking at one point she said what you know about pit cooking isnt worth a fart in the wind in the winds and she chuckled for a long time the pile of vegetables grew and he asked barda are we vegetarians theyll bring a bird in tonight if they can everything else gets carted in they dont give us red meat i think it spoils too quick when we take in enough kilos of seeds sometimes they give us a radiated sausage keep talking the battle with bandits excited her when he spoke of the otterfolk she was rapt her knife hand slow and forgotten she loved the theft of the speckles can she looked queasy when he described sunburn she smiled when he spoke of swimsuits aboard carders boat the boat must have been rifled for anything anyone could use on land even cookware and somebody left a burner going the towels had all rotted but the older stuff must be settler magic we wondered six baggy shorts and seven old windbreakers and no hat no jacket you were wearing three windbreakers on over each other he drifted with the current aboard carders boat fed by otterfolk barda looked wistful he took his surfboard into the winds and her knife action turned angry you must be some kind of crazy and some kind of lucky we lose gatherers in the winds every year when i found the road i knew id be all right not the plants you didnt know the plants black core orange branches green tips never saw them before yeah why would you barda stood and stretched elaborately theyre speckles we grow speckles and youre pnisoned here she didnt answer barda youre faster than lightning with that knife can you cook as well as you carve she shrugged a silence grew and then she said daddy owns the swan its the best inn and restaurant in destiny town he says theres a destiny town shimon laughed incredulously barda started to laugh then changed her mind if you dont know destiny town youre a big bright target andrew just dont ever mention destiny town okay i cant tell you enough to fake it just tell me if the road ends there yes of course have you seen cavorite his intensity startled her then she laughed jemmy said ive followed cavorite all this way from spiral town have you seen it not up close they take children through for tours but daddy she didnt say anything while she shaved a potato naked then me and my four brothers we were free labor daddy never took us anywhere unless it was for the swan or for cooking or for customers i did every part of making an inn work before i was twelve i saw the top of cavorite once because we went to romanoffs cavorite is right down the road from romanoffs the top is round and theres a glitter from the windows if you need to know more jemmy waved it off ive been through columbia thats the other lander in spiral town unless cavorite was damaged or painted she didnt know better not talk about that either so tell me about romanoffs that is the best restaurant in destiny town when daddy was a boy the swan was outside town just beside i wont tell you where the swan is jemmy smiled what if i get hungry i dont want this scum thinking they can hide out at the swan anyway daddy thought he was going to move the swan the town was growing up around us and we had to buy more and more of our food you used to hunt it she sighed in exasperation he said tell it your way tell what you cant pass for a citizen just because you somehow crossed the neck i should be telling you how to talk like a trusty im tired barda get yourself a nap tomorrow you work the melee around the stormbock woke him he walked down to watch barda and shimon cook dinner it went fast they set up a pot to boil rice then a wok big enough to bathe in he wouldnt be able to lift that for a while barda shook and tilted it to stirfry the vegetables fans sucked the smoke and smells up into the ceiling settler magic whereas the stove was a woodfired iron box barda served herself then shimon then jemmy they sat while halfbeard and the gatherers fresh out of hot showers converged i never saw anything like that jemmy said is that how they cook at the swan its how we cook vegetables we served fish and waterfowl grilled and baked i know other ways to cook but i couldnt feed twenty people that way you can feed two hundred with a fire pit not when it rains one day out of four and thats how it is around destiny town the settlers must have liked things wet the spaceports on a plateau top of mount canaveral and thats dry old igor didnt want the noisemy granddaddys granddaddyso he built down below swan lake how does the road go spaceport then destiny town then here shimons sullen silence cracked he said trusty may i and he spilled some flour across the wooden table and began to draw in the flour the road runs straight from the neck along the coast to the winds how high high along most of the crab the road acts like its afraid of water oh yeah high enough that nobody bothers the otterfolk except here shimons fingertip grazed the line of ocean and veered away then you have to go right past unless you get permission from the overview bureau then the road branches here about halfway and the other branch runs inland cavorite stopped for a few years where this little town is now terminus and thats where i was born we grow up wanting to leave he said destiny town is where it all happens but they dont want you in destiny unless you already got work there and how can you do that the damn admiralty shimon stick to the point yesss trusty trusty theres a little branch off the road here it spirals around this bluff to the top they flew cavorite to orbit from terminus a lot of times then from mount canaveral just once they gave it up thirty years ago they only started flying again trusty fifteen years ago those new ships have to land on the ocean the port had to be moved and thats what did it for daddy barda reached past him the swan is here foot of mount canaveral and now they launch the ships from somewhere this way clean it up now shimon shimon wait jemmy said barda where were you thinking of moving to moving oh daddy daddy wanted to build another inn here her finger left an imprint on the other side of the roads first branching where the road dipped to nearly touch the sea a day short of the neck wed get all the caravan custom and people who wanted to study the otterfolk could stay there too it wasnt just a whim daddy sent us to build the damn thing barry and bill and me shimon said there now is that everything you need to know lets hope jemmy said and shimon began to clean the flour off the table barda said it better be shimon tomorrow you keep him straight right at his elbow every second if he starts to make a mistake you cover for him i cant ive got to be watching the whole troop excuse me jemmy said and he managed to reach his bed without falling over when the lights came on jemmy crawled out of bed with the rest they eased out of his way so he could get to the bread before it was gone nobody seemed to want to talk to him halfbeard watched him he said take another day barda said i wanted shimon watching him oh we can fix that but look at him if he tries to hold the pose you taught him the pose no ill do it barda and shimon went out with the rest halfbeard waited until they were gone willametta was tending miledy the pregnant woman but listening too the pose jemmy reminded him it looks like this halfbeard stood with his arms held high to the sides do it jemmy stood feet apart and raised his arms any specklesshy could have done it hold it till i tell you to quit barda says youre smart good you need to fool the probes into thinking youre me can you do that not yet tell me about proles halfbeard studied him jemmy said were the barda said gatherers youre trusties someone is trusting you your bosses that would be the probes proles proles keep talking i need to hear you ten men and women they rotate we dont know their names we dont ever have to when you talk to them you say yes man if its a woman yes mam they sound alike so if youre outside it doesnt matter if you cant tell you know them cause theyve got more orange they wear the orange right his arms were beginning to ache where do they live down the road through the cleft not far if you go there you dont come back andrew barda says youve fired yutz guns what the probes have is worse dont ever go up against the probes and when you talk to them you say the parole board like their main job is to let us go jemmy bobbed his chin his arms and shoulders were hurting now he held his breathing deep and reached im going out tomorrow to farm in the rain he said im a trusty probes come to check on us but they cant see anything about me but a big jacket with a hood and an orange stripe unless theres something funny about your legs halfbeard laughed a fullthroated bellow jemmy said right but you have to tell me what they think youll be doing sit down lie down jemmy lowered his arms then sat i dont know how to get speckles off a plant do i have a sack backpack you get your gear after you leave the stormbock gatherers get a pack and a scoop glove this time of year you get a bird gun they strip the speckles with the scoop gloves come spring theyd be planting weeding takes a weed cutter probes dont give gatherers weed cutters so you have to cut the weeds but you still get the bird gun and a pack too but theres rescue gear in yours you get your gun in the toobhouse and hang it back when you come home and the probes replace the ammo while youre gone they take the packs now as far as the parole board is concerned nothing nothing stops us from gathering speckles and thats how they pick trusties so you better not show them anything else otherwise you dont have to know anything except to count gatherers and see they do the work count halfbeard grinned he said you met shimon hell help you you watch shimon dont make it too obvious and hell point the way if you get confused and what will you be doing while andrew dowd is leading a work party leading a shift halfbeard grinned and thats my problem twentytwo prisoners jemmy thought the trusties are prisoners too firebird shorts and ponchos would mark them anywhere outside the winds go out without them and youre naked in a storm and birds tear you apart but now the storm gives up a stranger the parole board doesnt know about a twentythird gatherer carrying shorts and windbreakers that arent red and yellow with an orange stripe now the probes can count twentytwo while the other andrew dowd is off where gathering whatever might be needed when six prisoners disappear wearing clothes they shouldnt own barda winslow and andrew dowd and four others not jemmy bloocher unless he can talk his way in do the rest know halfbeard was watching his face do you think you can be me theres no telling what i might have to know i got barda talking yesterday tell me how you got here halfbeard scowled and turned away jemmy said the parole board knows how you got here andrew when they ask me id better know halfbeard spoke without turning murder twice they dont want to know any more if they do you killed them when they tried to rob you okay the damn tribunal didnt believe you transport trans they walk us in felony tape around our wrists crossed like this in front of us theres a wagon sealed bike a safe with gun slits and tugs to pull it we stick close to that were already wearing firebird colors if we run serve us right andrew i got to start dinner sometime come along i was a caravan chef barda said he noticed more today food was stored in bins near the stove grains fresh and dried fruit potatoes and carrots and other vegetables a big bottle of cooking oil some spices halfbeard opened the bins with a key cookware was in there too including heavy pans and cooking knives the ovens and burners seemed to run continually keeping the place warm cooking was wonderfully relaxing jemmy helped where he could peeling and cutting vegetables and feeding the fire until he got tired then he watched wibbametta and halfbeard set up the wok indoor cooking was most unlike the firepit cooking hed learned on the road suddenly powerfully and painfully jemmy missed the kitchen in bboocher farm the gatherers brought a dead bird in with them and gave it to halfbeard who passed it to jemmy and willametta jemmy was startled to find himself holding two raptorclawed legs while willametta took the other pair big wings drooped between eight kilos of destiny bird halfbeard shouted we dont stare at it andrew we cut it up and cook it willametta smiled and showed him how to slice under the feathers the bird didnt seem to have a distinct skin the feathers were narrow fractal spikes based in muscle tissue the blood was rich dark red this was no relative of the shelled varieties jemmy had encountered along the crab i was expecting earthlife jemmy said he was surprised now he thought about it to find himself holding a l cnife twerdahi town wouldnt trust a stranger so where are the speckles youre gonna love this andrew barda showed me how to stirfry destiny bird with potatoes and onions speckles we dont need speckles the birds and turtles around here concentrate the elements in the meat but is it all sure the wagons bring in earthlife food and we kill windbirds for the meat he waved the cooking oil this is the only fat we get and they dont give us enough we were real glad to see you andrew just anyone wouldnt pass for one of us it had to be someone whos been starved halfbeard smiled id kill a probe for a rasher of bacon willamettas lips twitched a token of a smile fletch say fletch of bacon people will think youre easy the gatherers were piling their ponchos into the dryer taking firebirdcolored towels and trooping back to the showers before the lights went out dennis levoy cut his hair to match halfbeards the speckles crop you cant eat these seeds straight on fd theyre almost salty almost metallic i hope we can get used to the taste dutton hydroponics jemmy entered the stormbock first with shimon and four he hadnt met he got their names a trusty would know rafik shar denis henry henry you found me henry grinned you looked like a drowned dustbird trusty shimon snapped trusty henry said door trusty that was shimon again reminding andrew that the trusty was always first through a door he walked into pulsing yellowwhite light it stopped him for an instant a flood of raindrops flared irregularly as the light waxed and waned somewhere in his murky memory hadnt he seen this before flashing yellow rain too tired to look up a pair of skeletons took him by the arms and told him dont say birdfucking aloud and led him out of hell some kind of hallucination he didnt look up now either because two birdshapes and a cart waited outside in the rain a cart pulled by a little smoothshelled machine jemmy lifted his hood and as hood and arm hid his face from them shouted over the thunder probes shimon nodded violently jemmy had thought theyd wait in the toolhouse where it was dry the gatherers were all pulling their hoods up jemmy wiped his eyes and looked around and had to throttle a laugh the hoods had eyes and beaks the proles came near one behind the other and a little to the side the orange stripes on their ponchos were broad r than a trustys weapons dangled at their sides belted over ponchos jemmy had seen merchants returning such things to spadoni wagon after a bandit hunt they bore another clear sign of their power halfbeard hadnt told him that probes would wear pants big loose pants and boots to keep legs and feet dry luxuries beyond your wildest dreams jemmy stepped forward eagerness over fear yes man the lead probes voice was rusty and male get on with it he waved and jemmy saw the toolhouse like the short arm of an l built onto the barracks building the gatherers were cinching the strings on their ponchos none of them moved not even shimon until andrew took the handles on the highwheeled cart and pushed it toward the toolhouse wooden bed metal wheels a crude piece of work very different from the lowbuilt machine that had been pulling it but it robbed easily it held empty backpacks painted in the colors of a firebird and one that held something massive the probes maintained their staggered position attack one youd be shot by the other the door was blocked by a thick metal beam with a big crude metal lock a probe opened it his sleeve hid the key he returned it to a zipped poncho pocket jemmy pulled the cart inside and the gatherers filed in after him he lifted out the heavy backpack it was full of bullets lungshark bullets were this size but these looked wrong and felt light jemmy didnt pause to study them he found the ammo bin where andrew had said it would be he unlocked it it was near empty he poured most of the bullets in a handful went into a pocket in his poncho he returned the pack to the cart the gatherers were picking up empty packs and big duckf oot shaped gloves there was a pack with a bigger orange patch jemmy took that and glanced in before he donned it rope and a big box marked with a red cross the halfdozen bird guns were shark guns yutz guns and nothing but jemmy loaded a gun and got his first good book at the bullets the business end was a cluster of little pellets not a slug the gun took eight shimon never stopped watching him jemmy wished he would lose that grin it called attention to them both still moving briskly as if he had been here too often to find it interesting jemmy followed the last gatherer he glanced back once blacksmithlevel technology here settler magic in the barracks snap it up trusty sorry man andrew dowd stepped briskly into the road leading his gatherers to their work site amnon took last place the proles stayed to lock the toolhouse twenty meters down the road jemmy turned to book back above the barracks pure light flapped like a banner and blazed bike a lightbulb too bright to look at jemmy squinted hard and looked anyway the roof might have been begley cloth but in this light he couldnt tell the flagpole was three poles meeting in a narrow tripod on the barracks roof the flag must have been at least ten meters by seven you couldnt get lost with that bight to guide the way but how much power was being burned here how long had it been burning cloth that burned like a lightbulb that was settler magic from the beginning jemmy had seen a flood of electrical energy bardas kitchen would have fed a dozen times the bloocher family hot water at the turn of a knob and enough to wash twenty gatherers at once all these ponchos and shorts and blankets cycling endlessly through the big machine that was never turned off and this there wasnt enough begley cloth to power a fraction of all this where were they getting their power a sudden downpour turned it all into a great halfglobe of yellowwhite rain rain hid the last of his line of gatherers and the proles werent in sight jemmy turned and walked on he looked back rarely rain and mist hid stragglers he assumed the probes were mounting rear guard they couldnt watch him fumbling with the strings of his poncho snarling them in knots until he finally managed to cinch wrists and neck and waist against the rain shimon kept pace behind him when he caught jemmys eye shimons casual pushing gesture waved him straight ahead jemmy grinned at that he was following the road along row after row of speckles crops how could he get lost probes might guess something if he stopped where speckles plants had already been stripped or led them past plants ready to harvest but halfbeard was out with the gatherers yesterday and hed guided them to the end of the road at days end he felt heard the rain stop for a long moment the air cleared and when jemmy looked back the last plodder was a shape too big to be anyone but amnon kaczinski no probes and the rain resumed and they marched on the road ended in a muddy pond a shallow crater cavorite had hovered here when jemmy was sure where he was he waved into the plants the gatherers moved in they knew where theyd stopped last night shimon looked back once before he followed the rest the probes were in place they followed amnon in then separated and began to circle wide around the little crowd of gatherers the gatherers formed a line one to a row and followed the rows of speckles plants jemmy bloocher moved among them watching and learning andrew dowd moves among the gatherers supervising with gloves built like pieces of an umbrella they stripped the branches holding their packs to let a rain of bright yellow dust fall in rain was turning the bottoms of the packs into a sludge of tiny yellow speckles seeds the packs would be heavy coming back he passed near shimon head down shimon shouted above the rain look around not just at me youre not just watching us work youre protecting us from what shimon looked up disgusted just pretend anything that pops up the proleslb get it first jemmy hadnt been told of any danger shimon went on theyre seeing if the ground is clear any bird they find theyll shoot it any bird still annoyed still obtrusively patient shimon explained any bird that doesnt eat meat must eat plants right any bird you see is after us or the speckles so the probes do a circle then theyll take a pass through the rows then theyll go home and get dry home for lunch he said it like a curse jemmy moved on winnie maclean looked like an elf or wraith very thin and fragile she smiled up at him and then looked down again working briskly eerily beautiful she was if you could forget that she was starving he got a conspiratorial leer from duncan nick to whom he had never spoken at all jemmy watched until duncan suddenly remembered what he was supposed to be doing with his hands a womans eyes snagged his own though her hands didnt pause in stripping branches a oncepretty face turned hard was that hatred what had jemmy ever done to her he was idle while she worked trusties must get a lot of this jemmy was going past when her head beckoned he moved closer and in the next row over a face turned toward him within a gatherers hood narrow head narrow nose yellowbrown skin and oriental eyes the same face with a smile like sunlight the angry twin said theyll leave you you know that hmmjemmy asked casually whos going rita this had to be rita or dolores nogabes not us either were not crazy he wants to go over the mountains who do i talk to if i want to go rita shrilled laughter who willametta bet shes with you know with halfbeard the other andrew and shimons with barda nobody talks to shimon rita nogales looked down dismissing him he moved on the other twin smiled at him and said good day for picking trusty he couldnt help smiling back is that sarcasm i wouldnt know dolores it doesnt get drier gets noiser gets windier sometimes the air burns your throat if theres windbirds you maybe have to hold the pose for half a day and then the board wants to know why your packs light you were a yutz yeah the trader women they teach you anything dolores nogaless eyes were direct and speculative jemmys instinct was to back up a few centimeters he said i think your sister hates me you dont ritas being stupid youre lucky talk to me later he moved on thinking pleasant thoughts what did trusties and probes get out of this they got just as wet as the gatherers but probes went home for lunch and everyone took their orders anyone but probes had to take a trustys orders of course you couldnt trust random felons to cook there must be poisons to he found in the lava scrub and cooking knives could kill or a heavy pan might as well give the cook a gun and call him a trusty but cooking meant trusties stayed dry one day out of two and anyone a trusty liked would also stay dry one day out of two it was andrews day outside and bardas day in theyd had to arrange something to get shimon out here guiding andrew if shimon wasnt with barda maybe barda was rubbing up against another man shed better be doing that no wonder shimon was irritable but tomorrow would be andrew s day in was that what dolores nogales was thinking andrew didnt have to be with willametta willametta was with andrew and jemmyasandrew was outside so one of these identical shapes must be willametta jemmy stopped by each gatherer for a time looking around conscientiously for a threat he couldnt describe the real threat the probes had closed their wide circle around the gatherers they talked then separated and moved in staggered fashion toward the gatherers here was willametta jemmy looked into her bag and said casually im told im not going wiblametta had a couple of pounds of seeds in the bag with another three pounds of water she said going where andrew i have no idea she returned his grin and he said im trying to think of a way we can all go wiblametta seemed to have the giggles right six of us in shorts and tshirts lucky i came in summer someone comes by we were swimming at the beach and a freak gust blew all our clothes out to sea couldnt six of us in swimwear tell a tale while the rest hide im a good storyteller shoes and pack and all freak wave talk to andrew im being andrew lets see along the road from the barracks theres fields this way and molten lava beyond thats no good other way is the parole board housing and then what civilization if you get past the parole board which will be a neat trick i guess her hands were stripping speckles branches head bent he glimpsed a smile beneath the hood but not if you leave seventeen gatherers behind you to answer questions she looked up out of the hood and the smile was gone she said nothing he walked casually on henrys grin was conspiratorial or maybe proprietary rafik last in line looked starved and hunted an aged youth who didnt want to meet jemmys eyes his hand slipped twice dropping seeds on the ground jemmy slapped his shoulder and said relax and walked on a slacking of rain moved across the field jemmys eyes followed the wave across gatherers moving in an even line one to a row well beyond the two probes were walking toward them the second behind and one row to the side behind them two speckles bushes stood up and streaked toward them jemmys gun was out before his mind caught up what moved like that was lungsharks the probes guns moved they were going to shoot jemmy he fired his bird gun straight up and pointed with the other arm one whirled around jemmy heard a brief ripping sound that wasnt thunder and wasnt a gunshot the attackers slowed as if theyd plowed into invisible honey birds now they seemed to dance jemmy turned away looking for more attackers away from some terrible secret hed almost guessed much closer two blackgreenbronze darts streaked along two rows of blackgreenbronze speckles bushes nearinvisible and too far to shoot even with decent bullets but coming fast at the line of gatherers someone yelled pose pose spectre birds shimons voice that should have been andrew s jemmy took the pose as hed been taught one row over henry said quietly no birdfucking allowed and a whispered chorus its the law he couldnt see anything else attacking the probes had stopped firing what had attacked them was gone the gatherers were a row of statues their ponchos drooping from raised arms their hoods facing the oncoming pair of spectre birds jemmy stood last in line arms raised high a bird gun in one hand afield offirebirds spreads their wings to face an aggressor spectre birds were fast like probes they came in staggered stance the range was too great for pellets jemmy held his fire while they closed the birds slowed as if confused then made for the middle of the line why werent they veering jemmy held held aimed and fired at the lead bird he hit it the bird flinched back and lifted its head it was as big as a small man with oversized ripping foreclaws the forwardfacing eyes of a predator and a beak that was a hooked prybar on top paired prongs underneath it came on jemmy shot it again then shot the trailing bird he had their attention now the lead bird lunged at a gatherers chest the gatherer whirled around at the last instant the beak gashed his back and he shrieked and tried to run then both birds were on him jemmy yelled and charged them firing one ran jemmy fired at the other bird its beak was deep in the gatherers torso four quick shots emptied jemmys gun before the bird dropped its prey and ran as each bird cleared the line of gatherers jemmy heard the nipsaw sound of the probes weapons matter sprayed from the birds blood and a chaff of feathers the probes weapons didnt fire bullets they fired streams of bullets jemmy tore his gaze away and ran to the fallen gatherer blood was flooding through holes in his poncho and jemmy couldnt doubt he was dead when a probe shoved him aside he gave way but hed seen it was shimon jemmy reloaded looking about him where there were four spectre birds there might be six or eight a hand snatched at his shoulder and pulled him around the probe was a man with a full red beard he snarled what did you think you were doing shooting at a spectre bird guns arent for things that big jemmy protested he was going after my man man take the pose the paroles chest heaved he must have run flat out how often do you have to be taught take the pose and the bird thinks youre a firebird firebirds dont run dont shout dont shoot shimon was posed we were all posed why did it kill shimon while i stood like a statue when the bird got close he tried to run the probe heaved in a ragged breath lost his nerve yeah they could have killed you all thats why were here jemmy had seen but he said something safe thanks man you took them out good redbeard turned without answering he and the other probe spoke for a time jemmy waved the gatherers back to work and they obeyed fortunately and he waited for orders redbeard told him take your people back to barracks four of you carry this one wait for us well look around a little there has to be a report suspicions if speckles can be farmed elsewhere we must ttll extract potassium to feed it wh bother well grow it here will coffey hydroponics of course the strongest men should have been carrying shimon but the ones who did were the first names jemmy could remember dennis and denis henry and amnon jemmy draped shimons nearly empty pack to keep some of the rain off shimons torn torso the parole board might want a coroner to examine those wounds he walked alongside while four men carried the fifth hed told off two more to carry one of the spectre birds for dinner and a chance to examine the wounds and so the funeral procession straggled up the road willametta trusty there was a joke andrew wouldnt have missed its the law willametta guffawed well iwasnt here yet but you can picture it nobody gets a bird gun except the probe but there hadnt been any birds so theyd been eating nothing but rice and veggies for weeks one day a crooner popped up in the field its as big as an ostrich well the probes and the trusty were a little slow for gordon weiss he didnt wait he ran the bird down and jumped on it and tried to crush it in a scissor lock jemmy thought it over ouch of course those arent really feathers theres a reason the windbird predators all have needle beaks theyve got to stab through the destiny feathers to get at the meat because the feathers are nothing but needles so picture it she said gordons legs and arms are full of needles and he rolls away screaming and the bird is crooning and the trusty has finally started shooting and somebody shouts itillametta drew breath and bellowed no birdfucking allowed and someone else yells her timing was perfect six people behind them shouted its the law and ever since then light grew behind them like a sudden dawn drenched exhausted frightened jemmy could only wonder at the glare behind him that threw blurred shadows along the road he turned expecting to see sunglare through split clouds that would not be such a strange thing whirling storm was still there but the clouds flared too bright to book at lightning was only a faint sputter against that jemmy shouted willya what is that theyre lighting the field looking for more birds lighting it with what the other pallbearers laughed willametta said quicksilver quicksilver how the power comes from quicksilver and the long road stretched away and after a time the light behind went out it seemed to take forever a white flicker became an intermittent white glow and the rain blew it away and there it was again until a blazing yellowwhite banner bed them on and on at the end jemmy stood in the rain before the massive door and its massive lock and couldnt remember what to do next like the barracks the toolhouse was built for giants generations of gatherers labored to move masses of rock their lives as nothing to their parole board masters nah jemmy had come to understand cavorites intent find potassium get it back to the landing site before everyone on destiny dies they must have come prepared to refine the ore here or at spiral town speckles must have been a surprise a plant that poisoned herbivores by secreting potassium and other trace elements that earthlife needed so cavorite brought the road here and cavorites crew farmed speck les they came with interstellar technology and desperate intent and they built massive forts of fused rock if the first settlers tried to stop them from leaving and later remembered cavorite as a ship of deserters perhaps it was because they were already specklesshy todays gatherers lived in housing that settler wizards had built for themselves prisoners swaddled in luxury twerdahls crew hadnt barred this door against themselves the bock must have been added years later or centuries and he didnt have a key oh that was it jemmy couldnt get in so four men were standing behind him still hoisting the dead weight of shimon jemmy turned toward the barracks wibbametta blocked his way youve got to give over the packs and gloves first she said urgently and your gun theyll shoot you have some sense we cant just two hours walk through rain with lightningblasted vision and thundershattered hearing and that damned ghostly banner ahead must have turned off his mind of course they could wait out in the storm for the probes convenience yes but they couldnt set shimon down in the mud jemmy booked around him two gatherers were halfreclined on an exposed ridge of bare white rock jemmy told them move they stood not hurrying rita and dolores nogabes here he beckoned the pallbearers and they set the body down shimon was still dripping wet and his pack no longer covered him jemmy looked around and found packs piled on another bare tufa ridge and the dead spectre bird next to them he felt queasy looking at the spectre its torso was chopped half through raggedly as if a big dull ripsaw had been used on it while it wiggled warm breath in both ears he jumped voices whispered trusty could be a long wait the twins had him bracketed jemmy said sorry if i had a key we could wait in the toolhouse but then id be a probe so maybe i wouldnt give a shit what we sometimes do we go around the other side of the barracks the corner for shelter the women brushed gently against him on both sides even through the poncho that felt nice and practiced one said not everyone just us the rest they know not to bother us because youre a trusty and its a corner of course its still wet but its not so cold you could think of it as slz pery that twin had to be dolores it was tempting jemmys arms had reflexively moved around their waists at worst they warded off some rain dolores meant it he thought but anger still smoldered in ritas eyes so what was going on he said you know theyll do a count he felt rita go rigid dolores said quickly theyll want to know what spectres were doing there in the fields where theres no prey so they wont be right behind us but we might want to hurry or just fool around now and then stay in tomorrow rita dolores have you seen the big baths theres the packs and theres us jemmy said firmly three of us in the barracks that hasnt changed andrews gone but im here i count eighteen of us out here including shimon but that should be nineteen rita snapped hell be back whojemmy asked and the pack piling them up is good but he took a pack i counted those too rita touched doloress hand and they both faded back amnon kaczinski asked you got a problem trusty willametta was standing beside the looming giant and jemmy spoke to both you tell me a missing man a missing pack and a pair of probes coming closer every second those guns are like hoses then again i dont have a problem amnon sure i know were one gatherer short man and he stole a pack of speckles too but i cant chase him because theres just me to watch all of these other gatherers including that big dangerouslooking one willametta spoke yes all right rafik took shimons pack and hell take a handful of speckles for the stash amnon said willametta and the parole board wont notice that little all right and you should have stopped him amnon hes crazy we need the speckles wilbya weve got two manyears weight of speckles stashed and what did we ever do with it but now weve got something to wear finally weve got clothes what if rafik gets caught now jemmy suggested send someone for him we cant have two missing hell be back willametta assured herself good ive got a few questions talk to andrew the probes are going to ask me questions we didnt know thered be a dead man so i wasnt told any answers why did the birds attack shimon how would i know that amnon birds amnon shrugged massively you never know but am i supposed to knowno good will they ask me to guess willametta amnon shut up you the big man was going into a rage willametta said go away amnon but willya amnon what do they do to you when you hurt a trusty go away go wait for rafik hes not oh the big man went wilbametta just give me a guess that doesnt sound totally stupid she was silent mating season makes them twitchy what windbirds dont have a mating season he cut himself no thats human blood itd drive birds away she was laughing at him try this then jemmy hesitated the bird struck then shimon turned the probe was sure it couldnt happen that way so jemmy knew that shimon had been murdered but how did he dare to guess right but willametta was looking at him waiting suppose one poncho out of all our ponchos wasnt the right color not quite the color of a firebird there must be animals or plants that dont secrete potassium but that show colors maybe a little off she was shaking her head he persisted is there a paint source in the toolhouse that thing in the toolhouse used to make survival biscuits out of earthbife garbage trusty any trusty would know that well thats why im asking willametta she nodded lets see you brought a bird home for dinner last night now suppose shimon was cold so he kept his poncho on and he still had it this morning her hands gripped his arms hard dont say that with the blood of a windbird all over it if some of those horrors whiffed destiny blood dont tell them that was he a spy willamettas mouth stayed open jemmy said the probes have to know whats going on in the barracks they need a spy they can tell a spy theyll make him the next trusty barda and andrew theyre trusties now but were they spies before andrew was so he knows how a spy gets picked did shimon know youve stashed some speckles she pulled him close and whispered in his ear she was scared right through they havent touched it yes he knew but he didnt know where how could you know all this jemmy i guess i was waiting for someone to die barda and andrew have to know who the spy is or they cant hide anything when the birds tore into shimon it all just fit except the paint i guess who gave him his poncho this morning barda they were hood to hood arms bracing each other against the wind an approaching probe would see only lovers jemmy said willametta i need a story to tell the probes they know something they waited for us in the rain this morning they stayed to search for something else before they caught up with us she said theyll search the barracks did andrew tell you she looked into his eyes damn him when the probes search you open every door and drawer dont close any of it they do that you go around the room clockwise idont know sure or watch their hands if one points to something you open it or move it or lift it try not to talk too much the rain slacked and she looked around they all seemed to do that she said rafiks back her breath caught oddly jemmy could see past huddled gatherers far down the road to where two rainbow birds walked bike men two willamettas hands closed like claws and she pushed her cheek against his and keened in terror he whispered not rafik theyre too soon where did they come from isnt the parole board in that direction no way could a runner get to them settler magic he remembered an old word from the lessons phones quick around the side willametta ducked and lifted the hem of jemmys poncho nearly to his chin he guessed what she had in mind the rain was back a waterfall now and he had to shout into her ear we cant do that its a distraction her hand found the waistband of his shorts and dipped in to cup his genitals and squeezed gently he stopped her hand on wrist nowlisten theres a man dead and proles coming to look into it andrew dowd is alert and scared and waiting he cant be around to the side rubbing up against a lovely woman when he could be having her all day tomorrow in dry comfort itd be suspicious as hell her hand stopped moving he had her attention he had an erection too so hed best talk fast rafik went that way then the probes passed him right hes behind them yes yes we have to give him a chance to join us okay you get let go now she did you get amnon and the twins send them around that side while the rain holds the parole board direction the gatherers stay huddled so theyll be harder to count im at the road ready to serve my prole masters but looking in the wrong direction i dont know anything about prole phones right she gaped willametta i never heard the word good then andrew didnt either you behind me ready to spot anything weird and tell me and lets drape a pack or two over shimon the next break in the rain showed two pairs of proles converging the pair from the board direction was nearest and jemmy let them see him suddenly discover them they plodded up to him and one said trusty some of your gatherers are missing jemmy looked around wildly oh man they must be around to the side can i check that out i had to stay here man one of my people got killed go get them where are the packs we piled youre missing some of those too the other prole had drawn his weapon jemmy shrank back raised his arms no man we spread some packs over shimon over the body i thought youd want to look him over i didnt want the rain to wash anything away i still cant figure why birds would tear him up like that walking backward jemmy led them to shimon laid out on white rock there two packs covering torso and face and when jemmy lifted them there were the terrible holes in shimons poncho and shimons corpse for an instant jemmy glimpsed a birdshape with a pack in his hand behind the probes a moment later hed merged with the other birdshapes the second pair of probes the ones who had been in the field were birdshadows seen through slackening rain and jemmy could only hope that they hadnt seen rafik rita and amnon and dolores were coming around the toolhouse obtrusively straightening each others clothing and jemmy shouted and went to yell at them when he looked around again the piled packs booked to be the right height the four probes closed on jemmy tell us how this man died now dont leave anything out i swear man the spectre bird jabbed him before he moved jemmy said belligerent and tired two probes shrugged and one had gone to open the toobhouse but one redbeard cursed what i saw was a bird getting curious and a gatherer losing his nerve maybe youre right man but i saw what i saw jemmy had considered changing his story but he judged this betterjust stubborn thats all turn in your gear and then were going to search the barracks the packs of speckles went in the cart the gatherers returned their gloves to the toolhouse jemmy left his bird gun and bullets in there too he watched the little smoothshelled machine pull the cart away the three who remained directed their passage through the stormlock they were too edgy for anyones comfort jemmy and the redbearded probe went in with willametta and amnon jemmy smelled stirfry cooking barda winslow looked around and jumped go easy barda jemmy said its a search he pulled off his poncho and dropped it a woman moaned on one of the beds jemmy reflexively turned toward the sound redbeard said you go nowhere dowd stay with the cooking winslow whos that barda winslow answered defensively miledy waithe is pregnant and overdue my assistant ansel tarr is standing by as midwife ansel tarn was a goodbooking sixteenyearold boy white skin straight black hair just a touch of sullen he was plausible enough as barda winslows love slave redbeard grimaced when the rest of the parole board gets in well do our search i believe well start by searching under miledy waithe he was watching bardas eyes and he wasnt pleased when she laughed out loud the stormlock door opened and he said all right here come hell here came two gatherers and a dead bird jemmy commanded them take the bird to barda and help her cook miledy waithe screamed again ansel tarr murmured in her ear otherwise the stormfree silence was heavenly you dont give orders when were here dowd the redbearded probe said quietly jemmy said were all going to run late tonight man last chance to search the bird did what are you looking for something you can talk about hidden tools hidden speckles dyes any kind of cloth that isnt the probes fingers rubbed the cloth of jemmys shorts this kind three gatherers and a second probe entered redbeard said dowd stay marta when horace gets in well search the bathrooms cover me will you go for it the second probe said redbeard pulled his wet poncho over his head and was bare to the waist he ran fingers through his hair and flung the water away ah better my turn go marta stripped off her poncho she was in jemmys judgment exquisite males gaped at her and she hoisted the gun and grinned redbeard caught jemmys smile and glared mens room he snapped they began their search there the mens bath was bare of anything suspicious the womens bath was very like the mens when they emerged the gatherers were all inside along with a third probe he was a stocky muscular man and he stood guard while the probe marta and the gatherer ansel examined miledy mibedy certainly seemed about to give birth jemmy ignored that moving clockwise around the room he opened every door and drawer he could find he missed two that the probes knew were there they took that seriously the probe hed nicknamed muscles held him at gunpoint marta took position in a corner and covered the whole room while redbeard emptied a cabinet in the medical stores and tapped it for secret corn partments all in the sullen communal glare of wet and uncomfortable gatherers they did the same later with a kitchen storage bin they watched carefully while barda and jemmy poured the elements of dinner slowly from one container to another nothing hidden then redbeard gestured toward miledy and wet and uncomfortable gatherers began to murmur do this fast jemmy thought he summoned amnon with a gesture they lifted the bed next to miledy and invited the probes to examine that then together amnon and jemmy and muscles lifted mibedy waithe they set her on the other bed before she could begin to protest for miledy that was the last straw redbeard and muscles examined mibedys bed ignoring the sounds behind them but miledy was giving birth ansel tarr and marta helped them tend to that at the end they were holding a squirming red infant girl and miledy had gone from screaming into monotonous cursing marta said so theres your free ride out miledy wasnt listening she moved the baby a little said girl in tones of wonder and went to sleep the search was over but while the rest of the gatherers served themselves and ate the probes questioned barda and andrew about housekeeping details that was hellish jemmy didnt know most of the answers he and barda found a routine hed start to answer then barda would interrupt it seemed forever before the proles trooped into the stormlock and were gone then jemmy sagged and sighed and barda called get your showers now the parole board can check our water flow did anyone save us anything there was still food jemmy was ravenous most of the gatherers were showering miledy was asleep with the tiny new baby in her arms jemmy and barth ate in silence for a time in a silent hall barda said good routine domineering bitch wimpy male worked we should practice yeah itd work better with a guy who wasnt so mmm impressive rafik this could have gone on all night you know cooking smells helped probes get hungry too redbeard found something in the mens jemmy said he hid it paper not sure message from shimon thats all right jemmy i found it and took out the part about you what now barda took her bowl to the sink she hadnt actually eaten much nerves maybe we wait for andrew she said then maybe we run i want to talk to rafik but lets get our showers first plans destinys ecology after all will have its own agenda dutton hydroponics he couldnt remember hitting the bed now something was pushing his toes down and the barracks was buzzing like a hive and through his eyelids he felt the heat of a stare they were both watching him the nogales twins they were on his bed their weight pulling the sheet down on his feet when his eyes opened one said severely men dont turn us down most men like rubbing up against two women just alike jemmy said you may be the best opportunity i never had who told you i needed distracting wibbya you werent supposed to notice the pack or count heads just us and a hand in his chest hair jemmy felt damp and grungy hed been too tired to shower he asked am i getting another chance should i shower first andrews here they want you what time is it did i get any sleep they dont give us clocks they were down at the tables andrew barda rafik and willametta the rest were staying clear a few were asleep andrew dowd was wet and triumphant jeremy bboocher he said do i get to be jemmy bboocher now the rest of your life halfbeard said expansively and i get to be andrew dowd jeremy we need to know what the proles know did they get shimons note in the mens he the one with the red beard he didnt look at it barda you said it mentioned me because if that note didnt then some other would yeah it did i copied it with that part missing jemmy was still getting his brain up to speed they thought i was hiding something because there were two cabinets i didnt open but they searched those theyll look for bird blood on shimons poncho but maybe the rain washed he saw the look that passed among them barda shimons poncho the big woman shuddered no i sucked the poor bastard dry and kept him distracted i set him to keeping you out of trouble so he couldnt talk to proles i did not put a bloody poncho on him but she whispered i would have andrew said couldnt rain would wash off bird blood rafik rafik grinned we soaked the inside of a pack in bird blood we gave that to shimon he had to open the pack to gather speckles and that let out the smell the birds were in place shells andrew said suddenly rafik tell me you didnt leave a mockturtle shell for proles to find rafik shrugged what of it trusty they know there were spectre birds in the field they have to guess the birds went after something they could eat how a mock turtle got there thats the part theyll never know andrew dowd was nodding reluctantly rafik said when we got back i took shimons pack took out the speckles turned it inside out and let the rain wash it clean theyll be looking at the wrong pack anyway you switched the speckles sure then wiliya and the yutz they got me back in see jeremy theres bird blood soaked all through the speckles in shirnons pack we cant bet the parole board have that so those speckles went in the stash and rafik put speckles from the stash in his pack rafik you didnt scant that i devotely hope no trusty generous andrew saw the heat in willamettas cheeks and the glare in her eyes willya i didnt want you to know exactly what you were hiding be too much of a pointer he waved it off so the spy is dead we changed the only message he left the probes dont know weve got clothes and they dont know someone was loose today are we clear on that have i left anything out jemmy asked who wears seven windbreakers and six shorts and a merchants pack barda me amnon shar willoughby henry you we had to throw away the one you were wearing on top it was torn to shreds they were grinning at him rafik said you dont get it its anyone with a trace of fat on his cheeks aghast jemmy booked about him of course and well still look like well it only works if theres only one jemmy said andrew what happens to the rest of us we take all but eight andrew said its nine now i guess the baby youre leaving them jeremy wed never get past the parole board not by road were going over the mountains well pick up the road on the other side eight of us dont want to try it winnie maclean too frail she wants to come the nogabes sisters dont ill miss the twins rafik said soberly feremy not jemmy have to practice lateryoure leaving eight people to describe how we did it the ones who arent coming i didnt tell them everything and thats okay with them they know there was a spy jeremy we never could have taken miledy waithe and her baby so whats the point too many of us are looking at a fiveyear hitch and four years gone already if i tried to make them come along theyd drop out somewhere in the rain and id never find them that probe said something about a free ride willametta said if you give birth in here the baby goes back out and you go with her only twice though then they char your tubes but men dont get pregnant rafik laughed were screwing for nothing fourteen of us were the maxers andrew said destroy life support its seven years and theyre generous with that term arent they wibbya kill its seven years i killed two never mind why the board wont listen now i scouted the mountain today that place you found rafik it doesnt work i had to go farther six klicks toward the fields then up theres a channel up to a ridge that runs another two klicks back must be an old flow then another channel up and thatlb take us over and down to the road barda didnt see andrews shrug or ignored it on the road we can pass if anyone comes the rest hide we do the talking but jeremys right andrew two of us together still look gaunt jemmy said like so many liches risen untimely from our graves one of us at a time is only skinny but two or three together you cant see it youve been together too long andrew can we all climb he could no thirteen felons could outclimb jemmy bloocher dont know andrew said i need as many as i can get were going to take over a caravan jemmy sighed they were crazy after all barda said we need you to tell us what theyre like how theyre armed well it had to be dealt with he asked where were you going to jump them this side of the neck that way youre only fighting fifty or sixty merchants other way youd be fighting yutzes too this side sure зell be lucky to get that far but well only be facing bird guns thats yutz guns andrew theyre the same as bird guns but with a solid bullet for putting holes in lungsharks and bandits when bandits jumped us we shot them with yutz guns but when the merchants went off alone to kill all the bandits they took stuff from spadoni wagon that they wouldnt let us look at i saw just enough prole guns andrew silence the toolhouse is locked till morning youve got no guns at all andrew stood turned opened one of the bins with a key he lifted it just into sight a prole gun a shudder ran through him jemmy said we looked in there his hand reached out without consulting his forebrain andrew pulled it away i came in after the proles left bullets two chains andrew lifted those too and jemmy stood to look he had never seen chains of bullets meant to feed into a prole gun but standing he could see that both loops were part empty it was suicide and more than that it was murder theyd end up killing as many merchants as they could before the merchants killed all of them he could rave against spilling blood all over the road but would it persuade these alreadymurderers or would they only kill jemmy bloocher try something else he asked do you know how to make a caravan move andrew said you do i know how to tend chugs jemmy said im a chef i did a little mending i never drove a wagon i cant do it all jemmy wondered if theyd believe that what time of year is it the date tells us if well get a caravan on its way to the crab or coming back or nothing at all willya whats the date rafik ive lost track myself we cant wait willametta said rafik said well find someone on the road ask uhhuh then well know if were between caravans that could take months murderous silence of course we might outrun a caravan they cant move faster than a chug but you didnt even know that much did you what you dont know doesnt it scare you now if theres a caravan and if fourteen of us could take it youd lose some wagons just by shooting them up bullets kill chugs too that gives you a short wagon train and maybe eight or ten left alive to run it and nothing to sell andrew released a bit of his fury hold it you son of a dirty bird why nothing to sell andrew a caravan full of trade goods is on its way to meet the other caravan they stop on the neck nose to nose they transfer all the yutzes and throw a big party they see were fakes and shoot us all dead so you cant stop the outbound caravan you could stop the caravan thats coming back and turn it around but itll be full of stuff they bought on the road and every little town along the road is going to notice one caravan following another with not enough people to defend it and that andrew is when your pitiful few survivors of that last fight get to die at the hands of bandits by the way theres no point in negotiating with bandits theyre specklesshy by then i guess well be too barda winslow stood she said go away jemmy went hot water flooded over him he stopped trying to think just let it happen ancient luxury the water never had run like this at bloocher farm a voice shouted hey and a hand touched his arm then the twins were under the shower with him he laughed and shouted into an ear what if someone wants the mens room amnons guarding we asked willya she said you could use a distraction if anyone else comes in we break this up ritas mostly here to take care of me some men theyd get rough they connected he and dolores sitting in a thundering flood of hot water rita was massaging his back and shoulders and that felt good jemmy found he could still shout trying to get a free ride out yeah they rode in the aftermath glow he reached up along ritas leg hey if dolores gets pregnant but you dont would they take her but not you girl move over hey yutz you got any of that left weeks i was saving it for loria well save it no more then someone did come in and the women rolled to either side and were on their feet and rita turned off the shower while jemmy lay bedazzled and bewildered three shadows seen through fog just us down rita jeremy weve talked can you join us sure barda and rafik and henry emerged from the steam he was still short of sleep he thought but there wasnt any way to rest now barda do we have time to talk if i thought of looking for windbird blood on shimons shirt they wont find it rafik said carelessly come on jemmy got his shorts on he was talking as they walked toward the airlock end i shot both birds then they both chewed shimon up they must have gotten their own blood all over him the proles will think of looking the question is did it wash off henry began swearing rafiks glare was the kind that kills barda took andrew aside and began to whisper they broke all right andrew said we have to go i have to go i killed a prole tonight for that gun jeremy for earths sake when did you think of this came to me while i was in the shower what can we do steal one wagon do they ever separate they can be separated there are stories you need more than fourteen people for a bandit gang though yet again andrew what would you do with it even if we could peel off a wagon and kill everyone in it and take all their yutz guns we wouldnt have enough firepower to hold off shark attacks well lose our chugs in the first week thats why they take so many wagons well if its that hopeless theres no point in any of you going im a trusty you c im coming barda snapped without looking up she was rolling the biggest of the kitchen knives into a pair of shorts you couldnt have stopped me doing anything andrew told her didnt know i was out there killing a prole and i iding the pack wagon cant stop me now cause im holding that damned hose of a prole gun so jeremy do you have anything to say that isnt were all gonna die jemmy said i think we can become a restaurant the run old sun old planet means less f heavy metals and radioactives the crust is too th k for plate movement and mountain building destiny doesnt really have more water than earth b t it covers nearly everyhing henry judd planetologist andrew stopped them just outside the stormlock in the flapping white light of the electric banner i forgot something he grinned and turned to go back in jemmy had him by the poncho no you dont amnon he bellowed the snout of the prole gun pushed into jemmys throat andrew almostwhispered just what d jemmy screamed hes going to kill the ones who stayed the crowd of refugees melted jemmy couldnt tell who ran or where they hid but barda and willametta moved immediately to andrews side they whispered urgent remonstrances their hands caressing his arms while amnon stepped up behind him and wrapped his big arms around andrews head but andrew pushed the prole gun hard under jemmys chin and jemmy didnt try to move amnons arms began to tighten and twist he asked the twins too you birdfucker we cant leave them to talk barda was holding the point of the biggest of the kitchen knives just under andrews eye andrew cursed and released the gun jemmy caught the heavy thing and cradled it pointing it at nobody a tiny green light twinkled in the butt he said you never did have a plan did you just kill and kill until something stops you nooo jeremy jeremy give me the gun a minute what jemmy swung round the gun swung too one of the twins shied back just give me the gun for a breath she pleaded laughing i dont think so then you do it shoot up the toolhouse a little bad idea rita dolores but look willya shouted barda dont cut him its all right let him go now what andrew andrew snarled like a beast plan jemmy said in disgust without andrew the rest had no direction but jemmy bloocher might as well be lost on another planet he said push anyone stupid enough to trust you until he drops out then kill him for it kill proles till they shoot everyone whos still with you keep it up till theres nobody left plan andrew wrenched himself loose and they let him do it he shook himself and strode off shouting follow me the flapping yellow blaze dwindled into black rain in the rain and the thunder there was a rustling too and motion that wasnt just trees in the wind a big bird dropped from the sputtering sky and lifted again with a turtleshape in its four sawtoothedged feet andrew had told them to keep their ponchos he was right the night was alive rafik doe recognized tree roots strangling a sharpedged boulder and fished jemmy bloochers pack from underneath those on the short list stripped and donned the swim trunks and windbreakers from carders boat then wore their firebird colors over them jemmy gave his prole gun to amnon before he pulled a windbreaker over his head then his own old and battered pack amnon handed the gun back somewhat to jemmys surprise and got himself dressed theyd walked halfway back to the field where shimon died in a sputter of lightning they watched a battle between shadows of birds rafik complained in a continuous drone until others took up the theme too here said andrew he meant a line of spiky blackandbronze foliage dug into the crack that ran up a nearvertical rock face there were exclamations and protests and then they climbed jemmy waited to help the laggards shar willoughby got ten meters up and froze jemmy climbed up to show her which plants would hold where to place her feet she shook her head and wouldnt look or move get me down just get me down andrew and barda were high above him he couldnt ask do we need shar she was wearing shorts and windbreaker but shed never make it and she was blocking the path a tenmeter fall would break bones he guided her down letting her stand on his shoulders when he had to she knelt at the bottom panting like a dog he made her strip and took her shorts and windbreaker the others were climbing shar plodded back toward the barracks jemmy pulled himself along a row of destiny plants or was it all one plant he couldnt see a break just a line of roots prying a mountainsized rock apart before that crack ran out there was another the world was all tilted surfaces black and lightningwhite and roar of thunder he remembered wandering in a daze mostly blind and mostly deaf pulling himself from nowhere to nowhere just because he wasnt dead yet but this night was very different from the night hed abandoned carders boat hed been fed and succored and twelve people had given their lives into his hands gloves nobody else had gloves the plants ended suddenly other climbers started having trouble jemmy had to double back a few times to guide the others to foot and handholds the prole guns strap left jemmys arms free he could see andrew watching from far above if jemmy slipped andrew would have the gun again here andrew bellowed the ledge leave your ponchos here firebird shorts too use rocks to weigh them down rafik exclaimed now what on earth are you playing at andrew do it right andrew bellowed hed left his own clothing where he was fifty feet above the ledge sleeves spread and wedged in cracks they cant see through unless the clouds break he scrambled back and helped rafik then willametta then amnon place rocks to display flamecolored ponchos and shorts against dark wet rock the others were getting the idea andrew was painting a picture of climbers scattered over a cliff face were halfway up and frozen in fear right and thats the way it is until they get here themselves and look right andrew jemmy asked do you think they can see us andrews teeth flashed in lightning not yet all set come andrew theres too many andrew looked at him and jemmy shouted me im one too many theyre looking for thirteen ponchos not fourteen and if we meet a spectre or something someone has to pose and after they found shar theyd be looking for twelve ponchos not thirteen still one too many unless shar talked andrew said one of us should have started naked damndamn ansel you look cold ansel tarr dressed again in flame colors jemmy looked arouhd at them willya he gave her shars swim shorts and windbreaker she looked no more skeletal than the rest andrew led off again leaving twelve posed ponchos the ledge was straight hard to lose in the flashing dark but it wasnt a split in rock it was a frozen flow of lava naked of plants and slippery there were holes etched by rain for handholds and footholds jemmy stayed on hands and knees even where he could stand because those behind him were copying his style jemmy henry andrew willametta barda and amnon wore swim trunks and windbreakers ansel wore the last poncho the rest were naked and not liking it he barely heard the scream but he turned quick and shouted down who fell he heard i caught something caught a plant amnons voice thorn can you climb up oh earth and moon amnon was in a windbreaker and trunks if proles found those on a gatherers corpse theyd guess there were more i cant move its like two handfuls of hypo needles ive got rope jeremy andrew hurled a coil of rope at him he leered atjemmy and said anchor me plan wheres your rope jemmy tied the rope to a low knotted destiny tree he could hear amnon whimpering the rope didnt seem to be finding him the sky lit like a sun it hurt the eyes like the light that burned over the speckles field after shimons death jemmy blinked what on earth quicksilverrr andrews bellow was all triumph he trolled the rope toward amnon who was clinging to a double armful of thorn on a sixtydegree slope the rope was too short jeremy it was long enough when jemmy had untied it from the tree but the only anchor now was himself and andrew amnon didnt want to let go of the bush andrew shouted take it you damned fool amnon moaned and snatched at the rope lost his grip and had only the rope he clung and swung while andrew and jemmy pulled hand over hand at the end he lay sobbing at their feet his hands full of needles and blood and jemmy asked again the light its quicksilver you crabshy dropout and the date is late summer and quicksilver rises just an hour before sunrise and we are right on schedule jeremy but we should move quicksilvers bright but this bright settler magic thats what you call it isnt it argos flew past quicksilver they dropped a metal and plastic turtleive seen picturesit makes solarelectric plates and lasers to beam the power and more little mining turtles now its hundreds of years later and quicksilvers covered in solar collectors thats why its so bright an entire planet covered in begley cloth jemmy began to understand that destinytown had power undreamed by the towns along the crab they could light up a mountain range launch ships into space andrew had known did they all know did they all take this for granted lightning flickered dimly against a sky like a hazy noon the rock slope was etched in detail it looked to be four hundred meters to the ridge and there that crack might be a way up buttheyre looking at us how amnon got your nerve back ready to move dammit andrew how are they watching us from the sky light like this had burned behind them this afternoon lighting the proles investigation of shimons death the others gathered around andrew and jemmy and amnon andrew said all right jeremy but we dont have forever now that light isnt for us theyre looking for firebird ponchosansel get that off now ball it up and hide itand those are uproad theyre looking through videoyou understand video cameras in spiral town we still have a few that work video from orbit so they cant see us unless the clouds break but theres a way to split light into colors theyll look for firebird colors theyll match every firebird in the area but firebirds dont gather the way our ponchos are gathered willametta said andrew the lights on us it isnt on the ponchos cant you see the mountains lit up all around us but it fades going back toward the barracks fades toward the fields too the others murmured jemmy saw that she was right but andrew said youre imagining that why would they be looking at us i thought they might be focusing on this jemmy held up the prole gun why but willametta asked jeremy how long has that light been blinking a blinking green light in the butt of the gun jemmy said its been doing that all along why because they wouldnt want a gun like this wandering loose if theyve got phones prole guns dont blink when were harvesting they didnt blink after the proles shot the birds willametta said andrew when did it start blinking after you killed a prole for it maybe damndamndamn its sending a help call isnt it willya throw it away andrew daaamn damn jeremy do it jemmy hurled the evil thing back the way theyd come it flew not far struck bare rock and spun away downhill andrew screamed at the sky andrew climbed as if possessed this part of the range was new to them all the plants were gone it was naked rock in the weird light they could see him far above while jemmy moved about helping the slower climbers and the ones who froze in fear dennis levoy was sliding hed lost the crack they were following it was out of his reach now and he couldnt even scream jemmy scrambled down to reach him but dennis was sliding faster now still silent naked against a slick slope that wouldnt hold him in the acid light jemmy saw henry flatten himself to avoid being knocked off dennis bounced against him and snatched at henrys ankle henry kicked him free he was falling falling gone dennis had been naked jemmy felt shamed that hed thought to look but he looked around and ticked them off his own and five other sets of windbreakers and shorts all climbing well a rift in the blazing clouds showed as a black canyon and a terrible light within blinded they froze against the hillside under a blazing eye in a black sky the rift closed before they moved again as they climbed the light crawled away from them back toward the firebird ponchos andrew was coming back down not this way stop them he edged sideways along the hillside and tried another path jemmy got the rest of them to where they could cling and they waited until andrew shouted now the sky blazed uproad above the ponchos theyd left behind lighting them until proles could come to see what they were that ought to take hours the windfarms felons climbed in the fringes of the light with no firebird colors to mark them the bulge of the hill hid further heights the crest receded like dreams jemmy tried to count heads ten plus his own plus andrew should be twelve he waited and presently heard sobbing ansel tarr sixteen and skinny and shivering in the rain jemmy doubled back cursing the slope hed have to climb twice and guided ansels hands and feet until theyd found the next split in the rock the next man he had to help was andrew andrew had spent the last day and night exploring preparing it wasnt surprising that he was exhausted his glare of hate was hard to take jemmy tied the rope under andrews shoulders then his own waist and climbed they found a flat spot and stood and looked about beyond was down they could hear the whoops of the gatherers receding ahead of them only barda and willametta and amnon had waited they chattered as they flowed downhill they had their wind back blazing clouds lit the way there was valley below and behind it another ridge the slopes were steep with a tangle of black and bronze and yellow at the bottom and a glitter shining through a glitter of water not road jemmy thought he didnt see any easy way to cross thats not the road henry said critically andrew snarled barda if we follow the valley far enough we have to hit the road well be moving toward the neck barda didnt answer willya okay andrew led off the bottom of the valley was all water and mud and destiny thorn they crawled along the slope at the frost line they were picking up stones and branches for weapons even before they saw the birds two they plunged out of the bush uphill silent aimed like darts just beyond stones throw they stopped suddenly wings braked against the air turned and plunged back we must stink of alien blood rafik said andrew said keep the clubs oh man i miss the prole gun he glared at jemmy jemmy said i should have given it to you and made you carry it carry it but oh you bastard carry it back to where we left the ponchos and then throw it away that would have fixed you andrew was laughing much against his will no birdfucking allowed its the law shouted half a dozen voices the line straggled to a halt the valley ended in a dome of gray lava or began there it appeared theyd been moving upstream jemmy asked andrew anyone what makes tubes tubes jemmy pointed across at the opposite slope lava had oozed out of destinys core to form a pillow of rock half a klick high a snake of gray rock flowed from it widening and narrowing in pulses a rounded break like a snakes mouth emitted a lesser tube like a snakes tongue and that grew larger until it did it again and that tube ran down into the thorn jemmy could see breaks where the tube had collapsed he said i hid out in one of those saved my life great how do we cross why bother henry said about now the proles are looking at what was it a dozen empty ponchos and theyre trying to think of someplace else to look and were all ready to collapse willametta said but weve got knives andrew well cut through barda passed out knives she had eight and andrew got one but she kept the biggest andrews opinion had not been asked they sawed their way through the weeds at the bottom of the valley wading through waistdeep water birds of all sizes fled in terror from twelve noisy alien lifeforms and a rich stench of human blood from cuts and scrapes and scratches they were well and truly exhausted by the time they reached the tube the sky went black the light had been glaring beyond the ridge over the valley theyd left behind for so many hours that at first jemmy couldnt understand what had changed but someone in the parole board must have guessed that fleeing felons might need light in a sputter of lightning they crawled into true dark the tube was big it might have held any kind of predator jemmy moved knifepointfirst ready to back up fast though he was third in line behind andrew and willametta it was a big tube as wide as two people wider in spots jemmy sprawled out and let himself fade let me out let me out far away and garbled and then a rustle barda anything wrong down there just denis losing his dinner the tube was quite smooth and comfortable barring a little rainwater in the bottom wind blew through the big holes and kept it from being stuffy thunder roared from time to time but hed grown used to that he could hear willametta and andrew making noisy love both wild with the taste of freedom their feet a meter from his head that was almost restful yet he couldnt sleep he heard henry ask plaintively did anyone see an earthlife bird wed have known barda three centimeters from jemmys feet henry id kill a prole for a duck ansel much closer theres good eatin on a prole is he right barda oh shut it henry even so you all listening weve gotto find earthlife food if we still look like a dozen ghouls the first time any citizen finds us thats kind of what i meant willametta from uptube barda tell us more about this inn were trying to get to wave rider we were going to call it my older brothers barry and bill and i went off with a gang of workmen from destiny town that left daddy with brian and carol we knew daddyd work them hard we hated to leave them the overview bureau used to be antsy about people messing with otterfolk but theyve loosened up some daddy got permission somehow we built not far from shore we brought a specialist to teach us how to deal with otterfolk for fish i dont think daddy could ever have loosened up enough you have to swim with them they like to play you like that barda it beats what else we were doing digging a foundation pouring stone we were starting to build the frame when daddy sent me off to romanoff the other best restaurant jeremy i grew up knowing how to cook the earthlife fish from swan lake but daddy thought seafood must be different and destiny seafood anyway i went wide wades school of de tiny biochemistry and cuisine is attached to romanoff the best students end up there and while i was at wide wades i got word that bill ran away with the money for the workmen daddy was in a rage and i was supposed to go back to the swan so i ran too and i never saw any of them ever again until the tribunal ive been in the swan duncan nicholls said no way said barda willametta asked voice raised to talk past jemmy barda how far away is this shoreline site you picked seventy klicks from destiny town where the road dips almost down to the water about that far from here i guess willya i dont know how much of it they built well theres ten of us and you tell us how to do it and jeremy can make us a pit barbecue if we can get there said a voice another told him to shut up jemmy stopped listening he was halfasleep and so were the rest of them and anyone still awake wouldnt be making sense he dozed the voices had all gone quiet all but its at swan lake between the road and the shore duncan daddy wouldnt let you in the swan barda scornful harold winslow he wasnt there who was nobody barda its just a shell they took out the ovens even and the chairs and tables i hid out in the swan while they were looking for me after you know howd they catch you got careless twice i mean i thought id hide out for a while and then hit the road with the money and settle down in terminus but i didnt think of speckles so i got specklesshy and careless and got caught fishing off the dock jemmy asked duncan do you have any idea where the winslow family went how would i well the proles might have said something nope barda it strikes me that maybe your daddy just left the swan and went off to finish wave rider silence jemmy asked who else would take the ovens is andrew awake i dont think so well tell him in the morning the ridges we could b ld clocks that keep a destiny calendar and destiny time but theres no point the spirals sell clocks by wagonloads and we all use them on arth its some slightly different date plus the lightspeed gap and that doesnt matter either hillary miller first mayor f terminus in the morning they crossed the ridge and found another valley they hacked and waded across and another behind the next ridge but cavorite must have seared and seeded this land they yelled like maniacs to see green trees and grass covering the slopes black and yellowgreen ran along the bottom destiny life seared away and then returned felons scattered to hunt andrew kept others to dig a pit with their hands and to cut destiny wood with kitchen knives jemmy bloocher and barda winslow fought sporadic flurries of rain to make fire before night fell they had cooked a pig four rabbits a small bird ansel caught by leaping at it and a mans weight of green bananas gorged stupid the dozen escapees lay on a sloping hill and looked at each other andrew dowd said it can work someone was talking about staying here jemmy could have slept through that if andrew hadnt begun shouting where will the parole board look first where more speckles crazy bastard had a plan he tried to ignore the sounds but now ansel was shouting back not forever we stay here till the board gets bored looking for us andrew i know where the caravan is now when they get to the swan weve got to be ready merchants wont wait if we settle here the board will quit after a month they dont know weve got a speckles stash speckles rots what what are you saying barda ansel speckles gets a splash of radiation before it goes on the road they do it in the parole board complex didnt you know you planned this knowing wait a minute andrew how long does speckles last if nobody zaps it no idea you dont even know its to preserve the speckles do you it might be they dont want fertile seeds getting out thats birdfucking crazy who died and made you prole shut up shut your face or ill turn it inside out for you barda was on andrews arm whispering while willametta stalked off in a rage jemmy spoke as she passed willya she dropped beside him she said theyre all crazy jemmy said sure andrew too idiot if hed just let them talk he still thinks hes a trusty willya whats your take on this jeremy jemmy said we had a plan then we had another plan plans are cheap ive thrown away a lot of plans i like his arm swept about himself this we can hunt youd stay the ragged clouds permitted glimpses of stars but it was too dark to see more than shadows she moved closer to see his face no i mean we can keep a restaurant supplied if they seared this valley cavorite must have seared and seeded every valley between here and the road theyre all ready to be hunted i saw ah relieved she nestled against him he asked does andrew too many men not enough women and a woman who gets pregnant goes free any man who tries to hold on to a woman gets taught different unless hes a trusty by that time he knows somehow theyd come to be lying side by side their backs against the long damp grass willametta said i havent seen stars in two years me well days be a restaurant it sounded crazy when you said it caravans build a new restaurant every evet iing and i was the one who did the building when i see the swan ill tell you what i think maybe its fallen down what do we do then i cant stop until ive seen destiny town she sat up abruptly crab shies arent allowed on the mainland she said you know better than to go into town without an identity jeremy crab shies how would i pick up an identity what identity i mean with this accent you could be a merchant child jemmy chewed that hed have learned the crab accent while traveling with the caravan wait willya there werent any children on the caravans no jeremy if a merchant gets pregnant on the road shes bound to be home before she has the baby then what are we talking about well merchant men make children along the road too the children stay where theyre born unless something happens you could have been picked up at two or three years old that ever happen it sounded like a childrens story ask duncan nick nicholls duncan doesnt have any accent he lost it she rolled over onto him you going to talk all night he did wonder afterward why he had been so favored but willya her breath easing whispered what did you see when you said he remembered and smiled i saw green beans growing up cornstalks over most of a hillside but theyre not ripe yet in a few months well get our veggies here too ive been looking for potatoes we can bake bananas at dawn the felons were all over the place andrew whistled to gather them up winnie was talking to barda low and fast barda listened then summoned andrew the rest straggled in winnie looked exhausted already and two were still missing ansel tarr and asham mandala andrew looked like bloody murder this would be easier jemmy thought if he had bread to offer instead of leftover pork he said theyll catch up once were on the ridge theyll see us being seen from the sky is the problem always ready to spot the problem arent we jemmy mmm what am i missing barda said tell him winnie the slender dark woman spoke in a fast monotone they wanted me to go with them asham had my arms but i bit ansels hand and started screaming i think i kicked him a good one too and i pulled loose they wanted me to stop yelling and let them go and i saw asham had one of the knives so i just ran back here but theyre gone and you didnt tell me andrew said venomously we cant wait barda said barda theyve deserted me andrew and barda were still keeping their voices down though amnon and henry had moved into earshot jemmy risked saying some of us still think youre the trusties you know and some of us have noticed that there arent any proles to say so andrew when you tell all of us to stop talking about anything but the plan who is it that stops talking just the ones who say youre right right your point keep us talking or youll lose more andrew sighed but if i let these birdfuckers go did they get our speckles stash what turn around jemmy turned andrew opened jemmys pack and looked in still there wait he fished the bag out opened it looked sniffed still there what are you playing at did you think they could get it away from you it was the only thing they could take thats worth anything and they dont have it let them go no henry said we cant catch them earths sake would you have chased them in the dark when they do show up in a few days speckle sshy and begging for their brains back theyll be a horrible example andrew snorted barda said well be restaurateurs by then theyll have to be hidden fast jemmy saw andrew bite back his answer killed were planning a charade and a specklesshy might blurt out something deadly jemmy looked for alternatives and andrew saw his nod ten were left over the ridge was another valley destiny rife along the bottom earthlife running up the slopes birds that hovered like hawks the sky was tattered clouds and fluttery winds that would not support heavy destiny birds those birds must be earthlife ten felons hunted and feasted on burrowing creatures it seemed strange to be eating at noon merchants and yutzes didnt do that either their intestines had forgotten about meat and some were having trouble they talked as they lay about the slopes and continued as they moved on i signed a contract i shouldnt have andrew dowd said he was walking off his anger he walked fast and jemmy matched his pace just to see if he could didnt you say you were being robbed robbed yeah they were my partners i had the idea they were holding you at gunpoint andrew only grinned over his shoulder but hed certainly implied were they trying to kill you the courts are screwy jeremy i wasnt sure id get justice jemmy dropped back by a little andrew was halfsmart and dangerous and maybe his own record was no better i dont remember any of it duncan nick told jemmy my mother got killed when someone got careless with a weed cutter my aunt and uncle they already had marie now momma was dead and suddenly theyve got four and i didnt look like the others daddy already knew about me when the summer caravan came by he took me carnot wagon maria wasnt any too pleased jemmy guessed your stepmother my older sister is that when you saw mount canaveral oh i wasnt much past two funny i remember anything at all but i saw mount canaveral when some of us went swimming and fishing at swan lake years later winslows chased us off so the restaurant was still going then i was only thirteen duncan looked around him barda winslow was trailing well out of earshot so me and my two friends we went back to the swan six years later but it was empty so we went through three of the big houses on the nob and hid out in the swan i suppose youd think i was crazy a crab shy forgetting about speckles i cant imagine it but i grew up here hereabouts not just in destiny town but everywhere speckles is free we dont need much earthlife animals have nerves too you know so hey willya what you told me once why is it that we dont have to worry so much about speckles the earthlife and destiny life grow together yes jemmy these valleys are all earthlife and destiny mixed its like that around destiny town too earthlife animals learn to eat destiny plants that secrete potassium the ones that dont get stupid and die the crab isnt like that nothings like that unless its near the winds see the potassium has to be there willya how did caravans get started dont know lucky for the crab shies though eh barda thought it over while she walked i know some of whats in the lessons she said a little daddy didnt give us much time to learn but youve got tapes and computers like in spiral town sure you cant get to them though theyre in the libraries and you dont have identification the caravans they keep the crab shies going why jeremy youre one yourself i know but why when there were only two hundred of the first settlers and another fifty children why not move us then barda walked silent for a bit then hell why not i never thought of that but the stories shed trailed off oddly jemmy asked what do they say about us you had to be fed by hand you were meaner than snakesi mean your ancestors of course couldnt move you then i guess and they tried speckles on a few of you and you must have brightened up jemmy i guess they got tired of you specklesshy two hundred adultsized angry infants who had to be fed clothed washed toilettrained the lucky ones who recovered would be more or less ambulatory but no damn use to anyone transplanting two hundred jael harnesses would be a nightmare jemmy was he discovered crying destiny town had the planets and spiral town was left to savagery he dropped back so that barda wouldnt see tears and he said without speckles we would have died they must have brought speckles they could watch us getting well why not move us then now they have to keep bringing us speckles barda shook her head its stranger than you think you talked to duncan yeah there were only forty in cavorite right and two died early now its two hundred years later and the merchant women almost always get pregnant on the road and the men leave children too they do it to keep the gene mix but why go so far you tell me now jemmy could picture the settling mass of extruded mountains pushing the flat land away until from the sky it would seem to run in parallel wrinkles they crossed wrinkle after endless wrinkle at evening they crossed another ridge and the road was below heads lined up along the edge of rock showing nothing more of themselves looking down there was nobody on the road it was another valley another wrinkle with another ridge beyond the road was one edge of a fastmoving stream lined with earthgreen bushes jemmys view to the right showed no more than road and river running on dipping and reappearing finally curving out of sight left the ridge ran two or three klicks and then splayed out into a flattopped peak andrew whispered where are we barda is that canaveral ive seen pictures not from this angle its mount canaveral duncan nick said the restaurant was just past it must be half a klick this side just around that curve the lake too they spoke without looking at each other their eyes on the road andrew said an hours walk and its getting dark damn if anyone saw ten of us sneaking up on an empty building okay the rest of you wait here stay the night barda its you and me whatever we find down there youre the owner or the owners daughter im your husbandor not yet not yet she decided lovers but i want daddys approval you want to meet my parents and it has you a little scared what if theyre not there and someone else is do i threaten to call the police for earths sake dont lose your cool until ido barda hissed okay were too far from anyone else daddy kept guns if its daddy keep your cool ready his better judgment told him to be quiet but jemmy said not you andrew andrew turned jemmy said dont take it wrong but you look as crazy as a pigeon in a fool cage grow some meat over your cheekbones soften those eye sockets you could pass not now id say duncan hes gaunt but at least he knows the swan barda winslow looked at the men and women lined up along the rock crest they waited her judgment she said you jemmy there was nobody in sight they scrambled down to the road jemmy looked at the fastmoving water he asked can you swim theres a bridge now we just walk right a little tired weve been swimming where are our towels in the pack good now you might see a bus go by bus if you see a box full of people being pulled by a tug and theyre looking out the windows at you just look back ill wave it on tug tractor pulling machine you see them a lot back at the windfarm that was a tug pulling the speckles cart oh that was a tug a flat metal thing that hugs the ground hip high the top is begley cloth barda nodded the light had faded to a silver circle above the west quicksilver light blurred by haze the bridge was wood it wasnt in good shape with only one handrail and it shook as they crossed the swan loomed a lightless shadow against a hillside twice the size of bloocher farm brendas jittery voice led him toward it that bridge will need some serious repair place hasnt collapsed good what do you think go in the front is there a bell bloocher farm had a bell the front door was twice a mans height barda waved her arms about the bell ropes gone i think daddys gone too and he took the bell daddy its barda they listened barda whispered no lights the sign is out you dont close an inn at night you just charge higher if they wake you up daddy its barda ive brought a a nice hesitation friend nothing barda pulled and pushed the door locked come on around the kitchen door was lower and wider wide enough to pass a cart barda pulled and it swung open the locks broken jemmy suggested duncan sure well come in here she hooked her fingers into his waistband and led him there was nothing else to guide him but barda moved by memory and scent not even nightlights daddy must have taken the guide spot with him kitchen she said and he smelled old food smells and smoke dining hall wow he took the tables and chairs too and the carts stairs here watch it there was a banister stay along the wall and these were the guest rooms sounds good to me but she kept moving down to the end and another flight of stairs then a strange smell flowerymy room watch your feet hed kicked something whats that dont know clutter well have to sleep on the floor no wind no rain and they left us a rug i like it the swan quicksilvers year runs three months and a bit it rises as much as an hour before sunrise or sets up to an hour after sunset as bright as mercury from barth i miss the moon henry judd planetologist andrew hailed him from the crest jemmy stopped on the bridge and waited while andrew bounded down we tracked you he said thought you might need help and we watched a bus go past the others were already climbing down three more in windbreakers followed by four scrambling down in naked haste exposed in brilliant sunlight become a restaurant were kidding ourselves hows it look lot of work jemmy said i dont see everything barda says needs doing but theres a lot by morning the damage was easier to see the bridge might have been a century old it was new enough that big trees had been cut to build it on earth there had certainly been lifeforms that ate wood but here it would last forever the wood was sound and thick and moored in poured stone sturdy enough to support a caravan it sagged in the middle water had poured over it in a spring storm or several and taken the handrail and some paint patches of paint lined the edges still glarebright needs propping andrew said one big beam right in the middle a wide sheet of clear glass wrapped the front of the inn in a halfcylinder framing the dining area several smaller windows were broken the bed left behind in the captains suite would have been too big to move they could clean up the captains suite for display the thick rug in bardas room would be bed for them all and of course the sign is out andrew said there were outhouse toilets the one with a womans silhouette stank these have to be dug out barda said daddy must have just let the ferns go a much bigger outbuilding was barred from the inside barda showed them how to slide a sawblade through the crack and lift the bar daddy thought this would keep us out but my brother barry figured it out daddys hiding place right she opened the door and yelped in delight harold winslow hadnt taken everything they wandered through the place as if entering an ancient texas politicians treasure trove there were tools no little stuff and nothing powered but they put amnon into the big set of coveralls and gave his trunks and windbreaker to rafik doe rafik claimed a long vicious weed cutter then reluctantly traded it to andrew for one of the shovels amnon took the other there was a roll of cloth a tablecloth with the logo of the swan a fluffy white bird sailing a pond that reflected the blue sky blue and green and pure white andrews weed cutter sliced it into broad strips loincloths for the nudes clothing at last they looked at half a dozen fragile wands as tall as a man barda wondered now why didnt daddy take these jemmy said ive never seen anything like them a breath would have broken them fishing rods rafik said not for ocean fishing jemmy told them barda you dealt with the otterfolk your daddy wouldnt throw a hook into somebodys dining room daddy might rafik and arnnon dug a pit then six men picked up the old outhouse hoarding their breath and moved it to the new pit they were all wolfishly hungry by midafternoon and barda was trying to get them to dig out the other outhouse jemmy got her attention pit fire hunt cook he said now we can lose a meal jeremy thats not it though he was getting hungry willya henry give me a sanity check here the day anyone sees this restaurant going weve been here for half a year yes jemmy waved at a flat patch of ground just look at our fire pit sir we cleaned it out last week and its already full of ashes we were so busy two days ago its no wonder weve run out ofafew things he saw a few grins and persisted but we dont have a fire pit what if someone comes by today no chairs either no tables no silverware barda said start a list we dont need silverware no forks at a caravan stop barda everyone carries his own knife andrew asked what about the buses barda waved it off a bus ride costs money people dont take them very often so theres a restaurant here last time anyone went past he didnt notice jemmy two months weve been here fine but ive got to teach you people how to cook the nudes had skirts and or loincloths now but that wasnt quite like being clothed it seemed best to send them off to hunt and keep the others for digging they dug a fire pit long enough to feed ten extend it tomorrow the mens ancient outhouse could imply an ancient restaurant so that could wait the fems had been too rank barda showed them where the truck garden had been and sure enough potatoes and carrots were growing in a maze of weeds that had been spices the patch was clean of destiny life they watched barda choosing spices for dinner the rest got bored and wandered away but jemmy stayed and made her identify every spice for him he waited until they were alone before he asked barda isnt this a graveyard sure three generations of winslows it must have halfkilled your father to move she looked up one day ill have to ask him heya jemmy if i said no birdfucking allowed do you think hed answer he might know maybe the proles caught your brother its the law barda stood and dusted herself off that should do it she left carrying spices in her rolledup windbreaker when she was gone jemmy reached into his pack the hunters returned at dusk with something piglike still alive and struggling they left it tied up and settled for root vegetables cant cook in the dark in the morning jemmy and a few others built up the fire and killed and roasted the nonpig they got a cheer from the late risers afterward they extended the fire pit into an arc seven meters long the men got tired of sharing their outhouse they dug another pit and moved the mens outhouse to that well call this place the pits jemmy suggested they jeered him he took men uphill to collect rocks a roadside caravan stop had to have an oven hed walk the road and look for grain and find a way to grind it if that birdfucker harold winslow had only left some pots they could have set a stew going there were flowerpots in the toolhouse but no passerby would accept those as cookware they cleaned the long hall and the first pair of rooms leading off it and the captains suite on bardas insistence they cleaned the suite of rooms at the end too because someone might want it there were indoor toilets and old signs on the doors that said out of order these have been down since i was a little girl daddy got tired of digging up the pipes or else he ran out of money barda said theres a destiny plant that just loves to block pipes in bardas old room were chairs and a desk they took the chairs down to the dining area the desk was too big looking up at the inn you could see through the picture window but you saw only ceiling so it didnt matter that the place was an echoing emptiness daddy took all the curtains barda told them they should be there if you dont close them the sun can fry the diners andrew shrugged we just dont let anyone in might work but the windows filthy there was soap but no rags they cleaned the picture window with their swim shorts amid considerable horseplay then used more soap to get the shorts clean the shorts came out of that amazingly well settler magic some machine in spiral town some relic of argos and sol system must have continued making clothing after carders boat stopped moving jemmy found a tree big enough to serve as a centerpost for the bridge that could wait they found endless useless junk accumulated in the dining hall and moved that out and made brooms and swept the place out but there were no tables and no chairs bardas list was growing i really wish we had any kind of money nobody in his right mind would start an inn without funds as long as it doesnt rain jemmy said what well drag some logs down here for seats it took them all the next day they chopped down trees split the logs set them around the firepit arc and adzed them flat on top it felt decidedly fancy a sanitized wimpy mockup of a roadside caravan stop when they dined around the coals that night napkins said barda it doesnt work without napkins clean napkins there was no light but the coals and briefly quicksilver they felt their way to their beds but in the morning jemmy got barda to show him the list poured stoneslo tonnes glass panes silverware paint chairs up to tables up to line wire soap curtains advertising napkins paper week or napkins cloth logo washer cookware stew pots teapot tea im guessing at the cost most of the time even so some of this doesnt cost much cloth napkins we dont need to buy a washer if one of us will wash them out five days after their arrival the pits was starting to look more like the picture in bardas mind the felons too were starting to look less gaunt less pale too a day of sporadic sunlight wouldnt give anyone a sunburn but they no longer looked like theyd been living under an endless black thunderstorm of course they were too many and three were in kilts chopped from a tablecloth and if jemmy bloocher had thought of robbing their first customers for their clothes and never mind the friends and relatives and proles who might come looking for them then nine people who had been imprisoned for violent crimes would all have thought of the same thing something had better be done about clotljes buses passed twice a day on the fifth evening they sat around the fire pit and spoke their plans its a wonder nobodys ever tried this before barda caroled it could work unless it rains was she fooling herself nobody could see the flaws in the inn as well as barda not even jemmy who still saw only a mask over chaos andrew asked what else do we need to be a restaurant barda said well the sign of course jemmy asked paint she laughed paint no we have to turn the sign on like the windfarm barracks sign we need lights too jemmy theres a way out to the roof but its blocked can you climb up there the roof was three stories up nobody but jemmy wanted to climb it but it wasnt difficult he found a weathered and muddy elegance he called down barda three tables twelve chairs you didnt say it was a dining area we never got crowded enough to use it thats why daddy closed it off i dont see how to get them down well get the door unblocked barda i can see the door its barred on this side what really whoever did it must have climbed down afterward brian he wouldve and then daddy never got around to unblocking it jemmy lifted the bar away and tried to pull the door open stuck there was no chimney from this height you could see well you could see enough road from here to prepare for visitors get the nudes under cover and put amnon on display in his coveralls from the roofs back edge through a notch in the ridge water gleamed through a fringe of slender straight earthlife trees swan lake he called down still there barda im thinking if a client never sees us except in swimsuits and windbreakers we have to serve fish daddy left because swan lake was fished out worth a try barda youve got electric power beneath a surface of accumulated dirt he was standing on a dark silvergray surface did something light up no i only mean half the roof is begley cloth of course hows it look its covered with goo well have to clean it off and theres a metal structure as high as his head was sited on the silvergray surface where the sharp corner of the restaurant pointed toward the road like the prow of a boat jemmy thought he put his hand on the stained metal casing and asked what is this whats it look like casing out of a foundry it looks like an open hand round base splayed fingers antenna i can open it the inside looks like settler magic is this your sign its the sign and the lights and anything else that takes power see if theres anything missing oh come on barda ive never seen anything like this all right heres a slot like it takes a great big threepronged key fuck my bird im coming up so amnon pushed the door open and they all trouped out on the roof to see what everyone except jemmy knew all about they hovered around barda while she opened the shell and looked in she said he took it with him it birdfucker andrew said it isnt as if we could go off to town and open another account that birdfucking list is getting big barda said andrew whose name would we use not mine andrew laughed were all wanted felons except jeremy jeremy doesnt have a name well without a guide spot we dont have a sign and without a sign we dont have an inn guildas place in spiral town had never needed anything but paint jemmy asked guide spot he wasnt heard maybe i can rig something duncan nick said barda made way for him the shell opened at the edge of the roof two could look inside no more i was up here before but i did not want lights duncan said mmm let me see but winnie maclean wasnt heard either and she wasnt strong enough to push her way in sojemmy asked her guide spot it sends back a reflection winnie said the power beam from quicksilver goes to four orbiting relays the relays flash a beam and all the guide spots flash back then the beams focus on all the guide spots its a frequency begley cloth can turn into power but you buy your guide spot from city hall and then youre in the records and city hall keeps track of how much power you use so theres a record in a city computer and it says this is the swan said denis but these things can be hacked barda edged away from the power collector so that others could look it over duncans and deniss heads and shoulders disappeared inside the winslows must have retired the account when they moved winnie said barda laughed suddenly not daddy all the way to destiny town when hes going the other way i bet he just took the guide spot along and bought someone elses power collector most of this was beyond him but jemmy caught that datum as it went by you mean the city thinks hes still the swan im guessing you know so if you got it going again i worked for a power company winnie said let me try the city would just see the swan using more power your daddy would pay a bigger fee would he notice oh sure and complain but couldnt complain to the city could he they like things neat in the city if he didnt switch accounts duncan nick moved out its hopeless he said i could make it work if i had some numberfour line wire winnie moved in beside denis they whispered crypticisms their heads hidden dont need number four any gauge line wire isnt that what they use to wire a kitchen no its thinner watching them wasnt very interesting they werent doing anything the men picked up chairs and tables and wrestled them inside and downstairs and into the main dining room there were chickens in the woods they were fast hard to catch but on the fifth day winnie found four nests scrambled eggs for all cooked in the pottery pots on the seventh morning willametta saw the bus stop and let people off blind luck that she happened to be looking through the picture window andrew had set a guard but he hadnt been taken seriously two men two women walked across the bridge carrying fishing poles willametta moved about the house whispering the news nudes to the upstairs rooms amnon to work the garden the strangers were in their teens they wore tiny swimsuits and skimpy vests with lots of pockets what they saw was amnon in coveralls and four older folk in outofdate shortsleeved windbreakers carrying poles jemmy was one of those yes were reopening the restaurant just for dinner wed be happy if youd pass the word what have you got for breakfast we dont have flour yet cold chicken tea they turned that down one man said you should open for breakfast too they come to swan lake to fish you know and this is the only way in cook their fish for them in the evening amnon stayed jemmy took the rest to the lake behind him he sensed frantic action held leashed at the shore they separated the inlet to swan lake was easy to wade jemmy tried to keep an eye on the little group on the far shore but they werent spending all their time fishing they let a little tent inflate and spent some of their time in there they went exploring through the trees earthlife bushes and grass and trees earthlife fish before noon the felons had caught two dozen fish of three varieties none of which jemmy recognized it made sense to go home then and they did jemmy dreaded that andrew would see what he saw four teens on foot who might have disappeared anywhere between here and the city with clothes on their backs in current styles and money in their pockets but he couldnt stay to protect them they returned to a great light above the restaurants roof a flame rose and fluttered in the shape of a swan jemmy was relieved to see andrew grinning up into the lighted dininghall windows he lofted a mess of fish and got a nod he asked how did you do it i dont know winnie and denis pulled a nest of line wire out of the ceiling in one of the rooms you know what that is a thread of superconductor in a rubber tube theyd have been electrocuted if the roof was clean i think nothing worked till they found some silver thing barda hid in her room and pounded it into shape but he waved they got it going shouldnt we turn it off or are we open were open lets see well keep that room locked and clean up the roof so we get more power all the lights are way too dim but you jemmy you get a pit fire going when those kids come back we want to cook their fish for them and show somebody how to clean fish henry the visitors stayed for dinner jemmy was a chef on display with a road accent selfconsciously not a spiral town accent and my merchant father picked me up from the dairy when i was a little boy what the swan lacked became much clearer bread potatoes lettuce theyd have asked for a room until barda told them there werent any working toilets then they opted for their tent by the lake then they tried to pay the chef you pay barda she prefers to keep track jemmy sneaked a peek at destiny town money before they turned away it was a hologram imposed onto thin paper barda took their money they climbed uphill with swanlight behind them and barda gave him an intensive course in how to identify count and change money before she let him go to bed the last climb we were chosen for genetic disparity now our numbers are down by onethird and were scattered from base one to the wi d how are we going to avoid gene drift grigori dudayev senior m d next morning was a bleeryeyed scramble they didnt have to look like a restaurant as long as they didnt look like a prison camp four visitors would be returning through here any minute now they appeared near noon theyd stayed to fish up a breakfast jemmy guessed right he had coals going and hed saved a dozen of winnies eggs and several big mushroom caps the fishers wanted tea and were mildly put off because it was herb tea licorice picked from the spice patch there was of course no bread admitting that was embarrassing after they were gone rafik told barda you could have charged them more theyll talk we want customers barda said what is an inn with no guests a birdfucking halfway house jemmy asked rafik how much wholewheat flour would that buy sack and a half last nights take would buy five or six but we could have charged more rafik said and andrews face was growing red with his laughter it was a trivial sum of course bardas list had grown one full set f decent clothing poured stone tonnes glass panes flour silverware paint chairs up to tables up to soap curtains advertising napkins lth washer cookware stew pots teapot butchers table or make one tea guide spot and power account line wire when jemmy went to fetch wood for the pit andrew was there i found grain he said what you mean before we crossed the last ridge well yes in that last valley but not where you were we followed you on the ridge just before the sun came up i was looking back it was all yellow earthlife yellow its not far from the swan i can show you what kind of grain two or three kinds i went back to check day before yesterday grain why would the settlers bring anything that looks that much like wheat and isnt jemmy thought it over while he and andrew collected deadwood theyd been here nine days and they hadnt had to chop down trees for firewood but the day would come he said then all we need is a mill ill show you next time i go out you want to come andrew moved off dragging a log there was just too much wrong with that grain right bardas daddy or his daddy or his would have planted wheat and rye around the swan but it was a great find why wasnt andrew taking the credit in his usual booming voice or demanding some favor in return and when had he had the chance to check it out he found willametta on the hill above the swan willya did you see any grain hereabouts before you got to the inn willametta looked around her windbreaker had become a bag for onions and mushrooms i didnt did andrew no why any idea where duncans got to shed seen his worry its all going fine isnt it why are you turning weird now i havent seen duncan nick since breakfast maybe i started weird how would you like to go to destiny town what somebody has to buy stuff it sure isnt me not with this accent she smiled i guess i could stay out of trouble do i look like a living woman now close lets test that he took the bag shed made of her windbreaker and set it down jeremy destiny people wont see this much of me speaking for the felons assembled were relieved to hear it conversation deteriorated winnie looked into the wood grinned at them and passed on then dashed back scooped up willamettas windbreaker and ran away laughing they were in no condition to chase her down too many of them had spent too much of the day arguing possibilities nevertheless the arguments had culled bardas list into what they needed most that cost least by the red light of evenings coals it had all evolved into a plan someone was going to have to go into town at some point that person had become andrew he was going alone you were right jeremy one of us is just skinny two together look like walking dead our bones arent showing through so much now jemmy agreed you can pass most of us could but not you youd make a mistake not barda either barda the places that sell supplies for an inn would all know your face barda grinned theyd all tell me how wonderful i look all that lost weight she looked down at her windbreaker it was too dark to see food stains but she said id kill a prole for a stack of napkins how high felons were tottering off to their beds duncan nick wasnt among them duncan hadnt come to dinner jemmy hadnt seen him since breakfast it bothered him most because hed been expecting it andrew said come with me at dawn ill show you where the grain is hed been expecting that too not dawn jemmy said ill clean up from dinner and set up breakfast first ill start after that and catch up they went into the inn they left the hall lights on all the time now unbelievable luxury and spiral town saw none of it felons and merchants took it for granted and nobody wondered why nobody but jemmy bloocher the ninth day had a lid of dark clouds jemmy watched andrew leave his pack looked heavy jemmy waved but there were things he had to do before he set off after andrew cleaning out the pit wasnt one those ashes would get to be too much of a good thing but for now they were authentication of the restaurants age there were squirrels and songbirds about they did some of the cleaning up of spilled food when jemmy amnon and winnie finished the job they left scraps in the wood curious looks followed his departure his pack was light hed hidden the gatherings trove of speckles he didnt want to be carrying that down the road he crossed the bridge and moved immediately to the center of the road the river ran on his right chuckling unseen jemmy moved briefly to its edge a curve of melted rock flowing straight down into rushing water he moved back to center hed considered climbing to the ridge but that would have slowed him and he could be overreacting seeing murder in every face willametta was no creature of evil she would have been free of the windfarm in less than a year shed followed andrew for love it seemed and winnies story told by others was that shed killed a man because it was the only way to be rid of him she had scars and broken bones to show for their time together and hed stalked her after she ran to destiny town maybe destiny justice would have imprisoned him maybe shed kill quicker next time a man gave her a hard time she was probably no threat to a man like jemmy barda would never do anything to hurt the swan but the windfarmers were felons duncan nick was legitimately a thief and doloress first impulse had been to use a prole gun on the toolshed and andrew dowd murder in every face the road straightened after a time now jemmy could see several klicks ahead though a dip hid part of it then he was over the dip watching andrew hike along the rivers edge now by a small blackbronze tree he stopped and looked down into the water then moved on jemmy followed andrew must have expected jemmy to start later he hadnt looked back jemmy lost him around a curve and couldnt see him when that stretch of road reappeared the road stayed a steady twentyfive meters wide with a jagged bluff on the left river and bluff on the right where hed seen andrew stop jemmy with his breath gone fast and the hairs rising on his neck edged to the water and looked down the rock was split a destiny fisher trees oversized roots were prying the rock apart jemmy moved back to center and after a moment kept walking left and ahead the red rock turned ragged and jagged a steep slope with deep cracks halffilled with loose landslideshattered rock okay jemmy called hoy andrew no answer came but jemmy turned in a quick circle and andrew was ten meters behind him laughing how on earth did you get past me dont know did you stop for lunch no a quick dip andrew strolled toward jemmy but his hair was dry and jemmy turned and ran straight at the red rock cliff finding andrew behind him had been a shock but hed already picked his path and he took it now straight up the cliff avoiding the loose rock he didnt look back until he reached a flat spot as wide as his foot andrew was just below him and climbing fast his pack swinging like something heavy and broken jemmy climbed breathing hard through a grin hed done this the whole length of the crab he could see his path and there wasnt any better on this stretch a hundred and twenty meters up the rock turned sheer he edged sideways toward a heap of shattered rock standing at a fortydegree slope he paused there to glance back andrew paused too blowing hard teeth showing in a laugh he shouted i thought you brought the lunch just a watermelon jemmy called hope you brought a knife you bet seen duncan lately lately yes andrew lunged toward him panting like a bellows now across red rock and onto red scree jemmy climbed with some care he thought he could climb faster than andrew but a slide would be bad might be bad for andrew too but the game was to live the peak of the rockslide was sheer again but for a notch of sorts a setting for his feet and a hold for his left hand jemmy set himself before he looked back andrew was far below and making little progress jemmy threw a rock at him then another and another without waiting they fell in front of andrew all three he wasnt throwing hard enough but his aim was good andrew screamed something foul fowl actually jemmy caught the echo jemmy screamed back its the law and he set himself and hurled andrew threw too but his rock fell far short his second throw started him sliding and he flattened himself against the scree and tried to stay there jemmys falling rock hit himsomewhereand so did the next and jemmy threw three more before he had to stop for breath andrew was sliding he couldnt stop jemmy hadnt planned on that by now andrew dowd might have come to believe the unbelievable that jemmy bloocher could beat him at climbing if the slide didnt kill him andrew would have a chance to rest to hide to run now and kill him later there was just no help for it jemmy spread himself as flat as possible and crawled backward down the scree andrew was out of sight he couldnt have edged off the scree though last time jemmy saw him those rocks were carrying him right to the bottom now jemmy edged off to the side onto solid rock and looked down andrew was far below jemmy began throwing andrew got a little farther but the rocks were hitting him and he had to strike back it was in his bones he scrambled backward and reached bottom in a near landslide crawled out from under braced himself against a rock projection and started throwing it was not a fair contest andrew gave up turned his face to the rock and took the hits and suddenly leapt up and threw three and curled up again jemmy with his arm hanging like a lead weight started down he hadnt picked the quickest path this time but the route that would keep andrew in sight wherever he could stop he threw a rock at the end he was walking toward andrew knowing that andrew would uncurl and charge him with that great weed cutter theyd found in the outbuilding he stopped out of knifes range and threw rocks from point blank until he knew that andrew was dead the weed cutter was under him the pack wasnt on him he pulled andrews body out of sight from the road rolled some rocks over it and left it there jemmy found the pack when hed nearly reached the road andrew hadnt tried to hide it he never expected jemmy to live to find it and hed wanted to be rid of the weight winnie and amnon were doing nothing much at the bridge jemmy stopped in the middle and spilled the pack in front of them winnie said yeep and covered her mouth amnon said what in isnt that andrews no birdfucking allowed its the law i thought youd better see this jemmy said i dont recognize most of it is this what i think it is he held up a stack of thin paper printed with holograms little windows into a composite view of sol system sun and planets and moons blazing against black its money winnie said jemmy fished among halffamiliar things a wide silver belt buckle handfuls of rings and ear crescents jeweled and elaborately shaped a tiny statue group old men and a kibbitzer around a chess set in inset jade a malachite cube whats this and this and this i never actually saw thats a phone and i think thats a book an old holy book and thats a lighter at a touch a point on the lighter turned white hot jemmy kept it all right we have to give the rest of this to barda will you come with me amnon said were supposed to be guarding ill stay winnie said you go amnon thats andrews pack amnon said jemmy repacked the pack holding out the malachite cube and two ear crescents he said not anymore andrew tried to kill me i won andrews dead jemmy looked at amnon he hadnt considered the big man a threat how do you feel about that amnon rubbed his jaw i guess we all knew hed try to kill you that stuff with the prole gun you won yeah winnie here he gave her the ear crescent and helped her fit it you shouldnt wear it much maybe not at all in destiny town they might know where it came from here well you know thank you she kissed him once upon a time twelve days ago amnon had handed a monstrous weapon back to jemmy and jemmy had to trust someone amnon i want to look uphill for something and then i want to talk to barda will you come im afraid to be alone jemmy stopped at the big outbuilding hed hidden the communal speckles and some personal stuff in the bushes around back he collected them now and picked up a shovel then up toward the lake the fresh new outhouses were closer to the inn than the old ones jemmy wondered if that was a mistake today they were conveniently close in a few years when they got ripe or when the pit began leaking into the groundwater and so his mind was led to the old outhouse middens here the mens now where had the ferns gotten to his nose led him to a patch of bare earth he called amnon did someone set you to filling this in amnon shook his head he was standing well back now who would have done hard labor here without first trying to get amnon to do it jemmy dug the smell drove amnon farther back he hadnt dug far when he uncovered a hand he cleared enough to find duncan nicks face the shovel set the head flopping loose amnon his throats cut take my word sure i want to cover this up and leave it alone at least till we talk to barda got a better idea want help no you do everything else around here he shoveled the dirt back not too deep now where was amnon standing well back maybe retching a little trying to ignore the whole scene stench and all jemmy stooped over his pack his back was to amnon he fished into the speckles bag and flung a handful of speckles over the mound closed the bag and swung the pack onto his shoulders in a smooth turn that brought amnon into view amnon had noticed nothing amnon he gave amnon the malachite cube you heard what i told winnie dont show it around okay what if i wanted the rest of whats in there jemmy laughed well youve already got a shovel you had to trust somebody barda was in the kitchen and every cabinet was open just wondering where to put things she said and looked around isnt that jemmy spilled the contents of the pack across the kitchen floor you tell me is that duncans loot she stared no birdfucking allowed its the law yes yes of course it must be that birdfucker must have hidden it here and then they took him off to the windfarm of course he wanted us back here with just the least of that we could have jemmy tell me what happened jemmy told it barda listened with a face like stone at one point she asked andrew just strolled toward you and you scrambled up a cliff i did but why i mean yes i remember you argued about the prole gun but we all stopped him killing the ones who wouldnt go jemmy what will we do without andrew barda wondered miserably she looked up sorry jemmy said heres how i saw it andrew cant kill the chef and still keep the swan going what would he have if he didnt have the swan he waved at the treasure heaped on the floor every time you cried about not having the money for something to make the swan a real inn i saw duncan nick not saying anything the rest of us all said something inane duncan nick and his friends with no names hid out here after they robbed some houses one of them might have it or your proles might have the loot or they gave it back to the owners or maybe duncan nick hid it at the swan and maybe duncan told you in private barda shook her head or told andrew then youd have money and wed all be set but that isnt what happened duncan took seven days to get himself a little less pale a little better fed now andrew knew duncan much better than i do if icould see all that andrew might just wait for duncan to grab the loot and run i saw duncan missing for a day i saw andrew set off for town to buy supplies theyd have to come back in his pack of course so why was his pack already full of heavy stuff and hed set me up to join him alone he was clearing up a loose end barda so you lay in wait barda he was lying in wait and i thought i knew where and i still missed him he must have been under the roots on the fisher tree she studied him a little longer then said youre rich now you could why didnt you run where all right thank you thank you for bringing it all back duncans in the old fern latrine pit with his throat cut we covered it up again its none of the parole boards business no someone still has to go in and buy supplies jemmy said amnon and winnie you told them both about this why i wanted someone with me when i brought you this i thought maybe youd do anything for the inn such as its early jemmy said im going to get some fish for dinner he set andrews pack beside the loot of three houses and left bardas eyes bored into his back he still didnt know if andrew was to be sent to destiny town with everybodys money then andrew had to want to come back he had authority here and nowhere else still would barda have offered him more say the life of a man who snatched a gun away from him jemmy didnt know and it wasnt ever going to matter he passed a few people and waved and went on the mens old cesspit hadnt been filled in jemmy stopped and sprinkled speckles around the edge and was reminded that he couldnt leave yet when he reached the lake willametta haines was perched on a perfect rounded white rock fishing jemmy took up position beside her he handed her the speckles bag would you take this please why youre the chef accidents happen i dont want to get it wet she took it whatre you doing going to circle the lake want company he said sure then he handed her an ear crescent a tiny snake made of silver wire where did you get this he fitted it onto her and then he told her she scrambled backward a safe distance away she threw the ear crescent at the lake water and ran he waited until she was out of sight then he kept walking around the lake and uphill he kept the pole awkward as it was there would be lakes and rivers he didnt expect to be hunted jemmy bloocher disappears after admitting that hes killed the trusty did he run or did someone take offense who cares but anyone who tried to follow jemmy would surely expect to find him on the road uphill he climbed swan lake nestled in another wrinkle in the fabric of the land another crest with another valley beyond from the crest he could look into the next valley earthlife colors then destiny black along the bottom then earthlife again that day and the next three he stuck to the crest he made forays into the valley to hunt and gather in time he descended to the road when he met the caravan he was welcome he had money hed saved out half before he gave the rest to barth part three wave rider the otterfolk enjoy boat rije we want to try a mixed crew will granger xenobiology c orit jeremy winslow had shaped a reclining chair for himself out of sand out beyond the waves blue and white water sparkled and flashed a tiny pale shape bobbed up and down chloe was sitting on a board with her back to jeremy surrounded by small dark shelltopped heads it was off season wave riders clientele might think that they came for the otterfolk hut they came for each others company too when a caravan wasnt in nobody else came either the folk who tended wave rider could all relax a little only a little entropy ran fast at the shoreline and barbara barenblatt had brought a large family a husband four young children and a sister doubling as babysitter all in the threeback suite barry and brenda were cleaning it up while they were out brendas husband lloyd had gone yesterday for supplies and hed seen karen tending a cauldron of soup and jeremy was nursing a twisted knee hut it wouldnt keep him idle forever he was shelling peas under a net to keep sand out his hands moved without distracting him much out beyond chloe the water humped chloe saw it she was paddling turning small heads popped up around her a dozen twenty the hump in the ocean rolled toward her chloe paddled madly jeremy watched nodding good good youre on good stand now she stood the board slid down the water slope in a flurry of otterfolk when chloe veered they all veered no surfboard ever hit an otterfolk the wave was breaking and she skimmed away under the falling water otterfolk got lost or let the wave roll over them just for the hell of it a few were almost keeping up she looked good his sisterinlaw hed taught her to ride these waves hed be riding again after his knee healed at fortyseven years of age he couldnt expect that to happen fast behind him not loud jeremy heard a metallic thump and a highpitched yzp a moment to realize how queer that sound was another to wait for the yell of reassurance that didnt come then he was hoprunning uphill cane stabbing sand right arm windmilling for balance he saw karen and he bellowed barry brenda help karen had set the cauldron in a frame above the pit in the sand below wave rider the cauldron was on its side he could see where chowder had spilled down karens right side shoulder to hip and elbow barrbarrbarreee brenbrenbrendaaa her face was twisted in terror why wasnt she screaming he shied from the answer the nerves must have been seared lifeless he got under karens shoulder her left shoulder just as she started to collapse his own scream rose to incoherent agony as his knee buckled under her weight brenda came running jeremy was down on his knee still supporting karen dont touch her where shes burned get under her here here where i am okay he transferred his burden karen was moaning shed started to realize how bad it was she wasnt able to stand get her up to the inn jeremy limped uphill up sixty meters of old wooden stairs shouting every few steps barrbarrbarreee whati was stowing meat and veggies lloyd was back good get ice all the ice karens been burned barrbarrbarreee lloyd disappeared jeremy continued his hopjump progress up the stairs from the beach through reception and into the kitchen lloyd had poured several pounds of ice over a towel in the sink he rolled the towel up and rushed past jeremy brenda and karen had reached the landing outside reception karen was whimpering her eyes rolled a patch of skin on her upper arm had slipped lloyd and brenda eased her down to the wood floor and settled the icefilled towel across her jeremy slid a pillow under her knees brenda asked did you call anyone call lloyd phoneno brenda ran inside karen wanted to hold his hand he told her dont worry brenda must be calling the city what happened it was tipping over i tried to stop it should have called me no time your knee someone i know her eyes closed her hand went slack he found brenda in reception talking to the settlermagic box in her hand karen winslow wave rider inn got it the little projector behind the desk flashed whiteonblue print into the air and she said yes im her daughter brenda winslow but shell probably come in with daddy jeremy winslow thats right the air blinked ruby script at her and she frowned daddy when were you born twentyseven eleven the truth he didnt know a better answer where skip it haven on the crab iremember daddy theyre having trouble finding your credit references jeremy winslow didnt answer brenda said you came here so you took moms name would they have your name from before i hope not jeremy hearst dad they wont find me his daughter gave him a long hard stare then she told the phone try barry winslow uncle barry karen winslows brother the screen flashed yes thats right daddy see if you can find uncle barry jeremy hopjumped away he heard brendas voice continue behind him yes ill have him phone and give you a reference but send an ambulance now shes burned over half her body when can we expect barry was up two flights of stairs making dust jeremy had to go up after him wave rider had a high noise level you got to where you barely heard the crashing waves but you couldnt hear someone shouting either barry moved fast for his age jeremy followed him down slowly favoring the knee that hadnt worked right since the surfing accident when he was alone he let his face have its way his face wanted a twitching teethclenching rictus sardonicus his hands wanted to tear the banister apart what was he going to tell brenda or when he must karen whatever he told his daughter hed have to tell them all barry and chloe would demand to know what was up and they werent just his inlaws they owned part of the restaurant he didnt see his other children much harlow earth he would have liked to talk to her his stepmotherinlaw hadnt quite got along with harolds children after harolds death shed sold them what she owned of wave rider not quite of her own choice she ran a candle shop in destiny town itself out of jeremys reach when karen had survived this horror she would have to know so hed better build a story jeremy thought gripping the railing as he limped down the stairs hed had a story it had bought him twentyseven good years they were clustered around karen when he got down trying to explain the matter to chloe and six hotel guests asham barenblatt offered to use his credit reference but barry was already on the phone giving his karen had been given pills the way she looked frightened him brenda looked at him and said daddy the ambulance will be hours getting here i have to pack you should pack for mother i told medical the same as you used to tell us brenda said she moved briskly about karens bedroom stuffing clothing into the case with unnecessary force not looking at her father born at haven on the crab little place with six families your mother my grandmother died you were three your father came by with the spring caravan and took you randall hearst of hearst wagon but medicals got no record of any of that its fiction didnt you tell mother there was no documentation father dead stepmother never got to it its fiction randall hearst hes a merchant i barely met when we traded off at the neck he wouldnt know me well he might havens real carnot wagons real too im from spiral town brenda hugged a double armful of blouses to her and stared you mean literally spiral town literally nobody leaves spiral town i had to i shot a man it was an accident he told her the tale marriage in twerdahl town the caravans long leisurely trek down the road the quick terrible trip back adrift aboard carders boat there were tears running down brendas face but shed finished packing they left the cases in the hall and crossed to her own bedroom he spoke little of the windfarm but she knew more every child of the mainland studied speckles biology and the biology of the winds when he told of birds killing shimon she held her breath when he came to the fight with andrew she was looking at her father with horror and fascination you killed him yes how i threw rocks he wasnt proud of giving away duncans twicestolen loot he skipped that and he skipped over what hed done with the speckles though hed already told brenda enough to put him back in the winds he said only i kept out a handful for the road and gave the pouch to willametta then i walked out four days later i was looking down from the ridge at the autumn caravan it was down to six wagons pulled by tugs i bit my tongue trying to look nonchalant theyd have arrested me anyway scruffy as i was if i hadnt had the fishing pole and fish to share around i bought some clothes and a haircut and a bar of soap enough to make me look civilized i went on up the road to the wave rider and asked for a job your grandfather turned me down i thought no he turned me down i knew a lot about harold from listening to barda i thought i could push his buttons but your grandmother had died and harold was married again harlow met me at the door i thought she must be bardas sister karen maybe harold winslow didnt like how i looked at his wife so i camped on the beach a little down from wave rider i set up a pit barbecue ate a couple of meals at wave rider while the money held out i swam with otterfolk werent you afraid theyd remember you otterfolk dont travel im not even sure this bunch could breed with otterfolk around the curve of the bay but hed learned that much later and he added sure i was nervous but they didnt know me and they liked playing with me harolds family they never got time its part of the bargain brenda they like us theyre interested they want to play with us i think harolds poor overworked family nagged him into hiring someone and i was there temporary he said he kept boards for guests i taught harlow how to ride a board then some of the others tried it and you told them a story yeah i told my tale of a caravan trader and his roadside son and i stuck to it brenda i know what happens to anyone crossing the neck they shoot him i do not know what they do to an island shy who lives among them for twentyseven years there was noise outside the windows from the road they looked out a tug pulled up towing a boxy vehicle marked with a red cross jeremy hoplimped down the stairs in brendas wake they were carrying karen out she was quiet she looked dead the medics stopped so that he could see she was breathing raggedly but breathing no daddys not going im going with her brenda told them she put the cases in the ambulance alongside karens stretcher and lloyd added his lloyd was going with his wife brenda asked cant you visit us no there were others listening so he said ive got to take care of the inn chloe and barry began to assure him that they could handle that it was slack season they didnt depend on the cookpit but brenda and lloyd climbed into the ambulance jeremy waved it away and it moved off asham barenblatt and his family boarded the outbound bus the next day jeremy wondered where theyd stay outbound was the spaceport itself and beyond that the caravans barbara barenblatt worked at the spaceport that was somewhere up the road she couldnt leave during the fine weather season there must be facilities for rebuilding the wagons maybe theyd stay there now the inn was empty of tenants they closed all the upstairs windows pending the next caravans arrival in fourteen days chloe and barry took up the slack nobody expected very much of the pit chef but he could cook for the rest for years jeremy had watched shuttles streak overhead like slow and vivid meteors until one day karen told him that the spaceport was just around the bluff to the east all he had to do was paddle out on a board and watch the shuttles always came out of the west always came down tens of klicks short of the neck jeremy remembered seeing a takeoff when he was nearing the neck but yutzes who thought theyd seen spacecraft reentering above them on the crab had seen only meteors the shuttles came down on inverted nearly invisible flames that flared yellow when they touched the water then a boat went out with a line and the craft bobbing like a top was winched to the beach where tracks and a pair of big bulbous structures waited jeremy couldnt get any closer because people in boats would come out to yell at him barbara barenblatt wouldnt talk about what she did there asham wouldnt talk about it but jeremy had mentioned his pilot stepson to the barenblatt children and maybe they knew something and now theyd gone guild secrets the spaceport stretched from the road to the beach jeremy believed but a high wall hid all of that from the road and boats guarded the beach they didnt like gawkers from wave rider risking cremation under a shuttle flame the far side of the spaceport was a long white line of beach just visible some days and then invisibly far the neck caravan country and they didnt want company either he knelt at the edge of the pier water lapping just below his knees and reached out with a slice of sweet potato three flattish heads popped up winston he said and one of the otterfolk took the sweet potato short arms wide hands with four thick short fingers jeremy curled and uncurled four fingers thumb withheld four fish he concealed all but the tips of a finger and wiggled those shrimp winston disappeared without acknowledgment he couldnt ride the waves or even ease off the dock and swim because theyd swarm around him and bump his leg when the otterfolk were happy with him theyd try to surprise or delight him today theyd bring whatever fish were nearest he couldnt surf out to watch the shuttles land time he gave that up anyway but what was there to do here but worry about karen he went back inside to a ringing phone jeremy had never gotten used to the phone he almost never answered its flash and bell he was only the pit chef after all he owned no part of wave rider barry and chloe had bought out part of harlows share never mind in the absence of karen and brenda they expected him to answer wave rider inn speak to me a young mans head and shoulders half familiar mans voice whove i got pit chef jeremy karens man brenda talked to eileen yesterday dreadful thing anything new jeremy knew him now johannes wheeler had married his eldest daughter eileen jeremy tried to think not easy since karens accident had shattered his world lets see they took her to the hospital day before yesterday and brenda called this morning theyre treating her as a burn patient i guess i dont know medical terms cultured skin transplant the cameo bust of johannes stared at him means shes lost huge amounts of skin jeremy settled to a squat so that he wouldnt faint johannes must have noticed hey hey they mean superskin theyre putting skin back from the cultures in medical shell grow it back jeremy grow it back why arent you with her somebody had to take care of the inn jeremy remembered that these two had bought out part of harlows piece of wave rider then again the barenblatts are gone now its just us can you handle it just barely with three of us missing tell eileen i cant come to destiny town well i cant get away but we wondered if eileen should come early no well youve got our number and brenda says her mother is calling for you and she says theyve found your records my records earth he felt stupid karen was half his brain but what could she have meant you were having trouble with your credit record i guess but brenda says its all straightened out look if you can get to the hospital i think you should and soon karens been asking for you and brenda sounded scared after he hung up he stood staring through the empty space above the phone projector they found his records did he dare call brenda and ask brenda was staying with harlow theyd given him the number better not but he knew how to summon a credit check he typed in jeremy w l a reasonable price for a meal for eight green somehow he was in the computer he used the phone once more to get a schedule for the next bus to destiny town destiny t most species on barth arent adventurous they occupy one habitat and f it fails they go extinct the otterfolk shouldnt have surprised us maybe most intelligent species cant travel wayne parnelli marine biology a big square bus and the tug pulling it came the next morning a swing of his arm flagged it down a gesture jeremy had seen a thousand times and never used himself he climbed up into a box full of indifferent strangers stowed his backpack chose a seat as soon as jeremy was settled it took off at a scary fifty klicks an hour down the road straight into the horizon when the caravan was in wave rider seethed with strangers they didnt press this close though because too often he was holding something sharp or something hot at the pit his word was law and any strangers about him were in his charge here the bus was no more than halffull they werent staring they werent hostile yet he couldnt meet their eyes he looked out the windows he got used to the speed and the shaking and even dozed for a time he woke afraid that hed missed the swan but when the bus stopped an hour later he recognized the bridge it had a new handrail and new paint it still sagged almost to the water under a big painted sign corsos camp waikiki six older children crossed the old bridge to the bus they chattered as the bus moved on the passengers paid not the slightest attention to a landslide slope not much farther on site of an old climbing accident never discovered or long forgotten terminus was bigger than twerdahl town the buildings were old and blocky and oppressively massive like nothing hed seen short of the windfarm still the town wasnt dying a street fair was buzzing along the road the bus stopped to let adozen people get off and near as many got on another hour passed here were more houses then a line of stores side streets multiplied the bus stopped frequently and now it was easing through foot and bicycle traffic youre supposed to have seen it all before nothing he saw stood above three stories newer structures had a lighter feel but as the bus moved deeper into town he saw massive blocky buildings like those in terminus it was as if cavorites crew built to withstand some terror left behind on old earth coriolisdriven storms spun off from the winds earthshakes guessing he was guessing but he was close enough to taste the answers all the answers ticking in the back of his mind was the certainty that he was nearing the end of the road how could he have lived so close for so long stop staring hed grown up with as much variety if not quite the same styles when traffic slowed he looked for the oldest buildings to encroach on the road as they did in spiral town the shops along this part of the road were marked by signs few had holograms and those were faint in daylight the glowing ghost of a manhigh fur hat caught his attention the hologram letters were too dim to read but there was a painted sign too romanoff the road curved gently right then gently left still the buildings stood well clear of the road jeremy suddenly realized that he was looking up at the curving hull of cavorite so close that he couldnt see the top but only what he had taken for a cobbled wall the landers lavaspattered groundeffect skirt other passengers were staring too cavorite the end of the road was a ioop and cavorite was the middle of it like columbiad in destiny town the lander stood among smaller structures in a lava dish of its own melting there was a fence around it traffic was clogged here but only because there was so much of it nothing blocked the road building must have been restricted from the beginning he had wondered whether it would be safe to ask directions no need faded holograms marked three buildings of ancient poured stone all with big glass windows medical medical medical the bus stopped with his case on his back and a cane in his hand jeremy climbed down to the road closer he could read more medical reception and records medical intensive care and surgery medical outpatient and recovery he staggerstepped into the leftmost building a narrowfaced woman his own age looked up what she wore was likely a uniform white with scarlet markings lisa schiavo reception duty doctor he was the last thing she wanted to see patient he said im here to see karen winslow she repeated patient yes emergency burn patient four days ago family only her brows furrowed puzzled at the spiral town accent that hed thought long lost im jeremy winslow he said more carefully karens husband she said okay okay were all specklesshy here today and the reason is the computer went out about quitting time yesterday her hands shuffled a stack of printouts helplessly we spent the whole morning trying to keep track with notes on paper now were using the library computer and thats where youll find out where your wife is through that door and up three floors theres a lift wait whats wrong with your leg i hurt my knee surfing really wonderful brendan nothing happened immediately schiavo said sit down how long ago almost three weeks he sat down is it healing all right i suppose come back after you see your wife ill have brendan scan you here she handed him a card your wifes name address age and whatever you remember about her medical history jeremy began writing a barrelshaped man jogged in ja mein fьhrer his uniform was very like schiavos with a label that read brendan shaw surgery duty doctor brendan want some exercise run up to the library yeah find out where theyre keeping a burn patient and get her status karen winslow you could take the lift whod know she took jeremys card glanced at it handed it to brendan i go effendi brendan jogged out knees high arms pumping he slowed to a walk while in jeremys sight but not schiavos schiavo handed him another card fill one out for yourself too jeremy filled out what he remembered from his credit rating put it in his pocket closed his eyes brendans voice jolted him awake winslow weve got her in intensive out the door turn left its the next building over fourth floor room fourten her doctors nogales but shes home today come back after you see your wife and well scan your knee karen smiled jeremy cant move i cant disturb the skin all right he went around to her good side and she gripped his hand the sheet didnt cover much of her they had her hands tied loosely and padded but she couldnt reach herself the skin over half her body was shiny and patchy it made him queasy to look but he could well understand why nothing should touch her skin so good to see you jeremy what kept you they couldnt find my credit record at first her eyes doubted him hed always wondered how much shed guessed he told her how matters stood at wave rider no customers and a good thing too himself walking around braindead with worry the otterfolk were getting bored what they brought in was skimpy nine days until the caravaners arrived she listened dozed there was a hand on his shoulder hed gone to sleep with his cheek on karens good arm lloyd dont wake her karens hand was slack now and he disengaged their youngest daughters mate said ill take you back to gran harlows place itll hold four for one night cant go yet the doctor wants to look at my knee about time medical was the strangest scariest place jeremy winslow had ever been he hoped it didnt show youre supposed to have seen this before he told brendan shaw the waves were rqlling in from way out there little shelled heads all around me i hadnt been out for weeks because the caravan was in they like it better when you take chances you know i caught this beautiful curl and rode it till my knees turned to water and then let it break and carry me till the board hit sand and i lit running i twisted my knee running in sand just too tired brendan shaw had a hand scanner he moved it around jeremys injured knee and a hologram showed him the inside he said well you tore the meniscus will it grow back no he moved to scan the good knee for comparison the meniscus isnt alive exactly your body grows this spongy cushion in your knee joint and it only grows once now theres a piece floating free when it gets between the bones that hurts too right can you sew it up brendan wrapped a blue pad around jeremys knee jemmy grimaced at the cold and brendan grinned yes first we chill you down i need to wheel some equipment in here the groper a fiberoptic probe the stitcher some help he was thinking out loud after that cools a little well poke some fiber optics into your knee and look around more then well position the torn part which has to be done by hand sony and paint the edges for the stitcher so it can sew them shut thats not real paint it just marks them in memory you got a card for me just like that jeremys teeth were clenched the cold burned him but fear did too but if he put this off hed spend days getting his nerve up card in his shirt pocket brendan took it lie down and ill put you out or i could give you a local but most patients dont want to be here when this is happening to them no telling what he might blurt out while he watched things being poked into his knee put me out safer actually jeremy closed his eyes as shaw settled a skeletal metal structure on his head wet pads touched both eyes and the nape of his neck three hundred years old if you figure it was built on earth but it still works local anesthetic would be a drug much cruder jeremy woke up hurting a bulky cast held his leg stiff and a little bent a young man handed him pills and a mug of water brendan said aspirin youre not allergic good all done oh yeah two hours ago you looked like you needed the sleep here do you know how to use crutches no ive got my stick no use crutches for a few days try standing up now the trick you okaythe trick is to never put your weight on your armpits the crutches go there but your weight is on your arms and hands crutches move first then your foot steady try it again wheres lloyd lets go see brendan darted down a hail jemmy followed crutches right foot crutcheshe felt unstable his knee hurt like fury brendan darted back lloyd winslow hes got your pack too lloyd saw jeremy come in and started to laugh the bus stopped in the middle of a block to let them off lloyd was chattering we thought wed take you to romanoffs for dinner tomorrow after twentyseven years eating your own cooking but its eight blocks from medical jeremys wifes fathers second wife was jeremys age she was dark with black kinky hair white showing through now her beauty had refined itself why shed married old harold was something he had never asked she was too good for him twentyseven years ago the vision of harlow standing in the doorway of wave rider had gone straight to his glandular system hed held himself polite and diffident a pit chef looking for a job but what had she seen in his eyes hed never asked had harold been relieved when jeremy married karen today she was not much changed but he knew what she saw from the dismay in her eyes a young man grown old fatigued and in pain what on i think youd better have the downstairs she said used to be an office harlow leased one quarter of a big twostory building of poured stone the old office was big enough for a bureau and a big futonbig enough for brenda and lloyd but theyd moved upstairsand an old computer with a dark screen anything he did to his left leg hurt he crawled down the crutches maneuvering around the legs rigidity until his back was on the futon he didnt move again until brenda woke him for dinner getting up again could be worse he might have lived as a cripple forever waiting for his knee to heal lloyds laughter chopped off when jeremy entered he said sorry but they were going to look at your knee you went away with a limp next thing youre staggering in on crutches with your whole leg cased in concrete its everything i grew up knowing abput medical i shouldnt have laughed jer but i hate that place i share your pain lloyd laughed wildly well youre here should we go home in the morning this was the partowner asking the pit chef is there anyone left to run the innjeremy said were empty you could take another day or two hows mommy brenda asked jeremy took his seat hanging on brave brenda i dont know anything about destiny town medicine you tell me how is she i could lie to you only one answer to that sure daddy she got badly hurt were not wizards superskin is old settler magic but it still has to grow on her hed known she could die he couldnt speak of that so brenda dear how did they find my identity ask gran harlow harlow said i wrote it in that computer youre sleeping with it died before i moved in here but one of my friends got it going brenda told me what to say are we likely to be caught in an inconsistency jeremy that story held up for twentyseven years he said they all seemed to be studying him a sudden stranger harlow asked was it supposed to what dyou then he understood harlow i wasnt sure what i wanted i needed refuge i didnt know what was possible maybe id follow the road the rest of the way to destiny town and see where cavorite ended maybe id go home maybe there was a way to serve time in the winds and come out as a citizen i didnt know how to do any of that but i thought i knew how to keep a restaurant and get some breathing space so now youve seen cavorite yes he looked at harlow in wonder he hadnt known it here in his bones until now ive seen cavorite ive seen the end of the road harlow thank you is that a big thing harlow what we learn is all wrong were told that the twerdahl contingent got bored cavorite went off with all the wealth of the colony and was never heard from again just like argos i followed the road all the way down to the neck and i found it again in the winds cavorites crew saved spiral town they set up the windfarm and worked it to grow speckles they set up the caravans to keep the speckles coming they did more than that brenda said ah daddy do they have teaching machines in spiral town sure theres a computer in medical in the library look up speckles daddy its the law cavorite calling base one we remain camped halfway along haunted bay weve found aquatic animals like little armored volkswagons they like to pull things the h t language seems to be mostly body language most of us have nvum with them and parnelli has made a surfboard will somebody please talk to me are you all right its been two months since i talked to anything but a damned recording oliver carter ecology moving only her eyes karen watched brenda help jeremy into a chair she said that limps getting worse isnt it you should go to medical lloyd laughed himself into tears they told karen what had been done to his knee they talked about wave rider then about his first return to destiny town in twentyseven years had he been to see his old home under brendas censorious eye he told karen i havent been anywhere the bus this morning was a nightmare lloyd and brenda had to get me on and off i dont think i want to visit anyplace before i heal a little not even cavorite those first few years hed talked of burning lights settling on the sea just out of sight of space and argos and cavorite spaceport personnel ate at wave rider but harold didnt want the pit chef bothering them in time he dropped the subject but karen remembered he said for cavorite id walk on my hands would they let me in i dont know can just anyone get in there lloyd said brenda went mustafa took me through brenda said pilots get in mustafa came to visit while he was in training and i was at wide wades daddy i used to wonder why you never came if you ask she caught herself yes he could ask his wifes son the shuttle pilot to guide his stepfather through the old lander but it was a risk he gave karen a hand massage both hands he and brenda trading chairs when he had put her to sleep brenda stood up when are you going to tell her when she isnt on drugs when i figure out how to tell her about her sister barda when i think it wont kill her look up speckles well see you at dinner he tracked down dr nogales in a third floor office rita nogales surgery surgeon and anesthesiologist she was reading a computer screen jeremy told her karen doesnt look good karen winslow she tapped at a virtual keyboard the configuration jumped a torso with highlighted internal organs then with highlighted patches of skin a requisition form a block of text nogales hadnt looked around you wouldnt look good either if youd scalded seventy centimeters of skin off your body your wife thats right we put superskin on we wait its a lifeform you know human genes trimmed in some lab in sol system to make it a universal donor wonderful stuff now she looked up at him we wait it attaches itself eventually the patient gets up and goes home there are old guys walking around with superskin faces and hands women too you can just barely tell he knew her narrow head narrow nose yellowbrown skin and oriental eyes handsome but an impatient angry woman he couldnt quite remember and he couldnt just stare i know youve got her on drugs is she in a lot of pain would be shes taking novabliss with that in her shes happier than you are her eyes widened in shock no birdfucking allowed oh there being nowhere to run he said its the law i didnt know you till you smiled jeremy jemmy hows dolores died damn igot pregnant a man killed her after i wasnt there to protect her anyone i know no ill know him everyone comes to medic l sooner or later winslow like barda married bardas sister right clever jeremy anyone could find out i served time in the windfarm but i dont call attention to it sounds good to me she was still studying him thats right youre a crab shy how on earth did you get here at all fake records whats with the knee he told her she nodded nodded used her keyboard okay it says youre real and your credit is midlevel you can buy dinner but not a restaurant can i go to the library the computers see you as a surgery patient you can use the library while you wait for a doctor ill take you away from brendan and i cant fit you in for is six hours enough then ill look you over and we can talk lisa schiavo was on duty in reception and recovery jeremy watched her for a bit got your computer back winslow hows ah karen dr nogales wont make any promises shes good that way i mean im sorry its bad news but nogales wont lie hows the knee dr nogaies wants to look it over later today doctor is everyone here a doctor arent there any nurses or aides or doctor means youre doing something to run a hospital its courtesy like in a restaurant saying herrober gets you someone who can bring you food or clean your table it used to mean headwaiter but patients get put on diets so even the commissary chefs are doctorswinslow ive got to work id like to wait in the library if youre not using it log on with your credit ident doctors get priority up three floors lines of office doors along a corridor all labeled all closed at the end of the hall an open door library he found a dozen comfortable chairs and five screens one wasnt working four were in use one user looked wasted his eyes had a glassy look patient three looked healthy and busy doctors jeremy sat down and waited placidly hed waited twentyseven years the patient nodded off rapped his forehead on the keyboard jerked up to see gibberish staggered upright and went away jeremy took his place as his fingertips touched the keyboard jeremys eyes stung with tears abruptly unexpectedly the home hed lost again and again was his at last he was back in spiral town eight years old again and it was time for school all right there were things hed always wondered about the teaching programs never had enough to satisfy him crab there were hundreds of earthlife varieties jeremy could pick one or two that resembled the crab peninsula otter earthlife a mammal streamlined with bristly hair it looked nothing at all like otterfolk otte rfolk kismet tegumentum lutrahomines the first intelligent species ever found off earth otterfolk were curious about humans cavorites crew loved that they ran their road well above otterfolk beaches for fear that those who came after would meddle jeremy found references to species gone extinct because they attracted human attention but theyd done some meddling themselves theyd taught the otterfolk how to cultivate earthlife fish and crustacea and traded them simple tools for fish that was a success theyd set up a cooperative exploring team reference otterfolk explore cliff side otterfolk explore beache s the otterfolle enjoy boat rides we want to try a mixed crew arundez has designed a suitable boat a catamaran with nets we can drop to b k off the central well so that otterfolk can swim during a voyage theyd gone exploring together along the coast and off the back side of the crab above and beneath the sea destiny sunlight reddened and deficient in ultraviolet still caused skin cancers and blindness in otterfolk sea life outside haunted bay poisoned them or attacked them there were predators worse than lungsharks in unfamiliar currents they followed the wrong smells and got lost lower salinity hurt their skins and made them vulnerable to parasites to avoid bringing back a nasty skin parasite the contact crew had euthanized ten otterfolk and burned the boat euthanize kill it bothered jeremy but the biology crew had been horrified not just the guilt not just the deaths an intelligent species that couldnt explore to men and women who had conquered space and seen space ripped from their grasp that was obscene he flinched from the next entry karen winslow patient records are restricted access code relaxed and tried argos familiar stuff half a thousand colonists had left sol system in cold sleep with twenty crew coldsleep techniques were two hundred years advanced beyond avalons time but the major advances were diagnostic colonists damaged by cranial ice crystals would be ah euthanized a crew member wakened during the voyage must remain thawed far too many were damaged three hundred and sixtysix sleepers arrived and seventy crew fifty sleepers chosen for skills learned in deep space had been revived to deal with an emergency most of the fifty had lived their lives off earth theyd grown up using the resources of an entire solar system they had flown argos across lightyears to a system yet untouched asteroid and gasgiant mining techniques were centuries old their faith was in argos and their own skills theyd expected the colony on destiny to fail destinys ecology after all would have its own agenda on arrival they mutinied argo s mutiny trial the facts werent in dispute a trial hadnt struck him as silly when he was a boy base ones tribunal had found them guilty and so what by then the mutineers were elsewhere in the solar system their judges were marooned owning two landers and whatever gear had been judged useless by an exoplanetaiy community they were barely able to reach orbit argos debrief hed been through these too memoirs by crew who chose to remain with the destiny colony wait these files had more bulk than base ones memoirs it must include material written after cavorites departure try argos memoir twerdahl restricted material access code no birdfucking allowed argos sightings ye gods destiny town had an orbiting telescope the cyclops telescope had gone up a hundred and ninetyone years ago first sighting of argos came ten years later first verified sighting eleven years argoss drive flame was not bright argos without it was invisible but the argos drive flame impacting an asteroid was brilliant and unmistakable for whatever that was worth destiny town could only watch cavorite could reach geosynchronous orbit but not the moons not the planets not the stars cyclops telescope watched argos establishing a base on the dumbbellshaped asteroid called blake and verified that argos had kept faith by this much they had seeded quicksilver with a photocollector factory quicksilver sunpower in approaching two centuries after its emplacement that first little selfreproducing factory had multiplied enough to be noticed a bright patch was visible on the innermost planet and a trickle of power was flowing to destiny power was also being directed toward argos todayquicksilvers sunward face was covered in silver along the crab they never knew it had been different but power flow toward argos could no longer be detected jeremy kept returning to the blueprints for the selfreproducing factory shape of a turtle mass of a man size of a small boy there was a name for such things what was it a factory that could be directed to make more of itself von neumann device argoss mutineers had no faith in the planetary colony time might have justified that to their descendants the colony on destiny had done little in a quarter of a millennium wait hadnt he seen a file argos sightings yes the last sighting of argos in flight was in fiftynine years ago and the flow of power from quicksilver had stopped did argoss crew still have descendants speckles the list of entries ran on and on what on earth was speckles see also fatum mortem parnelli fatum mortem parnelli destiny krill is a multicelled microscopic lifeform that uses photosynthesis but swims free e en on earth there were organisms that crossed the line between plant and animal f mortem parnelli lives in every part f the ocean thus far explored it is clearly f the speckles family though speckles is entirely a plant may one speculate future archeologists will find the f l record of a krill eaterone pictures a destiny blue whale with shell and shellcap that plowed th worlds seas until m parnelli learned to secrete deadly metals the krill poisoned them to extinction later a mortem variation evolved on land the crucial point here is that destiny lzrill secretes potassium when it dies it sinks to the bottom f the sea there the potassium remains after billions f years f that we find no potassium in destiny sea salt and that is we will die wayne parnelli marine biology fatum mortem hed called it destinys death scared the hell of out him did it jeremy had wondered every child wondered why a rgos came to destiny without the means to keep settlers alive how could the ancient wizards of sol system have been so stupid but if oceans on earth had all the potassium they needed jeremy almost laughed that must have been a nasty shock look up speckles but there were so many files be selective search speckle s farm a line of sporadic volcanoes four hundred klicks long tornadoes metals potassium refining speckles thorn trees and thorn weeds groundhugging animals and windbirds a varied and intricate ecology evolved within the winds each new species needing classification and further study and if speckles can be farmed elsewhere we must t l extract potassium to feed it why bother well grow it here cavorites course matched his guesses but what had brenda meant they did more than that more than refine potassium then discover and cultivate speckles in an endless howling storm full of thorn birds then race home speckles twerdahl base one he read on while afternoon darkened to evening base one had delayed cavorites departure had afflicted them with a long list of projects had repeatedly tried to cancel the expedition the first settlers had not perceived any need for haste a nasty shock as jeremy had guessed following the nasty shock of argoss betrayal base one was in denial but though sea salt would not sustain base one earthlife animals made nerves too they were good at secreting potassium ancient kings had learned to confiscate manure piles at the first sign of war for nuggets of saltpeter to grind up for gunpowder but saltpeterpotassium nitratecould also be ground into food so cavorite drifted down the coast at a snails pace leaving a snails trail of molten rock they would fulfill all of their mission seed earthlife wherever they went pause to sample local life look for places a village might thrive investigate signs of what might be intelligence let the ungrateful bastards wait and wonder cavorites crew could take their time in due time cavorite returned to base one emptied of earthlife seeds and infant animals and loaded with samples of rock and destiny life maps refined potassium and speckles what had gone wrong at base one they found plumbing redirected to sterilize sewage with heat then vent it above croplands that would have done the job if the job had been more than ten percent finished maybe they were stopped by the stench livestock implied manure manure had even been raked into heaps but the heaps lay untouched nobody had picked through them for saltpeter then again there wasnt much potassium must first be put into fertilizer to feed the grass grass didnt make nerves as their intelligence dropped had they forgotten what was at stake cavorites crew might speculate but there was nobody to ask there were nobody at base one who could still talk coherently the records that followed were nearly incoherent with medical jargon here jeremy sensed a rage shared but never expressed twerdahls crew had fed and washed and dressed their former colleagues dressed the sores and treated the illnesses caused by dirt and randomly deposited sewage and cleaned up after them until they grew to detest them jeremy found reference to discipline problems and murky speculation as to what constitutes rape and consent theft versus custody rnurder versus euthanasia for people who had ceased to be people this wasn tin the teaching tapes at spiral town but barda winslow had tried to tell him some of the sick ones recovered some of their intelligence some of their memory not all centralnervoussystem nerves once dead dont grow back cavorites crew came to realize that they had become the primary colony on destiny they founded terminus far enough outside the winds to escape the continual howling move it someone said before he could react someone was handing jeremy his crutches and lifting him to his feet set ah wait i want to look up the man sat down a doctor he erased jeremys file and called up something else caravans if jeremys sudden rage showed through the doctor hadnt seen it jeremy was on crutches and still getting his balance and that was as well he had time to visit karen before he saw rita nogales karen was awake but a bit fuddled he tried to tell her what hed learned about speckles cavorite argos the windfarrn destiny town she listened she tried to comfort him as if hed suffered a personal injury presently she fell asleep looks good nogales said turning the luminous interior of a human knee before her eyes a doctor like itchy wald does a neater job but he spends too much time probing around in the joint trauma brendan is brisk so stay on crutches and dont do much walking for another day then maybe well take the cast off would you look in on karen before you go sure he started to stand i should catch a bus she said wait wait wait you owe me a story he sat down you owe me i think andrew was going to use the prole gun on you all no birdfucking allowed i knew that specklesshy birdfucker its the law go on i was expecting it rita he turned around and i yelled and jumped him the rest piled on of course he tried to kill me later he told her more than hed told brenda but again he left out the speckles i did it i made them into a restaurant before i had to leave and now i knew how running from the swan jemmy bloocher might have begged a ride from the inbound caravan go to destiny town the end of the road cavorite in the instant that was possible hed remembered what the windfarmers had called him crab shy a stranger in a place where he didnt understand the rules hed done that before and generally messed it up hed gone outbound instead from bardas description hed had no trouble finding wave rider all i had to do was get harold winslow to give me a chance the daughter karen she was two months pregnant when i got there she never told me who maybe ive served him dinner maybe not turnovers high in the caravans or he might be from the spaceport rita are you thinking i targeted the innkeepers daughter didnt you no no no i only wanted to make myself a pit chef i wasnt staying and barda didnt know harlow she worried me karen was just the little sister then we i started noticing her we started talking while she was pregnant with mustafa tell me about her shes my patient too i can tell by her skih she gets a lot more sunlight than most human beings karen was the one who talked to the otterfolk before i came she swims and wave rider has a pier she didnt have to bull her way through the waves she gave birth in the water later i taught her to surf but otterfolk dont talk do they karen taught me to read their dance thats her word dance he talked about karen and himself he was never boss at wave rider he never owned any part of the restaurant any investment was emotional karen had never demanded that he show ambition she has you by the balls theyre still there show me he shied off rita laughed hed stayed nearly faithful pressed he admitted four affairs in those twentyseven years as for karen he was sure only of a wagonmaster who may have been mustafas father he was an old man now and mustafa flew the orbital shuttles yeah you werent staying twentyseven years he didnt laugh she said im a real doctor now a surgeon its what dolores wanted to be when she when that birdfucker dolores had empathy she couldnt stand to cut a person open for me thats the easy part wanting to fix something broken thats easy too jeremy if medical knew i was in the windfarm they might ease me out might not id be in worse trouble than you theyd kill me he didnt say reassure her yes but he didnt want rita nogales thinking in terms of extortion well ill go look in on her anything else you want she shrugged and didnt finish he found harlow lloyd and brenda waiting in reception to take him to dinner hydraulic empire we have to stop meeting in cargo rec its gotten too small the grandchildren are growing up anonymous cavorite was just across the road jeremy stood rapt until he realized that they were trying to help him sit down on a bench lloyd said well get a bus pretty soon its only eight blocks lets try it jeremy turned away and began his swinging progress crutches then foot crutches foot harlow said dubiously if it starts to hurt whats it like jeremy asked cavorite yes two stories tall and you bump your head a lot daddy everythings near the base brenda said rooms cargo motors and pumps and cooling even the system that makes fuel and air everything that has any mass the upper part is all hydrogen tank they build the new shuttles the same harlow said i know you want every part of a spacecraft as light as you can make it see tanks you can make into frothywalled balloons motors you cant lighten those much f you want to run them afew hundred times and motors have to be at the aft end now the cargo one trip you leave it in orbit the next youre bringing it back for repair you never know where your center of mass will becoming home so you dont know how the shz willfly unless you put the cargo hold where the motors are now most of your mass is at the tail its going to fly butt first coming back so you beef up the tail against reentry and you might as well pile all the rest of the mass there too mustafa had a test coming up jeremy said we all had to hear him lecture and the new shuttles aren tfusion they run on kerosene and liquid oxygen so they have to be really light they come home like a silver birthday balloon weighted at one end so even f the motors dont light at the last second it doesnt crash see daddy he and mustafa never said stepfather stepson to each other hed learned more about the shuttles before mustafas tests they fueled the shuttle right on the beach electrolyzing seawater then liquefying the hydrogen and oxygen then ran it up those tracks the fur hat blazed ahead of him brighter than quicksilver or any moon crutches foot crutches foot a pit chef developed massive arms jeremy was in the swing of it and outrunning the others by the time they reached romanoffs he stopped blinking in the hatlight at a flight of stairs this ill have to take slow no daddy theyve got a lift romanoffs dining hall was an awesome sight ablaze with holograms of chandeliers the kind that had candles in them the headwaiter moved them through the crowd with some care the restaurant was laid out in levels with steps up or down every few meters jeremy was watching his feet and the crutches he didnt get a chance to gawk until they were seated tables of half a dozen were common families shared dishes around just like spiral town families a young couple turned out at second glance to be a stunning young woman and a creaky older man with a startling young face of superskin harlow asked hows karen hanging on dr nogales has her on novabliss for pain and she wanted karens life story whats she say no birdfucking allowed something about romanoffs made it impossible even to whisper that she didnt make any promises brenda you sent me to the library the waiter came jeremy asked him about some menu items and the man got bogged down in questions he went to get the chef several minutes of shoptalk ensued much to his familys amusement the cuisine sounded like spiral town but chef simonsen knew pit cooking he had been a merchant on hearst wagon jeremy realized barely in time that jeremy hearst had not thatjeremy raised in destiny town had learned pit cuisine from a spadoni wagon merchant and from lessons filed under cuisine barbecue thatjeremy was an apprentice learning from a master his family listened to this line of fiction with much interest simonsen went back to his kitchen harlow had ordered drinks and jeremy sipped something fruity and alcoholic brenda asked about the library i spent the whole day there we were never taught that our ancestors were mindless idiots for eleven months more than a destiny year brenda began to turn pink harlow asked shake you up she was not quite amused and not shocked you knew every child learns that brenda you the other kids too you all got well daddy you havent changed but jeremy winslows children knew him as a crab shy who worked the pit at wave rider the wonder was that they gave their father any respect at all youd have died without us lloyd said casually sure we owe you my ancestors owe yours but i think they robbed us too robbed dinner came communal dishes separate plates lloyd waited until they had served themselves then he repeated robbed you jeremy pointed up at the hologram chandeliers settler magic all around us megas of electric power thats from quicksilver lloyd said jeremy said thats power beamed from quicksilver to relay satellites to guide spots all over destiny town and way beyond they could be sending power to spiral town too couldnt they we could reset them harlow admitted i see a lot of tugs theres just one factory jeremy lloyd its nearly the same design as the power plants on quicksilver or a begley cloth weaver unit seen under a microscope or destiny towns varmint killer its unmistakable your tug factory was designed in sol system more to the point it will accept a signal to reproduce itself i dont actually know that cavorite made a lot of trips in eleven months speckles to spiral town home with a loaded cargo hold every time right his family was embarrassed jeremy kept his voice down i can see it your ancestors stripped us theres nothing of settler magic left in spiral town but now he came to think of it a handful of computers a paint machine thousands of electric lights the road varmint killer and a cave in a hillside where begley cloth comes from and he couldnt suppress the smile lloyd smiled back quite a lot well that cave was just too big to steal i guess and the rest isnt valuable enough harlow said jeremy suppose youre right suppose cavorite carried some communal supplies away from base one you did survive so far harlow they took too much everythings wearing out mmm was he annoying his family without reason it wasnt as if hed evolved any kind of answer he turned his attention to dinner the food resembled spiral town cuisine with an emphasis on sauces and potatoes and a variety of salads light on the speckles hey this wasnt a potato shreds of black in the porkandbroccoli yellowgreen in the duck dish were certainly destiny spices there were spiky yellowgreen disks in a brown sauce more destiny plants and his family was careful cutting off the rind jeremys taste and belly and intellect feasted all together whatfiavors has simonsen matched here it became a lively family discussion hes done something to these almonds how can our kitchen do this and this he could see their relief jeremy was being difficult but we got him to change the subject but who else could he ask he had questions his family had pieces of answers if there were answers his family would protect him knowing that jeremy winslow was fiction otterfolk he said they drove cavorites crew crazy leaving haunted bay kills them heres an intelligent species that cant explore whats intelligence for if not for seeking knowledge theyre happy brenda said jeremy we all read those old records harlow said one point daryl twerdahl made the otterfolk knew some of them were dying but they kept coming back for more the ones who lived had tales to tell however they tell tales so theyd die to learn more but they cant jeremy said daddy theyve got us we can show them things heres my point feeling the way they did about the otterfolk and knowing what argos had done to them how could cavorites people take away our access to space and leave us marooned lloyd said we had cavorite you had columbiad jeremy thought it over and lloyd was right he said little after that he listened to ingroup chat from his family and a few tantalizing snatches of conversation from tables nearby dessert was a mountain of fruit and sorbets chef simonsen brought over a bottle of a sweet wine and poured them thimblesized glasses tasting wine isnt one of my skills jeremy admitted you should start the chef said severely jeremy heard a big bells bong before they had finished ten minutes to bus time harlow told him he paid the bill just like a citizen by speaking his name and a number to their waiter then he tried to get up no birdfucking forgot they had to help him to his feet hut he was all right with crutches under him he wondered if a tablespoon of wine could have thrown his balance off so badly in the morning the house was empty but jeremy remembered harlow standing over his futon looking down at him from what seemed a vast distance tomorrow look up hydraulic empire shed said karen turned just her head with a delighted smile hi hi did nogales take you off the novabliss she seemed far more alert than she had yesterday dont know nogales rita my doctor she says ive got to stay out of the sun for a while and the water till autumn long time karen said it means i cant help you with the pit her hands were still bound but her shoulders moved restlessly karen still looked patchy better along her ribs and hip but her shoulder and breast were worst one big grayish patch of skin had sloughed off her shoulder onto the sheet jeremy wondered if he should remove it or put it back what was underneath was puffy and red touched with purple he said you cant talk to the otterfolk either and thats the fun part i should have my knee back before the next caravan i want to try some things in the kitchen if any of it works out well be working there instead of the pit ahhah brenda got you to romanoffs lucky guess yeah brenda and lloyd and harlow took me last night were all staying at harlows except that lloyd and brenda went back this morning and he chose not to tell his wife that we had a good life didnt we what where did that comefromso far so good he said cautiously and every bit of it stolen he could put off telling her that for a little while yet i used to wonder did you and harlow he didnt ask did we what he spoke the truth while he had the chance yes while you were carrying mustafa we were careful your father never caught us mmm but never after we were married karen good she shifted a little it itches she shifted again burns what did you call it novabliss if you run across dr nogales i need some he found someone with a label and told him that karen needed a doctor that might get something done but rita nogales should see her he looked into some rooms he stopped at reception and spoke with lisa schiavo then he went to the library the obvious place to wait for a doctor caravan again a multitude of entries cap avan map three klicks of the neck and a twelveklick stretch of land between the road and the ocean were all shaded in tan call it twenty square klicks all property of the caravans a scatter of rectangles and a sprinkling of square dots just the far side of the spaceport and another scattering just short of the neck and no other buildings in between to the west the road ran off the map and jeremy wondered windfarm iviap restricted material access code wind farm restricted material access code destiny town that was well mapped with a zoom feature he could sketch the details of jeremy hearsts life onto this he should but it felt too much like work and there was something he wanted more caravan cargo nothing wrong word caravan export nope if he knew exactly what wagons carried and what they needed hed know how to deal for it try caravan replacements bandages whiskey considered as medicine paint from spiral town oil from twerdahi town silver fern tea from the shire did the caravans carry hightech medicine it wasnt listed and hed never seen such not for yutzes at least ammunition guns gun oil and cloth the cylinder on the little reboring thing in tucker wagon shark guns and tools to maintain them nothing about spadoni or he didnt know a proper name for prole guns better not try caravan spadoni supplies a computer might be told to alert somebody try caravan sale s this years outgoing speckles and spices basic farming and clothmaking tools and some half familiar terms that were also tools cookware not the magical stuff nothing sticks to toys and shells and other luxury goods preserved meat root vegetables spices some of which had been sold to wave rider nothing much to learn caravan purchas e this year returning clocks and paint and begley cloth spices again and salt shire tea smoked fish from haven whiskey liqueurs and cheeses wave rider kept some of these in stock for twentyseven years hed watched and eavesdropped on caravan merchants merchants from terminus and destiny town and the winslow clan he had a very good idea what passed along the road and wave rider was involved in all of this except prole guns replacement purchase maintenance nothing at all and speckles if the route involved middlemen hed have seen something the sterilized seeds must go straight from the windfarm to wherever along the road they did their loading he went back to caravan and opened origin caravan in will coffeys vision now more than two centuries old caravans were not for commerce not for making wealth they were a way to deliver speckles to spiral town the impression would be that spiral town was the peak of civilization on destiny that sophistication dwindled with distance down the road weve been swindled the greed of merchants is that a lie too or a game the merchants play to entertain themselves a later entry the caravans are worleing they serve as recreation for some for some a way f life a forum for courtship for some but for all a hedge against the danger f inbreeding they allow us to learn more about the only other sapient species ever found they maintain the stability f our control experiment all that vastness of stars staring down at us and its just us and the otterfolk but argos might have heard more from earth by now control experiment base one now spiral town was to retain technology that was too heavy or fragile to transport visiting caravans would purchase the use of what they hadnt already stolen paint and clocks and begley cloth and in later years handcrafted work a generation later they teased the paintmaker system into duplicating itself on their next circuit they bought the duplicate from puzzled spirals they didnt bother with the clock factory but they tried it again with the begley cloth weavers jeremy read the results in bitter amusement the little mechanical spiders in the walls and roof of the apollo caverns could be snatched by handfuls spirals never interfered but they wouldnt dig anywhere else of course it was a safety measure a part of their program one wouldnt want mechanical vermin eating caverns into every hill and mountain on destiny but where was the damn code stored in the teaching tapes or lost with argos caravan geneology a handful of listings caravan geneology shire restricted material access code caravan geneology twerdahl t restricted material access code caravan geneology tail town restricted material access code somebody somewhere was keeping genealogical records and keeping them hidden hed seen an ominous degree of continuity in the families that held the wagons he remembered three generations in ibnrushd wagon outsiders not welcome how could he learn avalon restricted material access code space shuttle designs vidtapes test results wow six crashes in fiftyone years no deaths mentioned a vivid description of the tenth flight by the first humans to orbit say what hed read it and failed to believe it he had to go back for it the shuttle didnt have a pilot on board it was flown by onboard programs and a pilot on the ground a box of varied design but rigidly exact size fit into the shuttles rectangular cargo space one such box was a cabin for two passengers and an array of tools passengers had flown twice that first pair of women went up to repair a satellite the second pair something political jeremy felt massive disappointment had mustafa ever said that hed gone into space personally he couldnt remember but hed daydreamed from time to time of persuading mustafa to help him stow away aboard a shuttle the space wasnt even there harlows words didnt make sense together maybe hed remembered wrong try it anyway hydraulic empirf a political entity that controls its citizens h controlling the flow f wafer tuck my bird what sorry it was no trivial thing thousands of years of eastern despotisms had been of that nature water was life dig a canal system guard the canals if a town opposes the government block the canals dam or pollute the river confiscate the wheat or rice two towns in a drought strip one of food send it all to the second gain the second towns support make deadly enemies of the first but it wont matter they will die hydraulic empires never died no matter how far they slid into decadence they lived on until destroyed by barbarians beyond the border hydraulic empires grew with the rising level of communications and transport on earth a moment came at which one government could rule the world forever afterward the united nations controlled not just water but communications via comsats electric power from sunpower satellites and every resource that could be labeled lim ited the united nations in its last days had launched the avalon expedition last days he skimmed picking it up little by little ah theyd grown their own barbarians theyd been brought down by a coalition of populations throughout the solar system each as great or greater than the population of destiny there followed two hundred years of stagnation before one civilization stretched from sol to the far comets one empire with a stranglehold on what reading between the lines everything the web controlled everything that flowed water hydrogen information diet supplements placement of orbitting habitats and kinetic energy especially kinetic energy what moved through interplanetary space averaged twenty klicks per second fusion explosions were nothing compared to that every habitat in motion within sol system was assigned its orbit keep to it or be treated as a meteor in a spasm of creativity the web had launched argos and a third expedition restricted material access code the thrust of the lecture was that sol system had become one vast resourcecontrol empire sluggish but able to make long plans there werent any barbarians because there was no outside a million years from now it would still he in place outsiders and their barbaric ideas would not be welcome in sol system there was no home to return to jeremy he looked up rita karens itching like crazy did you take her off novabliss i cut the dose as per your suggestion right and its great to hear her making plans again but now shes itching ill go see her come along ritas tendency was to outrun him and what the hell he knew the way but she glanced back and then waited hows the leg i did eight blocks last night i guess we can take the cast off after we see karen ive been reading about hydraulic empires silence she was fishing through her head sol system that old tenthyear lecture its a reason why we cant go back but thats just mind games jeremy anyone can think of reasons why we shouldnt do what we cant do anyway suppose a government didnt control water just speckles a disgusted look then rita nogales walked away from him she held the lift they descended in silence she walked away from him again outside in another lift and he reached karens room a good ten minutes behind her it was too active something was wrong four doctors crowded the room and one left at a halfrun jeremy backed against the corridor wall and resting on his crutches waited rita nogales noticed him and came out jeremy did karen have trouble controlling her weight no damn after all we live at wave rider she just eats a lot of destiny sea life if she needs to lose a few kilos so do i was she doing that a week ago i dont know all right right now karens getting all the attention she can stand right the whole damn hospitals worrying about her they dont need a twitchy husband on crutches getting in their way she said and walked away fast over her shoulder she added go eat go home go read but dont block any doctors now there were two doctors in there with karen one saw jeremy still there and came out his label said malcolm evans he was having trouble keeping his smile on dont let all this activity worry you he said karen is rejecting superskin thats all but its not supposed to happen maybe this batch threw off a sport clinics keep batches of superskin all over destiny town and on up the road nogales is off to get a different batch for uh karen and waither is phoning patients who got superskin from batch one so you can s evans caught a gesture from the other doctor and turned away without finishing the sentence control experiment jeremy couldnt concentrate he had to read it twice though the idea wasnt complicated a population to be experimented upon would be split the control experiment was the group to which nobody did anything these were the rats that didnt ingest carcinogens didnt have to run mazes with traps in them werent bothered by flashing lights or loud noises the patients who got placebos instead of medicine you watched for differences between the control group and the experimental group control experiment base one the lives were trying to carve from th wilderness would be a risk even f argos had not deserted us base one is thriving they tell us theyre living according to the guidelines laid down for argos project in s l system isolated on a peninsula with the neck blocked theyre safe from whatever destiny life might throw at them with one horrifying exception fatum mortem parnelli is our prison we must live within range f the planets only known potassium source inside a maze f twisty little destiny ecologies all different granted that nothing has come after us yet the lesson f avalon seems clear enough trust nothing in an unfamiliar environment i propose to designate base one as a control experiment where the primary experiment is terminus establish an overview bureau give it authority over the crab base one and haunted bay and whatever communities arise elsewhere whatever risks we take here the larger population will survive provided that we can secure the crabs speckles supply w l coffey hydroponics idiot how could he conceivably expect to do that the caravan systemcoffeys proposalwas only as good as the windfarm and terminus if either failed terminus hadnt failed it had fissioned destiny town was thriving but what of spiral town a couple of generations of a control experiment might have made sense two and a half centuries later why on earth would they still need a control experiment hed come to the library looking for distraction and found this overview bureau was two doors up from medical they still had charge of the crab spiral town the road towns haunted bay and otterfolk and all he could walk there but why bother a government bureau was not likely to give up its authority over anything from destiny towns viewpoint bringing spiral town into civilization would only risk the flow of begley cloth clocks and handicrafts down the road destiny town hadnt failed the windfarm would twentyseven years ago andrew dowd would have killed all the prisoners and left nobody to harvest the speckles dolores nogales had wanted to shoot up the toolshed there would be other revolts other escapes when the speckles flow stopped it wouldnt be destiny town that went specklesshy jeremy made his way to karens room only rita nogales was on duty karen was asleep her burns were covered with new patches of superskin jeremy took the bus back to harlows lies whatever risks we take the larger population will survive provided that we can secure base ones speckles supply will coffey hydroponics it was an invitation to disaster cooking a dinner in someone elses kitchen it worked partly because he had harlow to tell him where the tools were kept there was that one moment of disorientation when harlow began taking vegetables bacon and a calfs liver out of halfinvisible envelopes all the same size he lurched over to study the things these come out of a machine that used to be mounted in cavorite harlow said laughing at his astonishment thousands a day we feed it sand we feed the bags back in too dont you have she trailed off he said speckles pouches merchants sell speckles in these i never saw them used for anything else she nodded then she showed him how to make meringue shells they cut fruit into the shells men lie to their wives harlow said women lie to their husbands she sipped at her brandy brandy wasnt familiar to jeremy and he thought he was being cautious with it he said ive gone through this in my head scripted it my lines her lines im not who she thought i was im a crab shy right i killed a man and had to run right i was in prison right but never convicted of anything i didnt hurt anyone getting out except andrew dowd i can say all that but harlow how can i tell karen that i knew her sister what oh barda barda was a trusty when i got to the windfarm i never met barda we escaped together brenda must have told you the rest we helped her run the swan barda told you about us you already knew us karen they were dining by firelight and an awesome variety of candles harlow was mostly shadow he couldnt make out her face not you you were a shock harold though and her mother espania winslow and karen as a little girl harlow when i last saw barda she was all right i never told karen that when did karen last see her at the trial when they took her away it was just karen and barry and espania harold didnt go did barda tell you what she did no poison the whole second class at wide wades two students died the proles had to know that jeremy realized the parole board decides who does the cooking thats why they made her a trusty you think thats funnyand you knew what happened to barda and never told karen jeremy you she trailed off he said barda got as far as the swan but after that and the longer i waited the harder it was to say anything now its twentyseven years harlow ill lose her leave it out tell karen you escaped from the windfarm dont tell her who came along she watched him absorb that no barda no barda so how did you get to the inn lets see if barda didnt tell me about wave rider he played it through his mind i didnt know it was there i was running home back across the neck if i meet a caravan im dead heres an inn i can cook merchants dont notice a chef a week later ive heard too much nobody hut a merchant gets across the neck alive at least it doesnt sound so premeditated harlow said why did you come here mmm carders boat jeremy you were nearly home with your board and your gloves you could have crossed the weed straight to shore that would put you on the beach at at the inn there warkans tavern with bloocher farm right next door yes harlow they would not have been glad to see me who would but theyd take you in why did you throw your life to the ocean currents how did you get to know me so well i pulled you under the surfboards twentysix years ago repeatedly it comes back to me but i dont know you even karen didnt know you why didnt you go home i had to know where cavorite went harlow laughed in the dark jeremy he tried to tell her but he barely remembered himself cavorites path was the path of humankind from the stars down to destiny to spiral town on to the mainland and out again to the stars jemmy bloocher was tracing the path of cavorite and he was looking for a home when he killed fedrik hed blown his home apart hed left spiral town then married and settled down the first chance he got tagged by the caravan he hadnt resisted there was the road and he followed it donning the life of a caravan yutz like a wellfitting glove hed never taken it off until his life was threatened after that there was joy in learning and exploring but his roots waved in the air the farther he went the less he was tied to anything at all unless it was to loria bednacourt rejected by loria and by twerdahl town hed gone mad still mad perhaps hed rebuilt the life of a pit cuisine chef from nothing more than escaped felons and the abandoned wreck of an inn when that collapsed in blood he did it again at wave rider and he settled in as wave riders pit chef and forgot cavorite for twentyseven years i knew where cavorite was he said it was just down the road and a bus every two days but anyone who asked me to pay for something would know i didnt belong theyd put me back in the winds or kill me after a while i stopped thinking about cavorite i burrowed in and spent twentyseven years halfasleep theres a civilization out there harlow spiral town and the crab are all barred from it and i forgot i just forgot then karen burned herself he said and here i am and now what he couldnt tell her what hed decided he didnt know what shed do harlow was of destiny town he was of spiral town and hed learned too much hed learned what it really meant to be a crab shy hed learned about the overview bureau but he could tell her a little i cant stay here forever as soon as karens better back to wave rider i guess i want to stop at the swan maybe i can figure out what happened to them to barda want company sure his mouth had run ahead of his mind dont you have a shop to run here i can get belle kuiger to cover with a few days notice youll be shorthanded come the caravan i can help i miss wave rider jeremy she reached across to take his hand i miss you he was harlows guest and everyone else had gone home best to be wary here he asked why did you leave i always you didnt notice what was happening dominance games you and the rest of the family property rights harolds brothers and sister didnt like it when harold married me they waited it out but when harold died he didnt leave a will they could hassle me i could hassle them it just looked better to let them buy me out and you you didnt do anything with what you were just the pit chef werent you but i thought you had some authority karen she sided with her brothers will they want you at wave rider she settled back in her chair the firelight behind her im sorry i wasnt thinking still they might want the help with karen in medical and you in a cast and the caravan coming he got himself onto his crutches a little off balance the brandy harlow wrapped herself around him for a deep kiss thank you she said and held him steady until he had his balance he hadnt felt this since karen burned herself the flash of lust had knocked him off balance but his breath was coming back and his mind was catching up he made his toppling footcrutchesfoot way to bed maybe harlow hadnt noticed any man could miss a signal lisa schiavo told him at reception karen was dead but but what happened she was reading it off her screen karen winslow had a severe allergic reaction that led to a heart attack mr winslow a human body is really very good at doing unexpected things but they had the other batch of superskin schiavo didnt seem to be used to this ill let you talk to dr nogales why dont you wait in the library crutches took his attention until hed reached the library what now the computers were all occupied he sat down dead not karen someone else scores of patients must be wearing transplants from that bad batch of superskin picture them collapsing everywhere like a plague mixups would be routine nah hed never be able to tell her never have to tell her a patient got up and left jeremy looked at the vacated screen hed learned all he cared to of cavorite no wait law caravan ref overview bureau law overview bureau restricted material access code passenger caravan nothing you wouldnt just hail a caravan and buy a ticket caravans werent transport they were a way of moving speckles and theyd be filed that way meanwhile try passenger bus one set of buses moved around the city back and forth along the road you stopped it where you liked the usual gesture and a lot of flex in the schedule two buses ran from destiny town all the way to the far end at fifty klicks per one started at dawn on alternate days the other at noon both returned the next day over and over neck map hed seen these pictures as a child maps made in orbit by argos before the mutiny a blackbronzeyellow forest ran thickly down the fat side of the crab sparsely down the narrow side joined at the neck and ran on into the mainland but this next was more recent taken by the cyclops telescope the road was in place chugs were pulling thirteen wagons amazing how much detail showed below the water crude otterfolk cities built hefty to withstand currents not cities at all the text said but walls to guide currents and precipitate sand to provide refuge for destiny fish and extend the haunted bay environment by a little the back of the crab was all cliffs the sea bottom dropped straight down what had he hoped to see there was no way across the neck save with a caravan swan inn open may see crime files case license terminated may current site corsos camp waikiki children ages to earth those dates harold winslow must have noticed he was paying for too much electricity hed terminated the swans power license a year after jeremy reached wave rider how had barda and her crew survived that and now it was a childrens camp and buses stopped hed seen that crime o that was the record of duncan nicks arrest caught hiding out at the swan sent to the windfarm the loot never found what jeremy had in mind seemed possible hed started to cry they were all looking and the hell with them he let it come karen i dont want to go a doctor got him onto his crutches and led him out and sat him down in an empty room rita nogales found him there all right he said what happened thats still under debate we lost her jeremy but the problem may not stop there if batch one as i went badyes understand it karen rejected batch one so another batch was found hope batch from hope clinic last night she rejected that and went into a coma they loaded her with antihistamines but she was dead by the time i could get here we couldnt resuscitate her jeremy there might be something atypical about karen too much sunlight for too many years too much of something in destiny seafood or just haunted bay destiny seafood or something genetic anything then again maybe batch one is bad karen reacted to it and it set her up for a reaction to any breed of superskin we need to know jeremy were doing an autopsy in spiral town there would be no question that the community held title to a lifegiver do what you need to can i see her of course but she hesitated i dont recommend it of course it was his duty to but rita nogales was shrinking back in her chair withdrawing from him with that for a clue his mind showed him more than he wanted to see of what karen must look like all right shall we take that cast off you fine he rested on his stick for a time looking across the road considering how he might get inside cavorite then he flagged the bus and boarded it back at harlows he called wave rider immediately getting harlow to place the call brenda picked up shes dead isnt she how did you know oh daddy and she wept the damn trouble he said is medical looks like the power of life and death written in stone brenda nogales still doesnt know just what killed her i should come home no jeremy youll have to stay a few days that was harlow he looked around why legal reasons and to bury karen brenda i have to stay a few days all right daddy call and tell us when the funeral is harlow showed him how to hang up he said legal why because youll inherit karens piece of wave rider that jolted him i never asked about a will she told brenda and lloyd where to find it what does karen own i think onequarter but it wasnt any of my business thisll make me conspicuous wont it harlow somebody will be putting new information in a file marked jeremy winslow who is fiction its fiction but i wrote it jeremy trust me the next day medical released karens body they arranged a funeral for the day after funerals werent important events in spiral town but brenda came and mustafa and rita nogales they buried her with black pepper and lemon trees at her head and feet the children and harlow stayed with him while he talked to nogales thanks for coming i know karen would appreciate nogales rode him down the autopsy showed some abnormal chemistry going on she told them with a touch of belligerence some of us think its destiny seafood people have been losing weight that way for a long time we dont really know how long i do it myself but we damn sure didnt evolve to eat it have you any idea if she was eating mother and i had lunch together brenda said quietly avocado and seafood surf clam and earthlife crab mayonnaise jeremy listened as morales quizzed his daughter like a felon she went away mumbling to herself rita nogales was a solver of puzzles like jeremy himself if hed known that well then what two days later jeremy winslow horn hearst owned onefifth of wave rider jeremy read through a thick file of data and learned more of the restaurant than hed learned in twentyseven years karens three siblings held another fifth each the last piece rested with an entity that called itself andys bank investment outfit harlow said they bailed us out with some money just after we opened in spiral town the law would have dithered for much longer sometimes years he said so its communication harlow answered that and an attitude the law doesnt like ambiguities if theyd found any discrepancies in the history of jeremy winslow theyd be on your tail already so im real real and a man of property lets celebrate i want to be on the bus at dawn dawn he couldnt sit still he paced leaning on the stick careful with the knee now heres my plan dawn bus i want to get off at the swan thatll be about midmorning ill flag down the noon bus and get to wave rider after someone else has finished making dinner theres a noon bus why dont you take that one harlow meet me at the swan well go on to wave rider in a day or so well know if you and the rest of karens clan can get along no ill dawn bus early dinner good what are the neighbors like but harlow didnt have friends she could invite at short notice she had not repeated an invitation that might have been only his imagination nonetheless that seemed ominous his leg was healing nicely he was able to get around the kitchen without the cane he packed for tomorrows bus trip and then they spent the afternoon building a dinner for two she opened what she called a halfbottle of wine and tried to make him see what made it superior to whiskey it was weaker anyway again he thought he was being cautious harlow hadnt played among otterfolk in years nor visited the inn and he had stories to tell her he told her what its the law was about he got her to telling tales of destiny town and he told her about playing with varmint killer in spiral town lie knew hed drunk too much when he tried to stand up harlow got under his shoulder and led him to bed she was weaving more than he was she got him down to the futon then she asked shall i stay he said of course woman its your apartment being more obtuse than should be required of any man and he let his eyes close and his mouth fall open he knew no more until morning the windfarm i n n k e e p e r s not you not your family your guests passing strangers nobody goes near the otterfolk birthground understand me harold georges manet overview bureau hed leave without her let her take the noon bus if he found her asleep leave her a note but she was bright and perky and handing him a mug of tea in the predawn dark backpacks cane the walk to the road loosened up his stiff knee apollo finished rising they flagged down the bus harlow pointed out sights as they moved out of spiral town she was asleep before they reached terminus too soon she woke mount canaveral she crowed we used to launch cavorite from here land by the ocean refuel fly it back here to load up ever see this yourself no she squinted up at the mesa rim hows the knee not that good that looks like quite a climb the bus rolled on harlow asked whereabouts did you and andrew and didnt finish the bluff was in view andrew might still be there bones picked clean and maybe scattered jeremy pointed well past it and said far side of the swan on the same side andrew would have gone out the same way i did here was the bridge they signaled to stop the bus donned packs and got off jeremy leaning heavily on his stick like the bridge the swan sagged a little lights glowed inside though the hologram sign wasnt lit the pit barbecue smelled of recent fire children were all over the place midteens commanding hordes of youngsters with moderate success they looked too busy to talk jeremy and harlow went in looking for an adult alexandre chorin was a little old a little heavy a little slow to be chasing after children it was easy to see him as hiding from the noise here in the shade of what had been the swans dining room and was now littered with games and toys but he seemed glad to see them or anyone jeremys grandchildren will be old enough soon harlow told him we thought wed stop off and look i used to fish here jeremy put in we still do chorin said quickly the lake perch are nice theres a pit barbecue we use sometimes but then there was that trouble and everyone stopped coming harlow said jeremy my children missed this entirely fishing at swan lake its still swan lake oh yes harlow do the children know oh yes its one reason they come duncan nick the city planted an oak over him its just up the slope you cant miss it and there are horror stories about the windfarm innkeepers in a hoarse whisper theres no knowing how many people stayed here overnight and werent ever seen again well harlow said id have thought one felon would have babbled stories how many were there a dozen five the caravaners say all gone when the proles came if you go up to swan lake you can see how easy it must have been to get into the hills jeremy had found a brochure day rates rates for stays of a week list of what a child should pack a map whats it like staying here may we look around harlow asked of course outside too if youre going to the lake take some fishing poles they went upstairs pro forma harlow went into the nearest room and bounced on a tiny carefully made bed nice move but i didnt leave anything up here jeremy said her hands smoothed out the bed any interest in anything just the roof two floors up you rest ill go up what should i look for well the guide spots working but see if it got damaged the floors begley cloth see if its been kept up look around at the view all directions harlow its probably not worth the effort she laughed and went feet quick on the stairs jeremy went into the mens bathroom he tried the taps theyd got the plumbing working again he used a toilet then stayed there private thinking harlow was staking a claim jeremy winslow was in mourning but set that aside because it was twentyseven years late to tell harlow to get lost and innuendos were getting harder to miss and that wasnt the problem anyway he needed to get out of harlows sight for seven hours would have been great half an hour would do might not hed be climbing all over a hillside hed see the hill from the roof she met him on the stair what i thought id look for myself i never stared at a guide spot before somebody whacked the casing with a crowbar looks like but it must be working or there wouldnt be lights the begley cloths new what else they walked out on the roof jeremy opened the powerhouse casing and looked in thats a new guide spot too it was a snarl of line wire when i left here he turned in a slow circle that way is swan lake the proles think they went out that way but that waylook across the road she nestled close to sight along his arm thats how we came and there are valleys where we could survive for weeks mr chorin didnt say the caravan sold them clothing but i bet they did a lot a proud oak stood above the hillside easily a quartercentury old duncan nicks oak where the womens cesspit had been what was that growing around its base to jeremys eye it stood out like settlermagic paint greenery tinged with yellow and orange flecks on black from the oak he traced narrow paths to a thicket of growth greenandblack shadows with touches of orange the other ancient cesspit broader paths led from duncan nicks oak down to the lodge and to the lake and east to the ridge another way out he said pointing and to a stand of fruit trees that must have replaced the old spice garden with a hint of orange in the shadowed greenblack around the trunks you think barda got away harlow said she could have i can couldve harlow hugged him from behind chin on his sfioulder he plunged on couldve told it to karen that way still can karen had barda has brothers suddenly he knew what to do weve got four hours shall i show you how to fish alexandre chorin stored their backpacks behind the desk for them and rented them fishing gear all assembled for instant use do you use flies harlow stared jeremy knew just enough to say harlow its a lure you float mr chorin have you got actual bait no try digging in the orchard okay the graveyardturnedspicegarden had turned fruit orchard speckles grew all through it sparsely as if a gardener had failed to weed them out jeremy studiously ignored them while he dug for earthworms there were children all along the near shore fishing throwing frisbees batting at a ball tethered to a pole a worn transparent tent sprawled loosely along the south side of the lake with room for twenty or thirty underneath six growing earthlife trees had become the tent poles destiny trees had been chopped down to make room harlow said the way the buses run yeah kids would have to stay overnight hence the tent by silent agreement they walked around the north shore until most of the activity was out of sight and hearing they took off their shoes harlow didnt flinch from putting worms on a hook you can use anything organic but we didnt bring anything he told her they flung the lines a fair distance out and waited drowsy in the sun reasonable time passed and nothing struck bare white rock stretched far into the lake coming to a point a meter above deep water jeremy walked out onto it set his cane down and carefully balanced flung out his line waited a fish struck he pulled it in harlow came to join him she maneuvered to put them nearly back to back moving to make more room he stumbled started to fall arms windmilling she reached and had him and pulled he backed into her hip hard she lost her balance and splashed into the lake he barely saved himself from going after her the rock fell off steeply jeremy went down on his belly and reached for her hand she could swim of course she swam over and with his arms to anchor her walked up the rock her clothing clung to her like paint the sight of her froze him like a rabbit in torchlight the words hed planned to say evaporated she was furious she started to say so instead she looked into the heat of his stare and then began to pull his shirt open he pulled them together no other response ever crossed his mind until much later he felt so incredibly good she curled against him and said tell me you didnt throw me in the lake just to rub up against me he laughed like a maniac then he said i swear to you by everything i own i did not right good there were children just out of sight they deemed it better to ignore them they sorted through their clothes looked them over critically put them on anyway jeremy asked did you bring a change sure you course he used his pole to fish her pole off the bottom they walked back down to the lodge dripping shed got his clothes almost as wet and muddy as hers alexandre chorins chuckle kept bubbling through his selfrestraint he had towels for rent they retrieved their packs and went upstairs men women change together in one room harlows suggestion was a wiggle of her eyebrow his answer a quick headshake they went in separate doors jeremy spilled his pack snatched up a shirt and shorts stripped and put them on rubbed a towel past his hair stuffed his wet clothes into the pack closed it and was out to hell with showering down the stair fast but limp past chorin and i think i want to see that oak just dont overdo it with that leg mr winslow he climbed the hill fast digging his stick in and pulling himself up hed seen speckles growing around duncan nicks oak but the oak was a bit conspicuous and the graveyard grove but that must get visitors his fragile plan had gone all to hell fall in the lake go back to the lodge to change anything for a moment alone with the speckles crop anything but he hadnt expected he certainly hadnt expected hadnt fought her off either couldnt shed wonder at his motives harlow was doing quite enough of that already yeah right karen im sony i have to do this here the ancient privy the mens groundhugging bristly plants with black stalks that split and split again to become orange thorns whose tips divided down to tiny tinier microscopic green needles these plants couldnt be ignored even if nobody here knew what they were children must have tasted the buds a cook who found speckles in the spice patch might try it on food did it taste like sterile speckles hed brought two bags hed forgotten to bring a glove he wrapped his hand in a silk scarf and took a pinch of tiny seeds and put them in his mouth and chewed as he stripped the speckles plants fresh speckles was a bit different try mixing it with salt he filled the first bag and pushed it deep in his pack and heard a rustle and knew it was harlow he didnt look around had she seen more than one bag he began stuffing the second bag she wouldnt find the other unless she dug deep in his pack she was nearly breathing in his ear now he said we will never have to buy speckles again is that what this is dont you know speckles plants does anyone outside the windfarm know what speckles looks like when its growing there must be pictures in the teaching programs restricted material access code but prisoners do get released from the windfarm youre evading we came out of the windfarm with fertile speckles we used them for cooking so the chef got to carry them i scattered them where i thought theyd grow now its twentyseven years later and i own a piece of a restaurant harlow i never had to worry about how to keep a restaurant solvent and now i know we lost a piece of the inn to people i never heard of they were there at the right time jeremy next time might be worse so i thought id fall in the lake and collect a bag of speckles on the way down to get myself changed wasnt i supposed to get wet that would have worked too if we both get wet that doesnt work if you get wet and then we rub all the water and mud into each others clothes that sends us both back together she smiled now he said look i only suspect its illegal you specklesshy idiot of course its illegal we cant stop buying speckles and still run a restaurant of course well have to buy speckles well get them from the caravans just like always but if hard times come theres a bag of speckles how many did you bring shed seen just the two one would have done any bus can get us back here for more okay stashed where only you and i can find it we dont tell anyone else you didnt think youd tell me its a crime harlow i thought id tell barry but as long as you know thats enough that ought to get her and he saw that it had wave rider had a secret and none knew it save jeremy and harlow the inner circle they arrived in time to scavenge the last of dinner three caravan suppliers had come early and were sharing a room otherwise the inn held most of karens siblings and children and inlaws everyone stayed polite and presently carried jeremys and harlows backpacks up to separate rooms theyd discussed that on the bus jeremy got to lloyd before they gathered for breakfast what have you and brenda told them about me about the windfarm brenda and i wont tell them anything jeremy we talked it over it just wouldnt be good lloyd laughed suddenly and then you show up with harlow she can help when the caravan sure at least the timing was sweet whatever the winslow clan remembered of their stepmother however much they mourned karen now a lifegiver whatever they thought of the pit chef who was probably rubbing up against his stepmotherinlaw they were shorthanded it was late autumn the outbound spring caravan was due in five days over the next few days harlow and the winslow clan found some sort of adjustment jeremy didnt have to watch dominance and accommodation games the trick was to stay outside he tended the pit and tried out some of what he thought hed learned in romanoffs and upgraded his tools for the onslaught to come he tested his leg by swimming with the otterfolk reacquainting himself with them if they noticed his game leg that was all to the good theyd guess why he wouldnt surf harlow and chloe surfed with them riding waves in tandem harlow had returned to the board as if shed never been away theyd need the otterfolks goodwill to get fish to feed the merchants harlow simply poured one bagful of speckles into their speckles shaker can its the obvious place for it the way we run the inn everyonell think someone else got us more speckles he stopped her from adding the second bag but he had no excuse at all a day later hed found one taste this she sipped smooth grapefruit and vodka and salt secret recipe he said speckles sea salt and speckles they called the drink a salty dog and the last bag of fertile speckles stayed in the bar rita nogales phoned she had answers fresh avocado reacting to speckles in the mayonnaise in karens and brendas mixed seafood dish produced a mild allergic reaction that disappeared without obtrusive symptoms only a patient already sick was threatened avocado picked two days earlier wouldnt react hardly surprising if nobody had noticed in two hundred years nogales was crowing sure that anyone she talked to must be just delighted she could live with throwing away hope batch and batch one but all the superskin on destiny jeremy was glad hed answered the phone anyone else would have screamed at the woman even he hung up in a black mood avocados what a lousy trivial with two days to spare johannes and eileen wheeler arrived with a wagonload of green and root vegetables pulled by two goats and a tug hell of a lot of prep work for three days of pure madness johannes told jeremy grinning and slapping a goats flank i expect you can use the help yes do not introduce me to the goats johannes had once insisted on doing that before jeremy put on his butchers hat for a day then he and harlow faced karens entire family then all four men went off to hunt and left just the women and the gimp jeremy didnt see any fireworks they were being civilized eileen tried once or twice to involve her father in some kind of property discussion as for the separate rooms theres no point harlow told him we came here together they know where you were staying they dont know how long you fought me off hey we probably even walk like were rubbing up against each other you do i have this deceptive limp jeremy were not doing them a favor here people like to file people in subroutines its easier for them if they think of us as a couple matters of courtesy be damned the room would be needed a day ahead of the caravan harlow moved into jeremys room he liked it he dreamed of karen and woke guilty but with a woman in his bed he could sleep they came at noon announced by a cloud of dust a wagon was the length and width of a bus but taller and two tugs were enough to pull it they numbered a full twenty wagons no yutzes yet but eighty merchants and perhaps twentyfive suppliers they rolled past wave rider and out of sight in spiral town the caravans arrival had been very like this wave rider had twentytwo rooms and that had always been barely enough caravans carried tents after all and did not look for unnecessary expense wave rider housed merchant families with elders and children merchants relatives and businesses that dealt with the caravan were the caravans supply line and they would want rooms they often doubled up romances and marriages had started that way forty or so to be housed in twentytwo rooms over a hundred to be fed wave rider geared up for business the spring caravan the natives are irrelevant to humankind on the crab theyre not as madly versatile as men wayne parnelli marine biology there was no winter in destinys year removing winter allowed the other seasons to be almost the right length for the earthtime clocks in order for the spring caravan to reach destiny town in spring it must reach the neck in autumn wave rider hosted the spring caravan in early autumn and the previous summer caravan carrying goods acquired along the crab three weeks later it was autumn now the nights were cooling dionne party of eight filed out onto the pier to watch the sunset old wayne dionne traded in terminus selling carved and painted shells and similar goods collected along the road by his family in dionne wagon jeremy had known them for years when they filed back toward the fire pit wayne called jeremy meet hester shes old enough for the wagons now hello hester waynes granddaughter had grown tall and kept the quiet smile will any of you be staying then no the tents enough for us just meals tonight and tomorrow we wouldntmiss your cooking i have something for you jeremy showed wayne what hed found on the beach west of here a flattish shell nearly a meter long rainbows played along its inner face where jeremy had polished it wayne looked dubious jeremy persisted it doesnt look like a back shell does it more like a skullcap this at the end would be where the beak extension broke off the beast would be huge jeremy set it aside wayne said no sell it to me somebody might be interested back in destiny town forty money changed hands jeremy asked wayne what would you think of my joining a caravan and he watched waynes slow grin unlikely why would you want to at your age i never saw a caravan pit barbecue everything i know is secondhand you do fine would i do better if id been up and down the road maybe would you want me in the cooking crew if you had to eat the result maybe hester what do you think the girl smiled jeremy grinned back hester hadnt tasted his cooking or the roads wayne wasnt taking him seriously wayne wasnt a merchant chloe and harlow came out with the large salad bowl harlow stopped for a lingering kiss before going back in more merchants were gathering around the fire pit or watching the sunset fade and the otterfolk play merchants and suppliers did business here not many would bother to talk to the chef jeremy wore his pit chefs persona like a vividly painted mask and of course the light hid him too jeremy had persuaded harold winslow that he could run a pit barbecue so harold had run a strip of lighting along the decks edge above where jeremy dug the pit my guests eat late hed said in that electric blaze jeremy hadnt been able to tell whether food was raw or cooked in two weeks it had become much easier than trying to judge by sunsetlight and in this bluetinged light no merchant from tim bednacourts past had ever recognized him this is one thing you almost never get on the road an older man said not to jeremy lettuce he looked around for inn personnel you grow this yourself half our back garden is planted in lettuce jeremy said and kept the neutral grin as he recognized joker ibnrushd aged and weathered and gone a bit soft he babbled on after all itd be wilted mush before it got here from the terminus farms joker was frowning in the harsh bluetinged light better not give him time to think about where hed seen this barbecue chef im jeremy winslow part owner youre new here not quite new im dzhokhar schilling my wife greta my daughter shireen jeremy clasped his hand and said dzhokhar schilling careful of his pronunciation because jeremy winslow had never called this man joker hello greta hi shireen more handclasps for the young woman and the tenyearold girl joker was saying were ibnrushd you buy our cookware ive spent time at wave rider but usually i eat in the restaurant i see enough of pit barbecues but its a new thing to me greta laughed for twelve years weve worked dzhokhars shop in destiny town joker had married a woman fifteen years his junior she was small pale of skin and hair a bit plain too easy to overlook jeremy asked her youve never been on the road no dzhokhar has been trying to prepare me jeremy trying to picture that said we hear interesting rumors suspecting he already knew more than he was supposed to and less had joker explained joker grinned at them both things not to be told the tuna must be cooked through by now jeremy drafted lloyd and together they turned it onto a platter and carved the schillings watched other merchants gathered to watch the show and to serve themselves jeremy asked joker how was that joker ate a mouthful skillful i have to ask everything i know about pit cooking i learn by asking ive sometimes thought of joining a caravan yes i see joker was amused try grilling your fish when something has delayed the wagons cook and carve by dying sunset light and quicksilver already gone youll know then what a caravan chefs first law is get more lights stick with the lights jeremy turnover was high in the caravans but there were still familiar faces put jeremy winslow under blue light dress him in white age him scar him no merchant would know him from the past but even dressed in a merchants flamboyant garb tim bednacourt still might be remembered in daylight of course hed be crazy to go now it was the wrong caravan after the spring caravan moved on harlow had fallen in love with wave rider not harold winslow maybe not jeremy either if jeremy married her shed have his fifth of the inn after he was gone come spring speckles would be sprouting around the lettuce patch hed imposed that time limit on himself wave rider was too public a speckles crop couldnt be ignored for long in early summer would come the outbound autumn caravan and he must go but go how hadnt he had this conversation once long ago with murderers trying to hijack a wagon nobody could cross the neck alive nobody could travel the road except with a caravan even a lone captured wagon would be attacked tim bednacourt had run the length of the crab by keeping to the peaks no man had climbed now he was nearing fifty and he limped now hed have a secure speckles supply but could he still climb climb along the frost line dip down for food and water up and over to circle around any bandits hed even considered traveling up the narrow side of the crab but on the maps that looked lethal hed need a way to cross the neck a boat a surfboard the currents ran the right way hed want a cockade too he hadnt found them growing anywhere what he was looking for was the least crazy way back and that was to talk himself aboard a caravan if it was even possible his family was serving dinner in the restaurant out of earshot he could sound out a few peripheral people now the slowcooking part of dinner was taking care of itself guests milled and sampled waver riders people milled and cooked jeremy joined a dozen guests out on the pier he knelt at the edge of the pier water lapping just below his knees and reached out with a slice of sweet potato to the tenyearold girl he said shireen go like this three flattish heads popped up winston he said and one of the otterfolk came forward to take the sweet potato short arms wide hands with four thick short fingers jeremy handed sweet potato slices to shireen shireen began distributing them to the other otterfolk winston was still watching jeremy jeremy curled and uncurled just his fingers no thumbs eight sixteen twentyfourfish prawns a double handful one surf clam fingers wiggled dont bust your chops well take what you can get winston disappeared tomorrow he would be back with what he could collect and would tell jeremy what he wanted but that was easier by daylight and while they were both in the water the little girl asked jeremy can i go in with them depends what are you wearing no cried greta schilling unseen in shadow until now tomorrow morning yes dear yes mommy greta turned to jeremy we wear our good clothes for your first nights banquet you know reproving mrs schilling you flatter us please i am greta jeremy is it safe for a child to swim with otterfolk absolutely we depend on it if we dont entertain them they dont fish for us greta i know that name shireen her greatgrandmother shireen died twelve years ago dzhokhar and i we both loved her so i married dzhokhar livnah and gave her name to our first daughter it took jeremy a moment to untangle that in his mind but the implicationsso dzhokhar settled with you in destiny town yes for twelve years and took gretas surname of course his wife was with armstrong wagon you see but she retired many merchants travel the road for a time and then retire to a family shop dzhokhar could have married another merchant but we knew each other dzhokhar livnah yes why no nothing but hed always assumed that everyone on ibnrushd wagon was named ibnrushd assumed that joker was single too i only wondered how a man named livnah joined ibnrushd wagon she shook her head there are things im not supposed to tell if he forced too many merchants to say that too often it would be noticed but a caravan trainee was exactly who he wanted to question he compromised is there anything ican tell you she laughed no really ive been listening to firepit talk for twentyseven years they speak a secret language but ive picked up a little ibnrushd cooks and that is my language shireen tugged at her mothers arm the fence she said yes jeremy we walked down the beach this afternoon as far as a razormesh fence the beach beyond it looked nice private there were shells can you get us past that fence as i understand it jeremy said if i could get you past that fence you wouldnt see a restaurant here next year thats the local birthground for the otterfolk greta and the overview bureau is very serious about that oh she thought a moment then asked after you fillet the tuna where do you take the bones and head soup stock everything interesting goes into the cauldron on the caravans you wont carry that size cauldron why do you shudder he shook his head thinking that a chef could always break off conversation for some convenient urgency is it true that we must get pregnant by men along the road and the men make the local women pregnant thats what they say they say also that you merchants are almost inhumanly good at doing that with us mortals she dimpled i thought dzhokhar might have been having fun with me well i havent had the training yet most of the merchants had gone up the road and the rest had gone to bed the winslow family cleaned up after them to some extent then quit jeremy went up to bed he could climb a flight of stairs now but not run up it he began stripping down found he had some help harlow breathed in his ear so you want to join a caravan she must have felt him lose his balance and wince as pain crunched in his healing knee he said ive been thinking about it who told you yvonne dionne told me my husband was talking about hitting the road yvonne and wayne the only thing between their shop and mine is a sandwich shop jeremy were you serious is this a sudden thing still thinking as fast as ever in his life jeremy said not sudden but i never could have talked karen into doing it and just to get away from here but with that limp oh i can wait for the autumn caravan ill be healed by then they were seated on the futon by now and he took her face in his hands will you marry me after the spring caravan leaves well id have to wouldnt i what why she laughed the caravans only take couples what you didnt know still laughing but you asked me to marry you first good hed been thinking that she could vote his onefifth share of wave rider this blindsided him everyone on a caravan is married what about rian and old shireen and joker wait joker was married well no not everyone a woman in her teens or twenties or a veteran who wants to die on the road but only if theyre a caravan family jeremy anyone else its couples otherwise there would be too many men i guess local help is supposed to be all men he was still stunned harlow why didnt i think of coming to you before you may be an instinctive liar jeremy she was the answer all along and hed been dodging and weaving no wait im a spiral youre a girl we almost dont talk to each other in spiral town i thought id got that crap out of my head hmmm can we get on a caravan will you come with me she hesitated you know there are certain rules i doubledamned dont seem to know what they are wed both be rubbing up against locals mostly younger locals who can make babies well be trained for that at the camp i dont really know more than that but i hear jokes sounds like fun he put a question in that and she grinned we can still rub up against each other i remember the ibnrushds did she said you know how to cook but theyll train you to sit behind a counter and sell cookware and speckles ive watched only watched the third rule is very important keep the caravan secrets never tell my darling you seem to have learned a lot of what they never tell i listened to merchants at wave rider for years before you came ive spent more years talking to shopkeepers a lot of them retired from the wagons you know even so i dont know anything deep well have to persuade a wagonmaster that we can be trusted he thought smiled i could persuade someone that i have kept a secret i could ask what would happen if spadoni wagon fell into the hands of bandits better to trust me than someone who hasnt been tested what does it mean doubtfully should i tell you jeremy spadoni is where they keep the real guns tucker has the shark guns and ammo the stuff the yutzes use the yutzes dont see whats in spa doni and locals shouldnt have it let alone bandits if bandits stopped spadoni the whole caravan would have to deal with it any idea what those weapons are like some dont tell me dont tell anyone can we get in i dont know best if theres an opening on one of the wagons sometimes theyre shorthanded we can ask walther simonsen at romanoffs he knows youre the real thing the spring caravan wont be back in time to do us any good so theres no point in you talking to them talk to the suppliers yes harlow thank you can wave rider do without us both well hire someone id better tell someone where the extra speckles are brenda she was searching for something in his eyes i dont see why its so important to you oh damn of course i do i forget who you are you want to go home that was true and he nodded jeremy promise me you wont do anything stupid like what dont run away home when you get to spiral town disappearing from a caravan rouses all kinds of excitement they wouldnt leave until they found you or your corpse they could cut off the speckles to spiral town promise harlow i promise then ill get us on a caravan from autumn to summer was a happy time jeremy winslow paid attention look again it might he gone no way could he board a caravan without a background check hed made a whimsical choice twentyseven years ago and flow the computer had him as jeremy winslow born hearst what might willow and randall hearst have to say to that he went hack to medical to get his knee looked at and wangled two hours in the library willow hearst was dead killed by overweight randall hearst had become an alcoholic his periodic treatments were a matter of record risk it jeremy hearst born on the road was not a terribly happy child in destiny town he dropped out of wide wades in adolescence got into cooking anyway he took long walks along the beach with anyone who would come he swam he didnt risk the board caravan merchants need their legs harlow said that the bus stopped at baikunur beach where the shuttles were loaded prospective caravaners walked twenty klicks further to where theyd be trained and they dared not arrive limping there was a thing harlow couldnt help him with how could he get fertile speckles across the neck get them into a caravan a chef must carry speckles but nothing of destiny town technology crossed to the crab no caravan no wagon no man or woman crossed the neck without a skin search harlow said was that true he couldnt quite ask butharlow they take speckles pouches and the guns in spadoni wagon arent lowtech she shrugged at a guess the rest of a caravan might be destroyed but the prole guns in the wagon must not fall into bandit hands so phones or superskin or anything of settler magic would be kept in the wagon too and if a man couldnt get a pouch of speckles in there he sure couldnt get one back out jeremy considered a hidden pouch in a backpack he considered a trip to the neck by surfboard hide a pouch of speckles pick it up after the search and during the leavetaking banquet he began playing in wave riders kitchen in early spring jeremy was able to say to harlow close your eyes try this it was a sweet fruit jell cut to the size of a thumb and rolled in seeds delicious harlow said she considered sesame sesame and speckles she laughed at his chagrin nobody else would have guessed jeremy im the only one who knows you get your speckles free its the sesame and honey that costs she looked at what shed bitten in half pale brown sesame seeds bright yellow speckles you should dye them jeremy used a dark blue food dye dilute the tiny yellow seeds came out green as earthlife grass he could put green dye in the jell or make a rainbow of colors he dyed the sesame seeds red he called it festivity candy and then just festivity his only question now was whether dyed speckles seeds would sprout in spring in the lettuce patch they did and the autumn caravan departed at the height of summer the autumn caravan weve f d some animals that k like little armored volkswagens grigori dudayev senior md something about the position of the sun on his cheek brought jeremy winslow gently awake he was dozing upright in the drivers alcove harlow was driving behind them on the roof tanya hearst kept watch with steban the new yutz theyd picked up in haven they werent paying much attention in this territory they neednt there was farmland on both sides and large houses sparsely set people who feared bandits didnt build like this it was all new this must have been wilderness when last hed seen it jeremy wondered if he would recognize the new hann farm the sun it was midafternoon almost time to quit a caravan doesnt hurry if they didnt reach warkans tavern tonight theyd make it tomorrow some pointed structure poked up from the road too far ahead to make out jeremy looked downslope a mere halfklick to a strip of sand and then water dark with destiny devilhair weed it all looked strangely familiar he still didnt know where he was until somebody far ahead shouted warkans tavern angelo hearst climbed up from the sales window to see the word bounced down the caravans length to hearst wagon and angelos bellow sent it on while jeremy stared ahead in befuddlement oh of course hed been looking for carders boat which had been there forever until hed last seen carders boat moored offshore of tail town haunted bay fishermen used it as a dock it had swarmed with children on the day the caravan rolled through hed come home but fifty meters past the justvisible faзade of warkans tavern a slender triangular arch stood above the road in the road a gate or a barrier harlow was bringing the wagon to a stop it took a while for the chugs to get the idea but the message was welcome wagons behind were stopping too the lead wagons wanted a little more space first if you made chugs bunch up they wouldnt bring in as much weed and wouldnt get enough to eat locals were gathering on the hills above warkans tavern they knew merchants did no business now hearst wagon was at a halt harlow and jeremy gave the reins the practiced flip flip flip that freed the chugs a good trip they still had all twenty the spring caravan had come back somewhat shot up theyd found and obliterated a bandit nest they said obliterated maybe bandits hadnt bothered the autumn caravan the chugs drifted downslope angelo dropped straight from the roof showing off for his wife jeremy eased on down then gave a hand to harlow who didnt need it and tanya who didnt either wave riders pit chef always did that it irritated angelo and amused steban on the roof steban threw open the sides of the wagon then came down to help the others deploy cookware miller wagons people were doing the same the dark line of chugs had reached the sand hearst wagon carried tanya and angelo hearst angelos grandfather glen and the winslows five merchants meant room for only one yutz miller cookwagon carried three yutzes to make up for that glen hearst made small concessions to pay off the debt thus the caravan would be here two nights not all could afford to dine at warkans tavern or go into town but it didnt take both cookwagons to cook dinner hearst wagon would cook on the first night the line of chugs flowed into the waves jeremy and harlow moved well together unloading and deploying tools hanging an ostrich and four chickens the hunters had shot at this their steady efficiency and decades of practice made them the best in the caravan yutzes from all the wagons were gathering destiny firewood and digging out the pits something was bothering glen hearst he spent less time supervising than in looking toward town or the tavern or far up the road two electric wagons approached jeremy glanced that way from time to time as he worked atop one he picked out the glitter of begley cloth the wagons stopped short of the pointed structure and men began unloading them the barrier stood just at the border between warkans tavern and bloocher farm glen what is that thing never saw it before hearst and miller wagons had made all reasonable preparations for dinner and no sign of chugs the fires in the long pits were beginning to catch mind if i go look set up the tents first jeremy and harlow exchanged glances jeremy hadnt meant now there was time to break out the tents and set them up but not to walk most of a klick almost as far as warkans tavern glen knew that what had made him so touchy they busied themselves setting tentpoles and deploying tents and inflating pillows until a long black line of devilhair weed rolled out of the sea then all the traders and yutzes dropped their work and returned to their wagons as the chugs emerged pushing devilhair ahead of them hearst wagons crew settled on the roof with a liter of lemonade and their guns the chugs fed placidly then they all broke off at once and rolled uphill six long low shapes darted from the water all at once and wide apart only six a few guns sounded overeager yutzes quickly silenced four sharks stopped at the black weed two came on the caravan fired one long roll of thunder the two fell four sharks darted from the weed and into the next wave two lay dead jeremy was pretty sure hed hit one a few yutzes were still firing into the shredded bodies it wasnt just glen hearst the elders were in a fury at dinner they gathered in a small tight circle they fell silent when yutzes came to serve them harlow and jeremy approached the circle and were rebuffed yutzes did most of the work of serving dinner jeremy only had to get it off the fire while it wasnt yet charred in dying orange light he stopped to look at one of the dead sharks they were too chewed up to show detail hed look up lungshark if he ever reached another library the light was dying and so were the coals jeremy set his pan of pureed cherries and gelatin where theheat wouldnt char it hed practiced that and ruined several batches during the training period hed brought gelatin and honey and twenty pounds of seeds to roll it in all along the road hed found fruit to make jell every batch of festivity was different harlow was watching him she said i think your festivity candy was what really put us here it made us just that extra notch more desirable youre very desirable he kissed her harlow gestured toward the circle of elders lifted one brow harlow didnt like being treated as a child he said maybe when youre older dear were glen hearsts age lets eavesdrop no safe way love the yutzes know how to clean up lets go look at that gate warkans tavern was full of light and activity as they strolled past at the edge of bloocher farm they stopped beside the arch it was poured stone in a castiron frame it straddled the road narrower than a caravan wagon the chair beneath it was made of iron and poured stone though lined with pillows as jeremy approached the man in the chair stood up tall and massive though armed with no more than a stick at his belt harlow asked are we barred from spiral town the man didnt respond jeremy touched harlows hand take it easy he reached into his special pocket for three thumbs of candy try this when the man didnt react jeremy put one between harlows lips ate one then offered the other the man ate it oooh what is it winslows festivity candy im winslow are we barred from spiral town the caravans are yes sir merchants are too unless you have special business but you can go to the tavern theres a carolyn hope hearst buried in your graveyard i was a hearst before i married id like to visit her grave harlow stared the guard missed that he wasnt seeing harlow he said we havent buried a lifegiver from outside in more than fifty years jeremy said more like ninety for carolyn hope way too old to visit the tavern sir you have one of our men too more recent father wasnt so sure of him the guard was massively embarrassed sir i dont doubt youll be let visit your ancestors but icant and not at night when did the rules change since the spring caravan yeah if they did something awful they never told us sir im not sure i could tell you anyway the man was nervous he must have watched a caravan repel sharks everyone did the pouredstone triangle and the stone chair looked very permanent for so recent a thing cargo lay in piles just beyond across the road from the huge old elms that bordered warkan farm a little heap of clocks an array of pottery and glassware melons and squashes and oranges two great stacks of begley cloth sparking with current they must have brought it down from mount apollo in sunlight uncovered jeremy turned away leading harlow he murmured he cant talk to a woman he doesnt know its birdfucking rude you sound like a felon ill be one after i murder the next birdfucker who treats me that way what was that about a dead ancestor he told harlow i found her on that last trip to medical the programs gave me a lineage for hearst wagon why not im a hearst courtesy of harlow winslow someone in a caravan family was bound to have died in spiral town quicksilver still lit the night while the caravans elders walked the length of the caravan talking to whomever they found they found maiku lall bedding down his family beside lall wagon the medical wagon first in line and harlow and jeremy winslow just passing you sell no speckles tomorrow palava lall said maiku gaped at his mother glen hearst quickly said that goes for us too harlow jeremy speckles are not to enter spiral town tomorrow jeremy didnt speak harlow asked might one ask why later glen said and the group of elders turned downroad jeremy noticed govert miller among them back early from the tavern the roster of elders was complete the whisper of waves had a buzzing in it the caravan was not asleep but talking in their tents glen asked where have you been jeremy told glen what theyd learned of the guarded gate harlow said caravans were founded to move speckles glen this violates a trust and so does that gate we do more than deliver speckles the old man said we supervise the mainland takes risks but these crab shies live their lives the way evolution shaped us on earth lots of farming diet varies by season not much medicine not much industrial power short life spans yes all right harlow shorter life spans glen hearst said but theyre safe if jeremy was going to get his say harlow was going to have to say it she tried glen humanity on destiny is two hundred and fifty years old do we still need a control group you never do know in advance harlow thats what a control experiment is for anyway its not just one anymore when offshoot groups started moving down the road from base one the caravans transported them whatever hurts any of them is a warning for the rest of us we know what kills on destiny speckles lack of the threat to spiral town is us jeremy feared shed overdo it in haste he asked glen what do we want from this theyve barred us in stages over these past fifty years no merchants past peach street no merchants in town at night one wagon to the market and one to mount apollo then none now this how the hell can we supervise a control experiment if he waved his arms in frustration if the mice lock us out jeremy murmured glen glared its bad for them too they dont see any sapient creature outside their insular selves it stunts their minds harlow said theyre inbred too but that is policy so we know what we want jeremy said what if we dont get it oh well get it thats good because were here for two nights if we get it or not chugs cant forage in one place more than two nights running the spirals know it too glen said remember sell anything but speckles tomorrow he crawled into the tent to sleep jeremy kept walking and harlow followed wagons were wide apart between tents they could not be overheard jeremy said thank you its a joy she said watching you keep your mouth shut you terrify me are you with steban tonight tanya snatched him as soon as he was on board dont you notice jeremy or was that a joke hell have you both if shes any good very and beautiful and already pregnant hell wonder what youve got to match her anyway youre mine tonight if i can get you relaxed so what would that take she was silent she was thinking about all the way back to bloocher farm and watching him the way an armed yutz watches the sea downslope to shore then across the overgrown fence then up likely enough hed be shot as a burglar uphill would take him to the frost line hed crouch behind the brush like a nineteenyearold duckwalk past mount apollo and down into spiral town the long way home but harlow couldnt guess who might give him refuge or he could procure spiral garb recover his spiral accent and walk past the gate in a clump of shoppers ive promised not to go home he told her right harlow do you think id leave these old birdfuckers alone to decide whether to turn us all into speckelsshies harlow put her fingertips over his mouth damn he was getting too loud she said now who needs relaxing me well come back to the tent in the morning the chugs went into the sea again ten sharks followed them out three lay flopping when the rest fled six last night then ten theyre getting smart angelo said smart for sharks the first night theres weed close to shore morning the chugs have to go deeper for it next night deeper yet next morning even farther the sharks get a better and better chance to catch a chug or two they dont get smart just hungry the chugs are taking their food angelo thousands of spirals had come to watch the sharkshooting now they descended on the wagons yutzes were sent to fetch the clocks pottery glassware fruit and vegetables piled beyond the gate the prices for these had been agreed they were told to leave the begley cloth alone by noon it was sparking and spitting lightning not safe to touch the spirals bought what the wagons sold and couldnt believe that they couldnt buy speckles too jeremy gave away handfuls of festivity to all the children hed cut and roll more tonight merchants were expected to wear eccentric dress pockets were always in fashion jeremy had built a big pocket over his belly and lined it and he kept a generous handful of extra seeds inside to keep the jelly candies from sticking it gave him a lumpyrotund look come evening the hearsts geared up for warkans tavern as they laid out cookware and the yutzes dug their pits jeremy found himself crouching down behind his persona the last time hed seen warkans tavern hed killed a man here came a forest of black devilhair and a row of chugs pushing it time to board the roofs far up the road two electric wagons approached warkans tavern maybe spiral town only had two in jeremys youth theyd had four these were empty but for five men they stopped at the gate five soberly dressed spiral town men went into the tavern and emerged on the secondfloor balcony the chugs left off burrowing in the black weed and moved uphill sharks zipped up the sand bullets spattered them two fled seven burrowed into the weed four sped after the chugs a hail of bullets stopped those smarter angelo grunted and relaxed seven sharks zipped out of the weed all at once into the waves before anyone could quite react harlow asked what would it cost to wipe out lungsharks we almost have glen hearst said there used to be more its a bad idea though without sharks wed pay less attention to shark guns locals tend to be respectful if theyve seen shark guns in action bandits too tanya asked harlow dont you like shooting sharks i really do not tanya laughed miller wagon was cooking dinner tonight though hearst wagon had helped set up jeremy and harlow waited for glen the elders seemed to be waiting for what but a third of the caravan walked toward warkans tavern a growing crowd that included angelo tanya and steban they stopped milling a bit when the dignitaries came out of warkans tavern and walked toward the caravan glen hearst said i think thats my dinner jemmy bloochers father had been of the council and the council did usually take several wagonmasters to dinner in his youth the car avans had come as far as the hub later but was it nonnal for the council to come this far the councilors were picking up elders from the wagons not all just some nobody from krupp wagon nine men re ched hearst wagon one man took glen hearst aside and spoke to him a casual and genial tone words halfheard harrys bar pat the special pocket halffull pit chef jeremy obsequious a bit effusive first sight of spiral town gape a little even warkan s tavern is impressive damn you can see buildings poking up in clusters a klick away he felt himself wanting to overdo it and you must meet our pit chef from the finest restaurant on the road jeremy winslow not much interested chairman greegry bloocher stepped forward to shake the cooks hand jeremy some of us have been invited to dinner by these good people and i mentioned your dessert a recent invention sir spiral town accentanda complacent smile jeremy handed his brother a thumb of festivity candy he watched greegiys appreciation and offered a handful to the rest harlow was watching him like a magicians hat why dont you come to dinner with us glen hearst asked and bring some along spiral town most cultures have understood that some are more equal than others there were those h would not go to the stars and there were those we not take captain arnold cohen aboard argos during negotiation electric wagons brought them back to the light and noise at warkans tavern jeremy walked in behind govert miller harlow was with six other women on the womens side of the room she saw him he smiled she dove back into animated conversation jeremy looked around for company hed completely forgotten that he couldnt just sit down with his wife there jeremy govert miller meant a table of merchants all men in their twenties with one empty chair jeremy fielded one from another table and they sat jeremy flagged a waiter and ordered drinks for the table far too skillfully the waiter was puzzled nobody else noticed the elder miller began an animated description of events at dinner for merchants from miller and hearst jeremy listened picking up more than hed been able to witness the council had capitulated theyd kept some tattered shreds of dignity kept some surface concessions some had to be silent for the depth of their fury the caravans would roll into spiral town tomorrow begley cloth would be loaded speckles would be delivered to the hub and sold to spiral women the gate that was being dealt with drinks appeared jeremy paid fumbling a bit with the coins he sipped vodka and grapefruit being cautious with it youre quiet govert said jeremy jumped he said i was wondering we set things back the way they were when twenty years ago two hundred and twenty years ago the caravans were a going concern already selfsupporting werent they heads nodded dont really know and glen hearst at another table barked right selfsupporting and they carry the speckles and even the otterfolk get what they want out of it thats what everyone hoped for in the first place isnt it about time we dismantled the overview bureau the table burst into laughter jeremy looked down at his empty glass no birdfucking angelo hearst said and we could raise the price of speckles through the roofi govert miller reproved him elder to youth angelo each wagon puts its own price couldnt we all set one price or wait lets say eleven wagons up our prices and only miller wagon stays low govert youd sell all your speckles before we got to the shire after that theyd pay whatever the rest of us want govert laughed jeremy hes got a point on another night they might have argued how would destiny town cope if the road communities knew the truth tonight wasnt that kind of night jeremy said angelo you win i never thought of that at all he saw the merchant womens table breaking up he made his excuses and left in a cluster of elders harlow saw him and waited when hed caught up she said i wondered if id see you again you know why i couldnt get you in on this ever harrys bar is men only remember the gate guard she was ticked that was sure do women have places too now how on birdfucking earth will i ever know that youve been surrounded by spiral woman all night youll he selling them speckles tomorrow ask then lie to me if you like what a concept fairs fair selling speckles yes the old ones came to some kind of agreement i was too far to hear details you enjoyed yourself oh yes i took a whole big pouch of festivity right for sixteen of us and the chefs at harrys bar impressed hell out of them and we spent some time talking shop pit chef jeremy they sat me at the far end from greegiy greegry my younger brother greegry bloocher the council chairman the tall guy harlow started to laugh then she said no offense dear but why did the spiral council wantjeremy winslow they didnt they held their tempers but it was pretty plain she waited like making them come all the way out here with wagons the caravans are playing mind games table for fifteen well all sit down and pretend were equals and talk business only theyve got to ride out here and get us and then glen hearst rings in a loose cook now the tables a little crowded and there are things no cook should hear what is this all about i was as far from the action as they could get me and that suited me just fine but the new gate is too much theyre tearing it down the elders are talking like the council rolled bellyup good and ive been invited to visit the graveyard tomorrow i can take my wife he felt her freeze under his hand why did you jeremy im being obtuse you must have people buried there no how can i come both of us cant be gone when the caravan leaves tomorrow youll have to catch up later he saw in her eyes youve escaped the burly councilman was chewing a barely conceale rage he couldnt make hi mself talk to the caravan elders at least the chef could be kept occupied he was gwillam doakes and he didnt recognize jemmy bloocher jeremy leaned on his destiny town accent you have a carolyn hope hearst buried in your graveyard william i was a hearst before i married i want to visit my ancestors grave gwillam doakes dithered then called down the table to greegiy bloocher greegiys downsweeping hand chopped off the request yes yes give my name to the gatekeeper get directions from him if you need them no dear the caravans going in tomorrow not very far just around the first turn as far as the outer circle the chugs can get down to the beach between the tucker and coffey holdings along the runoff strip the caravans used it for access when i was young well let the chugs clear away some of their devilhair weed while theyre there she relaxed softened under his hand he said ill go visit the graveyard afterward come or dont a breathy sigh yes of course of course ill come merchants never used to miss the destiny town graveyard they say nothing grows there but earthlife right neither of them slept well that night at dawn before even the yutzes were up there was a chattering sound from up the road like an enraged squirrel as big as a building jeremy lay in the tent listening trying to recall air hammer harlow said they got up and joined the caravaners on the roofs seven lungsharks tried their luck tents were stowed chugs were hooked up wagons were set moving the sales windows were opened to throngs of spirals who had come to buy jeremy and harlow drove the gate wasnt gone it lay fiat in the road in a vshaped recess cut into the old lava by an air hammer now it was hinged at the base the wagon wheels bumped over it and rolled past i just remembered jeremy told harlow one of the reasons we closed spiral town to the caravans the road isnt wide enough for a wagon and team to turn around thats going to be fun no thats why we go to the outer circle its where columbiad landed when the landers were still unloading from argos they always came down on the same spot plenty of room there they rolled past houses jeremy had known from his birth warkan harness doakes shut up she suggested a quarterturn around ten klicks brought them to another guard the same guard the wagons eased to a halt a little too bunched up but that wouldnt matter today inward the shallow pool of refrozen rock was tangent to two loops of the road it was considerably larger than similar craters found along the road cavorite and columbiad had landed always within a centimeter of the same spot guided down by settler magic below was columbiad s runoff stream a strip of bare rock that nobody had tried to farm in two hundred years it ran a klick and a half to the sea the sea was black with devilhair the chugs would feed very well today then againtoday i think well get sharks jeremy said the chugs didnt mind stopping early through the long afternoon they ambled on down into the waves rolled a black forest out and began to feast not a child in spiral town had ever seen wagons this far into town and they crowded round to watch the chugs left their dinner and started uphill just ahead of a wave of sharks jeremy heard startled laughter and nervous chatter over the rattle of gunfire damn fools they could lose a few chugs here he emptied his gun and reloaded in haste the guns left twentyodd sharks on the rocky beach and an awed silence among the watching spirals then harlow may have misread jeremys triumphant nearsnarl or not jeremy had never been sure of harlow she made some minor changes in her dressstill in the vivid style of a merchant woman but not so apt for shooting sharkswhile he filled his lined pocket with seeds and festivity candy once there had been a hydraulic empire in miniature the mainlands stranglehold on speckles no more the next time a caravan tried such extortion as theyd used these past few days theyd find fertile speckles growing over every garbage heap every manure pit every graveyard along the crab where there was potassium speckles would grow argos had robbed crab and mainland alike destiny town had only cavorite spiral town had only columbiad neither could reach farther than synchronous orbit spiral town had all the knowledge that cavorite had taken for terminus and destiny town and the equivalent in settlermagic tools destiny town had built shuttles that would reach orbit that was the first step had always been the first step to the stars spiral town could have taken that step and had not specklesshy for a year or less theyd recovered but theyd never reached farther no more whining about birthrights then or what the mainland owed to the towns along the crab jemmy bloocher would steal the stars when children passed them on the road jeremy gave them festivity a growing entourage of children followed them through spiral town one each he told them they didnt believe him maybe they just liked following a man and a woman walking together it might have struck themit would have struck young jemmy bloocheras just a bit obscene at the gate that led to the graveyard the children stopped he gave them another piece each and escorted harlow through the wroughtiron gate he saw newer graves marked not with holograms but with blocks of carved stone the marker gun must have failed people are staring at us harlow said isnt that dangerous nobodys ever going to recognize jemmy bloocher talking with a lovely woman they might tumble if you dont stop acting like youve seen it all before ill gawk a little then hows this he could guess where carolyn hope hearst must be from the date shed died yes here she was in the pecan grove with a fading hologram to mark the trunk poor woman the whole train was sick from malnutrition and she was the one who died the crops hadnt grown in yet i guessjeremy pulled two thumbs of festivity out of his special pocket along with a smattering of seeds and offered one to harlow she said is this respectful sure collect some nuts too there are lifegivers under those fruit trees see the girls eating plums they ate the candy seeds fluttered over carolyn hope hearsts grave jeremy plucked two handfuls of pecans and pocketed them he chose a way out that led past a line of bloocher graves he didnt point out the names he let harlow discover them he noticed a boy and girl watching him and offered them festivity if he spoke to the girl shed run so he didnt speak to either they both looked like well bloochers so he didnt look up at their mother she might know him he watched them eat the festivity and watched the seeds fall
