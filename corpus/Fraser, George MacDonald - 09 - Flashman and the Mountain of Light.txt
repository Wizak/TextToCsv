explanatory note the life and conduct of sir harry flashman vc were so irregular and eccentric that it is not surprising that he was also erratic in compiling his memoirs that picturesque catalogue of misadventure scandal and military history which came to light wrapped in oilskin packets in a midlands saleroom more than twenty years ago and has since been published in a series of volumes this being the ninth beginning characteristically with his expulsion from rugby in for drunkenness the old victorian hero continued his chronicle at random moving back and forth in time as the humour took him until the end of his eighth packet found him again the worse for drink being shanghaied from a singapore billiardroom after the china war of along the way he had ranged from the first afghan war of to the sioux campaign of it goes without saying that many gaps in his story remain to be filled but with the publication of the present volume which reverts to his early manhood the first half of his life is almost complete only an intriguing gap in the early s remains and a few odd months here and there thus far it is not an improving tale and this latest chapter is consistent in its depiction of an immoral and unscrupulous rascal whose only commendable quality was his gift of accurate observation it was this and the new and often unexpected light which it enabled him to cast on great events and famous figures of his time that excited the interest of historians and led to comparison of his memoirs with the boswell papers be that as it may it was a talent fully if nervously employed in the almost forgotten imperial campaign described in this volume the shortest bloodiest and strangest i think of my whole life indeed it was strange not least in its origins and flashmans account is a remarkable casehistory of how a war can come about and the freaks and perfidies and intrigues of its making and waging it is also the story of a fabulous jewel and of an extraordinary quartet an indian queen a slavegirl and two mercenary adventurers who would be dismissed as too outlandish for fiction if their careers were not easily verifiable from contemporary sources this as with previous packets of flashmans papers entrusted to me by their owner mr paget morrison has been my chief concern to satisfy myself that flashmans narrative tallies with historic fact so far as it can be tested beyond that i have only corrected occasional lapses in spelling and supplied the usual footnotes appendices and glossary gmf now my dear sir harry i must tell you says her majesty with that stubborn little duck of her head that always made palmerston think she was going to butt him in the guts i am quite determined to learn hindoostanee this at the age of sixtyseven mark you i almost asked her what the devil for at her time of life but fortunately my idiot wife got in first clapping her hands and exclaiming that it was a most splendid idea since nothing so improved the mind and broadened the outlook as acquaintance with a foreign tongue is that not so my love i seconded loyally of course saying it was a capital notion maam bound to come in handy but i must have looked doubtful for our sovereign lady refilled my teacup pretty offhand leaving out the brandy and said severely that dr johnson had learned dutch at the age of seventy and i have an excellent ear says she why i still recollect precisely those indian words you spoke at my dearest ones request so many long years ago she sighed and sipped and then to my dismay trotted them out hamare ghali ana achha din lord wellington said it was a hindoo greeting i recall well its what the bengali whores used to cry to attract customers so she wasnt far wrong theyd been the only words i could think of god help me on that memorable day in when the old duke had taken me to the palace after my afghan heroics id stood trembling and halfwitted before royalty and when albert asked me to say something in hindi out they popped luckily wellington had had the wit not to translate the queen had been a pretty slip of a girl then smiling timidly up as she pinned on the medal i didnt deserve now she was a stout little old body faded and grey fussing over the teacups at windsor and punishing the meringues her smile was still there though aye cavalry whiskers even white ones still fetched little vicky it is such a cheerful language says she i am sure it must have many jokes does it not sir harry i could think of a few but thought it best to give her the old harmless one that begins doh admi joh nashe men the rail ghari men safar kar raha ta but what does it mean sir harry well maam it means that two fellows were travelling by train you see and they were i regret to say intoxicated why harry cries elspeth acting shocked but the queen just took another tot of whisky in her tea and bade me continue so i told her that one chap said where are we and tother chap replied wednesday and the first chap said heavens this is where i get out needless to say it convulsed them and while they recovered and passed the gingerbread i asked myself for the twentieth time why we were here just elspeth and me and the great white mother taking tea together you see while i was used enough in those later years to being bidden to balmoral each autumn to squire her about on drives and fetch her shawl and endure her prattle and those damned pipers of an evening a summons to windsor in the spring was something new and when it included dear lady flashman our fair rowena the queen and she both pretendeda passion for scott i couldnt think what was up elspeth when shed recovered from her ecstasy at being commanded to court as she put it was sure i was to be offered a peerage in the jubilee honours i damped her by observing that the queen didnt keep coronets in the closet to hand out to visitors it was done official and anyway even salisbury wasnt so far gone as to ennoble me i wasnt worth bribing elspeth said i was a horrid cynic and if the queen herself required our attendance it must be something grand and whatever was she going to wear well the grandeur turned out to be buffalo bills wild west show i concluded that id been dragged in because id been out yonder myself and was considered an authority on all that was wild and woolly and we sat in vile discomfort at earls court among a great gang of court toadies while cody pranced on a white horse waving his hat and sporting a suit of patent buckskins that would have laid em helpless with laughter along the yellowstone there was enough paint and feathers to outfit the whole sioux nation the braves whooped and kiyikked and brandished their hatchets the roughriders curvetted a stagecoach of terrified virgins was ambushed the great man arrived in the nick of time blazing away until you couldnt see for smoke and the queen said it was most curious and interesting and what did the strange designs of the war paint signify my dear sir harry god knows what i told her the fact is while everyone else was cheering the spectacle i was reflecting that only eleven years earlier id been running like hell from the real thing at little bighorn and losing my top hair into the bargain a point which i mentioned to cody later after hed been presented he cried yes by thunder that was one warparty hed missed and didnt he envy me the trip though lying old humbug thats by the way i realised when the queen bore elspeth and me back to windsor and bade us to tea a trois next day that our presence at the show had been incidental and the real reason for our invitation was something else altogether a trifling matter as it turned out but it inspired this memoir so there you are she wanted our opinion she said on a matter of the first importance and if you think it odd that she should confide in the likes of us the retired imperial roughneck of heroic record but dubious repute and the glasgow merchants daughter well you dont know our late lamented queen empress oh she was a stickler and a tartar no error the highest mightiest monarch that ever was and didnt she know it just but if you were a friend well that was a different palaver elspeth and i were well out of court and barely halfway into society even but wed known her since long ago you see well shed always fancied me and elspeth aside from being such an artless happy beauty that even her own sex couldnt help liking her had the priceless gift of being able to make the queen laugh theyd taken to each other as young women and now on the rare occasions they met teteatete they blethered like the grandmothers they were why on that very day she told elspeth that there were some who wanted her to mark her golden jubilee by abdicating in favour of her ghastly son bertie the bounder but i shall do no such thing my dear i intend to outlive him if i can for the man is not fit to reign as none knows better than your own dear husband who had the thankless task of instructing him true id pimped for him occasional but twas wasted effort hed have been just as great a cad and whoremaster without my tuition however it was about the jubilee she wanted our advice and yours especially sir harry for you alone have the necessary knowledge i couldnt figure that for one thing shed been getting advice and to spare for months on how best to celebrate her fiftieth year on the throne the whole empire was in a jubilee frenzy with loyal addresses and fetes and junketings and school holidays and watertrough inaugurations and every sort of extravagance on the rates the shops were packed with jubilee mugs and plates and trumpery blazoned with union jacks and pictures of her majesty looking damned glum there were jubilee songs on the halls and jubilee marches for parades and even jubilee musical bustles that played god save the queen when the wearer sat down i tried to get elspeth to buy one but she said it was disrespectful and besides people might think it was her the queen of course had her nose into everything to make sure the celebrations were dignified and useful only she could approve the illuminations for cape town the chocolate boxes for eskimo children the plans for jubilee parks and gardens and halls and birdbaths from dublin to dunedin the special jubilee robes for buddhist monks in burma and the extra helpings of duff for lepers in singapore if the world didnt remember and the imperial grandmother from whom all blessings flowed it wouldnt be her fault and after years in purdah she had taken to gallivanting on the grand scale to jubilee dinners and assemblies and soirees and dedications dammit shed even visited liverpool but what had tickled her most it seemed was being photographed in full fig as empress of india it had given her quite an indian fever and she was determined that the jubilee should have a fine flavour of curry hence the resolve to learn hindi but what else sir harry would best mark our signal regard for our indian subjects do you think baksheesh booze and bints was the answer to that but i chewed on a muffin looking grave and said why not engage some indian attendants maam thatd go down well it would also infuriate the lordly placemen and toadcaters who surrounded her if i knew anything after some thought she nodded and said that was a wise and fitting suggestion in the event it was anything but for the hindiwallah she fixed on as her special pet turned out to be not the highcaste gent he pretended but the son of a pugglewalloper in agra jail if that wasnt enough he spread her secret indian papers all over the bazaars and drove the viceroy out of his halfwits aye old flashys got the touch at the time though she was all for it and then she got down to cases in earnest for now sir harry i have two questions for you most important questions so please to attend she adjusted her spectacles and rummaged in a flat case at her elbow breathing heavy and finally unearthing a yellowish scrap of paper there i have it colonel mackesons letter she peered at it with gooseberry eyes dated the ninth of february now where is ah yes the colonel writes in part on this head it will be best to consult those officers in the company service who have seen it and especially lieutenant flashman she shot me a look no doubt to make sure i recognised the name who is said to have been the first to see it and can doubtless say precisely how it was then worn she laid the letter down nodding you see i keep all letters most carefully arranged one cannot tell when they may be essential i made nothing of this where the deuce had i been in and what on earth was it on whose wearing i was apparently an authority the queen smiled at my mystification it may be somewhat changed says she but i am sure you will remember it she took a small leather box from the case set it down among the tea things and with the air of a conjurer producing a rabbit raised the lid elspeth gave a little gasp i looked and my heart gave a lurch it aint to be described you must see it close to that glittering pyramid of light broad as a crown piece alive with an icy fire that seems to shine from its very heart its a matchless evil thing and shouldnt be a diamond at all but a ruby red as the blood of the thousands whove died for it but it wasnt that or its terrible beauty that had shaken me it was the memory all unexpected aye id seen it before the mountain of light says the queen complacently that is what the nabobs called it did they not sir harry indeed maam says i a mite hoarse kohinoor a little smaller than you remember it i fancy it was recut under the directions of my dear albert and the duke of wellington she explained to elspeth but it is still the largest most precious gem in all the world taken in our wars against the sikh people you know more than forty years ago but was colonel mackeson correct sir harry did you see it then in its native setting and could you describe it by god i could but not to you old girl and certainly not to the wife of my bosom twittering breathlessly as the queen lifted the gleaming stone to the light in her stumpy fingers native setting was right i could see it now as i saw it first blazing in its bed of tawny naked flesh in the delectable navel of that gorgeous trollop maharani jeendan its dazzling rays shaming the thousands of lesser gems that sleeved her from thigh to ankle and from wrist to shoulder that had been her entire costume as she staggered drunkenly among the cushions laughing wildly at the amorous pawings of her dancingboys draining her gold cup and flinging it aside giggling as she undulated voluptuously towards me slapping her bare hips to the tomtoms while i heroically foxed but full of good intentions tried to crawl to her across a floor that seemed to be littered with kashmiri houris and their partners in jollity come and take it my englishman aiee if old runjeet could see it now eh would he leap from his funeral pyre think you dropping to her knees belly quivering the great diamond flashing blindingly will you not take it shall lal have it then or jawaheer take it gora sahib my english bahadur the loose red mouth and drugged kohlstained eyes mocking me through a swirling haze of booze and perfume why harry you look quite upset whatever is the matter it was elspeth all concern and the queen clucked sympathetically and said i was distrйe and she was to blame for i am sure my dear that the sudden sight of the stone has recalled to him those dreadful battles with the sikhs and the loss of oh so many of our gallant fellows am i not right she patted my hand kindly and i wiped my fevered brow and confessed it had given me a start and stirred painful recollections old comrades you know stern encounters trying times bad business all round but yes i remembered the diamond among the crown jewels at the court of lahore it had been much prized and worn with pride and reverence i am sure oh absolutely maam passed about too from time to time the queen looked shocked not from hand to hand from navel to navel in fact the game being to pass it round male to female without using your hands and anyone caught waxing his bellybutton was disqualified and reported to tattersalls i hastened to assure her that only the royal family and their ah closest intimates had ever touched it and she said she was glad to hear it you shall write me an exact description of how it was set and displayed says she of course i have worn it myself in various settings for while it is said to be unlucky i am not superstitious and besides they say it brings ill fortune only to men and while it was presented by lord dalhousie to me personally i regard it as belonging to all the women of the empire aye thinks i absently your majesty wears it on monday and the scrubwoman has it on tuesday that brings me to my second question and you sir harry knowing india so well must advise me would it be proper do you think to have it set in the state crown for the great jubilee service in the abbey would it please our indian subjects might it give the least offence to anyone the princes for example consider that if you please and give me your opinion presently she regarded me as though i were the delphic oracle and i had to clear my mind of memories to pay heed to what she was saying so that after all the preamble was her question of first importance of all the nonsense as though one nigger in a million would recognise the stone or knew it existed even and those who did would be fat crawling rajas ready to fawn and applaud if she proposed painting the taj mahal red white and blue with her damned diamond on top still she was showing more delicacy of feeling that id have given her credit for well i could set her mind at rest if i wanted to on reflection i wasnt sure about that it was true as shed said that kohinoor had been bad medicine only for men from aladdin to shah jehan nadir old runjeet and that poor pimp jawaheer i could hear his deathscreams yet and shudder but it hadnt done jeendan much good either and she was as female as they come take it englishman gad talk about your jubilee parties no i wouldnt want it to be unlucky for our vicky dont misunderstand i aint superstitious either but ive learned to be leery of the savage gods and ill admit that the sight of that infernal gewgaw winking among the teacups had taken me flat aback forty years and more i could hear the tramp of the khalsa again rank on bearded rank pouring out through the moochee gate wah guruji to delhi to london the thunder of guns and the hiss of rockets as the dragoons came slashing through the smoke old paddy gough in his white fighting coat twisting his moustaches oi nivver wuz bate an oi nivver will be bate a lean pathan face under a tartan turban you know what they call this beauty the man who would be king an arabian nights princess flaunting herself before her army like a nautchdancer mocking them and defying them halfnaked and raging sword in hand coals glowing hideously beneath a gridiron lovers hand in hand in an enchanted garden under a punjab moon a great river choked with bodies from bank to bank a little boy in cloth of gold the great diamond held aloft blood running through his tiny fingers kohinoor kohinoor the queen and elspeth were deep in talk over a great book of photographs of crowns and diadems and circlets for i know my weakness about jewellery you see and how it can lead me astray but your taste dear rowena is quite faultless now if it were set so among the fleursdelys i could see i wasnt going to get a word in edgeways for hours so i slid out for a smoke and to remember id vowed never to go near india again after the afghan fiasco of and might easily have kept my word but for elspeths loose conduct in those salad days you see she had to be forever flirting with anything in britches not that i blame her for she was a rare beauty and i was often away or ploughing with other heifers but she shook her bouncers once too often and at the wrong man that foul nigger pirate solomon who kidnapped her the year i took five for against allengland and a hell of a chase i had to win her back ill set it down some day provided the recounting dont scare me into the grave its a ghastly tale about brooke and the headhunting borneo rovers and how i only saved my skin by stallioning the mad black queen of madagascar into a stupor quaint isnt it the end of it was that we were rescued by the anglofrench expedition that bombarded tamitave in and we were all set for old england again but the officious snirp who governed mauritius takes one look at me and cries pon my soul its flashy the bayard of afghanistan how fortunate just when its all hands to the pumps in the punjab youre the very man off you go and settle the sikhs and well look after your missus or words to that effect i said id swim in blood first i hadnt retired on half pay just to be pitched into another war but he was one of your wrathofgod tyrants who wont be gainsaid and quoted queens regulations and bullied me about duty and honour and i was young then and fagged out with tupping ranavalona and easily cowed if id known what lay ahead id have seen him damned first those wordsll be on my tombstone so help me but i didnt and it would have shot my hardearned afghan laurels all to pieces if id shirked so i bowed to his instruction to proceed to india with all speed and report to the cinc rot him i consoled myself that there might be advantages to stopping abroad a while longer id no news from home you see and it was possible that mrs leo lades noble protector and that greasy bookie tighe might still have their bruisers on the lookout for me its damnable the pickle a little harmless wenching and welching can land you in so i bade elspeth an exhausting farewell and she clung to me on the dockside at port louis bedewing my linen and casting sidelong glances at the moustachioed frogs who were waiting to carry her home on their warship hollo thinks i well be calling the first one marcel at this rate and was about to speak to her sternly when she lifted those glorious blue eyes and gulped i was never so happy as in the forest just you and me come safe back my bonny jo or my heart will break and i felt such a pang as she kissed me and wanted to keep her by me forever and to hell with india and i watched her ship out of sight long after the goldenhaired figure waving from the rail had grown too small to see god knows what she got up to with the frogs mind you i had hopes of a nice leisurely passage to calcutta for choice so that whatever mischief there was with the sikhs might be settled long before i got near the frontier but the cape mailsloop arrived next day and i was bowled up to bombay in no time and there by the most hellish illluck before id got the gheesmell in my nostrils or even thought about finding a woman i ran slap into old general sale whom i hadnt seen since afghanistan and was the last man i wanted to meet just then in case you dont know my journal of the afghan disaster i must tell you that i was one of that inglorious army which came out in a dam sight faster than it went in what was left of it i was one of the few survivors and by glorious misunderstanding was hailed as the hero of the hour it was mistakenly believed that id fought the bloodiest lastditch action since hastings when in fact id been blubbering under a blanket and when i came to in dock at jallalabad who should be at my bedside misty with admiration but the garrison commander fighting bob sale he it was who had first trumpeted my supposed heroism to the world so you may picture his emotion when here i was tooling up three years later apparently thirsting for another slap at the paynim this is the finest thing cries he beaming why wed thought you lost to us restin on your laurels what i should ha known better sit down sit down my dear boy kyahai matey couldnt keep away you young dog wait till george broadfoot sees you oh aye hes on the leash up yonder and all the old crowd why twill be like old times except youll find goughs no elphy bey what he clapped me on the shoulder fit to burst at the prospect of bloodshed and added in a whisper they could have heard in benares kabul be damned therell be no retreat from lahore your health flashman it was sickening but i looked keen and managed a groan of dismay when he admitted that the war hadnt started yet and might not at all if hardinge the new governorgeneral had his way right thinks i count me as one of the hardinge ring but of course i begged bob to tell me how the land lay feigning great eagerness in planning a campaign you see you must know where the safe billets are likely to be so he did and in setting it down i shall add much information which i came by later so that you may see exactly how things were in the summer of and understand all that followed a word first though youll have heard it said that the british empire was acquired in a fit of absence of mind one of those smart oscarish squibs that sounds well but is thoroughly fatheaded presence of mind if you like and countless other things such as greed and christianity decency and villainy policy and lunacy deep design and blind chance pride and trade blunder and curiosity passion ignorance chivalry and expediency honest pursuit of right and determination to keep the bloody frogs out and often as not such things came tumbling together and when the dust had settled there we were and who else was going to set things straight and feed the folk and guard the gate and dig the drains oh aye and take the profit by all means thats what study and eyewitness have taught me leastways and perhaps i can prove it by describing what happened to me in in the bloodiest shortest war ever fought in india and the strangest i think of my whole life youll find it contains all the imperial ingredients ive listed stay though for frogs read muslims and if you like russians and a few others you may not believe when im done you may not be much clearer on how the map of the world came to be onefifth pink but at least you should realise that it aint something to be summed up in an epigram absence of mind my arse we always knew what we were doing we just didnt always know how it would pan out first of all you must do as sale bade me and look at the map in john company held bengal and the carnatic and the east coast more or less and was lord of the land up to the sutlej the frontier beyond which lay the five rivers country of the sikhs the punjab but things werent settled then as they are now we were still shoring up our borders and that northwest frontier was the weak point as it still is that way invasion had always come from afghanistan the vanguard of a mohammedan tide countless millions strong stretching back as far as the mediterranean and russia wed tried to sit down in afghanistan as you know and got a bloody nose and while that had been avenged since we werent venturing that way again so it remained a perpetual threat to india and ourselves and all that lay between was the punjab and the sikhs you know something of them tall splendid fellows with uncut hair and beards proud and exclusive as jews and well disliked as clannish easilyrecognised folk often are the muslims loathed them the hindoos distrusted i hem and even today t atkins while admiring them as stout fighters would rather be brigaded with anyone else excepting their cavalry which youd be glad of anywhere for my money they were the most advanced people in india well they were only a sixth of the punjabs population but they ruled the place so there you are wed made a treaty with these strong clever treacherous civilised savages respecting their independence north of the sutlej while we ruled south of it it was good business for both parties they remained free and friends with john company and we had a tough stable buffer between us and the wild tribes beyond the khyber let the sikhs guard the passes while we went about our business in india without the expense and trouble of having to deal with the afghans ourselves thats worth bearing in mind when you hear talk of our aggressive forward policy in india it simply wasnt common sense for us to take over the punjab not while it was strong and united which it was until when the sikh maharaja old runjeet singh died of drink and debauchery hed been a great man and a holy terror whod held the punjab solid as a rock but when he went the struggle for power over the next six years made the borgia intrigues look like a vicarage soirйe his only legitimate son kuruk an opiumguzzling degenerate was quickly poisoned by his son who lasted long enough to attend papas funeral where a building collapsed on him to no ones surprise second wicket down was shere singh runjeets bastard and a lecher of such enthusiasm that ive heard they had to pry him off a wench to seat him on the throne he had a fine long reign of two years surviving mutiny civil war and a plot by chaund cour kuruks widow before they finally did for him chaund cour later expired in her bath under a great stone dropped by her own slavegirls whose hands and tongues were then removed to prevent idle gossip and when various other friends and relations had been taken off suddenlike and the whole punjab was close to anarchy the way was suddenly clear for a most unlikely maharaja the infant dalip singh who was still on the throne and in good health in the summer of it was claimed he was the child of old runjeet and a dancinggirl named jeendan whom hed married shortly before his death there were those who doubted the paternity though since this jeendan was notorious for entertaining the lads of the village four at a time and old runjeet had been pretty far gone when he married her on the other hand it was pointed out that she was a practised professional whose charms would have roused a stone idol so old runjeet might have done the deed before rolling over and going to god so now she was queen mother and joint regent with her drunken brother jawaheer singh whose great party trick was to dress as a female and dance with the nautchgirls by all accounts it was one continuous orgy at the court of lahore with jeendan galloping every man in sight her lords and ladies all piling in no one sober for days on end treasure being spent like the wave of the sea and the whole polity sliding downhill to luxurious ruin i must say it sounded quite jolly to me bar the normal murders and tortures and the furious plotting which apparently occupied everyones sober moments and looming like a genie over all this delightful corruption was the khalsa the sikh army runjeet had built it hiring firstclass european mercenaries who had turned it into a truly formidable machine drilled disciplined modern strong the finest army in india barring the companys while runjeet lived all had been well but since his death the khalsa had realised its power and wasnt prepared to be cats paw to the succession of rascals degenerates and drunkards whod tumbled on and off the throne it had defied its officers and governed itself by soldiers committees called panches joining in the civil strife and bloodshed when it suited slaughtering looting and raping in disciplined fashion and supporting whichever maharaja took its fancy one thing was constant about the khalsa it hated the british and was forever demanding to be led against us south of the sutlej jeendan and jawaheer controlled it as their predecessors had done with huge bribes of pay and privileges but with lakhs being squandered on their depravities even the fabulous wealth of the punjab was beginning to run dry and what then for years wed been watching our northern buffer dissolve in a welter of blood and decay in which we were treatybound not to intervene now the crisis was come how long could jawaheer and jeendan keep the khalsa in hand could they prevent it taking a slap at us with the loot of all india as the prize if the khalsa did invade would our own native troops stand true and if they didnt well no one except a few canny folk like broadfoot cared to think about that or contemplate the kind of thing that halfhappened twelve years later in the mutiny so thats how things stood in august but my alarms as usual were entirely personal meeting sale had scuppered my hopes of lying low for a spell he would see to it that i had a place on goughs staff says he beaming paternally while i frisked in feigned enthusiasm with my bowels dissolving for i knew that being old paddys galloper would be a oneway trip to perdition if the bugles blew in earnest he was commanderinchief was gough an ancient irish squireen whod fought in more battles than any man living and was forever looking for more loved by the troops and much sympathised with just then when he was sweating to secure the frontier against the coming storm and calling down celtic curses on the head of that sensible chap hardinge in calcutta who was forever cautioning him not to provoke the sikhs and countermanding his troop movements but i had no way out sale was off now posthaste to resume his duties as quartermastergeneral on the frontier with poor flashy in tow wondering how i could catch measles or break a leg mind you as we rode north i was much reassured by the assembly of men and material along the grand trunk road from meerut up it was aswarm with british regiments native infantry dragoons lancers company cavalry and guns by the park the khalsall never tackle this crowd thinks i theyd be mad which of course they were but i didnt know the sikhs then or the incredible shifts and intrigues that can make an army march to suicide gough wasnt at headquarters in umballa which we reached early in september hed gone up to simla for a breather and since sales wife was living there we pushed straight on to my delight id heard of it as a great place for high jinks and good living and i foolishly supposed safety it was a glorious spot then before kiplings vulgarians and yahoos had arrived a little jewel of a hill station ringed in by snowclad peaks and pine forests with air that you could almost drink and lovely green valleys like the scotch border country one of em was absolutely called annandale where you could picnic and fete to hearts content emily eden had made it the resort in the s and already there were fine houses on the hillsides and stone bungalows with log fires where you could draw the curtains and think you were back in england they were building the churchs foundations then on the ridges above the bazaar and laying out the cricket ground even the fruits and flowers were like home we had strawberries and cream i remember that first afternoon at lady sales house dear dreadful florentia if youve read my afghan story you know her a rawboned old heroine whod ridden with the army all through that nightmare retreat over the passes from kabul when a force of was whittled almost to nothing by the dourani snipers and khyber knives she hadnt shut up the whole way damning the administration and bullying her bearers colin mackenzie said it was a near thing which was more fearsome a ghazi leaping from the rocks yelling murder or lady sales red nose emerging from a tent demanding to know why the water was not thoroughly boiling she hadnt changed bar the rheumatics from which she could get relief only by cocking a foot up on the table damned unnerving it was to have her boot beside your cup and a great lean shank in red flannel among the muffins flashman keeps staring at my ankle sale cries she they are all alike these young men dont make owl eyes at me sir i remember your pursuit of mrs parker at kabul you thought i had not noticed ha i and the whole cantonment i shall watch you in simla let me tell you this between a harangue about hardinges incompetence and a blistering rebuke to her khansamah for leaving the salt out of the coffee youll gather i was a favourite of hers and after tea she had me reviving afghan memories by rendering drink puppy drink in my sturdy baritone while she thumped the ivories my performance being marred by a sudden falsetto when i remembered that id last sung that jolly ditty in queen ranavalonas boudoir with her black majesty beating time in a most unconventional way that reminded me that simla was famous for its diversions and since the sales were giving dinner that night to gough and some cabbageeating princeling who was making the indian tour i was able to cry off florentia dropping a hint that i should be home before the milk i tooled down the hill to the dirt road that has since become the famous mall taking the air among the fashionable strollers admiring the sunset the giant rhododendrons and simlas two prime attractions hundreds of playful monkeys and scores of playful women unattached the women were their menfolk being hard at it downcountry and the pickings were choice civilian misses saucy infantry wives cavalry mares and bouncing grass widows i ran my eye over em and fastened on a fortyish juno with a merry eye and full nether lip who gave me a thoughtful smile before turning in to the hotel where by the strangest chance i presently encountered her in a secluded corner of the tea verandah we conversed politely about the weather and the latest french novels and she ate a dainty waterice and started to claw at my thigh under the table i like a woman who knows her mind the question was where and i couldnt think of anywhere cosier than the room id been allotted at the back of sales mansion indian servants have eyes in their buttocks of course but the walls were solid not chick and with dusk coming down we could slide in by the french windows unseen her good name had plainly died in the late s for she said it was a capital lark and presently we were slipping through the bushes of sales garden keeping clear of the dinner guests jampan bearers who were squatting by the front verandah we paused for a lustful grapple among the deodars before mounting the steps to the side verandah and dammit there was a light in my room and the sound of a bearer hawking and shuffling within i stood nonplussed while my charmer munched on my ear and tore at my buttons and at that moment some interesting oriental came round the corner of the house expectorating hugely and without thinking i whisked her through the door next to mine closing it softly it proved to be the billiardroom dark empty and smelling of clergymen and since my little flirt now had my pants round my ankles and was trying to plumb my depths i decided it would have to do the diners would be beating their plates for hours yet and gough hadnt the look of a poolshark somehow but caution and delicacy forbade our galloping on the open floor and since there were little curtains between the legs of the table there aint as much deck clearance under a billiard table as you might suppose but after a cramped and feverish partial disrobing we settled down to play fifty up and mrs madison proved to be a most expert tease tittering mischievously and spinning things out so that we must have been everywhere from beneath the baulk to the top cushion and back before i had her trapped by the middle pockets and was able to give of my best and after she had subsided with tremulous whimpers and i had got my breath back it seemed quite cosy dont you know and we whispered and played in the stuffy dark myself drowsy and she giggling at what a frolic it was and i was beginning to consider a return fixture when sale decided hed like a game of billiards i thought i was sent for the door crashed open light shone through the curtains bearers came scurrying in to remove the cover and light the table candles heavy footsteps sounded mens voices laughing and talking and old bob crying this way sir hugh your highness now what shall it be a round game or sides hey their legs were vague shadows beyond the curtains as i bundled mrs madison to the centre and the abandoned trot was positively shaking with laughter i hissed soundlessly in her ear and we lay halfclad and quivering she with mirth and i with fright while the talk and laughter and clatter of cues sounded horrid close overhead of all the damned fixes but there was nothing for it but to lie doggo praying we didnt sneeze or have the conniptions ive had similar experiences since under a sofa on which lord cardigan was paying court to his second wife beneath a dago presidents fourposter and one shocking time in russia when discovery meant certain death but the odd thing is quaking as you are you find yourself eavesdropping for dear life i lay with one ear between mrs madisons paps and the other taking it all in and its worth recounting for it was frontier gossip from our head men and will help you understand what followed in no time i knew who was in the room gough and sale and a pimpish affected lisp which could belong only to the german princeling the pulpit growl of old gravedigger havelock and the high arrogant scotch burr that announced the presence of my old afghan chum george broadfoot now exalted as agent for the northwest frontier he was in full complaint as usual and calcutta rebukes me for taking a high hand with the maharani and her drunken durbar i must not provoke them says hardinge provoke indeed while they run raids on us and ignore my letters and seduce our sepoys half the brothel bints in ludhiana are sikh agents offering our jawans double pay to desert to the khalsa double for infantry sixfold for sowars says sale temptin what spot or plain prince spot if you please but do many of your native soldiers desert then och a few this was gough in his pigsty brogue mind you if ever the khalsa invaded god knows how many might jump on what they thought was the winnin nag or refuse to fight agin fellowinjuns the pills clicked and the prince says but the british will always be the winning side why all india holds your army invincible there was a long pause then broadfoot says not since afghanistan we went in like lions and came out like sheep and india took note who knows what might follow a sikh invasion mutiny its possible a general revolt oh come cries the prince a sikh invasion would be promptly repelled surely is that not so sir hugh more pillclicking and then gough says put it this way sorr if john sepoy turned tail which i dont believe mind id be left wi our british regiments alone agin one hunnert tousand of the best fightin fellows in india european trained markee wi modern arms how many do i get for a cannon will ye tell me two mother o god is it worth it well here goes click damnation me eyes is failin as i was sayin your highness i wouldnt have to make too many mistakes now would i but if there is such danger why do you not march into the punjab now and nip it in the bud another long silence then broadfoot breach of treaty if we did and conquest isnt popular in england since sindl no doubt itll come to that in the end and hardinge knows it for all he says british indias big enough already but the sikhs must strike first you see and sir hughs right thats our moment of peril when theyre south of the sutlej in force and our own sepoys may join em if we struck first treaty or not and tackled the khalsa in the punjab our stock would rise with the sepoys they wouldnt waver and wed win hands down wed have to stay in a territory london dont want but india would be safe from muslim invasion forever a nice circular problem is it not the prince says thoughtfully sir henry hardinge has a dilemma it seems thats why he waits says sale in the faint hope that the present lahore government will restore stability meanwhile reproving me and hindering sir hugh in case we provoke lahore says broadfoot armed observation thats to be our ticket mrs madison gave a gentle snore and i whipped my hand over her mouth pinching her nostrils whats that says a voice overhead did you hear it there was silence while i trembled on the verge of heart failure and then sale says those dam geckoes your shot sir hugh if that wasnt enough mrs madison now awake put her lips to my ear when will they leave off i am ever so cold i made silent frantic motions and she thrust her tongue in my ear so that i missed the next exchange but id heard enough to be sure of one thing however pacific hardinges intentions war was an oddson certainty i dont mean that broadfoot was ready to start it himself but hed jump at the chance if the sikhs gave him one and so no doubt would most of our army folk its a soldiers business after all and by the sound of it the khalsa were ready to oblige and when they did id be in the middle galloper to a general who led not only from the front but from the middle of the enemys blasted army given the chance but the prince was talking again and i strained my ears trying to ignore mrs madison who was burrowing underneath me for warmth presumably but may sir henry not be right surely there is some sikh noble capable of restoring order and tranquillity this maharani for example chunda jinda jeendan says broadfoot shes a hoor they had to translate for the prince who perked up at once indeed one hears astonishing stories they say she is of incomparable beauty and ah insatiable appetite yeve heard of messalina says broadfoot well this lady has been known to discard six lovers in a single night mrs madison whispered i dont believe it and neither did the prince evidently for he cries oh scandalous rumours always multiply facts six in one night indeed how can you be sure of that eyewitnesses says broadfoot curtly and you could almost hear the prince blinking as his imagination went to work someone elses was also taking flight mrs madison possibly inspired by all this disgraceful gossip was becoming attentive again the reckless bitch and try as i would to still her she teased so insistently that i was sure they must hear and havelocks coffin face would pop under the curtain at any moment so what could i do except hold my breath and comply as quietly as possible its an eerie business i can tell you in dead silence and palpitating with fear of discovery and yet its quite soothing in a way i lost all track of their talk and by the time we were done and i was near choking with my shirt stuffed into my mouth they were putting up their cues and retiring thank god and then a moment broadfoot it was gough his voice down dye think his highness might talk at all there could only be the two of them in the room as the geese muck says broadfoot everywhere itll be news to nobody though half the folk in this damned country are spies and the other half are their agents on commission i know how many ears ive got and lahore has twice as many ye can be sure like enough says gough ah well twill all be over by christmas devil a doubt now then whats this sale tells me about young flashman how they didnt hear the sudden convulsion beneath the table god knows for i damned near put my head through the slates i must have him sir ive lost leech and cust will have to take his place there isnt another political in sight and i worked with flashman in afghanistan hes young but he did well among the gilzais he speaks urdu pushtu and punjabi hold yer horses says gough sales promised him the staff an the boy deserves it none more forbye hes a fightin soldier not a clerk if hes to win his way hell do it as he did at jallalabad among hot shot an cold steel with respect sir hugh snaps broadfoot and i could imagine the red beard bristling a political is not a clerk gathering and sifting intelligence dont tell me major broadfoot i was fightin an gatherin intelligence while your grandfather hadnt got the twinkle in his eye yet its a war were talkin about an a war needs warriors so now god help the poor old soul he was talking about me i am thinking of the good of the service sir an im not damn yer scotch impiddence och what the hell yere makin me all hot for nothin now see here george im a fair man i hope an this is what ill do flashman is on the staff an youll not say a word to him mallum but the whole army knows yeve lost leech an theres need for another political if flashman takes it into his head to apply for that vacancy an havin been a political he may be mad enough for anythin then ill not stand in his way but under no compulsion mind that is that fair now no sir says george what young officer would exchange the staff for the political service any number loafers an hyde park hoosars no disrespect to your own people or to young flashman hell do his duty as he sees it well george thats me last word to you now lets pay our respects to lady sale if id had the energy id have given mrs madison another run out of pure thanksgiving i suppose ye know nothing at all says broadfoot about the law of inheritance and widows rights not a dam thing george says i cheerily mind you i can quote you the guvnor on poaching and trespass and i know a husband cant get his hands on his wifes gelt if her father wont let him elspeths parent the loathly morrison had taught me that much rotten with rhino he was too the little reptile haud yer tongue says broadfoot theres for your education then and he pushed a couple of mouldering tomes across the table on top was a pamphlet inheritance act that was my reintroduction to the political service you see what id heard under sales pooltable had been the strains of salvation and ill tell you why as a rule id run a mile from political work skulking about in nigger clobber living on millet and sheep guts lousy as the tinkers dog scared stiff youll start whistling waltzing matilda in a mosque and finishing with your head on a pole like burnes and mcnaghten id been through all that but now there was going to be a pukka war you see and in my ignorance i supposed that the politicals would retire to their offices while the staff gallopers ran errands in the cannons mouth afghanistan had been one of those godless exceptions where no ones safe but the sikh campaign i imagined would be on sound lines more fool me so having thanked the fates that had guided me to roger mrs madison under the green baize and taken soundings to satisfy myself that leech and cust had been peaceably employed id lost no time in running into broadfoot accidentallike great hailfellowings on both sides although i was quite shocked at the change in him the hearty scotch giant all red beard and thick spectacles was quite fallen away liver curling at the edges he explained which was why hed moved his office to simla where the quacks could get a clear run at him hed taken a tumble riding too and went with a stick gasping when he stirred i commiserated and told him my own troubles damning the luck that had landed me on goughs staff and harking back to the brave days when he and i had dodged afridis on the gandamack road having endless fun he was a downy bird george and i could see him marvelling at this coincidence but he probably concluded that gough had dropped me a hint after all for he offered me an assistants berth on the spot so now we were in the chummery of crags his bungalow on mount jacko with me looking glum at the law books and reflecting that this was the price of safety and broadfoot telling me testily that i had better absorb their contents and sharp about it that was another change he was a sight sterner than hed been and it wasnt just his illness hed been a wild aginthegovernment fellow in afghanistan but authority had put him on his dignity and he rode a pretty high horse as agent once for a lark i called him major and he didnt even blink ah well thinks i theres none so prim as a scotsman up in the world in fairness he didnt blink at george either and was easy enough with me in between the snaps and barks next item says he did many folk see ye in umballa shouldnt think so whats it matter i dont owe money the fewer natives who know that iflassman the soldier is on hand the better says he ye havent worn uniform since ye landed good tomorrow yell shave off your moustache and whiskers do it yourself no nappywallah and ill cut your hair myself into something decently civilian give ye a touch of pomade perhaps the sun had got him not a doubt hold on george ill need a dam good reason im telling ye and thats reason enough snarls he liver in rough order i could see then he managed a sour grin this isnt the kind of political bandobast yere used to yell not be playing badoo the badmash this time well that was something no youre a proper wee civilian henceforth in a tussore suit high collar and tall hat riding in a jampan with a chotawallah to carry your green bag as befits a man of the law well versed in widows titles he studied me sardonically for a long moment doubtless enjoying my bewilderment i think yed better have a look at your brief says he and rose stiffly cursing his leg he led me into the little hall through a small door and down a short flight of steps into a cellar where one of his pathan sappers was squatting under a lamp glowering at three huge jars all of five feet high which took up most of the tiny cell two of them were secured with silk cords and great red seals broadfoot leaned on the wall to ease his leg and signed to the pathan who removed the lid from the unsealed jar holding the lamp to shine on its contents i looked and was sufficiently impressed whats up george says i dont you trust the banks the jar was packed to the brim with gold a mass of coin glinting under the light broadfoot gestured and i picked up a handful cold and heavy clinking as it trickled back into the jar i am the bank says broadfoot theres ј here in mohurs ingots and fashioned gold its disposal may well depend on you tik hai mahmud he limped aloft again while i followed in silence wondering what the devil i was in for this time not that it looked perilous thank heaven broadfoot settled gratefully in his chair that treasure says he is the legacy of raja soochet singh a punjabi prince who died two years ago leading sixty followers against an army of twenty thousand he wagged his red head aye theyre game lads up yonder well now like most punjabi nobles in these troubled times he had put his wealth in the only safe place in the care of the hated british infidels we may be but we keep honest books and they know it theres a cool twenty million sterling of punjab money south of the sutlej this minute for two years past the court of lahore which means the regents jawaheer singh and his slut of a sister have been demanding the return of soochets legacy on the ground that he was a forfeited rebel our line more or less has been that rebel is an unsatisfactory term since naebody kens who the punjab government is from one day to the next and that the money should go to soochets heirs his widow or his brother raja goolab singh weve taken counsels opinion says he straightfaced but the position is complicated by the fact that the widow was last heard of fleeing for her life from a beleaguered fort while goolab who had designs on the punjab throne at one time has lately proclaimed himself king of kashmir and is sitting behind a rock up jumoo way with fifty thousand hillmen at his back however we have sure information that both he and the widow are of opinion that the money is fine where it is for the time being he paused and isnt it was on the tip of my tongue for i didnt care for this above half talk of besieged forts and hillmen unsettles me and i had horrid visions of flashy sneaking through the passes with a portmanteau bearing statements of compound interest to these two eccentric legatees both of whom were probably dam dangerous to know a further complication says broadfoot is that jawaheer singh is threatening to make this legacy a cause of war as you know peace is in the balance those three jars down there might tip the scale naturally sir henry hardinge wishes negotiations about the legacy to be reopened at lahore not with a view to settlement of course but to temporise he looked at me over his spectacles were not ready yet to settle or to go to war having eavesdropped on broadfoots opinions i could guess which just as i could see with sudden horrible clarity who the negotiator was going to be in that court of bhang sodden savages where they murdered each other regular after supper but that apart the thing made no sense at all you want me to go to lahore but i aint a lawyer dammit why ive only been in a court twice in my life drunk and resisting arrest and being apprehended on premises known to be a disorderly house five quid each time not that it mattered they dont ken that says broadfoot dont they though george i aint puffing myself but im not unknown over there man alive when we had a garrison in lahore in i was being trumpeted all over the shop why you said yourself the fewer who knew iflassman was back the better they know im a soldier dont they bloody lance and all that rot so they may says he blandly but whos to say ye havent been eating your dinner in middle temple hall these three years past if hardinge sends ye accredited and under seal theyre not going to doubt ye ye can pick up the jargon and as much law as yell need from those he indicated the books but wheres the point a real lawyer can spin the thing out ten times better than i can calcuttas full of em but they cant speak punjabi they cant be my eyes and ears in lahore fort they cant take the pulse in that vipers nest of intrigue theyre not politicals trained by sekundar burnes and if the grip comes he tapped his desk triumphantly they cant turn themselves into a khyekeen or barukzai jezzailchi and slip back over the sutlej so i was to be a spy in that den of devilment i sat appalled stammering out the first objection that came to mind and a fat chance ill have of doing that with my face shaved he waved it aside ye cannot go to lahore with soldier written all over ye forbye itll never come to disguise or anything desperate youll be a british diplomat the governorgenerals envoy and immune so was mcnaghten i wanted to holler so was burnes so were connolly and stoddart and uncle tom cobleigh its on their bloody tombstones and then he unveiled the full horror of the thing that immunity will enable you to remain in lahore after the war has begun supposing it does and that is when your real work will begin and id exchanged a staff billet for this the prospect was fit to make me puke but i darent say so not to broadfoot somehow i contained my emotion assumed a ruptured frown and said surely a diplomat would be expelled or confined at least not for a moment oh he had it all pat blast him from the day you arrive in lahore and thereafter whatever befalls yell be the most courted man in the punjab its this way theres a war party and a peace party and the khalsa and the panch committees that control it and a faction that wants us to take the punjab and a faction that wants us driven from india altogether and some that hop from one side to tother and cabals and cliques that dont ken what they want because theyre too drunk and debauched to think he leaned forward all eager red whiskers his eyes huge behind the bottle lenses but they all want to be on the right side at the finish and most have wit enough to see that that will be our side oh theyll shift and swither and plot and yell be approached with more hints and ploys and assurances of good will than ye can count from enemies wholl be friends tomorrow and vice versa all of which yell transmit secretly to me he sat back well pleased with himself while i kept a straight face with my bowels in my boots thats the marrow of the business now for your more particular information he brought out a sheaf of those slim buff packets that i remembered from burness office at kabul i knew what they held maps names places reports and summaries laws and customs biographies and artists sketches heights and distances history geography even weights and measures all that years of intelligence and espionage had gathered about the punjab to be digested and returned when yeve studied these and the law books well talk at more length says he and asked if i had any observations i could have made a few but what was the use i was sunk through my own folly as usual if i hadnt thumped that randy baggage madison id never have overheard gough and rushed rejoicing into this hellish political stew it didnt bear thinking of all i could do was show willing for my precious credits sake so i asked him who the friends and enemies in lahore were likely to be if i knew that ye wouldnt be going oh i ken who our professed sympathisers and illwillers are at the moment but where theyll stand next week take goolab singh soochets fugitive heir hes sworn that if the khalsa marches hell stand by us well perhaps he will in the hope that well confirm him in kashmir but if the khalsa were to give us a wee setback where would goolab and his hillmen be then eh loyal or thinking about the loot of delhi i could see where flashy would be stranded in lahore among the raging heathen i knew better than to ask him what other politicals and trusted agents would be on hand so i went round about how shall i report to you through the vakil no such thing hes a native and not a sure one he can take any letters ye may write about the soochet legacy but anything secret will be in cypher notes which youll leave in second thessalonians on the bedside table in your quarters second where he looked at me as though id farted in your bible man you could see him wondering if my bedside reading wasnt more likely to be tom and jerry the cypher and coding instructions are in the packets your messages will be collected never fear so there was a trusted messenger at the court and the fact that i wasnt to be told who was another thought to chill my blood what you dont know you cant tell if inquisitive folk approach you with hot irons what if i need to get word to you quickly i mean if the khalsa march all of a sudden ill ken that before you do what you must discover then is why theyve marched who set them on and for what purpose if its war whats behind it and how came it to begin thats what i must know he hunched forward again intent ye see flashy to know precisely why your enemy is making war what he hopes to gain and fears to lose is to be halfway to winning mind that looking back i can say it made good sense though i was in no state to appreciate it then but i nodded dutifully with that grim attentive mien which ive learned to wear while scheming frantically how to slide out from under this soochet legacy then its all gammon by no means its your excuse for being in lahore to be sure as their subtler folk will suspect but its still a genuine cause which yell argue with their officials perhaps even in full durbar with the regents if theyre sober in which case keep your wits about you jawaheers a frightened degenerate weakling and maharani jeendan seems set on destroying herself by vicious indulgence he paused fingering his beard while i perked up a trifle like prince whatsisname he went on frowning im not sure about her though she had rare spirit and ability once or shed never have climbed from the stews to the throne aye courage too dye know how she once quelled a mob of her mutinous soldiery and them bent on slaughter i said id no notion and waited breathless she danced aye put on veils and castanets and danced them daft and they went home like sheep broadfoot shook his head in admiration no doubt wishing hed been there practising her trade she danced in the amritsar brothels as a child before she caught runjeets fancy he gave a grimace of distaste aye and what she learned there has obsessed her ever since until her minds unhinged with it i think dancing says i and he shot me a doubtful look he was a proper christian you see and knew nothing about me beyond my supposed heroics debauchery with men he gave a presbyterian sniff hesitating no doubt to sully my boyish mind she has an incurable lust what the medicos call nymphomania its driven her to unspeakable excesses not only with every man of rank in lahore but slaves and sweepers too her present favourite is lal singh a powerful general although i hear she abandoned him briefly of late for a stable lad who robbed her of ten lakhs of jewels i was so shocked i couldnt think what to say except easy come easy go i doubt if the stable lad thought so hes in a cage over the looharree gate this minute minus his nose lips ears et cetera they tell me that says broadfoot is why i say im not sure about her debauched or not the lady is still formidable and id been looking forward no end to meeting her too flashys ideal of womanhood shed sounded like until this the last grisly detail in the whole hideous business that night in my room at crags after id pored through broadfoots packets flung the lawbooks in a corner paced up and down racking my brains for a way out and found none i felt so low altogether that i decided to complete my misery by shaving my whiskers thats how reduced i was when id done and stared at my naked chops in the glass remembering how elspeth had adored my facefurniture and sworn they were what had first won her girlish heart i could have wept beardiebeardie she used to murmur fondly and that sent me into a maudlin reverie about that first splendid tumble in the bushes by the clyde and equally glorious romps in the madagascar forest from which my mind naturally strayed to frenzied gallops with queen ranavalona who hadnt cared for whiskers at all leastways she always used to try to wrench mine out by the roots in moments of ecstasy well some women dont like em i reflected idly that the maharani jeendan who evidently counted all time lost when she wasnt being bulled by sikhs must be partial to beards then again she might welcome a change by george that would ease the diplomatic burden no place like bed for state secrets useful patroness too in troubled times mind you if she wore out six strong men in a night lahore bazaar had better be well stocked with stout and oysters mere musing as i say but something similar may have been troubling the mind of major broadfoot g for while i was still admiring my commanding profile in the glass in he tooled looking middling uneasy i thought he apologised for intruding and then sat down prodding the rug with his stick and pondering finally flashy how old are ye i told him twentythree he grunted yere married though wondering i said id been wed five years and he frowned and shook his head even so dear me youre young for this lahore business hope sprang at once then he went on what i mean is its the deuce of a responsibility im putting on you the price of fame i suppose kabul mogala pipers fort man its a brave tale and you just a bit laddie as my grandam would have said but this thing says he seriously perhaps an older head a man of the world aye if there was anyone else i know when not to snatch at a cue i can tell you i waited till i saw him about to continue and then got in first slow and thoughtful george i know im dead green in some ways and its true enough im more at home with a sabre than a cypher what id never forgive myself if i well if i failed you of all people old fellow through inexperience i mean so if you want to send an older hand well manly you see putting service before self hiding my disappointment all it got me was a handclasp and a noble gleam of his glasses flashy yere a trump but the fact is theres no one in your parish for this work oh its not just the punjabi or that youve shown a stout front and a cool head aye and resource beyond your years i think youll succeed in this because ye have a gift with with folk that makes them take to you he gave a little uneasy laugh not meeting my eye its what troubles me in a way men respect you women admire you and he broke off taking another prod at the carpet and id have laid gold to groceries his thoughts were what mine had been before he came in ive wondered since what hed have done if id said very good george we both suspect that this horny bitch will corrupt my youthful innocence but if i pleasure her groggy enough why i may turn her mind inside out which is what youre after and how dye want me to steer her then george supposing i can what would suit calcutta being broadfoot hed probably have knocked me down he was honest that far if hed been the hypocrite that most folk are hed not have come up to see me at all but he had the conscience of his time you see biblereared and shunning sin and the thought that my success in lahore might depend on fornication set him a fine ethical problem he couldnt solve it i doubt if dr arnold and cardinal newman could either of course if it had been slaughter not adultery that was necessary none of my pious generation would even have blinked soldiers duty you see i may tell you that in broadfoots shoes with so much at stake id have told my young emissary rogers the answer and wished him good hunting but then im a scoundrel but i mustnt carp at old george for his tortured conscience saved my skin in the end im sure it made him feel that for some twisted reason he owed me something so he bent his duty just a little by giving me a lifeline in case things went amiss it wasnt much but it might have imperilled another of his people so as an amend i reckon it pretty high after hed finished havering and not saying what couldnt be said he turned to go still looking uneasy then he stopped hesitated and came out with it see here says he i should not be saying this but if the grip does come which i dont believe it will mind and ye find yourself in mortal danger theres a thing you can do he glowered at me mauling his whiskers as a last resort only mallum yell think it strange but its a word a password if ye like utter it anywhere within the bounds of lahore fort dropped into conversation or shouted from the housetops if need be and the odds are therell be those wholl pass it and a friend will come to you ye follow well the word is wisconsin he was as deadly serious as id ever seen him wisconsin i repeated and he nodded never breathe it unless ye have to its the name of a river in north america it might have been the name of a privy in penzance for all the good it seemed likely to be well i was wrong there ive set out on my countrys service more times than i can count always reluctantly and often as not in a state of alarm but at least ive usually known what i was meant to be doing and why the punjab business was different as i wended my sweltering dustdriven way to ferozepore on the frontier the whole thing seemed more unlikely by the mile i was going to a country in uproar whose mutinous army might invade us at any moment i was to present a legal case at a court of profligate murderous intriguers on whom war or no war i was also to spy both being tasks for which i was untrained whatever broadfoot might say i had been assured that the work was entirely safe and told almost in the same breath that when all hell broke loose i had only to holler wisconsin and a genie or broadfoots grandmother or the household brigade would emerge from a bottle and see me right just so well i didnt believe a word of it you see tyro though i was i knew the political service and the kind of larks it could get up to like not telling a fellow until it was too late two fearsome possibilities had occurred to my distrustful mind either i was a decoy to distract the enemy from other agents or i was being placed in the deep field to receive secret instructions when war started in either case i foresaw fatal consequences and to make matters worse i had dark misgivings about the native assistant broadfoot had assigned to me you remember the chotawallah who was to carry my green bag his name was jassa and he wasnt chota i had envisaged the usual fat babu or skinny clerk but jassa was a pockmarked barrelchested villain complete with hairy poshteen skullcap and khyber knife just the man youd choose as a rule to see you through rough country but i was leery of this one from the start for one thing he pretended to be a baloochi dervish and wasnt i put him down for afghan chichi for he was greyeyed had no greater a gap between his first and second toes than i did and possessed something rare among europeans at that time let alone natives a vaccination mark i spotted it at ferozepore when he was washing at the tank but didnt let on he was from broadfoots stable after all and plainly knew his business which was to act as orderly guide shieldonshoulder and general adviser on country matters still i didnt trust him above half ferozepore was the last outpost of british india then a beastly hole not much better than a village beyond which lay the broad brown flood of the sutlej and then the hot plain of the punjab we had just built a barracks for our three battalions one british and two native infantry who garrisoned the place god help them for it was hotter than hells pavement you boiled when it rained and baked when it didnt in my civilian role i didnt call on littler who commanded but put up with peter nicolson broadfoots local assistant he was suffering for his country that one dried out and hollowcheeked with the worst job in india nursemaiding the frontier finding shelter for the endless stream of refugees from the punjab sniffing out the troublemakers sent to seduce our sepoys and disaffect the zamindars chasing raiding parties disarming badmashes ruling a district and keeping the queens peace all this mind you without provoking a hostile power which was spoiling for trouble it cant last says he cheerfully and i wondered how long he could with that impossible task and the mercury at theyre just waitin for an excuse an if i dont give em one why theyll roll over the river as soon as the cold weather comes horse foot an guns youll see we ought to go in an smash em now while theyre in two minds an gettin over the cholera five thousand of the khalsa have died in lahore but its past its worst he was seeing me down to the ferry at daybreak when i mentioned the great assembly of our troops id seen above meerut he laughed and pointed back to the cantonment where the nd were drilling the red and buff figures like dolls in the heat haze never mind whats on the grand trunk says he thats whats here my boy seven thousand men onethird british an only light guns up there he pointed north is the khalsa one hundred thousand of the finest native army in asia with heavy guns theyre two days march away our nearest reinforcements are gilberts ten thousand at umballa a weeks march away and wheelers five thousand at ludhiana only five days march strong on mathematics are you id heard vague talk in simla as you know about our weakness on the frontier but its different when youre on the spot and hear the figures but why i was beginning and nicolson chuckled and shook his head doesnt gough reinforce now he mimicked me because it would provoke lahore my goodness it provokes lahore if one of our sepoys walks north to the latrines i hear theyre goin to demand that we withdraw even the troops we have up here now perhaps thatll start the war even if your soochet legacy doesnt he knew about that and had twitted me about how id be languishing at the feet of the fair sultana while honest soldiers like him were chasing infiltrators along the river i dont know why i remember those words or the sight of him with that great mob of niggers chattering about him while his orderlies cuffed and pushed them up to the camp where theyd be fed and looked after he was for all the world like a prepostor marshalling the fags laughing and swearing by turns with a chico perched on his shoulder id not have touched the verminous imp for a pension he was a kindly cheery ass working twenty hours a day minding his frontier four months later he got his reward a bullet i wonder if anyone else remembers him the last time id crossed the sutlej had been four years earlier where there was a british army ahead and we had posts all the way to kabul now there were no friends before me and no one to turn to except the khyberie thug jassa and our gaggle of bearers they were there chiefly because broadfoot had said i should enter lahore in a jampan to impress the sikhs with my consequence thanks george but i felt damned unimportant as i surveyed my waiting escort and jassa did nothing to raise my spirits gorracharra grunts he and spat irregular cavalry it is an insult to thee husoor these should have been men of the palace pukka cavalry they seek to put shame on us the hindoo swine i told him pretty sharp to mind his manners but i saw what he meant they were typical native irregulars splendid cavalry undoubtedly but dressed and armed any old how with lances bows tulwars and ancient firearms some in mail coats and helmets others barelegged and all grinning most familiarly not what youd call a guard of honour yet thats what they were as i learned when their officer a handsome young sikh in a splendid rigout of yellow silk addressed me by name and by fame sardul singh at your service flashman bahadur cries he teeth flashing through his beard i was by the turksalee gate when you came down from jallalabad and all men came to see the afghan kush so much for broadfoots notion that shaving my whiskers would help me to pass unnoticed mind you it was famous to hear myself described as the slayer of afghans if quite undeserved when we heard you were coming with the book and not the sword may it be an omen of peace for our peoples i sought command of your escort and these are volunteers he indicated his motley squadron men of the sirkart in their time a fitter escort for bloody lance than khalsa cavalry well this was altogether grand so i thanked him raised my civilian kepi to his grinning bandits saying salaam bha which pleased them no end i took the first chance to remind jassa how wrong hed been but the curmudgeon only grunted the sikh speaks the cobra spits who grows fat on the difference theres no pleasing some folk between the sutlej and lahore lie fifty of the hottest flattest scrubbiest miles on earth and i supposed wed cover them in a long days ride but sardul said we should lie overnight at a serai a few miles from the city there was something he wanted me to see so we did and after supper he took me through a copse to the loveliest place i ever saw in india there all unexpected after the heat and dust of the plain was a great garden with little palaces and pavilions among the trees all hung with coloured lanterns in the warm dusk streams meandered among the lawns and flowerbeds the air was fragrant with nightblooms soft music sounded from some hidden place and everywhere couples were strolling hand in hand or deep in lovers talk under the boughs the chinese summer palace where i walked years later was altogether grander i suppose but there was a magic about that indian garden that i cant describe you could call it perfect peace with its gentle airs rustling the leaves and the lights winking in the twilight it was the kind of spot where scheherazade might have told her unending stories even its name sounds like a caress shalamar but this wasnt the sight that sardul wanted me to see that was something unimaginably different and we viewed it next morning we left the serai at dawn but instead of riding towards lahore which was in full view in the distance we went a couple of miles out of our way towards the great plain of maian mir where sardul assured me mysteriously the true wonder of the punjab would be shown to me knowing the oriental mind i could guess it was something designed to strike awe in the visiting foreigner well it did all of that we heard it long before we saw it the flat crash of artillery at first and then a great confused rumble of sound which resolved itself into the squealing of elephants the high bray of trumpets the rhythm of drums and martial music and the thunder of a thousand hooves making the ground tremble beneath us i knew what it was before we rode out of the trees and halted on a bund to view it in breathtaking panorama the pride of the punjab and the dread of peaceful india the famous khalsa now ive taken note of a few heathen armies in my time the heavenly host of taiping was bigger the black tide of cetewayos legions sweeping into little hand was surely more terrifying and theres a special place in my nightmares for that vast forest of tipis five miles wide that i looked down on from the bluffs over little bighorn but for pure military might ive seen nothing outside europe to match that great disciplined array of men and beasts and metal on maian mir as far as you could see among the endless lines of tents and waving standards the broad maidan was alive with foot battalions at drill horse regiments at field exercise and guns at practice and they were all uniformed and in perfect order that was the shocking thing black brown and yellow armies in those days you see might be as brave as any but they didnt have centuries of drill and tactical movement drummed into em not even the zulus or ranavalonas hova guardsmen that was the thing about the khalsa it was aldershot in turbans it was an army thats worth bearing in mind when you hear some smart alec holding forth about our imperial wars being onesided massacres of poor clubwaving heathen mown down by gatlings oh it happened at ulundi and washita and omdurman but more often than not the snider and martini and brown bess were facing odds of ten to one against in country where shrapnel and rapid fire dont count for much your savage with his blowpipe or bow or jezzail behind a rock has a deuce of an advantage its his rock you see anyway our detractors never mention armies like the khalsa every bit as wellarmed and equipped as we were so how did we hold india youll see presently that morning on maian mir the confidence id felt viewing our forces on the grand trunk vanished like punjabi mist i thought of littlers puny seven thousand isolated at ferozepore our other troops scattered waiting to be eaten piecemeal by this juggernaut a hundred thousand strong a score of vivid images stay in my mind a regiment of sikh lancers wheeling at the charge in perfect dressing the glittering points falling and rising as one a battalion of jat infantry with moustaches like buffalo horns white figures with black crossbelts moving like clockwork as they performed at the halt on the left form companies dogra light infantry advancing in skirmishing order the blue turbans suddenly closing in immaculate line the bayonet points ripping into the sandbags to a savage yell of khalsaji heavy guns being dragged through swirling dust by trumpeting elephant teams while the gunners trimmed their fuses the cases being thrust home the deafening roar of the salvo and damme if those shells didnt burst a mile away in perfect unison all above ground even the sight of the light guns cutting their curtain targets to shreds with grape wasnt as sickening as the precision of the heavy batteries they were as good as royal artillery aye and with bigger shot they made all their own material too from brown bess to howitzers in the lahore foundry from our regulation patterns only one fault could i find with their gunners and infantry their drill was perfect but slow their cavalry well it was fit to ride over napoleon sardul took good care to let me see all this pour encourager les feringhees we tiffened with some of their senior men all courteous to a fault and not a word about the likelihood that our armies would be at each others throats by christmas the sikhs are damned good form you know there wasnt a european mercenary in sight by the way having built an army theyd retired for the best of reasons disgust at the state of the country and reluctance to find themselves fighting john company i saw another side to the khalsa when we set out for lahore after noon flashy now riding in state in his jampan white topper and flywhisk at the high port with jassa kicking the bearers arses to give tone to our progress we were swaying along in fine style past the headquarters tents when we became aware of a crowd of soldiery gathered before the main pavilion listening to some upper rojer on a dais sardul reined in to listen and when i asked jassa what this might be he growled and spat the panchayats if old runjeet had seen the day hed have cut his beard so these were the khalsas notorious military committees of whom wed heard so much you see while their field discipline was perfect khalsa policy was determined by the panches where jack jawan was as good as his master and all went by democratic vote no way to run an army i agreed with jassa small wonder they hadnt crossed the sutlej yet they were an astonishing mixture barelegged sepoys officers in red silk fierceeyed akalis in peaked blue turbans and gold beardnets a portly old rissaldarmajor with white whiskers a foot wide irregular sowars in lobstertail helmets dogra musketeers in green pathans with long camel guns there seemed to be every rank caste and race crowding round the speaker a splendid sikh six and a half feet tall in cloth of silver bellowing to make himself heard all that we heard from attack is true young peshora is dead and kashmiri singh with him taken in sleep after the hunting by chuttur singh and futteh khan tell us what we dont know bawls a heckler and the big fellow raised his arms to still the yells of agreement you dont know the manner of it the shame and black treachery imam shah was in attock fort let him tell you a burly bargee in a mail jacket with a bandolier of ivoryhilted knives round his hips jumps on the dais and they fell silent it was foully done croaks he peshora singh knew it was his time for they had him in irons and bore him before the jackal chuttur singh peshora looked him in the eye and called for a sword let me die like a soldier says he but chuttur would not look on him but wagged his head and made soft excuses again the young hawk cried for a sword you are thousands i am alone there can be but one end so let it be straight chuttur sighed and whined and turned away waving his hands straight coward cries peshora but they bore him away all this i saw they took him to the kolboorj dungeon and choked him like a thief with his chains and cast him in the river this i did not see i was told god wither my tongue if i lie peshora singh had been the form horse in the throne stakes according to nicolson well thats politics for you i wondered if this would mean a change of government for peshora had been the khalsas idol and while his death seemed to be old news the manner of it seemed to put them in a great taking they were all yelling at once and the tall sikh had to bellow again we have sent the parwana to the palace you all approved it what is there to do but wait wait while the snake jawaheer butchers other true men bawls a voice hes peshoras murderer for all he skulks in the kwabagh yonder let us visit him now and give him a sleep indeed this got a rousing hand but others shouted that jawaheer was the hope of the side and innocent of peshoras death who bribed thee to say that roars the rissaldarmajor all fire and whiskers did jawaheer buy thee with a gold chain boroowa or perchance mai jeendan danced for thee fornicating strumpet that she is cries of shame shabash and the punjabi equivalent of mr chairman some pointing out that the maharani had promised them fifteen rupees a month to march against the bastardised british pigs and jawaheer was just the chap to lead them another suggested that jawaheer wanted war only to draw the khalsas fury from his own head and that the maharani was an abominable whore of questionable parentage who had lately had a brahmins nose sliced off when he rebuked her depravities so there a beardless youth frothing with loyalty offered to eat the innards of anyone who impugned the honour of that saintly woman and the meeting seemed likely to dissolve in riot when a gorgeouslyrobed old general hawkfaced and commanding mounted the dais and let them have it straight from the shoulder silence are ye soldiers or fishwives ye have heard pirthee singh the parwana has been sent summoning jawaheer to come out to us on the sixth of assin to answer for peshoras death or show himself guiltless there is no more to be said but this he paused and you could have heard a pin drop as his cold eye ranged over them we are the khalsa the pure and our allegiance is to none but our maharaja dalip singh may god protect his innocence our swords and lives are his alone thunderous cheers the old rissaldarmajor spouting tears of loyalty as to marching against the british that is for the panchayats to decide another day but if we do then i general maka khan he slapped his breast shall march because the khalsa wills it and not for the wiles of a naked cunchunee or the whim of a drunken dancingboy with that summary of the regents characters the days business concluded and i was relieved as sardul led us past the dispersing soldiery to note that any glances in my direction were curious rather than hostile indeed one or two saluted and you may be sure i responded civilly this heartened me for it suggested that broadfoot was right and whatever upheavals in government took place dramatic ones by the sound of it the stranger flashy would be respected within their gates their opinion of his country notwithstanding we approached lahore roundabout skirting the main town which is a filthy maze of crooked streets and alleys to the northern side where the fort and palace building dominate the city lahores an impressive place or was then more than a mile across and girdled by towering thirtyfoot walls which overlooked a deep moat and massive earthworks since gone i believe in those days you were struck by the number and grandeur of its gates and by the extent of the fort and palace on their eminence with the great halfoctagon tower the summum boorj thrusting up like a giant finger close to the northern ramparts it loomed above us as we entered by the rushnai or bright gate past the swarms of dustcovered workmen labouring on old runjeets mausoleum and into the court garden to the right a tremendous flight of steps led up to badshai musjit the great triple mosque said to be the biggest on earth mind you the samarkandians say the same of their mosque and to the left was the inner gate up to the fort a bewildering place full of contradictions for it contains not only the sleeping palace but a foundry and arsenal close by the splendid pearl mosque which is used as a treasury and over one of the gates a figure of the virgin mary which they say shah jehan put up to keep the portugee traders happy but there was something stranger still id just bidden farewell to sarduls escort and my jampan and was being conducted on foot by a yellowclad officer of the palace guard when i noticed an extraordinary figure lounging in an embrasure above the gate swigging from an enormous tankard and barking orders at a party of guardsmen drilling with the light guns on the wall he was a real pathan mercenary with iron moustaches and a nose like a hatchet but he was dressed from top to toe puggaree robe and pyjamys in the red tartan of the th highlanders well ive seen a madagascar nigger in a black watch kilt but this beat all stranger still he carried a great metal collar in one hand and each time before he drank he would clamp it round his throat almost as though he expected the liquor to leak out through his adams apple i turned to remark on this to jassa and dammit hed vanished nowhere to be seen i stared about and demanded of the officer where he had got to but he hadnt seen him at all so in the end i found myself being led onward alone with all my former alarms rushing back at the gallop you may wonder why just because my orderly had gone astray aye but hed done it at the very moment of entering the lions den so to speak and the whole mission was mysterious and chancy enough to begin with and im gods own original funk so there and i smelled mischief here in this maze of courts and passages with high walls looming about me i didnt even care for the splendid apartments to which i was conducted they were on an upper storey of the sleeping palace two lofty spacious rooms joined by a broad moorish arch with mosaic tiles and persian murals a little marble balcony overlooking a secluded fountain court silks on the bed silent bearers to stow my kit two pretty little maids who shimmied in and out bringing water and towels and tea and a cooling breeze provided by an ancient punkahwallah in the passage when the old bugger was awake which was seldom for some reason the very luxury of the place struck me as sinister as though designed to lull my fears at least there were two doors one from either chamber i do like to know theres a line of retreat i washed and changed still fretting about jassas absence and was about to lie down to calm my nerves when my eye lit on a book on the bedside table and i sat up with a start for it was a bible placed by an unknown hand in case id forgotten my own of course broadfoot thinks i youre an uneasy man to work for but by god you know your business it reminded me that i wasnt quite cut off i found i was muttering wisconsin then humming it shakily to the tune of my bonnie is over the ocean and on the spur of the moment i dug out my cypher key crotchet castle the edition of if youre interested and began to write broadfoot a note of all that id heard on maian mir and i had just completed it and inserted it carefully at second thessalonians and was glumly pondering a verse that read pray without ceasing and thinking a fat lot of good thatll do when the door slammed open there was a bloodcurdling shriek a mad dwarf flourishing a gleaming sabre leaped into the archway and i rolled off the bed with a yell of terror scrabbling for the pepperbox in my open valise floundering round to cover the arch my finger snatching at the trigger ring in the archway stood a tiny boy not above seven years old one hand clutching his little sabre the other pressed to his teeth eyes shining with delight my wavering pistol fell away and the little monster fairly crowed with glee clapping his hands mangla mangla come and see come on woman it is he the afghan killer he has a great gun mangla he was going to shoot me oh shabash shabash ill give you shabash you little sonofabitch i roared and was going for him when a woman came flying into the archway scooping him up in her arms and i stopped dead for one thing she was a regular plum and for another the imp was glaring at me in indignation and piping no no you may shoot me but dont dare strike me i am a maharaja ive met royalty unexpected a number of times face to face with my twin carl gustaf in the jotunberg dungeon quaking in my rags before the black basilisk ranavalona speechless as lakshmibai regarded me gravely from her swing stark naked and trussed in the presence of the future empress of china and had eyes only for the principal but in the case of dalip singh lord of the punjab my attention was all for his protectress she was a little spanker this mangla your true kashmiri beauty creamskinned and perfect of feature tall and shapely as hebe eyes wide at me as she clasped him to her bosom the lucky lad he didnt know when he was well off though for he slapped her face and yelled set me down woman who bade thee interfere let me go id have walloped the tyke but after another searching glance at me she set him down and stepped back adjusting her veil with a little coquettish toss of her head even with my panic still subsiding i thought aha heres another who fancies flash at short notice the ungrateful infant gave her a push for luck straightened his shoulders and made me a jerky bow hand over heart royal as bedamned in his little aigretted turban and gold coat i am dalip singh you are flashman bahadur the famous soldier let me see your gun i resisted an impulse to tan his backside and bowed in turn forgive me maharaj i would not have drawn it in your presence but you took me unawares no i didnt cries he grinning you move as the cobra strikes too quickly to see oh it was fine and you must be the bravest soldier in the world now your gun maharaj you forget yourself manglas voice was sharp and not at all humble you have not given proper welcome to the english lord sahib and it is unmannerly to burst in on him instead of receiving him in durbar what will he think of us meaning what does he think of me to judge from another glance of those fine gazelle eyes i gave her my gallant leer and hastened to toady her overlord his majesty honours me but will you not sit maharaj and your lady also lady he stared and laughed why shes a slave arent you mangla your mothers slave maharaj says she coldly not yours then go and wait on my mother cries the pup not meeting her eye i wish to speak with flashman bahadur you could see her itching to upend him but after a moment she gave him a deep salaam and me a last appraisal up and down which i returned admiring her graceful carriage as she swayed out while the little pest tried to disarm me i told him firmly that a soldier never gives his weapon to anyone but that id hold it for him to see if he showed me his sword in the same way so he did and then stared at my pepperbox mouth open when i am a man says he i shall be a soldier of the sirkar and have such a gun i asked why the british army and not the khalsa and he shook his head the khalsa are mutinous dogs besides the british are the best soldiers in the world zeenan khan says whos zeenan khan one of my grooms he was flankmanfirstsquadronfifthbengalcavalrygeneralsalesahibinafghanistan rattled out as zeenan must have taught him he pointed at me he saw you at jallalabad fort and told me how you slew the muslims he has only one arm and no pinshun now thats a pension well see paid with arrears thinks i an exsowar of bengal cavalry who has a kings ear is worth a few chips a month i asked if i could meet zeenan khan if you like but he talks a lot and always the same story of the ghazi he killed at teizin did you kill many ghazis tell me about them so i lied for a few minutes and the bloodthirsty little brute revelled in every decapitation eyes fixed on me his small face cupped in his hands then he sighed and said his uncle jawaheer must be mad he wants to fight the british bhai ram says hes a fool that an ant cant fight an elephant but my uncle says we must or you will steal my country from me your uncle is mistaken says diplomatic flashy if that were true would i be here in peace no id have a sword you have a gun he pointed out gravely thats a gift says i inspired which ill present to a friend of mine when i leave lahore you have friends in lahore says he frowning i have now says i winking at him and after a moment his jaw dropped and he squealed with glee gad wasnt i doing my countrys work though i shall have it that gun oh oh he hugged himself capering and will you teach me your warcry you know the great shout you gave just now when i ran in with my sword the small face puckered as he tried to say it wee ska see i was baffled and then it dawned wisconsin gad my instinct for selfpreservation must be working well for me to squeal that without realising it oh that was nothing maharaj tell you what though ill teach you to shoot you will with that gun he sighed ecstatically then i shall be able to shoot lal singh i remembered the name a general the maharanis lover whos lal singh maharaj he shrugged oh one of my mothers bedmen seven years old mark you he hates me i cant tell why all her other bedmen like me and give me sweets and toys he shook his head in perplexity hopping on one leg no doubt to assist thought i wonder why she has so many bedmen ever so many cold feet i dare say look younker maharaj i mean hadnt you better be running along mangla will be mangla has bedmen too insists this fount of scandal but uncle jawaheer is her favourite do you know what lady eneela says they do he left off hopping and took a deep breath lady eneela says they fortunately before my delicacy could receive its death blow mangla suddenly reappeared quite composed considering shed plainly had her ear at the keyhole and informed his garrulous majesty peremptorily that his mother commanded him to the durbar room he pouted and kicked his heels but finally submitted exchanged salaams and allowed her to shoo him into the passage to my surprise she didnt follow but closed the door and faced me mighty cool she didnt look at all like a slavegirl and she didnt talk like one his majesty speaks as children do says she you will not mind him especially what he says of his uncle wazir jawaheer singh no sahib or downcast eyes or humble tone you notice i took her in from the dainty persian slippers and tight silk trousers to the wellfilled bodice and the calm lovely face framed by the flimsy head veil and moved up for a closer view i care nothing about your wazir little mangla smiles i but if our small tyrant speaks true i envy him jawaheer is not a man to be envied says she watching me with those insolent gazelle eyes and a drift of her perfume reached me heady stuff these slavegirls use i reached out and drew a glossy black tress from beneath the veil and she didnt blink i stroked her cheek with it and she smiled a provocative parting of the lips besides envy is the last deadly sin id expect from flashman bahadur but you can guess the first cant you says i and gathered her smoothly in by tit and buttock not omitting a chaste salute on the lips to which the coy little creature responded by slipping her hand down between us taking hold and thrusting her tongue halfway down my throat at which point that infernal brat dalip began hacking at the door clamouring for attention to hell with him growls i thoroughly engrossed and for a moment she teased with hand and tongue before pulling her trembling softness away panting brighteyed yes i know the first she murmurs taking a last fond stroke but this is not the time aint it by god never mind the pup hell go away hell get tired it is not that she pushed her hands against my chest pouting and shaking her head my mistress would never forgive me your mistress what the blazes oh you will see she disengaged my hands with a pretty little grimace as that whining whelp kicked and yammered at the panels be patient flashman bahadur remember the servant may sup last but she sups longest her tongue flickered at my lips again and then she had slipped out closing the door to the accompaniment of shrill childish reproaches leaving me most randily frustrated but in better trim than id been for days theres nothing like a brisk overhaul of a sporty female with the certainty of a treat in store for putting one in temper and it goes to show whiskers aint everything i wasnt allowed to spend long in lustful contemplation though for who should loaf in now but the bold jassa looking fit for treason and no whit put out when i damned his eyes and demanded where hed been about the husoors business was all the answer i got while he took a wary prowl through the two rooms prodding a hanging here and tapping a panel there and remarking that these hindoo swine did themselves uncommon well then he motioned me out on to the little balcony took a glance up and down and says softly thou has seen the little raja then and his mothers pimp what the devil dye mean speak low husoor the woman mangla mai jeendans spy and partner in all mischief a slave that stands by her mistresss purdah in durbar and speaks for her aye and makes policy on her own account and is grown the richest woman in lahore think on that husoor she is jawaheers whore and betrayer like enough not a doubt but she was sent to scout thee for whatever purposes he grinned his evil pockmarked grin and cut me off before i could speak husoor we are together in this business thou and i if i am blunt take it not amiss but harken they will come at thee all ways these folk if some have sleek limbs and plump breasts why then take thy pleasure if thourt so minded says this generous ruffian but remember always what they are now i shall be here and there awhile others will come presently to woo thee not so well favoured as mangla alas well damn his impudence and thank god for him and he was right for the next hour flashys apartments were like london bridge station in canterbury week first arrival was a tall stately ancient grandee splendidly attired and straight from a persian print he came alone coldly begging my pardon for his intrusion and keeping an ear cocked damned uneasy he seemed his name was dewan dinanath familiar to me from broadfoots packets where he was listed as an influential court adviser inclined to the peace party but a weathercock his business was simple did the sirkar intend to return the soochet fortune to the court of lahore i said that would not be known until id reported to calcutta where the decision would be taken and he eyed me with bleak disapproval i have enjoyed major broadfoots confidence in the past sniffs he you may have equal confidence in me both of which were damned lies this treasure is vast and its return might be a precedent for other punjab monies at present in the ah care of the british authorities in the hands of our government these funds would have a stabilising effect theyd help jawaheer and jeendan to keep the khalsa happy he meant a word in season to me of hardinge sahibs intentions im sorry sir says i im only an advocate a young advocate snaps he should study conciliation as well as law it is to go to goolab is it or soochet singhs widow or the maharajas government unless it is retained by calcutta for the time being thats all i can tell you sir im afraid he didnt like me i could see and might well have told me so but a sound caught his ear and he was through into my bedchamber like an elderly whippet i heard the door close as my next unexpected guests arrived two other grave seniors fakir azizudeen a tough shrewdlooking heavyweight and bhai ram singh portly jovial and bespectacled staunch men of the peace party according to the packets bhai ram was the one who thought jawaheer a fool according to little dalip he opened the ball with genial compliments about my afghan service but now you come to us in another capacity as an advocate still of the army but in major broadfoots service he twinkled at me stroking his white beard well he probably knew the colour of georges drawers too i explained that id been studying law at home at the inns of court perhaps no sir firm in chancery lane i hope to read for the bar some day excellent purrs bhai ram beaming i have a little law myself ill lay you do thinks i bracing myself sure enough out came the legal straight left i have been asking myself what difficulty might arise if in this soochet business it should prove that the widow had a coparcener he smiled at me inquiringly and i looked baffled and asked how that could possibly affect matters i do not know says he blandly that is why i ask you well sir says i puzzled the answer is that it dont apply you see if the lady were soochets descendant and had a sister a female in the same degree that is then theyd take together as coparceners but shes his widow so the question doesnt arise so put that in your pipe and smoke it old cheeryble i hadnt sat up in simla with towel round my head for nothing he regarded me ruefully and sighed with a shrug to fakir azizudeen who promptly exploded so he is a lawyer then did you expect broadfoot to send a farmer as if this legacy matters we know it does not and so does he this with a gesture at me he leaned forward why are you here sahib is it to take up time with this legal folly to whet the hopes of that drunken fool jawaheer gently gently bhai ram reproved him gently on the brink of war when the five rivers are like to run red he swung angrily on me let us regarded me benevolently over his specs a needless precaution no doubt but your safety is important they would be discreet of course you may judge that this put the wind up me like a full gale if this wily old stick thought i was in danger that was enough for me i was sure he meant me no harm broadfoot had marked him a so affecting nonchalance i said id be most obliged while assuring him i felt as safe in lahore as i would in calcutta or london or wisconsin even haha he gave me a puzzled look said he would see to it and left me in a rare sweat of anxiety which was interrupted by my final visitor he was a fat and unctuous villain with oily eyes one tej singh who waddled in with a couple of flunkeys greeting me effusively as a fellowsoldier he sported an enormous jewelled sabre over a military coat crusted with bullion his insignia as a khalsa general he was full of my afghan exploits and insisted on presenting me with a superb silk robe not quite a dress of honour he explained fawning but rather more practical in the sultry heat he was such a toad i wondered if the robe was poisoned but after hed heeped his way out assuring me of his undying friendship and homage i decided he was just dropping dash where he thought it might do good a fine garment it was too i peeled down and donned it enjoying its silky coolness while i reflected on the affairs of the day broadfoot and jassa had been right i was receiving attention from all kinds of people what struck me was their impatience i wasnt even here yet officially and wouldnt be until id been presented in durbar but theyd come flocking like sparrows to crumbs most of their motives were plain enough they saw through the legacy sham and recognised me as broadfoots ear trumpet but it was reassuring that they thought me worth cultivating tej singh a khalsa bigwig especially if that damned old bhai ram hadnt shown such concern for my safety id have been cheery altogether well i had more news for broadfoot for what it was worth at this rate second thessalonians was going to take some traffic i ambled through to the bedside table picked up the bible and dropped it in surprise the note id placed in it a bare two hours earlier was gone and since id never left the room broadfoots mysterious messenger must be one of those who had called on me jassa was my first thought instantly dismissed george would have told me in his case dinanath and fakir azizudeen had each passed alone through my bedroom but they seemed most unlikely tej singh hadnt been out of sight but i couldnt swear to his flunkeys or the two little maids little dalip was impossible bhai ram hadnt been near my bedside nor had mangla worse luck could she have sneaked in unobserved while i was with dalip beyond the arch i sifted the whole thing while i ate a solitary supper hoping it was mangla and wondering if shed be back presently it was going to be a lonely night and i cursed the indian protocol that kept me in purdah so to speak until i was summoned to durbar probably next day it was dark outside now but the maids had lit the lamps and the moths were fluttering at the mosquito curtain as i settled down with crotchet castle enjoying for the hundredth time the passage where old folliott becomes agitated in the presence of barearsed statues of venus which set me thinking of mangla again and i was idly wondering which of the ninetyseven positions taught me by fetnab would suit her best when i became aware that the punkah had stopped the old bastards caulked out again thinks i and hollered without result so i rolled up seized my crop and strode forth to give him an enjoyable leathering but his mat was empty and so was the passage stretching away to the far stairs with only a couple of lamps shining faint in the gloom i called for jassa nothing but a hollow echo i stood a moment it was damned quiet not a sound anywhere and for the first time my silk robe felt chill against my skin i went inside again and listened but apart from the faint pitter of the moths at the screen no sound at all to be sure the kwabagh was a big place and id no notion where i was within it but youd have expected some noise distant voices or music i went through the screen on to the little balcony and looked over the marble balustrade it was a long drop four storeys at least to the enclosed court high enough to make my crotch contract i would just hear the faint tinkle of the fountain and make out the white pavement in the gloom but the walls enclosing the court were black not a light anywhere i found i was shivering and it wasnt the night air my skin was crawling with a sudden dread in that lonely sinister darkness and i was just about to turn hurriedly back into my room when i saw something that brought the hair bristling up on my neck far down in the court on the pale marble by the fountain there was a shadow where none had been before i stared thrilling with horror as i realised it was a man in black robes his upturned face hidden in a dark hood he was looking up at my balcony and then he stepped back into the shadows and the court was empty i was inside and streaking across the room in an instant and if you say i start at shadows ill agree with you pointing out only that behind every shadow theres substance and in this case it wasnt out for an evening stroll i yanked open the door preparing to speed down the passage in search of cheer and comfort and my foot wasnt over the threshold before i froze in my tracks at the far end of the passage beyond the last light dark figures were advancing and i caught the gleam of steel among them i skipped back slamming the door looking wildly about for a bolthole which i knew didnt exist there wasnt time to get my pepperbox theyd be at the door in a second there was nothing for it but to slip through the screen to the balcony shuddering back against the balustrade even as i heard the door flung open and men bursting in in unthinking panic i swung over the side of the balustrade close to the wall clutching its pillars from the outside cowering low with my toes scrabbling for a hold and that appalling drop beneath me while heavy footsteps and harsh voices rang out from my room it was futile of course theyd be ravening out on the balcony in a moment see me through the pillars i could hear the yell of triumph feel the agony of steel slicing through my fingers sending me hurtling to hideous death i crouched lower gibbering like an ape trying to peer under the balcony god there was a massive stone bracket supporting it only inches away i thrust a foot through it slipped and for a ghastly instant was hanging at full stretch before i got one leg crooked over the bracket made a frantic grab and found myself clinging to it like a bloody sloth upside down beneath the balcony with my fine silk robe billowing beneath me ive no head for heights did i tell you that yawning black void was dragging my mind down willing me to let go even as i clung for dear life with locked ankles and sweating fingers i must drag myself up and over the bracket somehow but even as i braced myself a voice sang out just overhead and the toe of a boot appeared between the pillars only a yard above my upturned face thank god the balcony rail was a broad projecting slab which hid me from view as he shouted down and only then did i remember blasted romeo below who must have been watching my frantic acrobatics ai nurla bey what of the feringhee cries the voice above a rasping croak in pushtu and i could hear my muscles creaking with the awful strain as i waited to be announced he came out a moment since gurdana khan came the answer jesus it sounded a mile down then he went back within he hadnt seen me pondering it later which you aint inclined to do while hanging supine under a balcony of murderers i concluded that he must have been looking elsewhere or relieving himself when i made my leap for glory and my robe being dark green he couldnt make me out in the deep shadow beneath the balcony i embraced the bracket blubbering silently while gurdana khan swore by the seven lakes of hell that i wasnt in the room so where the devil was i perchance he has the gift of invisibility calls up the wag in the court the english are great chemists gurdana damned his eyes and for no sane reason i found myself thinking that this was the kind of crisis in which broadfoot had said i might drop the magic word wisconsin into the conversation i didnt care to interrupt though just then while gurdana stamped in fury and addressed his followers find him search every nook every corner in the palace stay though he may have gone to the durbar room what into the very presence of jawaheer scoffs another his best refuge fool even thou wouldst not cut his throat in open durbar away and search nurla thou dirt back to the gate for a split second as he shouted down his sleeve came into view and even in the poor light there was no mistaking that pattern it was the tartan of the th and gurdana khan was the pathan officer id seen that afternoon dear god the palace guard were after me how i held on for those last musclecracking moments with fiery cramps searing my arms i cant fathom much less how i managed to struggle up astride of the bracket but i did and sat gasping and shaking in the freezing dark they were gone and i must steel myself to reach out and up for a hold on the balcony pillars and somehow find the strength to drag myself to safety i knew it was death to try but equally certain death to remain so i drew myself into a crouch feet on the bracket like some damned cathedral gargoyle leaned out and reached slowly up with one trembling hand too terrified to make the snatch which had to be made a hideous face shot over the balustrade glaring down at me i squealed in terror my foot slipped i clawed wildly at thin air as i began to fall and a hand like a vice clamped on my wrist almost wrenching my arm from its socket for two bowelchilling seconds i swung free wailing then another hand seized my forearm and i was dragged up and over the balustrade collapsing in a quaking heap on the balcony with jassas ugly face peering into mine im not certain what line our conversation took once id heaved up my supper because i was in that state of blind funk and shock where talk dont matter and i made it worse once id recovered the strength to crawl indoors by emptying my pint flask of brandy in about three great gulps while jassa asked damfool questions that brandy was a mistake sober id have begun to reason straight and let him talk some sense into me but i sank the lot and the short result was that in the immortal words of thomas hughes flashy became beastly drunk and when im foxed and shuddering scared into the bargain well i aint responsible the odd thing is i keep all my faculties except common sense i see and hear clearly and remember too and i know i had only one thought in mind seared there by that tartan villain who was bent on murdering me the durbar room his best refuge if theres one thing i respect drunk or sober its a professional opinion and if my hunters thought id be safe there then by god not jassa or fifty like him were going to keep me from it he must have tried to calm me for i fancy i took him by the throat to make my intentions clear but all im sure of is that i went blundering off along the passage and then along another and down a long spiral staircase that grew lighter as i descended with the sound of music coming closer and then i was in a broad carpeted gallery where various interesting orientals glanced at me curiously and i was looking out at a huge chandelier gleaming with a thousand candles and below it a broad circular floor on which two men and a woman were dancing three brilliant figures whirling to and fro there were spectators down there too in curtained booths round the walls all in extravagant costumes aha thinks i this is the spot and a fancy dress party in progress too capital ill go as a chap in a green silk robe with bare feet its a terrible thing drink flashman bahadur why have you received the parwana then i turned and there was mangla walking towards me along the gallery wearing a smile of astonishment and very little besides plainly it was fancy dress and shed come as a dancer from some select brothel she wore a long black sash low on her hips knotted so that it hung to her ankles before and behind leaving her legs bare her fine upper works were displayed in a bodice of transparent gauze her hair hung in a black tail to her waist she tinkled with bangles and there were silver castanets on her fingers a cheering sight i can tell you at any time but even more so when youve been hanging out of windows to avoid the brokers men no parwana im afraid says i here i say thats a fetching rig well now is that the durbar room down yonder why yes you wish to meet their highnessses she came closer eyeing me curiously is all well with you bahadur why you are shaking are you ill not a bit of it says i took a turn in the night air chilly eh some drunken instinct told me to keep mum about my balcony adventure at least until i met higher authority she said i needed something to warm me and a lackey serving the folk in the gallery put a beaker in my hand what with brandy and funk i was parched as a camels oxter so i drank it straight off and another dry red wine with a curious effervescent tang to it dyou know it settled me wonderfully a few more of these thinks i and they can bring the nigger in i took another swig and mangla laid a hand on my arm smiling roguishly that is your third cup bahadur have a care it is strangely potent and the night has only begun rest a moment i didnt mind with the liquor taking hold i felt safe among the lights and music with this delectable houri to hand i slipped an arm round her waist as we looked down on the dancers the guests reclining in the booths around the floor were clapping to the music and throwing silver others were drinking and eating and dallying it looked a thoroughly jolly party with most of the women as briefly attired as mangla one black charmer naked to the waist was supporting a shouting reveller as he weaved his way across the floor there was excited laughter and shrill voices and one or two of the booths had their curtains discreetly closed and not a pathan in sight their highnesses are merry says mangla one of them at least a mans voice was shouting angrily below but the music and celebration continued uninterrupted never fear you will find a welcome come and join our entertainment capital thinks i well entertain each other in one of those curtained nooks so i let her lead me down a curved stair giving on to an open space at one side of the floor where there were buffets piled high with delicacies and drink the angry mans voice greeted us as we descended and then he was in view beside the tables a tall wellmade fellow handsome in the pretty indian way with a curly beard and moustache a huge jewelled turban on his head and only baggy silk pantaloons on the rest of him he was staggering tight with a goblet in one hand and the other round the neck of the black beauty whod been helping him across the floor before him stood dinanath and azizudeen grim and furious as he railed at them stuttering drunkenly tell em to go to the devil do they think the wazir is some mujbee wholl run to their bidding let em come to me aye and humbly khalsa scum sons of pigs and owls do they think they rule here they know it snaps azizudeen persist in this folly and theyll prove it treason bawls the other and flung the goblet at him it missed by yards and hed have tumbled over if the black wench hadnt caught him he clung tipsily to her flecks of spittle on his beard crying that he was the wazir they wouldnt dare and whats to stop them demands azizudeen your palace guard whom the khalsa have promised to blow from guns if you escape try it my prince and youll find your guards have become your jailers liar yammers the other and then from raging and cursing he burst into tears bleating about how well hed paid them half a lakh to a single general and theyd stand by him while the british ate the khalsa alive oh aye the british are marching on us even now cries he dont the fools know that they know you say so but that it is not true puts in dinanath sternly my prince this is foolish you know you must go out to the khalsa tomorrow to answer for peshoras death if you speak them fair all may be well he stepped closer speaking low and earnest while the fellow mowed and wept and then damme if he didnt lose interest and start nuzzling and fondling his black popsy first things first seemed to be his motto and he pawed with such ardour that they tumbled down and sprawled in a drunken embrace at the stair foot while dinanath and azizudeen stood speechless the drunkard raised his face from between her boobies once blubbering at dinanath that he darent go out to the khalsa theyd do him a mischief and then went back to the matter in hand trying to climb on top of her with his great turban all awry mangla and i were standing only a few steps above them and i was thinking well you dont often see this at windsor the astonishing thing was that no one else in the durbar room was paying the least heed while the drunkard alternately mauled his wench and whimpered and snarled at the two counsellors the dance was reaching its climax the band piping away in fine style the spectators applauding i glanced at mangla and she shrugged raja jawaheer singh wazir says she indicating the turbaned sportsman do you wish to be presented now he was struggling to his feet again calling for drink and the black girl held the cup while he gulped and slobbered azizudeen turned on his heel in disgust and dinanath followed him towards one of the booths jawaheer pushed the cup away staggered and clutched at a table for support calling for them to come back and that was when his eye fell on us he goggled stupidly and started forward mangla cries he mangla you bitch whos that it is the english envoy flashman sahib says she coolly he gaped at me blinking and then a crafty look came into his eyes and he loosed a great shout of laughter yelling that hed been right the british had come as hed said they would see dinanath look azizudeen the british are here he swung round stumbling weaving towards them in a sort of crazy dance crowing with highpitched laughter a liar am i see their spy is here dinanath and azizudeen had turned in the entrance of one of the booths and as jawaheer capered and fell down and mangla brought me to the foot of the staircase i saw dinanath white with fury shame and loss of face before a foreigner you see the dancing and music had stopped folk were craning to look and flunkeys were running to help jawaheer but he lashed out at them staggering round to point unsteadily at me british spy filth your company bandits will come to plunder us will they brigands wilayati vermin he glared from me to dinanath aiee the british will come they will have cause to come shrieks he pointing at me and then theyd hustled him off still yelling and laughing mangla clapped her hands the music began again and folk turned away whispering behind their hands just as they do at home when uncle percys had one of his bad turns during evensong i dare say i should have been embarrassed but with a couple of quarts of mixed brandy and puggle inside me i didnt mind one little bit jawaheer was plainly all that rumour said of him but i had deeper concerns i was suddenly thirsty again and beginning to feel so monstrous randy that if lady sale had happened by shed have had to look damned lively rheumatics and all doubtless the curious liquor mangla had plied me with was responsible for both conditions very well she could take the consequences there she was the luscious little teaser by the booth where azizudeen and dinanath had been a moment since i lurched towards her gloating but even as i hove to beside her a woman spoke from beyond the open curtains is this your englishman let me look at him i turned in surprise not only at the words but at the slurred appraising arrogance of the tone mangla stepped back and with a little gesture of presentation said flashman sahib kunwari and that title told me i was in the presence of the notorious maharani jeendan indian venus modern messalina and uncrowned queen of the punjab here and there in my memoirs ive remarked on the attraction of the female sex and how its seldom a matter of beauty alone there are breathtakers like elspeth and lola and yehonala whom you cant wait to chivvy into the shrubbery equally classic creatures who are as exciting as cold soup but appeal to the baser aesthetic senses and plain janes who could start a riot in a monastery in each case aphrodite or the governess the magic is different you see there is always some unique charm or singular attraction and it can be hard to define in mai jeendan though it stood out a mile she was simply the lewdestlooking strumpet i ever saw in my life mind you when a young woman with the proportions of an erotic indian statue is found reclining halfnaked and three parts drunk while a stalwart wrestler rubs her down with oil its easy to leap to conclusions but you could have covered this one with sackcloth in the front row of the church choir and theyd still have ridden her out of town on a rail youve heard of voluptuaries whose vices are stamped on their faces mine for example but im over eighty she was in her twenties and lust was in every line of her face the once perfect beauty turned fleshy the lovely curves of lip and nostril thickened by booze and pleasure into the painted mask of a depraved angel gad she was attractive she looked like those sensual pictures of jezebel and delilah which religious artists paint with such loving enthusiasm arnold could have got enough sermons out of her to last the half her eyes were large and wanton and slightly protruding with a vacant sated expression which may have been due to drink or the recent attentions of the wrestler a bit shaky he looked to me but as i made my bow they widened in what was either drunken interest or yearning lechery the same thing really with her considering the size of her endowments she was quite small light coffee in colour and fineboned under her smooth fat a tung bibi as they say a tight lady like mangla she was decked out as a dancer with a crimson silk loincloth and flimsy bodice but instead of bangles her legs and arms were sheathed in gauze sewn with tiny gems and her dark red hair was contained in a jewelled net to see her then youd never have guessed that when she wasnt guzzling drink and men mai jeendan was another woman altogether broadfoot was wrong in thinking debauchery had dulled her wits she was shrewd and resolute and ruthless when the need arose she was also an accomplished actress and mimic talents developed when shed been the leading jester in old runjeets obscene private entertainments just now though she was too languid with drink to do more than struggle up on one elbow pushing her masseur away to view me better slowly up and down it reminded me of being on the slaveblock in madagascar when no one bought me rot them this time so far as one could judge from the ladys tipsy muttering as she lolled back on her cushions fluttering a plump hand at me the market was more buoyant you were right mangla hes big she gave a drunken chuckle adding an indelicate remark which i wont translate well must make him comfortable have him take off his robe come sit down here beside me you get out this to the wrestler who salaamed himself off in haste you too mangla draw the curtains want to talk with big englishman and not about the soochet legacy from the way she patted the cushions and smiled at me over the rim of her glass well id heard she was game but this was informality with a vengeance i was all for it mind you even if s he was as drunk as taffys sow and spilling most of the drink down her front if any ass tells you that theres nothing so disgusting as a beauty in her cups i can only say she looks a sight more interesting than a sober schoolmarm i was wondering if i should offer to help her out of her wet things when mangla got in before me calling for a cloth so i hung back politelike and found myself being addressed most affably by a tall young grandee with a flashing smile who made me a pretty little speech welcoming me to the court of lahore and trusting that i would have a pleasant stay his name was lal singh and i still give him top marks for style after all he was jeendans principal lover and here was his mistress cussing like sowerberry hagan and having her dйshabille mopped in the presence of a stranger whom shed been about to drag into the woodshed it didnt unsettle him a bit as he congratulated me on my afghan exploits and drew me into conversation with tej singh my fat little warrior of the afternoon who bobbed up grinning at his elbow to tell me how well i suited the robe hed given me by this time i was beginning to feel a trifle confused myself having in short order survived an assassination plot what a long time ago it seemed been filled with strong waters and aphrodisiac trotted up and down by a halfnaked slave girl verbally assailed in public by the wazir of the punjab and indecently ogled by his drunken fleshtrap of a sister now i was discussing more or less coherently the merits of the latest congreve rockets with two knowledgeable military men while a yard away the queen regent was being dried off by her attendants and protesting tipsily and at my back a vigorous ballet was being danced by a score of young chaps in turbans and baggy trousers with the orchestra going full steam i was new to lahore of course and not au fait with their easygoing ways i didnt know for example that recently when lal singh and jawaheer had quarrelled publicly the maharani had composed things by presenting each of them with a naked houri and telling them to restore their tempers by doing honour to her gifts then and there which by all accounts they had done i mention that in case you think my own account is at all exaggerated we must have a longer talk presently says lal singh taking me by the arm you see the deplorable condition of affairs here it cannot continue as i am sure hardinge sahib is aware he and i have had some correspondence through your esteemed chief major broadfoot he flashed me another of his smiles all beard and teeth they are both very practical and expert men tell me you have their confidence what price do you suppose they would consider fair for the punjab well i was drunk and he knew it which was why he asked the impossible treasonable question in the hope that my reaction would tell him something even fuddled i knew that lal singh was a clever probably desperate man and that the best answer to the unanswerable is to put a question of your own so i said why does someone want to sell it at which he gave me a long smile while little tej held his breath then lal singh clapped me on the shoulder we shall have our long talk by day says he the night is for pleasure would you care for some opium no kashmiri opium is the finest obtainable like kashmiri women i would offer you one or even two of them but i fear my lady jeendans displeasure you have aroused some expectation in that quarter mr flashman as im sure you noticed his smile was as easy and open as though he were telling me shed be bidding me to tea presently may i suggest a fortifying draught he beckoned a matey and i was presented with another beaker of manglas finest old inspirator which i sipped with caution i see you treat it with greater respect than does that impossible sot our wazir look yonder bahadur and have pity on us for now jawaheer was to the fore again reeling noisily in front of jeendans booth with his black tart trying vainly to hold him upright he was delivering a great tirade against dinanath and jeendan must have sobered somewhat under manglas ministrations for she told him pretty plain with barely a hiccough to pull himself together and drink no more be a man says she and indicated his wench with her practise for acting like a man among men go on take her to bed make yourself brave and tomorrow cries he flopping down on his knees before her he was having another of his blubbering fits wailing and rocking to and fro tomorrow says she with drunken deliberation youll go out to khalsa i cannot squeals he theyll tear me to pieces youll go little brother and speak to them make your peace with em all will be right youll come with me he pleaded you and the child be assured well all come lal and tej mangla here her sleepy gaze travelled to me big englishman too hell tell the malki lat and jangi lat how the troops acclaimed their wazir cheered him she flourished her cup spilling liquor again so theyll know a man rules in lahore he stared about vacantly and his face was that of a frightened ape all streaked with tears i doubt if he saw me for he leaned closer to her whispering hoarsely and then well march on the british take them unawares as god wills smiles she and looked at me again and for an instant she didnt seem drunk at all she stroked his face speaking gently as to a fractious infant but first the khalsa you must take them gifts promises of pay but but how can i pay where can i there is treasure in delhi remember says she and glanced at me a third time promise them that perhaps if i gave them this he fumbled in his belt and brought out a little case on a chain i shall wear it tomorrow why not but i must wear it tonight she snatched it from him laughing and held it beyond his reach nay nay wait it is for the dance would you like that little brotherwhowisheshewerentabrother mmh she slipped her free hand round his neck kissing him on the lips tomorrow is tomorrow this is tonight so well take our pleasure eh she nodded to mangla who clapped her hands the music died away the dancers skipped off the floor and there was a general withdrawal by the guests jawaheer flopped down beside jeendan on the cushions leaning his head against her so government is conducted lal singh spoke in my ear would hardinge sahib approve think you until tomorrow then flashman sahib tej singh gave another of his greasy chuckles and nudged me remember the saying below the sutlej there are brothers and sisters beyond it only rivals he went off with lal singh i didnt know what the devil he meant nor in my growing inebriation did i care all these gassing intruders were keeping me from the company of that splendid painted trollop who was now wasting her talents in soothing her whining oaf of a brother yonder cradling him against that superb bosom and pouring drink into him and herself i was itching to be at her and even when mangla came to lead me to the neighbouring booth i wasnt distracted i guess my tastes are coarse and id developed a craving for the mistress that wasnt to be satisfied by the maid who kept the curtains open anyway and had a matey standing by to keep me liquored through the entertainment which now began as i said most of the courtiers seemed to have gone leaving the maharani and her chosen intimates to riot with the performers the first of these was a troupe of kashmiri girls spanking little creatures in scanty silver armour with bows and toy swords who cavorted in a parody of military drill which would have scandalised the general staff and terrified their horses this was something from runjeets day mangla told me the girls were his female bodyguard with whom the old lecher had been wont to battle through the night then there was a serious interlude by indian wrestlers who are the best on earth outside cumberland muscular young bucks who fought like greased lightning all science and sinew none of your crude turkish grunting or the unspeakable japanese vulgarity jeendan i noticed roused from her lethargy during these bouts rising unsteadily to her feet to applaud the falls and summoning the victors to drink from her cup while she stroked and petted them meanwhile their place was taken by female wrestlers strapping wenches who fought naked with the male wrestlers and kashmiri girls kneeling round the floor egging them on and then wrestling with each other to the inevitable conclusion while the band played appropriate music they were all over the floor in no time seriously impeding a troupe of dancing girls and boys who had come on to frolic in a measure which proved to be a considerable advance on the polka now you may not credit this but im not much of a hand at orgies i aint what youd all a prude but i do hold that an englishmans brothel is his castle where he should behave according as many flashtails as he likes but none of these troop fornications that the orientals indulge in its not the indecency i mind but the company of a lot of boozy brutes hallooing and kicking up the deuce of a row when i want to concentrate and give of my best a regular bacchanalia is something to see right enough but im with the discriminating frog who said that one is interesting but only a cad would make a habit of it still evil associations corrupt good manners especially when youre horny as turveys bull and full of lovepuggle manglall have to do thinks i if i aint too foxed to carry her out of this bedlam and i was just looking about for her when there was a great drunken cheer from the floor and jeendan came swaying out of her booth helped by a couple of her dancingboys she pushed them away took a couple of shaky steps and began to writhe like a turkish wedding dancer flaunting her hips and rotating her plump little bottom flirting the tails of her crimson loincloth giving little squeals of laughter as she turned stamping then clapping her hands above her head while the others took up the rhythm and the tomtoms throbbed and the cymbals clashed that was my first glimpse of kohinoor gleaming in her navel like a live thing as she fluttered her belly in and out but it didnt hold my attention long for as she danced she screamed over her shoulder and one of the dancingboys leaped in behind her sliding his hands up her body unclasping her bodice and letting it fall fondling her as she danced back into him and slowly turned herself until they were face to face they writhed against each other while the onlookers shrieked with delight and the music beat ever faster and then he retreated from her slowly sweat pouring down his body and burn me if the stone wasnt in his navel now how the devil they did it i cant think swedish exercises perhaps the boy yelled and pirouetted in triumph and jeendan staggered into the arms of one of the wrestlers giggling while he pawed and kissed her one of the kashmiri bints flung herself at the boy clasping him round the waist and wriggling against him damned if i could see any better this time but she came away with the stone in turn undulating to let the onlookers see it and then subsiding under another youth the pair of them heaving to wake the dead but either he was less expert or something else caught their interest for the diamond slipped out from between them and rolled across the floor to catcalls and groans of disappointment i was watching all this through a haze of booze and disbelief taking another refreshing swig and thinking wait till i get back to belgravia and teach em the new dance step and when i looked again there was jeendan struggling and laughing wildly in the arms of another dancingboy and the great stone was back on her belly again hollo thinks i someones been handling in the scrimmage she seized the boys winecup drained it and tossed it over her shoulder and then began to dance towards me the tawny hourglass body agleam as though it had been oiled her limbs shimmering in their sheaths of gems now she was slapping her bare flanks to the tomtom beat drawing her fingers tantalisingly up her jewelled thighs and across her body lifting the fat round breasts and laughing at me out of that painted harlots face will you have it englishman or shall i keep it for lal or jawaheer come take it gora sahib my english bahadur you maynt credit it but i was recalling a line by some poet or other elizabethan i think who must have witnessed a similar performance for he wrote of her brave vibrations each way free couldnt have put it better myself thinks i as i made a heroic lurch for her and fell on all fours but the sweet thoughtful girl sank down before me arms raised from her sides making her muscles quiver from her fingertips up her arms and beyond shuddering her bounties at me and i seized them with a cry of thanksgiving she squealed either in delight or to signify foul whipped her loincloth off and round my neck and drew my face towards her open mouth take it englishman she gasps and then she had my robe open thrusting her belly against mine and kissing me as though i were beefsteak and shed been fasting for a week and i dont know who the considerate chap was who drew the curtains to but suddenly we were alone and somehow i was on my feet with her clinging to me her legs clasped round my hips moaning as i settled her in place and began the slow march up and down keeping time to the tomtoms and i fear i broke the rules for i removed the jewel manually before it did me a mischief i doubt if she noticed didnt mention it anyway well i cant think when ive enjoyed a dance so much unless it was when we set to partners again an hour or so later i imagine i seem to remember we drank considerable in between and prosed in an incoherent way most of it escapes me but i recall distinctly that she said she purposed to send little dalip to an english public school when he was older and i said capital look what it had done for me but the devil with going up to oxford just a nest of bookworms and bestial and how the deuce did she do that navel exercise with the diamond so she tried to teach me giggling through incredible contortions which culminated in her plunging and squirming astride of me as though i were running reins with only a furlong to go and in the middle of it she screamed a summons and two of her kashmiri girls popped in and urged her on by whipping her with canes intrusive i thought but it was her home ground after all she went to sleep directly wed passed the post sprawled on top of me and the kashmiris left off lashing her and snickered to each other i sent them packing and having heaved her off was composing myself to slumber likewise when i heard them chattering beyond the curtain and presently they peeped in again giggling their mistress would wake presently they said and it was their duty to see that i was clean bright slightly oiled and ready for service walker says i but they insisted respectfully covering her with a shawl before renewing their pestering of me telling me i must be bathed and combed and perfumed and made presentable or thered be the devil to pay i saw id get no peace so i lumbered up cursing and warning them that their mistress would be out of luck for i was ruined beyond redemption wait until we have bathed you giggles one of the houris you will make her scream for mercy i doubted that but told them to lead on and they conducted me one holding me up on either side for i was still well foxed beyond the curtains the durbar room was empty now and the great chandelier was out with only a few candles on the walls making little pools of light in the gloom they led me under the staircase along a dimlit passage and down a short flight of stairs to a great stone and marble chamber like a turkish bathhouse it was in deep shadow about its walls and high ceiling but in the centre surrounded by tall slender pillars was a tiled area with a sunken bath in which water was steaming there was a brazier close by and towels piled to hand while all about stood flagons of oils and soaps and shampoos altogether it was as luxurious a wallow as you could wish i asked if this was where the maharani bathed not this maharani says one this was the bath of the lady chaund cour peace be upon her it is altogether finer than our mistresss says the other sidling up to me and is reserved for those whom she delights to honour she took a playful tease at me and her companion drew off my robe squeaking with admiration bahadur indeed oh fortunate mai jeendan shell be fortunate to get any good out of me after a bath with you two thinks i admiring them boozily as they laid by their little bows and arrows and toy swords and stripped off their silver skirts and breastplates lovely little nymphs they were and there was much playing and giggling as we stepped down into the bath it was about three feet deep by seven square halffilled with warm scented water into which i subsided drowsily letting it lap over my exhausted frame while one of the kashmiris cradled my head and gently sponged my face and hair and the other went to work on my feet and then on to my ankles and calves youre on the right lines thinks i and closed my eyes reflecting on what a delightful time of it haroun alraschid must have had and wondering if hed ever become bored and yearned for the life of a jolly waggoner or productive farm labour in the open air you wouldnt catch flashy prowling the streets of baghdad in disguise looking for adventure not while there was soap and water at home the lower wench was soaping my knees now and i opened my eyes contemplating the ceiling far above all coloured persian designs with a picture in the centre of a cove with a stiff neck sitting under an awning and lording it over a platoon of bearded wallahs crouched in supplication thats your sort thinks i whoever you are some sikh nabob and that reminded me of the names id memorised so painfully from broadfoots packets heera singh and dehan singh and soochet singh and buggerlugs singh and chaund cour and chaund cour where had i heard that name recently why only a few moments since from the houris this was her bathroom and suddenly a tiny maggot that had been wandering aimlessly through my mind snapped to attention even as i heard swirling of water and realised that the girl had stopped soaping my knees and was swinging herself nimbly out of the bath chaund cours bath chaund cour whod been smashed to pieces while bathing if the wench washing my hair had moved less sharply id have been a goner but when her mate jumped out she dropped my head like a hot brick and i went under and came out spluttering to see her in the act of heaving herself out on the tiles and from the tail of my eye i saw the huge coloured picture in the ceiling overhead start to quiver with a dreadful scraping sound for an instant i was frozen sprawled in the water and it can only have been instinct that galvanised my flaccid muscles so that i thrust myself out of the water turning and clutching for the edge of the bath my hand closing on the girls ankle that hold saved me from toppling back and gave me a purchase to hurl myself out on to the tiles while she was catapulted back into the water her scream of terror lost in a deafening grinding thunder like an avalanche followed by an almighty crash that seemed to shake the whole building and made the tiles start from their settings beneath my face i rolled away with a yell of terror sprawling on the wet tiles and staring back in disbelief where the bath had been there was a flat expanse of rough stone filling the cavity like a huge plug flush with the surrounding tiles from that monstrous square of rock great rusty chains snaked up clanking to and fro into a gaping hole in the patterned ceiling foam was gushing up in a curtain from the narrow fissures between the fallen slab and the sides of the bath washing over me in a wave and even as i stared in horror it continued to ooze out pink at first and then a hideous crimson beyond the bath the second kashmiri was cowering against a pillar her mouth wide in scream after scream she turned and ran water flying from her bare body and then stopped dead her shrieks changing to a terrified wail three men were standing just clear of the shadows on that side drawn scimitars in their hands they wore only loose grey pyjamy trousers and great wide hoods so deep that their faces were invisible the girl shrank away from them blubbering and covering her face she slipped and fell on the wet tiles and tried to scramble away while they stood like grey statues and then one stepped forward lightly hefting his sword she bounded to her feet screeching as she turned to run but before shed gone a step his point was through her back it came out like a ghastly silver needle between her breasts and she pitched forward lifeless on the stone block then they were flitting towards me in dead silence expert assassins of whom two skirted wide to take me in flank while the third came straight for me his bloodsmeared blade out before him i turned to run slipped and came down headlong cowardice has its uses id be long dead without it for its driven me to try in blind panic ploys which no thinking man would even attempt a brave man would have scrambled up to run or fling himself at the nearest enemy barehanded only flashy landing arse over tip on one of the little piles of gear discarded by the kashmiri girls would have grabbed at her pathetic tinsel bow snatched a dart from its quiver fumbled it gibbering on to the string and let fly at the leading thug as he came leaping over the girls corpse at me swinging up his scimitar it was only a fragile toy but it was tightstrung and that small shaft must have been sharp as a chisel for it sank to the flights in his midriff and he twisted howling in midair his scimitar clashing on the tiles before me i grabbed it knowing i was done for with one of the flank men driving at me but i managed to turn his thrust and hurl myself sideways expecting to feel his mates point searing into my back there was a yell and clash of steel behind me as i landed on my shoulder and rolled over and up slashing blindly and bawling like an idiot for help wasted breath for it had arrived the other flank man was desperately trying to parry the sweep of a khyber knife in the hand of a tall robed newcomer which with a scimitar is rather like opposing a peashooter to a rifle one slash and the scimitar blade was a shattered stump another and the thug was down with a cloven skull and the man whose thrust id parried leaped back and was off like a hare dodging for the shadows the robed apparition turned from his victim without undue haste took one long stride and brought over his swordarm like a fast bowler letting the khyber knife go it turned once in the air and drove into the fugitives back he hurtled against a pillar clinging to it with that dreadful cleaver imbedded in his body and slid slowly to the floor twenty seconds earlier id been having my knees washed the robed man strode past me recovered his knife and cursed as blood splashed his coat and only then did i realise it was a crimson garment in the tartan of the th he stalked back hunkering down to wash his blade in the water lapping over the tiles and surveyed the shambles where the bath had been the great rock that filled it and the dangling chains well ill be a son of a bitch says he so thats how they did for old lady chaund cour no wonder we never saw the body guess she didnt look like much with that on top of her he stood up and barked at me well sir you aim to stand around bollocknaked and take your death of cold or would you prefer to make tracks before the coroner gets here the words were english the accent was pure american since ive seen a welshman in a top hat leading a zulu impi and have myself ridden in an apache war party in paint and breechclout i dare say i shouldnt have been surprised to find that gurdana khan the complete khyberie hillman could talk the lingo of brother jonathan there were some damned odd fellows about in the earlies i can tell you but the circumstances were unusual youll allow and i probably gaped for several seconds before scrambling into my robe then reaction seized me and i vomited while he stood glowering like a nonconformist at the three hooded bodies and the naked white corpse of the poor little kashmiri slut with the bloody water lapping round her i say poor slut shed done her damnedest to have me squashed flatter than a fluke the man id shot was writhing about wailing in agony let him linger growls gurdana khan mistreatment of women is something i cannot endure come away he strode off to a staircase hidden in the shadows on the other side of the bathhouse ushering me impatiently ahead of him we ascended and he chivvied me along miles of turning passages ignoring my incoherent questions then across a lofty hall through a guardroom where blackrobed irregulars lounged and at last into a spacious comfortable room for all the world like a bachelors den at home with prints and trophies on the walls book cases and fine leather easy chairs i was shivering with chill and shock and bewilderment he sat me down threw a shawl over my legs and poured out two stiff pegs malt whisky if you please he laid by his khyber knife and pulled off his puggaree he was a pathan though with that closecropped skull hawk face and grizzled beard for all he grunted slainte as he lifted his tumbler first clamping his neck in that strange iron collar id seen in the afternoon dear god was it only twelve hours ago having drunk he stood scowling down at me like a headmaster at an erring fag now see here mr flashman where the devil were you this evening we combed the palace even looked under your bed godammit well sir i made no sense of this all i knew was that someone was trying to murder me but plainly it wasnt this crossgrained fellow so id risked horrible death hanging out of windows while he and his gang had been looking for me to protect me by the sound of it i removed the glass from my chattering teeth i i was out but who on earth are you alexander campbell gardner snaps he formerly artillery instructor to the khalsa presently guard commander to the maharaja and recently at your service and think yourself lucky but youre an american that i am he fixed me with an eye like a gimlet from the territory of wisconsin i must have been a picture of idiocy for he clapped that iron object to his neck again gulped whisky and rasped well sir you passed that word as broadfoot instructed you should in an emergency when you ask dammit to the little maharaja and again to old ram singh it reached me no matter how and i came directly to help you and not a hair of you in sight next i hear youre with the maharani playing the devil and jenny golightly was that intelligent conduct sir when you knew jawaheer singh was out to cut your throat he emptied his glass clashed his iron clamp on the table and glared how the dooce did you know he was after you anyway this tirade had me all adrift i didnt know any such thing mr gardner im at a loss colonel gardner then why the blue blazes did you sound the alarm hollering wisconsin to everyone you met concern it did i i may have said it inadvertently inadvertently upon my soul mr flashman but i dont understand its all mad why should jawaheer want to kill me he dont even know me barely met the fellow and he was tight as dicks hatband an appalling thought struck me why they werent his people they were the maharanis her slavegirls they lured me to that bloody bathroom they knew what was to happen she must have ordered them how dare you sir so help me its what he said with his whiskers crackling to suggest that she would what after the the kindness she had shown you a fine thing that would be i tell you those kashmiris were bribed and coerced by jawaheer and by jawaheer alone those were his villains down there sent to silence the girls once youd been disposed of dyou think i dont know em the maharani indeed he was in a fine indignation right enough im not saying he went on that shes the sort of young woman id take home to meet mother but you mind this sir he rounded on me with all her weaknesses of which youve taken full advantage mai jeendan is a charming and gracious lady and the best hope this godabandoned territory has seen since runjeet singh youll remember that by thunder if you and i are to remain friends i wasnt alone in my enthusiasm for the lady it seemed although i guessed his was of a more spiritual variety but i was as much in the dark as ever very well you say it was jawaheer why the devil should he want to murder me because he wants a war with the british thats why and the surest way to start one is to have a british emissary kiboshed right here in lahore why man gough would be over the sutlej with fifty thousand bayonets before you could say jack robinson john company and the khalsa would be at grips thats what jawaheer wants dont you see i didnt and said so if he wants a war why doesnt he just order the khalsa to march on india theyre spoiling for a fight with us aint they sure they are but not with jawaheer leading them theyve never had any use for him so the only way he can get em to fight is if the british strike first but dammit you wont oblige him however much he provokes you along the border and jawaheer has gotten desperate hes bankrupt the khalsa hates and distrusts him and is ready to skin him alive for peshoras death they hold him prisoner in his own palace his balls are in the mangle he took a deep breath dont you know anything mr flashman jawaheer needs a war now to keep the khalsa occupied and save his own skin thats why he tried to put you out with the bath water tonight confound it dont you see well put that way it made sense everyone seemed to want a bloody war except hardinge and yours truly but i could see why jawaheers need was more urgent than most id heard the khalsas opinion of him that afternoon and seen the almighty funk he was in thats what hed meant by god when hed pointed at me and yelled that the british would have cause to come the evil vicious bastard hed been lying in wait for my arrival and suddenly a dreadful incredible suspicion rushed in on me my god did broadfoot know that jawaheer would try to kill me did he send me here to he gave a barking laugh say you have a high opinion of your betters dont you first mai jeendan now major broadfoot no sir that is not his style why if he had foreseen such a thing he broke off frowning then shook his head no jawaheer hatched his plot in the last few hours i reckon your arrival must have seemed to him a heavensent opportunity hed have taken it too if i hadnt been on your tail from the moment you arrived in the durbar room he blew out his cheeks in disbelief i still cant get over that damned bath you wont linger among the soapsuds again i reckon that was enough to bring me to my feet reaching for his decanter without even a byyourleave god what a tarantulas nest broadfoot had plunged me into i still couldnt put it straight in my mind numb with the whirlwind of the last few hours had i fallen asleep over crotchet castle and dreamed it all my balcony acrobatics mangla and jawaheer and the dazzling spectacle of the durbar room the drunken ecstatic coupling with jeendan the horror of the descending stone the furious bloody scramble in which five lives were snuffed out in a bare minute this incredible tartan nemesis with his khyber knife and yankee twang eyeing me bleakly as i punished his malt belatedly i mumbled my thanks adding that broadfoot was lucky to have such an agent in lahore he snapped my head off im not his confounded agent im his friend and so far as my duty to the maharaja allows im sympathetic to british interest broadfoot knows ill help which is why he gave you my watchword he restrained himself with difficulty inadvertently by jiminy but thats all mr flashman you and i will now go our separate ways you wont address or even recognise me henceforth except as gurdana khan henceforth but ill be going back man alive i cant stay here now with jawaheer the devil you cant its your duty isnt it just because the war isnt going to start tomorrow doesnt mean it wont happen eventually oh it will and thats for years and even he wouldnt have the hard neck youre sure hes a broadfoot man and no beard eh well well see jemadar find the orderly tell him the husoor wants him double quick and if he asks say im out at maian mir you sit down mr flashman i suspect this may interest you after the events of the night i doubted if lahore could hold any further surprises but dyou know what followed was perhaps the most astonishing encounter between two men that ever i saw and i was at appomattox remember and saw bismarck and gully face to face with the mauleys and held the shotgun when hickok confronted wesley hardin but what took place in gardners room laid over any of them we waited in silence until the jemadar knocked and jassa slid in shifty as always the moment his eye fell on the grim tartan figure he started as though hed trod on hot coals but then he recovered and looked inquiringly to me while gardner viewed him almost in admiration not bad josiah says he you may have the guiltiest conscience east of suez but by god youve sure got the brazenest forehead to go with it id never ha known you cleanshaven his voice hardened to a bark now then whats the game speak up jildi none o your goddam business snaps jassa im a political agent in british service ask him if you dont believe me and that puts me outside your touch alick gardner so now said in pushtu id have held it a good answer reckless from what id seen of gardner but about what youd expect from a khyberie tough but it was said in english with an accent even more american than gardners own i couldnt credit my ears one bloody yankee promenading about in afghan fig was bad enough but two and the second one my own orderly courtesy of broadfoot if i sat openmouthed dyou wonder gardner exploded british political my eye why you crooked quaker you if youre working for broadfoot it must mean he doesnt know who you are and he doesnt ill bet no because youre before his time josiah you skipped out of kabul before the british arrived and wise you were sekundar burnes knew you though for the doubledealing rascal you are pollock knows you too he ran you out of burma didnt he damn me if theres a town between rangoon and basra that you havent left a shirt in so lets have it whats your lay this time i dont answer to you says jassa mr flashman if you care for this i dont you know im major broadfoots agent hold your tongue or ill have it out roars gardner outside my touch are you well see you know this man as jassa says he to me well let me perform the honours by presenting dr josiah harlan of philadelphia former packetrat impostor coiner spy traitor revolutionary and expert in every rascality he can think of and cant he think just no common blackguard mind you prince of ghor once werent you josiah and unfrocked governor of gujerat to say nothing of being a pretender to the throne of afghanistan no less you know what they call this beauty up in the high hills the man who would be king he came forward thumbs in his belt and stuck his jaw in jassas face well you have one minute to tell me what you would be in lahore doctor and dont say youre an orderly pure and simple because youve never been either jassa didnt move a muscle of his ugly pockmarked face but turned to me with a little inclination of his head leaving aside the insults part of what he says is true i was prince of ghor but colonel gardners memory is at fault he hasnt told you that lord amherst personally appointed me surgeon to his britannic majestys forces in the burmese campaign assistant surgeon stealing spirits in an artillery field hospital scoffs gardner or that i held high military command and the governorship of three districts under his late majesty raja runjeet singh who kicked you out for counterfeiting you damned scamp go ahead tell him how you were ambassador to dost mohammed and tried to start a revolution in afghanistan and sold him out more times than he could count tell him how you suborned muhammed khan to betray peshawar to the sikhs tell him how you lined your pockets on the kunduz expedition and cheated reffi bey and had the gall to plant the stars and stripes on the indian caucasus damn your impudence he paused for breath while jassa stood cool as a trout but why waste time tell him how you passed yourself off on broadfoot id enjoy hearing that myself jassa gave him an inquiring look as though to make sure he was done and addressed me mr flashman i owe you an explanation but not an apology why should i have told you what your own chief didnt broadfoot enlisted me more than a year ago how much of my history he knows i cant say and i dont care he knows his business and he trusts me or i wouldnt be here if you doubt me now write to him telling him what youve heard tonight like everyone whos mixed in diplomacy in these parts im used to having my reputation blown upon so hard that its scattered all over the bloody himalayas snarls gardner if youre so allfired trustworthy where were you tonight when jawaheer tried to kill flashman he was clever gardner knowing his man as he did the question must have been in his mind from the first but hed held it back to take jassa off guard he succeeded jassa gaped stared from gardner to me and back and gasped hoarsely what the hell dyou mean gardner told him in a few fierce sentences watching him lynxeyed and jassa was a sight to see the bounce had quite gone out of him and all he could do was rub his face and mutter jesus before turning helplessly to me i i dont know i must have been asleep sir after i pulled you on to the balcony and you went off to the durbar room well i reckoned you were there for the night he avoided my eye i i went to bed woke up an hour ago saw you hadnt returned asked around for you but no one had seen you then the jemadar came for me just now thats the truth he rubbed his face again and caught gardners eye christ you dont think no i dont growls gardner and shook his head at me whatever else you are and thats plenty youre not a murderer and if you were youd be in the tall timber this minute no josiah says he with grim satisfaction youre just a lousy bodyguard and i suggest mr flashman reports that to major broadfoot too and until he gets a reply you can cool your heels in a cell doctor the hell i can cries jassa and turns to me mr flashman i dont know what to say sir ive failed you i know that and im sorry for it if major broadfoot sees fit to recall me well so be it but its not his business sir he pointed at gardner as far as hes concerned im under british protection and entitled to immunity and with respect sir in spite of my failure tonight im still at your service you mustnt disown me sir well id had a long day and night the shock of discovering that my afghan orderly was an american medical man was quite small beer after all the rest no more of a shock than gardner himself really one thing was sure jassa or josiah was broadfoots man and he was right i couldnt disown him on gardners suspicions i said so and much to my surprise gardner didnt shout me down although he gave me a long hard stare after what ive told you about him well sir its on your own head its possible you wont rue the day but i doubt it he turned to jassa as for you josiah i dont know what brings you back to the punjab in another of your disguises i know it wasnt jawaheer or anything as simple as british political work no its some dirty little frolic of your own isnt it well you forget it doctor because if you dont immunity or not ill send you back to broadfoot by tying you over a gun and blowing you clear to simla you can count on that goodnight mr flashman the jemadar led us back to my quarters through a maze of corridors that was no more confused than my mind i was dogtired and still mortally shaken and had neither the wit nor the will to question my newlyrevealed afghanamerican orderly who kept up a muttered stream of apology and justification the whole way hed never have forgiven himself if any harm had come to me and i must write to broadfoot instanter to establish his bona fides he wouldnt rest until gardners calumnies had been disproved alick means no harm weve known each other for years but truth is you see hes jealous us both being american and all and he hasnt risen any too high while ive been prince and ambassador as he said course fate hasnt been too kind lately which is why i took any honourable employment that came god ive no words of excuse or apology sir for my lapse tonight what must you think what will broadfoot think say though id like him to understand about my losing my governorship it wasnt coining no sir i dabble in chemistry see and there was this experiment that went wrong he was still chuntering when we reached my door where i was reassured to see two stalwart constables presumably sent by bhai ram singh jassa with that ugly frontier dial and dress i could think of him by no other name swore hed be on hand too from this moment closer than a brother why hed bed down right here in the passage i closed my door head swimming with fatigue and rested a moment in blessed solitude and quiet before walking unsteadily through the arch to the bedchamber where two lights burned dimly either side of the pillow and stopped the hairs rising on my neck there was someone in the bed and a drift of perfume on the air and before i could move or cry out a woman whispered out of the gloom mai jeendan must have eaten her fill says mangla it is almost dawn i stepped closer staring she was lying naked beneath a flimsy veil of black gauze spread over her like a sheet theyve nothing to learn about erotic display in the punjab i can tell you i looked down at her swaying and it shows how fagged out i was for i asked like a damfool what are you doing here do you not remember murmurs she and i saw her teeth gleam as she smiled up from the pillow her black hair spread across it like a fan after the mistress has supped it is the maids turn oh my god says i i aint hungry are you not whispers she then i must whet your appetite and she sat up slow and languid stretching that transparent veil tight against her body pouting at me will you taste husoor for a moment i was tempted altogether used up fit only for the knackers yard i wanted sleep as i wanted salvation but as i contemplated that magnificent substance stirring beneath the gauze i thought to thine own self be true and put temptation aside right you are my dear says i got any more of that jolly drink have you she laughed softly andreached out for the cup beside the bed if youve read robinson crusoe you may recall a passage where he weighs up his plight on the desert island like a bookkeeper evil on one side good on tother dispiriting stuff mainly in which he croaks about solitude but concludes that things might be worse and god will see him through with luck optimism run mad if you ask me but then ive never been shipwrecked much and philosophy in the face of tribulation aint my line but i did use his system on waking that second day in lahore because so much had happened in such short space that i needed to set my mind straight thus i am cut off in a savage land which will be at war with my own country presently an attempt has been made to assassinate me these buggers would sooner murder people than eat their dinners broadfoot chose him and since i see no reason why he should be hostile to me i shall watch him like a hawk rations and quarters are a and mangla sober is a capital mount though she dont compare to jeendan drunk if i were a praying man the almighty would hear from me in no uncertain terms and much good it would do me being a pagan with no divine resources i shall tread uncommon wary and keep my pepperbox handy that was my accounting cast up in the drowsy hour after mangla slipped away like a lovely ghost at daybreak and it could have been worse my first task must be to make a searching examination of the bold jassa or josiah before sending off a cypher about him to broadfoot so i had him in while i shaved watching that crafty hill figurehead in my mirror and listening to the plausible yankee patter that came out of it oddly enough after the character gardner had given him i felt inclined to take him at face value you see pm a knave myself and know that we wrong uns aint always bent on mischief it seemed to me that jassa the professional soldier of fortune was quite likely just marking time in broadfoots employ as hed claimed until something better turned up the queerest fish swim into the political mill with not too many questions asked and i felt i could accept if not trust him like gardner i was sure hed had no hand in the plot against my life if hed wanted me dead he could have let me drop from the balcony instead of saving me it was comforting too to have one of my own kind alongside me and one who knew the punjab and its politics inside out though how you hoped to pass unrecognised i dont see says i if you were so high under runjeet half the country must know you surely that was six years ago behind a full set o beard an whiskers says he cleanshaven i reckoned to get by cept with alick but i planned to keep out o his way but it dont matter he added coolly there are no reward notices out for joe harlan here or anywhere else he was such a patent rascal that i took to him and even now i wont say i was wrong he had a fine political nose too and had been using it about the fort that morning jawaheer seems to be in luck the whole palace knows he tried to get you and the talk was that the maharani would have him arrested but she had him to her boudoir first thing today all smiles embraced him and drank toasts to his reconciliation to the khalsa her maids say it seems dinanath and azizudeen have made his peace for him they were out talking to the panches at dawn and jawaheers appearance this afternoon will be a formality he and the whole royal family will review the troops and youll be invited no doubt so that you can pass word to broadfoot that alls well with the lahore durbar he grinned yes sir youll have quite a packet of news for simla how dyou send out your cyphers through mangla as you said yourself doctor why should i tell you what broadfoot didnt are you really a doctor by the way no diploma says he frankly but i studied surgery back in pennsylvania yep ill bet its mangla that little puss is in everyones pocket so why not john companys a word of advice though cover her all youve a mind to but dont trust her or mai jeendan and before i could damn his impudence he took himself off to change as he put it into his mess kit that meant his best robes for our durbar appearance at noon with flashy in full fig of frock coat and gotomeeting roof making my official bow to little dalip enthroned in state youd not have recognised the lively imp of yesterday in the regal little figure all in silver nodding his aigretted turban most condescendingly when i was presented by lal singh who was second minister jawaheer was nowhere in sight but dinanath old bhai ram singh and azizudeen were present solemn as priests it was eerie knowing that they were all well aware that their wazir had tried to murder me a few hours earlier and that id rioted with their maharani in this very chamber there wasnt so much as a flicker on the handsome bearded faces damned good form the sikhs behind dalips throne hung a fine lace curtain the purdah of his mother the maharani it being the custom of quality indian ladies to seclude themselves when they aint bellydancing at orgies that is by the curtain stood mangla unveiled but most modestly dressed and formal as though wed never laid eyes on each other her duty was to relay conversation to and from her mistress behind the screen and she did it most properly welcoming me to lahore inviting blessings on my work and finally as jassa had forecast bidding me to attend his majesty when he reviewed the khalsa that afternoon you shall ride on an elephant squeaks the said majesty lapsing from kingly dignity for a moment and then stiffening before the reproving glances of his court i said gravely that id be honoured beyond measure he shot me a shy little smile and then i backed from the presence turning and resuming my tile only when i reached the rug in the doorway as form demanded to my surprise lal singh came after me taking my arm all smiles and insisting on giving me a conducted tour of the arsenal and foundry which were close by the sleeping palace since id spent half the night sporting with his lady love i found this affability disconcerting until he took me flat aback by speaking of her with alarming frankness mai jeendan had hoped to come out from purdah to greet you after the durbar confides he alas she is a little drunk from toasting her abominable brother in a vain effort to put some courage into him you can have no notion what a poltroon he is the thought of facing the khalsa quite unmans him even now when all is settled but she will certainly send for you afterwards she has important messages for the envoy of the sirkar i said i was at her majestys service and he smiled so i have heard seeing me stare he laughed aloud my dear friend you look at me as though i were a rival believe me with mai jeendan there is no such thing she is no ones mistress but her own let us fortunate fellows thank god for it now you shall give me your opinion of our punjabi muskets are they not a match for brown bess at the time i was all suspicion only later did i realise that lal singh meant every word he said and mai jeendan was the least of what he wanted to tell me that day when wed examined the small arms stocked in impressive numbers and the forges and the casting of a great whitehot ninepounder gun and the rain of lead hitting the steaming vats in the shot tower and id agreed that the khalsas armoury compared well with our own he took me by the arm as we walked most confidential you are right says he but arms are not everything on the day victory and defeat rest with the generals if ever the khalsa took the field it might well be under my leadership and tej singhs he sighed smiling and shook his head sometimes i wonder how we should acquit ourselves against oh against such a seasoned campaigner as your sir hugh gough what would you think flashman sahib wondering i said that gough wasnt the most scientific soldier since boney but he was probably the toughest lal singh nodded stroking his beard and then laughed merrily well we must hope it is never put to the test eh now we set out for maian mir in an hour may i offer you some refreshment theyre so devious these folk you never know what theyre up to was he hinting that if it came to war he was ready to fight a cross or trying a bamboozle or just gassing whatever his purpose he must know that nothing he said could make gough drop his guard it was all most interesting and gave me food for thought until the horns sounded to signal the departure of the royal progress to maian mir the procession was drawn up outside the bright gate and when i saw it i thought thats india it was arabian nights come to life two battalions of the palace guard in their red and yellow silks and in their midst half a dozen elephants gorgeously caparisoned in blue and gold saddlecloths that swept the ground jewelled harness on their heads their tusks and even the mahouts goads tipped with gold the howdahs were little coloured palaces topped with minarets and silk canopies which stirred as the great beasts swayed and bellowed the keepers quieting them as they waited for their royal freight horsemen in steel casques that shone like silver in the sunlight rode up and down the elephant line their sabres drawn they converged like clockwork to form a lane from the gate for porters who came bearing enormous panniers brimming with coin preceded by chamberlains who supervised the strapping of the panniers to the howdahs of the third and second elephants when some of the coins fell in a tinkling shower to the dust there was a great ooh from the crowd assembled to see the show two or three of the horsemen leaned from their saddles scooping up the rupees and hurling them over the heads of the rigid guardsmen to the mob who yelled and scuffled for them for a country that was supposed to be short of blunt there seemed to be no lack of pice to fling to the beggars two of the chamberlains mounted the third elephant and now came a little knot of courtiers led by lal singh all brave in green and gold they mounted into the fifth howdah and a chamberlain whod been shepherding jassa and me indicated that we should mount the ladder on the fourth beast we climbed up and as i seated myself the muted grumble of the crowd took on a new note i knew exactly why they were asking each other whos the foreigner then who takes precedence over the royal courtiers he must be an infidel of note doubtless the english queens son or a jewish moneylender from karachi well give the unbelieving swine a cheer i doffed my tile looking out over that astonishing scene ahead the great mammoths with their swaying howdahs and either side the horsemen the yellow guards and beyond a vast sea of brown faces the walls flanking the bright gate were black with spectators as were the buildings behind with the great column of the summum boorj towering over all the baying of the crowd rose again and now there was a disturbance below my elephant the yellow line of guardsmen breaking to let in a wild figure who capered and waved to me he was a burly ghazi of a fellow bandoliered and bearded to the eyebrows yelling in pushtu aiee bloody lance it is i shadman khan remember me salaam soldier heepheepheephoorah well i didnt remember him but plainly he was someone from the old days so i lifted my lid again calling salaam shadman khan and he shouted with delight and yelled in english stand fast foorteefoorth and in an instant i was looking down on the bloody snow over gandamack with the remnants of the th being cut down by the tribesmen swarming over their position and i wondered which side hed been on then now there was a sudden hush broken by the strains of sweet music and out from the bright gate came a native band followed by a tiny figure in cloth of gold mounted on a white pony a thunderous salaam rolled out from the waiting crowd maharaj maharaj as little dalip was lifted from his saddle by a richlyclad courtier whom i recognised with a shock as jawaheer singh he seemed sober enough now and ive never seen a man grin so eagerly as he perched dalip on his shoulder and gestured to the crowd inviting their acclaim they roared willingly enough but i detected an undertone of groans which i imagine were meant for jawaheer himself he mounted with dalip to the first elephant and then out from the gate stalks gardner staring grimly right and left and followed by a party of his black robes guarding a palki beside which mangla walked unveiled it stopped and she drew the curtains and handed out the maharani jeendan she was all in shimmering white and although she wore a gauzy purdah veil i believe id have recognised that hourglass figure anywhere shed got over her drunk by the looks of it for she walked steadily to the second elephant and gardner handed her up to an absolute bellow of cheering theres no doubt about it all the world loves nell gwynn mangla mounted beside her and then gardner stepped back and surveyed the procession your good bodyguard alert for trouble his eye passed over me and lingered for a moment on jassa then he had given the signal the band struck up a march the elephant lurched and bellowed beneath us and off we swayed with a great creaking of harness and jingling of outriders while the mob roared again and the dust swirled up from the tramp of the guardsmen we skirted under the high city walls thronged with folk who threw blossoms and shouted blessings on the little maharaja they were swarming like bees on the ramparts of the kashmir gate and then as we rounded the angle of the wall beneath the huge halfmoon battery there came from far ahead the report of cannon a continuous rumble of firing one gun after another the elephants squealed in alarm and the howdahs bucked from side to side so hard that we had to cling on to prevent being pitched out with the mahouts flat on their beasts heads steadying them with goad and voice as we came under the delhi gate the firing ceased to be replaced by a distant measured tread thousands of marching men and i craned out to look as the procession swung away from the city and saw an astonishing sight coming towards us all in immaculate line were four battalions of the khalsa a solid wall of infantry half a mile from wing to wing the dust rising before them in a low cloud their drummers and standard bearers to the fore i didnt know it then but they were absolutely marching on lahore to bring jawaheer out by force having lost patience after waiting for him all day you could almost read the purpose in the grim inexorable approach of that disciplined host the green jackets of sikh infantry and the blue turbans of the dogras on the left the scarlet coats and shakos of regular foot on the right our procession slowed and halfhalted but with the howdahs of jeendan and the chamberlains in front i couldnt see what was happening with jawaheer i could hear him though shouting shrilly and the armoured horsemen converged on his elephant while the yellow guardsmen tramped stolidly on our procession forged ahead towards the centre of the khalsa line and just as it seemed as though we must collide the advancing host split into two wheeling into columns which advanced down either side of us and ive never seen anything to match it for drill not even on horse guards i watched them striding by beyond our yellow guardsmen and wondered for a moment if they meant to pass us altogether but a burly rissaldarmajor came tearing out on the flank reining in midway down the procession rose in his stirrups and at the exact moment bawled in a voice you could have heard in delhi battalions aboutah there was the tremendous onetwothreefour crash as they marked time and turned and then they were marching with us a solid mass of two thousand infantry on either flank shakos and red coats to the right blue and green turbans to the left well thinks i whether jawaheer takes it for a prisoners escort or a guard of honour he cant complain that they havent received him in style i could hear him crying shabash in compliment and on the elephant ahead of us the chamberlains were on their feet scooping up rupees in little handshovels and hurling them over the yellow guardsmen at the khalsa battalions they glittered in the air like silver rain falling among the marching sikhs and not a man wavered in his step or even glanced aside the chamberlains shovelled away for dear life emptying the panniers and spraying the dust with their rupees screaming to the troops that this was the gift of their loving monarch and his wazir raja jawaheer singh god bless him but for all the heed the khalsa paid it might as well have been birddroppings and behind me i heard jassa mutter save your dollars boys they aint buying you a thing another roar from the rissaldarmajor and the escorting battalions crashed to a halt stockstill in the swirling dust our procession lumbered on wheeling left as we emerged from between those grim ranks and as our beast turned to follow the leaders there all of a sudden on our right flank was the whole khalsa drawn up in review horse foot and guns squadron upon squadron battalion upon battalion as far as the eye could see id seen it before and been impressed what i felt now was awe then it had been at exercise now it was dead still at attention eighty thousand men and not a movement except for the gentle stirring of the standards before the battalions the flutter of pennons on the lances at rest and the occasional tossing of a horses mane and its strange the tramp of our guardsmen and the groaning of the elephants harness must have been loud enough to wake the dead but all i remember now is the silence as we passed slowly before that tremendous army there was a sudden shrill voice from the second elephant and damme if jeendan and mangla werent flinging out baksheesh too as the chamberlains had done and calling out to the soldiers to accept their bounty to remember their oaths to the maharaja and to stand true to their salt for the honour of the khalsa still not a man moved and as the womens voices died away i felt a chill in spite of the heat of the westering sun and then someone shouted a command to halt and the elephants lumbered to a standstill there was a little cluster of tents ahead beside the leading beast and a group of senior officers before it akalis were moving down the line shouting to the mahouts to dismount and as our elephant sank to its knees i felt nothing but relief youre uncomfortably conspicuous in a howdah i can tell you especially with eighty thousand bearded graven images glaring blindly at you from pointblank range there was a clatter of hooves and there was gardner by the second elephant ordering servants who helped jeendan and mangla down and led them towards one of the pavilions where handmaidens were waiting to receive them pretty butterfly figures in silks and gauzes altogether out of place before that great martial host in leather and serge and steel gardner caught my eye and jerked his head and without waiting for a ladder i dropped to the ground with as much dignity as i could clutching my topper in place jassa followed and i saw that lal singh and the courtiers had also descended i walked towards gardners horse and noticed that only jawaheers elephant was still standing he was sitting in the howdah clutching little dalip to him and complaining shrilly to the akalis who were angrily ordering his mahout to make the elephant kneel another order was shouted and now the yellow guardsmen began to march away the armoured horsemen cantering ahead of them at this jawaheer was on his feet demanding to know where his escort was going shouting to his mahout not to take the elephant down he was in a great passion and as his head turned i caught the gleam of the great diamond in his turban aigrette good lord thats jeendans bellybutton thinks i how it does get about and now gardner was leaning down from his saddle and addressing me rapidly in english go and help the maharaja down go on man quickly itll please the troops make a fine impression get him flashman it all happened in split seconds there i was aware only that jawaheer was in a fine taking about the reception he was receiving that gardner was making what sounded like an excellent diplomatic suggestion kindly old john bull giving the heathen princeling a piggyback before his powers assembled and all that but even as he spoke i saw that an akali had scrambled up into the howdah and seemed to be trying to pull dalip away jawaheer screamed the akali hit him in the face jawaheer dropped the child and cowered away there was a zeep of drawn steel at my back and i started round to find half a dozen sikhs almost on top of me tulwars drawn and yelling blue murder i didnt wait to advise gardner to help the maharaja down himself i was past his horse like a stung whippet and ran slap into the elephants arse fell back with a yell of terror into the path of the charging sikhs made a dive to get under the elephants trailing saddlecloth stumbled and became entangled struggled free and something hit me an almighty blow across the shoulders driving me to my knees i clutched wildly behind me and found myself with little dalip in my arms fallen from aloft and a mob of raging madmen hurling me aside to get at the elephant there was a choking scream from overhead and there was jawaheer sprawling over the side of the howdah arms outstretched with a spear shaft buried in his chest blood spewing from his mouth and showering down on me the attackers were swarming into the howdah slashing at him suddenly his face was a bloody mask his turban slipped from his head a great length of bloodsodden silk snaking down at me gardners horse reared above me men were yelling and women shrieking i could hear the hideous sound of the tulwars cutting into jawaheers body and still he was screaming and blood was everywhere in my eyes and mouth on the gold coat of little dalip in my arms i tried to throw him away but the young blighter had me fast round the neck and wouldnt leave go someone seized me by the arm jassa a pistol in his free hand gardner urged his horse between us and the slaughter knocking jassas pistol from his grasp and shouting to him to get us away and i blundered towards the tents with that confounded infant hanging from my neck and not a sound out of him either the turban cloth had draped itself across my face and as i dragged the disgusting thing clear and sank to my knees dalip still clung to me with one hand and in the other dripping with his uncles gore was the great diamond that had fallen from jawaheers aigrette how the brat had got hold of it god knows but there it was almost filling his small hand and he stared at me with great round eyes and piped kohinoor kohinoor then he was whisked away from me and as i came to my feet i saw he was clasped in his mothers arms beside the tent bloodying her veil and white sari oh my christ groans jassa and i looked past him and saw jawaheer crimson from head to foot slide over the side of the howdah and fall headlong in the dust with his life flooding out of him and still those fiends hacked and stabbed at his corpse while some even emptied their muskets and pistols into it until the air was thick with the reek of black powder smoke it was gardner who hustled us to one of the smaller tents while his black robes surrounded jeendan dalip and the screeching women shepherding them to the main pavilion he cast a quick glance at the mob struggling about jawaheers corpse and then twitched our tent curtain shut he was breathing hard but cool as you please well how dye like that for a drumhead courtmartial mr flashman he laughed softly khalsa justice the damned fools i was atremble at the shocking sudden butchery of it you knew that was going to happen no sir says he calmly but nothing in this country surprises me by the holy youre a sight josiah get some water and clean him up youre not wounded goodnow lie low and be quiet both of you its over and done see the damned fools listen to em celebrating their own funerals now dont you budge till i come back he strode out leaving us to collect our breath and our wits and if you wonder what my thoughts were as jassa sponged the blood from my face and hands ill tell you relief and some satisfaction that jawaheer was receipted and filed and that id come away with nothing worse than a ruined frock coat not that theyd been out to get me but when you walk away from a scrimmage of that sort youre bound to put it down on crusoes good side in block capitals jassa and i shared my flask and for about half an hour we sat listening to the babble of shouting and laughter and feux de joie of the murderers celebration and the lamentations from the neighbouring tent while i digested this latest of lahores horrors and wondered what might come of it i suppose id seen the signs the previous day in the rage of the khalsa panches and jawaheers own terrors last night but this morning the talk had been that all was well aye designed no doubt to bring him out to the khalsa in false hope to a doom already fixed had his peacemakers azizudeen and dinanath known what would happen had his sister had jawaheer himself known even but been powerless to avert it and now that the khalsa had shown its teeth would it march over the sutlej would hardinge hearing of yet another bloody coup decide to intervene or would he still wait after all it was nothing new in this horrible country i didnt know then that jawaheers murder was a turningpoint to the khalsa it was just another demonstration of their own might another death sentence on a leader who displeased them they didnt realise theyd handed power to the most ruthless ruler the punjab had seen since runjeet singh she was in the next tent having hysterics so strident and prolonged that the noisy mob outside finally gave over celebrating and looting the gear from the royal procession the shouting and laughter died away and now there was the sound of her voice alone sobbing and screaming by turns and then it was no longer in her tent but outside and gardner slipped back through our curtain beckoning me to join him at the entrance i went and peered out it was full dark now but the space before the tents was lit bright as day by torches in the hands of a vast semicircle of khalsa soldiery thousands strong staring in silence at the spot where jawaheers body still lay on the bloodsoaked earth the elephants and the regiments had gone all that remained was that great ring of bearded silent faces the huddled corpse and kneeling over it wailing and beating the earth in an ecstasy of grief the small whiteclad figure of the maharani close by their hands on their hilts and their eyes on the khalsa a group of gardners black robes stood guard she flung herself across the body embracing it calling to it and then knelt upright again keening wildly and began to rock to and fro tearing at her clothing like a mad thing until she was bare to the waist her unbound hair flying from side to side before that dreadful uncontrolled passion the watchers recoiled a step some turned away or hid their faces in their hands and one or two even started towards her but were pulled back by their mates then she was on her feet facing them shaking her little fists and screaming her hatred scum vermin lice butchers coward sons of dishonoured mothers a hundred thousand of you against one you gallant champions of the punjab you wondrous heroes of the khalsa you noseless bastard offspring of owls and swine who boast of your triumphs against the afghans and the prowess youll show against the british you who would run in terror from one english camp sweeper and a kabuli whore oh you have the courage of a pack of pidogs to set on a poor soul unarmed aiee my brother my brother my jawaheer my prince from raging she was sobbing again rocking from side to side trailing her long hair across the body then stooping to cradle the horrid thing against her breast while she wailed on a tremulous high note that slowly died away they watched her some grim some impassive but most shocked and dismayed at the violence of her grief then she laid down the body picked up a fallen tulwar from beside it rose to her feet and began slowly to pace to and fro before them her head turned to watch their faces it was a sight to shiver your spine that small graceful figure her white sari in rags about her hips her bare arms and breasts painted with her brothers blood the naked sword in her hand she looked like some avenging fury from legend as she threw back her hair with a toss of her head and her glare travelled along that silent circle of faces a stirring sight if you know what i mean theres a picture i once saw that could have been drawn from her clytemnestra after agamemnons death cold steel and brazen boobies and bedamned to you suddenly she stopped by the body facing them and her voice was hard and clear and cold as ice as she passed her free hand slowly over her breasts and throat and face for every drop of this blood you will give a million you the khalsa the pure ones pure as pig dung brave as mice honoured as the panders of the bazaar fit only for i shant tell you what they were fit for but it sounded all the more obscene for being spoken without a trace of anger and they shrank from it oh there were angry scowls and clenched fists here and there but the mass of them could only stare like rabbits before a snake ive seen women royal mostly who could cow strong men ranavalona with her basilisk stare or irma with her imperious blue eye lakshmibai of jhansi could have frozen the khalsa in its tracks with a lift of her pretty chin each in her own way jeendan did it by shocking em out of their senses flaunting her body while she lashed them quietly with the language of the gutter at last one of them could take no more of it an old whitebearded sikh flung down his torch and cries no no it was no murder it was the will of god some murmured in support of him others cried him down and she waited until they were silent again the will of god is that your excuse you will blaspheme and hide behind gods will then hear mine the will of your maharani mother of your king she paused looking from one side to the other of the silent crowd you will give me the murderers so that they may pay you will give them to me or by that god with whose will you make so free i shall throw the snake in your bosom she struck the tulwar into the earth on the last word turned her back on them and walked quickly towards the tents clytemnestra as ever was with this difference that where mrs agamemnon had committed one murder she was contemplating a hundred thousand as she passed into her tent the light from within fell full on her face and here wasnt a trace of grief or anger she was smiling if there was one thing worse than jawaheers murder it was his funeral when his wives and slavegirls were roasted alive along with his corpse according to custom like much beastliness in the world suttee is inspired by religion which means theres no sense or reason to it ive yet to meet an indian who could tell me why its done even except that its a hallowed ritual like posting a sentry to mind the duke of wellingtons horse fifty years after the old fellow had kicked the bucket that at least was honest incompetence if you want my opinion of widowburning the main reason for it is that it provides the sort of show the mob revels in especially if the victims are young and personable as they were in jawaheers case i wouldnt have missed it myself for its a fascinating horror and i noticed in my years in india that the breastbeating christians who denounced it were always first at the ringside no my objection to it is on practical not moral grounds its a shameful waste of good womanhood and all the worse because the stupid bitches are all for it theyve been brought up to believe its meet and right to be broiled along with the head of the house you see why alick gardner told me of one funeral in lahore where some poor little lass of nine was excused burning as being too young and the silly chit threw herself off a high building they burned her corpse anyway thats what comes of religion and keeping women in ignorance the most educated indian female i ever knew rani lakshmibai thought suttee beneath contempt when i asked her why as a widow she hadnt hopped on the old mans pyre herself she looked at me in disbelief and asked do you think im a fool she wasnt but her punjabi sisters knew no better jawaheers body was brought in several pieces to the city on the day after his death and the procession to the ground of cremation took place under a red evening sky before an enormous throng with little dalip and jeendan and most of the nobility prostrating themselves before the suttees two wives stately handsome girls and three kashmiri slaves the prettiest wenches ever you saw all in their best finery with jewelled studs in their ears and noses and gold embroidery on their silk trousers i aint a soft man but it would have broken your heart to see those five little beauties who were made for fun and love and laughter walking to the pyre like guardsmen heads up and not a blink of fear serenely scattering money to the crowd according to custom and you wouldnt credit it those unutterable bastards of sikh soldiers who were meant to be guarding em absolutely tore the money from their hands and yelled taunts and insults at them when they tried to protest even when they got to the pyre those swine were tearing their jewels and ornaments from them and when the fire was lit one villain reached through the smoke and tore the gold fringe from one of the slaves trousers and these according to their religion were meant to be sacred women there were groans from the crowd but no one dared do anything against the allpowerful military and then an astounding thing happened one of the wives stood up among the flames and began to curse them i can see her still a tall lovely girl all in white and gold blood on her face where her nosestud had been ripped away one hand gripping her headveil beneath her chin the other raised as she damned em root and branch foretelling that the race of sikhs would be overthrown within the year their women widowed and their land conquered and laid waste and suttees you know are supposed to have the gift of prophecy one of the spoilers jumped on the pyre and swung his musket butt at her and she fell back into the fire where thefour others were sitting calmly as the flames rose and crackled about them none of them made a sound i saw all this from the wall the black smoke billowing up to mingle with the low clouds under the crimson dusk and came away in such a boiling rage as i never felt on behalf of anyone except myself aye thinks i let there be a war so that we can stamp these foul womanbutchers flat and put an end to their abominations i guess im like alick gardner i cant abide wanton cruelty to goodlooking women not by other folk anyway that brave lasss malediction filled the crowd with superstitious awe but it had an even more important effect it put the fear of god into the khalsa and that shaped their fate at a critical time for after jawaheers death they were in a great state of uncertainty and division with the hotheads clamouring for an immediate war against us and the more loyal element whod been dismayed by jeendans harangue at maian mir insisting that nothing could be done until theyd made their peace with her the regent of their lawful king the trouble was making peace meant surrendering those whod plotted the murder of jawaheer and they were a powerful clique so the debate raged among them and meanwhile jeendan played her hand to admiration refusing even to acknowledge the khalsas existence going daily to weep at jawaheers tomb heavily veiled and bowed with grief and winning the admiration of all for her piety the rumour ran that shed even sworn off drink and fornication a portent that reduced the khalsa to a state of stricken wonder by all accounts in the end they gave in and in response to their appeals for audience she summoned them not to durbar but to the yard under the summum boorj receiving them in cold silence while she sat veiled and swathed in her mourning weeds and dinanath announced her terms these sounded impressively severe total submission to her will and instant delivery of the murderers but were in fact part of an elaborate farce stagemanaged by mangla she and lal singh and a few other courtiers had been taken prisoner by the khalsa at the time of the murder but released soon after since when theyd been politicking furiously with dinanath and the panches arranging a compromise it amounted to this the khalsa grovelled to jeendan gave up a few token prisoners and promised to deliver pirthee singh and the other leading plotters as soon as they were caught in the meantime would she please forgive her loyal khalsa since they were showing willing and consider making war on the damned british in the near future for their part they swore undying loyalty to her as queen regent and mother of all sikhs to this she replied through dinanath that while it was hardly good enough she was graciously pleased to accept their submission and hand back the token prisoners as a liberal gesture they must now give her a little time to complete her mourning and recover from the grievous shock of her brothers death thereafter she would receive them in full durbar to discuss such questions as making war and appointing a new wazir it was the kind of facesaving settlement thats arranged daily at westminster and in parish councils and no ones fooled except the public and not all of them either you may ask where was flashy during all these stirring events to which the answer is that having mastered an impulse to steal a horse and ride like hell for the sutlej i was well in the background doing what id ostensibly come to lahore for namely negotiate about the soochet legacy this entailed sitting in a pleasant airy chamber for several hours a day listening to interminable submissions from venerable government officials who cited precedents from punjabi and british law the bible the koran the times and the bombay gazette they were the most tireless old bores you ever struck red herring worshippers to a man asking nothing from me beyond an occasional nod and an instruction to my babu to make a note of that point that kept em happy and was good for another hours prose none of which advanced the cause one iota but since the punjabi taxpayers were stumping up their salaries and i was content to sit under the punkah sipping brandy and soda all was for the best in the best of all possible civil services we could have been there yet my god they probably are i was busy enough in my spare time though chiefly writing cypher reports for broadfoot and committing them to second thessalonians from which they vanished with mysterious speed i still couldnt figure who the postman was but it was a most efficient service to simla and back within a week of my writing off about jassa a note turned up in my bible saying among other things number a which meant that notwithstanding his colourful past my orderly was trustworthy to the second degree which meant only a step below broadfoot and his assistants including myself i didnt tell jassa this but contrived a quick word with gardner to give him the glad tidings he grunted broadfoot must be sicker than i thought and passed on the surly brute for the rest broadfoots communication amounted to little more than carry on flash the official news from british india through the vakil was that calcutta deplored the untimely death of wazir jawaheer and trusted that his successor would have better luck that was the sense of it along with a pious hope that the punjab would now settle down to a period of tranquillity under maharaja dalip the only ruler whom the british power was prepared to recognise the message was clear murder each other as often as you please but any attempt to depose dalip and we shall be among you horse foot and guns so there it was status quo the question of the hour being would jeendan for her own and dalips safety give way before the khalsas demand for war and turn em loose over the sutlej i couldnt for the life of me see why she should in spite of her halfpromise to them she seemed to be able to deal with them as her brother had failed to do dividing and ruling and keeping them guessing if she could hold the rein on them while she tightened her grip on the government of the country i couldnt see how war would be in her interest time would tell a more pressing matter began to vex me as the first week lengthened into the second lal singh had assured me that jeendan was anxious to know me better politically and personally but devil a sign of it had there been for almost a fortnight and i was champing at the bit as the horrors of those first two days receded the pleasures became more vivid and i was plagued by fond memories of that painted little trollop writhing against me in the durbar room and strutting wantonly before her troops at maian mir quite fetching those recollections were and bred a passion which i knew from experience could be satisfied by the lady herself and no other im a faithful soul you see in my fashion and when a new bundle takes my fancy more than ordinary as about a score have done over the years i become quite devoted for a spell oh id done the polite by mangla but that was journeyman work which did nothing to quench my romantic lust to put jeendan over the jumps again and the sooner the better i cant account for these occasional infatuations but then neither can the poets uncommon randy those versifiers in my own case though i have to own that ive been particularly susceptible to crowned heads empres ses and queens and grand duchesses and so forth of whom ive encountered more than a few i dare say the trappings and luxury had something to do with it and the knowledge that the treasury would pick up any bills that were going but that aint the whole story im sure if i were a german philosopher id no doubt reflect on supermans subjection of the ultimate embodiment of the female but since i aint i can only conclude that im a galloping snob at all events theres a special satisfaction to rattling royalty i can tell you and when they have jeendans training and inclinations it only adds to the fun like most busy royal women she had the habit of mixing sport with politics and contrived our next encounter so that it dealt with both on the day of her emergence from mourning for her eagerlyawaited durbar with the khalsa panches id tiffened in my quarters and was preparing for an afternoons drowse with the soochetwallahs when mangla arrived unannounced at first i supposed shed looked in for another quarterstaff bout but she explained that i was summoned to royal audience and must follow quietly and ask no questions nothing loth i let her conduct me and had quite a letdown when she ushered me into a nursery where little dalip attended by a couple of nurses was wreaking carnage with his toy soldiers he jumped up beaming at the sight of me and then stopped short to compose himself before advancing bowing solemnly and holding out his hand i have to thank you flashman bahadur says he for your care of me that that afternoon suddenly he began to weep head lowered and then stamped and dashed his tears away angrily i have to thank you for your care of me he began gulping and looked at mangla and for the great service she prompted him and for the great service you rendered to me and my country he choked it out pretty well head up and lip trembling we are forever in your debt salaam bahadur i shook his hand and said i was happy to be of service and he nodded gravely glanced sidelong at the women and murmured i was so frightened well you didnt look it maharaj says i which was the honest truth i was frightened too not you cries he shocked you are a soldier the soldier who is never frightened is only half a soldier says i and dye know who told me that the greatest soldier in the world his names wellington youll hear about him some day he shook his head in wonder at this and deciding butter wouldnt hurt i asked if i might be shown his toys he squeaked with delight but mangla said it must be another time as i had important affairs to attend to he kicked over his castle and pouted but as i was salaaming my way out he did the strangest thing running to me and hugging me round the neck before trotting back to his nurses with a little wave of farewell mangla gave me an odd look as she closed the door behind us and asked if i had children of my own i said i hadnt i think you have now says she id supposed that was the end of the audience but now she conducted me through that labyrinth of palace passages until i was quite lost and from her haste and the stealthy way she paused at corners for a looksee i thought aha were bound for some secret nook where she means to have her wicked will of me watching her neat little bottom bobbing along in front of me i didnt mind a bit tho id rather it had been jeendan and when she ushered me into a pretty boudoir all hung in rose silk and containing a large divan i lost no time in seizing her opportunities she clung for a moment and then slipped away cautioning me to wait she drew the curtain from a small alcove pressed a spring and a panel slid noiselessly back to reveal a narrow stairway leading down sounds of distant voices came from somewhere below having had experience of their architecture i hesitated but she drew me towards it with a finger to her lips we must make no sound she breathed the maharani is holding durbar capital says i kneading her stern with both hands lets have a durbar ourselves shall we not now whispers she trying to wriggle free ah no it is by her command you are to watch and listen no please they must not hear us follow me close and make no noise well she was at a splendid disadvantage so i held her fast and played with her for a moment or two until she began to tremble and bite her lip moaning softly for me to leave off or wed be overheard and when i had her nicely on the boil and fit to dislocate herself why i let her go reminding her that we must be quiet as mice ill learn em to lure me into boudoirs on false pretences she gulped her breath back gave me a look that would have splintered glass and led the way cautiously down it was a dim steep spiral thickly carpeted against sound and as we descended the murmur of voices grew ever louder it sounded like a meeting before the chairman brings em to order at the stair foot was a small landing and in the wall ahead an aperture like a horizontal arrowslit very narrow on our side but widening to the far side of the wall so that it gave a full view of the room beyond we were looking down on the durbar room at a point directly above the purdah curtain which enclosed one end of it to the right in the body of the room before the empty throne and dais was a great jostling throng of men hundreds strong the panches of the khalsa much as id seen them that first day at maian mir soldiers of every rank and regiment from officers in brocaded coats and aigretted turbans to barefoot jawans even in our eyrie we could feel the heat and impatience of the closepacked throng as they pushed and craned and muttered to each other half a dozen of their spokesmen stood to the fore maka khan the imposing old general whod harangued them at maian mir the burly imam shah whod described peshoras death my rissaldarmajor of the heroic whiskers and a couple of tall young sikhs whom i didnt recognise maka khan was holding forth in a loud irritated way i suppose you feel a bit of an ass addressing two hundred square feet of embroidery to our left hidden from their view by the great curtain and paying no heed at all to maka khans oratory the queen regent and mother of all sikhs was making up for her recent enforced abstinence from drink and frivolity for two weeks shed been appearing in public sober griefstricken and swathed in mourning apparel now she was enjoying a leisurely toilet lounging goblet in hand against a table loaded with cosmetics and fripperies while her maids fluttered silently about her putting the finishing touches to an appearance plainly calculated to enthrall her audience when she emerged watching her drain her cup and have it refilled i wondered if shed be sober enough if she wasnt the khalsa would miss a rare treat from mourning she had gone to the other extreme and was decked out in a dancinggirls costume which in any civilised society would have led to her arrest for breach of the peace not that it was unduly scanty her red silk trousers fringed with silver lace covered her from hip to ankle and her gold weskit was modestly opaque but since both garments had evidently been designed for a wellgrown dwarf i could only wonder how shed been squeezed into them without bursting the seams for the rest she wore a head veil secured by a silver circlet above her brows and a profusion of rings and wristbangles the lovely sullen face was touched with rouge and kohl and one of her maids was painting her lips with vermilion while another held a mirror and two more were gilding her finger and toe nails they were all intent as artists at a canvas jeendan pouting critically at the mirror and directing the maid to touch up the corner of her mouth then they all stood back to admire the result before making another titivation and beyond the purdah her army coughed and shuffled and waited and maka khan ploughed on three divisions have declared for goolab singh as wazir cries he courts avitabiles and the povinda they wish the durbar to summon him from kashmir with all speed jeendan continued to study her mouth in the mirror opening and closing her lips satisfied she drank again and without looking aside gestured to her chief maid who called out what say the other divisions of the khalsa maka khan hesitated they are undecided not about goolab singh shouts the rissaldarmajor well have no rebel as wazir and the devil with courts and the povinda there was a roar of agreement and maka khan tried to make himself heard jeendan took another pull at her goblet before whispering to the chief maid who called there is no majority then for goolab singh a great bellow of no and raja goolab with the leaders trying to quiet them one of the young sikh spokesmen shouted that his division would accept whoever the maharani chose which was greeted with cheering and a few groans to the amusement of jeendan and the delight of the maids who were now holding up three long pierglasses so that she might survey herself from all sides she turned and posed emptied her cup pulled her trouser waist lower on her stomach winked at her chief maid then raised a finger as maka khan shouted hoarsely we can do nothing until the kunwari speaks her mind will she have goolab singh or no there was a hush at that and jeendan whispered to the chief maid who stifled a fit of the giggles and called back the maharani is only a woman and cant make up her mind how is she to choose when the great khalsa cannot that sent them into noisy confusion and the maids into stitches one of them was bringing something from the table on a little velvet cushion and to my astonishment i saw it was the great kohinoor stone which id last seen streaked with blood in dalips hand jeendan took it smiling a question at her maids and the wicked sluts all nodded eagerly and clustered round as the khalsa fumed and bickered beyond the curtain and one of the young sikhs shouted we have asked her to choose some say she favours lal singh a chorus of groans let her come out to us and speak her mind it is not seemly that her majesty should come out cries the chief maid she is not prepared this while her majesty with the diamond now in place was flexing her stomach to make it twinkle and her maids hugged themselves giggling and egged her on it is shameful to ask her to break her purdah in durbar where is your respect for her to whom you swore obedience at this there was a greater uproar than ever some crying that her wish was their command and she should stay where she was others that theyd seen her before and no harm done the older men scowled and shook their heads but the youngsters fairly bayed for her to come out one bold spirit even demanding that she dance for them as she had done in the past someone started up a song about a kashmiri girl who fluttered her trouser fringes and shook the world thereby and then from the back of the room they began to chant jeendan jeendan the conservatives swore in protest at this indecent levity and a big lean akali with eyes like coals and hair hanging to his waist burst out of the front rank yelling that they were a pack of whoremongers and looselivers who had been seduced by her wiles and that the children of god the immortal would stand no more of it aye let her come out bawls he let her come humbly as befits a woman and let her forswear her scandalous life that is a byword in the land and appoint a wazir of our approving such a one as will lead us to glory against the foreigners afghan and english alike the rest was lost in pandemonium some howling him down others taking up his cry for war maka khan and the spokesmen helpless before the storm of noise the akali frothing at the mouth leaped on to the front of the dais raving at them that they were fools if they gave obedience to a woman and a loose woman at that let her take a suitable husband and leave mens affairs to men as was fitting and decent and behind the purdah jeendan nodded to her chief maid draped a silver scarf over one arm took a last look at her reflection and walked quickly and fairly steadily round the end of the curtain speaking professionally id say she wasnt more than halfsoused but drunk or sober she knew her business she didnt sidle or saunter or play any courtesan tricks but walked a few paces and stopped looking at the akali there had been a startled gasp from the mob at her appearance well dammit she might as well have been stark naked painted scarlet from the hips down and gilded across her top hamper there was dead silence and then the akali stepped down from the dais like an automaton and without another glance she continued to the throne seated herself without haste arranged her scarf just so on the armrest to cushion her elbow leaned back comfortably with a finger to her cheek and surveyed the gathering with a cool little smile here are many questions to be considered at once her voice was slightly slurred but carried clearly enough which will you take first general she spoke past the akali who was glaring from side to side in uncertainty and maka khan looking as though he wished shed stayed out of sight drew himself up and bowed it is said kunwari that you would make lal singh wazir some hold that he is no fit man but others have bound themselves to accept my choice she reminded him very well it is lal singh this brought the akali to life again an arm flung out in denunciation your bedman he bawled your paramour your male whore there was a yell of rage at this and some started forward to fall on him but she checked them with a raised finger and answered the akali directly in the same calm voice you would prefer a wazir who has not been my bedman then you cant have goolab singh for one but if you wish to nominate yourself akali ill vouch for you there was a moments stunned hush followed by scandalised gasps and then a huge bellow of laughter echoing through the great room insults and obscene jests were showered on the akali who stood mouthing and shaking his fists the rowdies at the back began to stamp and cheer maka khan and the seniors stood like men poleaxed and then as the tumult grew the old soldier roused himself and thrust past the akali to the foot of the dais in spite of the din every word reached us through that cunninglydesigned spyhole kunwari this is not seemly it is to shame to shame the durbar i beg you to withdraw it can wait till another day you didnt bid that thing withdraw when he brayed his spite against me says she indicating the akali and as it was seen that she was speaking the noise died on the instant what are you afraid of the truth that everyone knows why maka khan what an old hypocrite you are she was laughing at him your soldiers are not children are you she raised her voice and of course the mob roared no with a vengeance applauding her so let him have his say she flirted a hand at the akali then i shall have mine maka khan was staring in dismay but with the others shouting at him to give way he could only fall back and she turned her painted smile on the akali you rebuke me for my lovers my male whores you call them very well she looked beyond him and the thick heavy voice was raised again let every man who has never visited a brothel step forward i was lost in admiration the most beardless innocent there wasnt going to confess his unworldliness to his mates and certainly not with that mocking jezebel watching even tom brown would have hesitated before stepping forth for the honour of the old schoolhouse the akali who hadnt the advantage of arnolds christian instruction was simply too dumbfounded to stir she timed it well though looking him up and down in affected wonder before hed collected his wits and drawling there he stands rooted as the hindoo kush well at least he is honest this wayward child of god the immortal but not i think in a position to rebuke my frailty that was the moment when she put them in her pocket if the laughter had been loud before now it was thunderous even maka khans lips twitched and the rissaldarmajor fairly stamped with delight and joined in the chorus of abuse at the akali all he could do was rage at her calling her shameless and wanton and drawing attention to her appearance which he likened to that of a harlot plying for hire he was a braver man than id have been with those fine eyes regarding him impassively out of that cruel mask of a face i remembered the story of the brahmin whose nose had been sliced off because hed rebuked her conduct looking at her i didnt doubt it the akalis are a privileged sect to be sure and no doubt he counted on that get you gone he bawled you are not decent it offends the eye to look at you then turn your eyes away while you still have them says she and as he fell back a pace silenced she rose keeping a firm grip of the throne to steady herself and stood straight posing to let them have a good view in my private place i dress as you see me to please myself i would not have come out but you called me if the sight of me displeases you say so and i shall retire that had them roaring for her to stay absolutely which was just as well for without the throne to cling to i believe shed have measured her length on the floor she swayed dangerously but managed to resume her seat with dignity and as some of the younger men startled to hustle the akali away she stopped them a moment you spoke of a suitable husband for me have you one in mind the akali was game he flung off the hands pulling at him and growled since you cannot do without a man choose one only let him be a sirdar or a wise man or a child of god the immortal an akali she stared in affected astonishment then clapped her hands you are making me a proposal oh but i am confused it is not fitting in open durbar to a poor widow woman she turned her head bashfully aside and of course the mob crowed with delight ah but no akali i cannot deliver my innocence to one who admits openly that he frequents brothels and chases the barbers little girls why i should never know where you were but i thank you for your gallantry she gave him a little ironic how and her smile would have chilled medusa so you may keep your sheeps eyes this time he was glad to escape into the jeering crowd and having entertained them by playing the flirt the fool and the tyrant in short order she waited till they were attentive again and gave them her speech from the throne taking care not to stutter some of you call for goolab singh as wazir well ill not have him and ill tell you why oh i could laugh him out of your esteem by saying that if he is as good a statesman as he was a lover youd be better with balloo the clown the young ones cheered and guffawed while the older men scowled and looked aside but it would not be true goolab is a good soldier strong brave and cunning too cunning for he corresponds with the british i can show you letters if you wish but it is well known is that the man you want a traitor wholl sell you to the malki lat in return for the lordship of kashmir is that the man to lead you over the sutlej that touched the chord they all wanted to hear and they roared khalsaji and wa guruji ko futteh clamouring to know when theyd be ordered to march all in good time she assured them let me finish with goolab i have told you why he is not the man for you now ill tell you why he is not the man for me he is ambitious make him wazir make him commander of the khalsa and hell not rest until he has thrust me aside and mounted to my sons throne well let me tell you i enjoy my power too much ever to let that happen she was sitting back at ease confident smiling a little as she surveyed them it will never happen with lal singh because i hold him here she lifted one small hand palm upwards and closed it into a fist he is not present today by my order but you may tell him what i say if you wish and if you think it wise you see i am honest with you i choose lal singh because i will have my way and at my bidding he will lead you she paused for effect sitting erect now head high wherever it pleases me to send you that meant only one thing to them and there was bedlam again with the whole assembly roaring khalsaji and jeendan as they crowded forward to the edge of the dais bearing the spokesmen in front of them shaking the roof with their cheers and applause and i thought bigod im seeing something new a woman as brazen as she looks with the courage to proclaim absolutely what she is and what she thinks bragging her lust of pleasure and power and ambition and let em make of it what they will no excuses or politicians fair words but simple arrogant admission im a selfish immoral bitch out to serve my own ends and i dont care who knows it and because i say it plain youll worship me for it and they did mind you if she hadnt promised them war it might have been another story but she had and shed done it in style she knew men you see and was well aware that for every one who shrank from her in disgust and anger and even hatred at the shame she put on them there were ten to acclaim and admire and tell each other what a hell of a girl she was and lust after her that was her secret strong clever women use their sex on men in a hundred ways jeendan used hers to appeal to the dark side of their natures and bring out the worst in them which of course is what you must do with an army once youve gauged its temper she knew the khalsas temper to an inch and how to shock it flirt with it frighten it make love to it and dominate it all to one end by the time shed done with em you see they trusted her i saw it happen and if you want confirmation youll find it in broadfoots reports and nicolsons and all the others which tell of lahore in you wont find them approving her mind you except gardner for whom she could do no wrong but youll get a true picture of an extraordinary woman order was restored at last and their distrust of lal singh was forgotten in the assurance that she would be leading them there was only one question that mattered and maka khan voiced it when kunwari when shall we march on india when you are ready says she after the dasahra there were groans of dismay and shouts that they were ready now which she silenced with questions of her own you are ready how many rounds a man has the povinda division what remounts are there for the gorracharra how much forage for the artillery teams you dont know ill tell you ten rounds no remounts forage for five days alick gardners been priming you thinks i it silenced them though and she went on you wont go far beyond the sutlej on that much less beat the sirkars army we must have time and money and you have eaten the treasury bare my hungry khalsa she smiled to soften the rebuke so for a season you must disperse the divisions about the country and live on what you can get nay it will be good practice against the day when you come to delhi and the fat lands to the south that cheered them up she was telling them to loot their own countryside youll notice which theyd been doing for six years meanwhile she and their new wazir would see to it that arms and stores were ready in abundance for the great day only a few of the older hands expressed doubts but if we disperse kunwari we leave the country open to attack says the burly imam shah the british can make a chapao and be in lahore while we are scattered the british will not move says she confidently rather when they see the great khalsa disperse they will thank god and stand down as they always do is it not so maka khan the old boy looked doubtful indeed kunwari yet they are not fools they have their spies among us there is one at your court now he hesitated not meeting her eye this iflassman of the sirkars army who hides behind a fools errand when all the world knows he is the right hand of the blackcoated infidel what if he should learn what passes here today what if there is a traitor among us to inform him among the khalsa she was scornful you do your comrades little honour general as to this englishman he learns what i wish him to learn no more and no less it will not disturb his masters she had a way with a drawled line and the lewd brutes went into ribald guffaws its damnable the way gossip gets about but it was eerie to hear her talk as though i were miles away when she knew i was listening to every word well no doubt id discover eventually what she was about i glanced at mangla who smiled mysteriously and motioned me to silence so i must sit and speculate as that remarkable durbar drew to a close with renewed cheers of loyal acclaim and enthusiastic promises of what theyd do to john company when the time came thereafter they all trooped out in high good humour with a last rouse for the small red and gold figure left in solitary state on her throne toying with her silver scarf mangla led me aloft again to the rosepink boudoir leaving the sliding panel ajar and busied herself pouring wine into a beaker that must have held near a quart anticipating her mistresss needs you see sure enough a stumbling step and muttered curse on the stair heralded the appearance of the mother of all sikhs looking obscenely beautiful and gasping for refreshment she drained the cup without even sitting down gave a sigh that shuddered her delightfully from head to foot and subsided gratefully on the divan fill it again another moment and i should have died oh how they stank she drank greedily was it well done mangla well indeed kunwari they are yours every man aye for the moment my tongue didnt trip youre sure my feet did though she giggled and sipped i know i drink too much but could i have faced them sober dyou think they noticed they noticed what you meant them to notice says mangla dryly baggage its true enough though men she gave her husky laugh raised a shimmering leg and admired its shapeliness complacently even that beast of an akali couldnt stare hard enough heaven help some wench tonight when he vents his piety on her wasnt he a godsend though i should be grateful to him i wonder if he she chuckled drank again and seemed to see me for the first time did our tall visitor hear it all every word kunwari and he was properly attentive good she eyed me over the rim of her cup set it aside and stretched luxuriously like a cat watching me to gauge the effect of all that goodness trying to burst out of the tight silk no modest violet she my expression must have pleased her for she laughed again good then well have much to talk about when ive washed away the memory of those sweaty warriors of mine you look warm too my englishman show him where to bathe mangla and keep your hands off him dyou hear why kunwari why kunwari indeed here unbutton my waist she laughed and hiccoughed glancing over her shoulder as mangla unfastened her at the back shes a lecherous slut our mangla arent you my dear lonely too now that jawaheers gone not that she ever cared two pice for him she gave me her delilah smile did you enjoy her englishman she enjoyed you well let me tell you she is thirtyone the old trollop five years my senior and twice as old in sin so beware of her she reached for her cup again knocked it over splashed wine across her midriff cursed fluently and pulled the diamond from her navel here mangla take this he doesnt like it and hell never learn the trick she rose none too steadily and waved mangla impatiently away go on woman show him where to bathe and set out the oil and then take yourself off and dont forget to tell rai and the python to be within call in case i need them i wondered as i had a hasty washdown in a tiny chamber off the boudoir if id ever met such a blatant strumpet in my life well ranavalona of course but you dont expect coy flirtation from a female ape montez hadnt been one to stand on ceremony either crying on guard and brandishing her hairbrush and mrs leo lade could rip the britches off you with a sidelong glance but neither had paraded their dark desires as openly as this tipsy little houri still one must conform to the etiquette of the country so i dried myself with feverish speed and strode forth as nature intended eager to ambush her as she emerged from her bathroom and she was there ahead of me she was halfreclining on a broad silken quilt on the floor clad in her headveil and bangles and id been looking forward to easing her out of those pants too she was fortifying herself with her wine cup as usual and it struck me that unless i went to work without delay shed be too foxed to perform but she could still speak and see at least for she surveyed me with glassyeyed approval licked her lips and says youre impatient i see no wait let me look at you mmm now come here and lie down beside me and wait i said we should talk remember there are things you must know so that you can speak my mind to broadfoot sahib and the malki lat another sip of puggle and a drunken chuckle as you english say business before pleasure i was boiling to contradict her by demonstration but as ive observed queens are different and this one had told mangla to have rai and the python standing by they didnt sound like ladys maids exactly also if she had something for hardinge i must hear it so i stretched out nearly bursting at the prospect of the abundances thrusting at me within easy reach and the wicked slut bobbed them with one hand while she poured tipple into herself with the other then she put down the cup scooped her hand into a deep porcelain bowl of oil at her side and kneeling forward above me let it trickle on to my manly breast then she began to rub it in ever so gently with her fingertips all over my torso murmuring to me to lie still while i gritted my teeth and clawed at the quilt and tried to remember what an ablative absolute was i had to humour her you see but with that painted harlots face breathing warm booze at me and those superb poonts quivering overhead with every teasing movement and her fingers caressing well it was distracting you know to make things worse she talked in that husky whisper and i must try to pay attention jeendan this is what killed runjeet singh did you know it took a full bowl of oil and then he died smiling flashy you dont say any last words were there j it was my duty to apply the oil while we discussed the business of the state it relieved the tedium of affairs he used to say and reminded him that life is not all policy f no wonder the country went to rack and ruin ah steady on oh lor state business eh well well j you find it stimulating it is a persian custom you know brides and grooms employ it on their wedding night to dispel their shyness and enhance their enjoyment of each other f its a fact you can always learn something new oh holy moses i say dont you care for a spot of oil yourself after your bath i mean mustnt catch cold id be glad to j presently not yet what splendid muscles you have my englishman f exercise and clean living oh god see here kunwari i think thatll do me nicely dont you know j i can judge better than you now be still and listen you heard all that passed at my durbar so you can assure broadfoot sahib that all is well that my brothers death is forgotten and that i hold the khalsa in the hollow of my hand like this no no be still i was only teasing tell him also that i entertain the friendliest feelings towards the sirkar and there is nothing to fear you understand f absolutely speaking of friendly feelings j a little more oil i think but you must warn him to withdraw no regiments from the sutlej is that clear they must remain at full strength like you my mighty english elephant there now i have teased you long enough you must be rewarded for your patience f not before time j no no it is your turn to take the oil not too much and begin at my fingertips so very gently smooth it into my hands good now the wrists you will inform broadfoot sahib that the khalsa will be dispersed until after the dasahra when i shall instruct the astrologers to choose a day for opening the war now my elbows but no day will be propitious for many weeks i shall see to that now slowly up to the shoulders softly a little more oil yes i shall know how to postpone and delay so the sirkar will have ample time to prepare for whatever may come the shoulders i said oh well you have been patient so why not more oil on both hands more ah delicious but gently there is more news for broadfoot sahib f bugger broadfoot j patience beloved you go too fast pleasure hasted is pleasure wasted remember tell him lal singh and tej singh will command the khalsa are you listening lal and tej dont forget their names there now all is told so lie down again elephant and await your mahouts pleasure soo oh gods ahhh wait lie still and observe this timeglass which tells the quarterhour its sands must run out before yours do you hear so now slowly you remember the names lal and tej lal and tej lal and young chaps who fancy themselves masterful wont credit it but these driving madames who insist on calling the tune can give you twice the sport of any submissive slave if you handle them right if they want to play the princess lording it over the poor peasant let em it puts them on their mettle and saves you no end of hard work ive known any number of the imperious bitches and the secret is to let them set the pace hold back until theyve shot their bolt and then give em more than they bargained for knowing jeendans distempered appetite id thought to be hard put to stay the course but now that i was sober which i hadnt been at our first encounter it was as easy as falling off a log which is what she did if you follow me after a mere five minutes wailing with satisfaction well i wasnt having that so i picked her up and bulled her round the room until she hollered uncle then i let her have the minute between rounds while i oiled her lovingly and set about her again turning the timeglass in the middle of it and drawing her attention to the fact although what with drink and ecstasy i doubt if she could even see it she was whimpering to be let alone so i finished the business leisurely as could be and damned if she didnt faint either that or it was the booze after a while she came to calling weakly for a drink so i fed her a few sips while i debated whether to give her a thrashing or sing her a lullaby you must keep em guessing you know the first seemed inadvisable so far from home so i carried her to and fro humming rockabye baby and so help me she absolutely went to sleep nestling against me i laid her on the divan thinking thisll give us time to restore our energies and went into the washroom to rid myself of the oil ive known randy women have some odd tastes birches spurs hairbrushes peacock feathers baths handcuffs god knows what but jeendans the only greasemonkey i can recall i was scrubbing away whistling drink puppy drink when i heard a handbell tinkle in the boudoir youll have to wait a while my dear thinks i but then i heard voices and realised she had summoned mangla and was giving instructions in a dreamy exhausted whisper you may dismiss rai and the python murmurs she i shall have no need of them today perhaps not tomorrow i should think not indeed so i sang rule britannia if you consult the papers of sir henry hardinge and major broadfoot for october youll find three significant entries early in the month mai jeendans court moved to amritsar hardinge left calcutta for the sutlej frontier and broadfoot had a medical examination and went on a tour of his agencies in short the three principals in the punjab crisis took a breather which meant no war that autumn good news for everyone except the dispersed khalsa moping in their outlying stations and spoiling for a fight my own immediate relief was physical jeendans departure came in the nick of time for me for one more amorous joust with her would have doubled me up forever ive seldom known the like youd have thought after the wild passage ive just described that shed have rested content for a spell but no such thing a couple of hours sleep a pint of spirits and drum up the town bull again was her style and i doubt if i saw daylight for three days as near as i could judge for you tend to lose count of time you know we may well have set a record but i didnt keep tally all im sure of is that my weight went down below twelve and a half stone and that aint healthy for a chap my size i was the one who needed medical inspection i can tell you never mind broadfoot and on the fourth morning when i was a mere husk of a man wondering if there was a monastery handy what dyou think she did absolutely had a chap in to paint my portrait at first when he dragged his easel and colours into the boudoir and started waving his brush i thought it was another of her depraved fancies and she was going to have him sketch us performing at the gallop the devil with this thinks i if im to be hung at the next punjab royal academy itll be with my britches on and my hair brushed but it proved to be a pukka sitting flashy fully clad in romatic native garb like lord byron looking noble with a hookah to hand and a bowl of fruit in the foreground while jeendan lounged at the artists elbow prompting and mangla made helpful remarks between the two of them he was in a fine sweat but did a capital likeness of me in no time its in a calcutta gallery now i believe entitled company officer in seekh costume or something of the sort ruined stag at bay more like so that i shall remember my english bahadur says jeendan smiling slantendicular when i asked her why she wanted it i took it as a compliment and wondered if it was a dismissal too for it was in the same breath that she announced she was taking little dalip to amritsar which is the sikhs holy city for the dasahra and wouldnt return for some weeks i feigned dismay concealing the fact that shed reduced me to a state where i didnt care if i never saw a woman again my first act when id staggered back to my quarters was to scribble a report of her durbar and subsequent conversation with me and commit it to second thessalonians that report was what convinced hardinge and broadfoot that they had time in hand no war before winter i was right enough in that fortunately i didnt give them my further opinion which was that there probably wouldnt be a war even then you see i was convinced that jeendan didnt want one if she had and believed the khalsa could beat us and make her queen of all hindoostan shed have turned em loose over the sutlej by now by hocussing them into delay shed spoiled their best chance which would have been to invade while the hot weather lasted and our white troops were at their feeblest by the cold months our sick would be on their feet again dry weather and low rivers would assist our transport and defensive movement and the freezing nights while unpleasant for us would plague the khalsa abominably she was also doubledealing em by warning us to stay on guard and promising ample notice if they did break loose in spite of her now there youll say is a clever lass who knows how to keep in with both sides and will cross either of em if it suits her but already shed ensured that if war did come the odds were in our favour and there was no profit to her in getting beat all that aside i didnt believe war was in her nature oh i knew she was a shrewd politician when she roused herself and no doubt as cruel and ruthless as any other indian ruler but i just had to think of that plump pleasuresodden face drowsing on the pillow too languid for anything but drink and debauchery and the notion of her scheming let alone directing a war was quite out of court lord love us she was seldom sober enough to plot anything beyond the next erotic experiment no if youd seen her as i did slothful with booze and romping youd have allowed that broadfoot was right and that here was a born harlot killing herself with kindness a fine spirit too far gone to undertake any great matter so i thought well i misjudged her especially in her capacity for hatred i misjudged the khalsa too mind you i dont blame myself too much there seems to have been a conspiracy to keep flashy in the dark just then jeendan mangla gardner jassa and even the sikh generals had me in mind as they pursued their sinister ends but id no way of knowing that indeed i was feeling pretty easy on the october morning when the court departed for amritsar and i turned out to doff my tile as the procession wound out of the kashmir gate little dalip was to the fore on his state elephant acknowledging the cheers of the mob as cool as you like but twinkling and waving gaily at sight of me lal singh brave as a peacock and riding with a proprietary air beside jeendans palki didnt twinkle exactly when she nodded and smiled in response to my salute he gave me a stuffed smirk as much as to say back to the pavilion infidel its my innings now youre welcome thinks i plenty of chinese ginger and rhinoceros powder and you may survive mangla in the litter following was the only one who seemed to be sorry to be leaving me behind waving and glancing back until the crowd swallowed her up the great train of beasts and servants and guards and musicians was still going by as jassa and i turned away and rode round to the rushnai gate have a jolly dasahra at amritsar all of you thinks i and by the time you get hack gough will have the frontier reinforced and hardinge will be on hand to talk sense to you face to face among you all you can keep the khalsa in order everything can be peacefully settled and i can go home i said its much to jassa and he gave one of his yankeepathan grunts you reckon well if i was you lieutenant id not say that till i was riding the gridiron again why not have you heard something just the barra choop says he grinning all over his ugly mug what the devils that you dont know an old khyber hand like you barra hoop the silent time before the tempest he cocked his head yes sir i can hear it all right oh to blazes with your croaking heavens man the khalsas scattered all over the place and by the time theyre mustered again gough will have fifty thousand bayonets at the river if he does itll be a red rag to a punjabi bull says this confounded pessimist then theyll be sure he means to invade besides your lady friends promised the khalsa a war come november theyre going to be mighty sore if they dont get it theyll be a dam sight sorer if they do you know that but maybe they dont he turned in the saddle to look back at the long procession filing along the dusty amritsar road shading his eyes and when he spoke again it was in pushtu see husoor we have in the punjab the two great ingredients of mischief an army loose about the land and a womans tongue unbridled in the house he spat together who knows what they may do i told him pretty sharp to keep his proverbs to himself if theres one thing i bar its croakers disturbing my peace of mind especially when theyre leery coves who know their business mind you i began to wonder if he did for now after the terrors and transports of my first weeks in lahore there came a long spell in which nothing happened at all we prosed daily about the soochet legacy and damned dull it was the inheritance act of aint a patch on the police gazette and after weeks of listening to the drivel of a garlicbreathing dotard in steel spectacles on the precise meaning of universum jus and seisin i was bored to the point where i almost wrote to elspeth barra choop indeed but if there was no sign of the tempest foretold by jassa there was no lack of rumour as the dasahra passed and october lengthened into november the bazaars were full of talk of british concentration on the river and dinanath of all people claimed publicly that the company was preparing to annex sikh estates on the south bank of the sutlej it was also reported that he had said that the maharani was willing for war to defend the national honour well wed heard that before the latest definite word was that shed moved from amritsar to shalamar and was rioting the nights away with lal i was surprised that he was still staying the course doubtless rai and the python were spelling him then late in november things began to happen which caused me reluctantly to sit up straight the khalsa began to reassemble on maian mir lal was confirmed as wazir and tej as commanderinchief both made proclamations full of fire and fury and the leading generals took their oaths on the granth pledging undying loyalty to young dalip with their hands on the canopy of runjeets tomb you may be sure i saw none of this diplomatic immunity or not i was keeping my head well below the parapet but jassa gave me eyewitness accounts taking cheerful satisfaction at every new alarm curse him theyre just waiting for the astrologers to name the day says he even the order of march is cut and dried tej singh to ferozepore with foot while lal crosses farther north with gorracharra yes sir theyre primed and ready to fire not wanting to believe him i pointed out that strategically the position was no worse than it had been two months earlier except that there isnt a rupee left in the pearl mosque and nothing to pay em with i tell you they either march or explode i just hope goughs ready what does broadfoot say that was the most disquieting thing of all for two weeks i hadnt had a line from simla id been cyphering away until second thessalonians was dogeared without reply i didnt tell jassa that but reminded him that the final word lay with jeendan shed charmed the khalsa into delay before and she could do it again ive got ten chips says she cant says he once the astrologers say the word itd be more than her pretty little hide was worth to hold back if those stars say go shes bound to give em their heads and god help ferozepore he lost his bet i shall instruct the astrologers she had told me and she must have done for when the wise men took a dekko at the planets they couldnt make head or tail of them finally they admitted that the propitious day was obvious enough but unfortunately it had been last week and they hadnt noticed dammit the panches werent having that and insisted that another date be found and sharp about it the astrologers conferred and admitted that there was a pretty decentlooking day about a fortnight hence so far as they could tell at this distance that didnt suit either and the soldiery were ready to string them up at which the astrologers took fright and said tomorrow was the day not a doubt of it couldnt think how theyd missed it before their credit was pretty thin by this time and although the gorracharra were ordered out of lahore lal took them only a little way beyond shalamar before hurrying back to the city and the arms of jeendan who was once more in residence at the fort tej sent off the infantry by divisions but stayed at home himself and the march was petering out jassa reported i heaved a sigh of relief plainly jeendan was being as good as her word now that she was back under the same roof i considered and instantly dismissed the notion of trying to have a word with her nothing could have been worse just then than talk spreading in the bazaar and the camp that shed been colloguing with a british officer so i sat down to compose a cypher to broadfoot describing the confusion caused by the astrologers and how the khalsa were marching round in rings without their two leading generals in all this i think we may discern a certain ladys fine punjabi hand elegant letterwriters we politicals were in those days sometimes too elegant for our own good i sent it off by way of the scriptures and suggested to jassa that he might canvass gardner who had returned with jeendan to find out the state of play but my faithful orderly demurred pointing out that he was the last man in whom gardner would confide at any time and if the jealous sonofabitch gets the idea that im nosing about right now hes liable to do me harm oh sure hes broadfoots friend but its dalips salt he eats and mai jeendans dont forget that if it comes to war he cant be on our side i wasnt sure about that but there was nothing to do but wait for news of the khalsas intentions and word from broadfoot three days went by and then a week in which lahore buzzed with rumours the khalsa were marching the british were invading goolab singh had declared first for one side then for the other the raja of nabla had announced that he was the eleventh incarnation of vishnu and was raising a holy war to sweep the foreigners out of india all the usual twaddle contradicted as soon as it was uttered and i could do nothing but endure the soochet legacy by day and pace my balcony impatiently in the evening watching the red dusk die into purple starfilled night over the fountain court and listen to the distant murmur of the great city waiting like me for peace or war it was nervous work and lonely and then on the seventh night when i had just climbed into bed who should slip in all unannounced but mangla news at last thinks i and was demanding it as i turned up the lamp but all the reply she made was to pout reproachfully cast aside her robe and hop into bed beside me after six weeks i have not come to talk politics says she rubbing her bumpers across my face ah taste bahadur and then eat to your hearts content have you missed me eh oh damnably says i taking a polite munch but hold on whats the news have you a message from your mistress whats she doing this and this and this says she teasing busily with lal singh rousing his manhood but whether for an assault on herself or on the frontier who knows are you jealous of him then am i so poor a substitute no dammit hold still cant you look woman whats happening for heavens sake one moment i hear the khalsas marching the next that its been recalled is it peace or war she swore shed give warning here dont take em away but i must know dont you see so that i can send word does it matter murmurs the randy little vixen at this moment does it truly matter she was right of course theres a time for everything so for the next hour or so she relieved the tedium of affairs and reminded me that life isnt all policy as old runjeet said before expiring blissfully i was ready for it too for since my protracted bout with jeendan i hadnt seen a skirt except my little maids and they werent worth turning to for afterwards though when we lay beneath the punkah drowsing and drinking there wasnt a scrap of news to be got out of her to all my questions she shrugged her pretty shoulders and said she didnt know the khalsa were still on the leash but what was in jeendans mind no one could tell i didnt believe it she must have some word for me then she has not told me do you know says mangla gnawing at my ear i think we talk too much of jeendan and you have ceased to care for her i know all men do she is too greedy of her pleasure so she has no lovers only bedmen even lal singh takes her only out of fear and ambition now i says the saucy piece teasing my lips with hers have true lovers because i delight to give pleasure as well as to take it especially with my english bahadur is it not so dyou know she was right again id had enough of punjabi royalty to last a lifetime and shed put her dainty finger on the reason with jeendan it had been like making love to a steam road roller but i still had to know what was in her devious indian mind and when mangla continued to protest ignorance i got in a bate and swore that if she didnt talk sense id thrash it out of her at which she clapped her hands and offered to get my belt so the night wore out and a jolly time we had of it with only one interruption when mangla complained of the cold draft from the fan i bawled to the punkahwallah to go easy but with the door closed he didnt hear so i turned out cursing it wasnt the usual ancient but another idiot theyre all alike fast asleep when you want a cool waft and freezing you with a noreaster in the small hours i leathered the brute and scampered back for some more kashmiri culture it was taxing work and when i awoke it was full morning mangla had gone and there was a cypher from broadfoot waiting in second thessalonians so jassa had been right she was the secret courier after all well the little puss mixing business with pleasure if you like id wondered if it was she you remember on that first day when she and others had had the opportunity to be at my bedside table she was the perfect gobetween when you thought about it able to come and go about the palace as she pleased the slavegirl who was the richest woman in lahore easy for her to bribe and command other couriers one of whom must have deputised while she was away in amritsar how the deuce had broadfoot recruited her my respect for my chief had always been high but it doubled now i can tell you which was just as well for if anything could have shaken my faith it was the contents of that cypher when id decoded it i sat staring at the paper for several minutes and then construed it again to be sure i had it right no mistake it was pukka and the sweat prickled on my skin as i read it for the tenth time most urgent to number one alone on the first night after receipt you will go in native dress to the french soldiers cabaret between the shah boorj and the buttee gate use the signals and wait for word from bibi kalil say nothing to your orderly not even an i remain or believe me c that was all the trouble with the political service you know is that they cant tell truth from falsehood even members of parliament know when theyre lying which is most of the time but folk like broadfoot simply aint aware of their own prevarications its all for the good of the service you see so it must be true and that makes it uncommon hard for straightforward rascals like me to know when were being done browner than an apes behind mind you id feared the worst when hed assured me itll never come to disguise or anything desperate oh no george never that honestly youd be safer dealing with lawyers and now here it was my worst fears realised flashy was being sent into the deep field cleanshaven too and never a bolthole or friendinneed to bless himself with come you may say whats the row its only a rendezvous in disguise surely aye and then who the blazes was this bibi kalil the name might mean anything from a princess to a bawd and what horror would she steer me to at broadfoots bidding well id find out soon enough the disguise was the least of it i had a poshteen in my valise and had gathered a few odds and ends since coming to lahore persian boots pyjamys and sash for lounging on the hotter days and the like my own shirt would do once id trampled it underfoot and i improvised a puggaree from a couple of towels ordinarily id have borrowed jassas gear but he was to be kept in the dark that was something about the cypher that struck me as middling odd the last sentence was unnecessary since the word alone at the beginning meant that the whole thing was secret to me presumably george was just makin siccar as he would say leaving the fort was less simple id strolled out once or twice of an evening but never beyond the market at the hazooree gate on the inner wall which was the betterclass bazaar serving the quality homes which lay south of the fort before you came to the town proper i darent assume my disguise inside the palace so i stuffed it into a handbag all but the boots which i put on under my unutterables then it was a case of making sure that jassa wasnt on hand and slipping out to the gardens after dark there were few folk about and in no time i was behind a bush staggering about with my foot tangled in my pants damning broadfoot and the mosquitoes i wrapped the puggaree well forward over my head dirtied my face put the bag with my civilised duds into a cleft in the garden wall prayed that i might return to claim them and sallied forth now ive gone native more times than i can count and its all a matter of confidence your amateur gives himself away because hes sure everyone can see through his disguise and behaves according they cant of course for one thing they aint interested and if you amble along doing no harm youll pass ill never forget sneaking out of lucknow with t h kavanaugh during the siege he was a great irish murphy without sense or a word of hindi figged out like the worst kind of pantomime pasha with the lampblack fairly running off his fat red cheeks and cursing in tipperary the whole way and not a mutineer gave him a second look hardly now my beardless chops were my chief anxiety but im dark enough and an ugly scowl goes a long way i had my pepperbox but i bought a belt and a kashmiri short sword in the market for added security and to test my appearance and elocution im at my easiest as a pathan ruffler speaking pushtu or in this case bad punjabi so i spat a good deal growled from the back of my throat and beat the boothwallah down to halfprice he didnt even blink so when i reached the alleys of the native town i stopped at a stall for a chapatti and a gossip to get the feel of things and pick up any shave that might be going the lads of the village were full of the impending war and how the gorracharra had crossed the river unopposed at the harree ghat and the british were abandoning ludhiana which wasnt true as it happened they have lost the spirit says one knowall afghanistan was the death of them afghanistan is everyones death says another didnt my own uncle die at jallalabad peace be on him in the british war nay he was cook to a horse caravan and a bazaar woman gave him a loathsome disease he had ointments from a hakim to no avail for his nose fell off and he died raving my aunt blamed the ointments who knows with an afghan hakim that is how we should slay the british cackles an ancient send the maharani to infect them heehee she must be rotten by now i didnt care for that and neither did a burly cove in a cavalry coat be decent pig she is the mother of thy king who will sit on the throne in london fort when we of the khalsa have eaten the sirkars army hear him scoffs the old comedian the khalsa will march on the ocean then to reach london what ocean fool london lies only a few cos beyond meerut is it so far says i playing the yokel have you been there myself no admitted the khalsa bird but my havildar was there as a cameldriver it is a poor place by all accounts not so great as lahore nay now cries the one with the poxy uncle the houses in london are faced with gold and even the public privies have doors of silver this i was told that was before the war with the afghans says the khalsas prize liar whose style i was beginning to admire it beggared the british and now they are in debt to the jews even wellesley sahib who broke tipoo and the maharattas aforetime can get no credit and the young queen and her waitingwomen sell themselves on the streets so my havildar tells he had one of them does he have his nose still cries another and there was great merriment aye laugh cries the ancient but if london is grown poor where is all this loot on which we are to grow fat when you heroes of the pure have brought it home now god give him wit where else but in calcutta in the hebrews strongboxes we shall march on thither when we have taken london and glashka where they grow tobacco and make the iron boats about as wellinformed you see as our own public were about india i lingered a little longer until i was thinking in punjabi and then with that wellknown hollow feeling in my innards set off on my reluctant way the shah boorj is at the southwestern corner of lahore city less than a mile away as the crow flies but nearer two when you must pick your way through the winding ways of the old town foul ways they were too running with filth past hovels tenanted by ugly beggar folk who glared from doorways or scavenged among the refuse with the rats and pidogs the air was so poisonous that i had to wrap my puggaree over my mouth as though to strain the pestilential vapours as i picked my way past pools of rotting filth a few fires among the dungheaps provided the only light and everywhere there were bright wicked eyes human and animal that shrank away as i approached lengthening my stride to get through that hellish place but always i could imagine horrid shapes pressing behind me and blundered on like the chap in the poem who darent look back because he knows theres a hideous goblin on his heels presently the going was better between high tenements and warehouses and only a few nightlurkers hurrying by near the south wall the streets were wider with decent houses set back behind high walls a couple of palkis went by swaying between their bearers and there was even a chowkidar patrolling with his lantern and staff but i still felt damnably alone with the squalid hostile warren between me and home that was how i now thought of the fort which id approached with such alarm a couple of months ago very adaptable we funks are the french soldiers cabaret was close to the buttee gate and if the frog mercenaries whose crude portraits adorned its walls could have seen it theyd have sought redress at law they squinted out of their frames on a great noisy reekfilled chamber ventura allard court and even my old chum avitabile looking like the italian bandit he was with his tasselled cap and spiky moustachioes id settle for you alongside this minute thinks i as i surveyed the company villainous tworupee bravos painted harpies who should have been perched in trees a seedy fluteandtomtom band accompanying a couple of gyrating nautches whom you wouldnt have touched with a long pole and sikh brandy fit to corrode a bucket ill never say a word against boodles again says i to myself at least there you dont have to sit with your back to the wall i found a stool between two beauties whod evidently been sleeping in a camel stable bought a glass of arrack that i took care not to drink growled curtly when addressed and sat like a good little political using the signals thumb between the first two fingers and scratching my right armpit from time to time half the clientele were clawing themselves in the same way with good reason which was disconcerting but i sat grimly on wishing id gone into holy orders and ignoring the blandishments of sundry viragos of the sort you can have for fourpence with a mutton pie and a pint of beer thrown in but better not for the pie meats sure to be off they sulked or snarled at me according to taste but the last one a hennad banshee with bad teeth said i was choosy wasnt i and what had i expected in a place like this bibi kalil there was so much noise that i doubted if anyone else had heard her but i waited till shed flounced off and another ten minutes for luck then i rose and shouldered my way to the door taking my time sure enough she was waiting in the shadow of the porch without a word she led on up the alley and i followed close my heart thumping and my hand on the pepperbox under my poshteen as i scanned the shadows ahead we went by twisting ways until she stopped by a high wall with an open wicket through the garden and round the house your friend is waiting she whispered and vanished into the dark i glanced about to mark lines of flight and went cautiously in a small bushy enclosure surrounded a tall wellkept house and directly before me a steep outside stair led up to a little arched porch on the upper floor with a dimlylit doorway beyond round the angle of the house to my left light was spilling from a groundfloor room that i couldnt see that was my way then but even as i set forward the light in the arch overhead shone brighter as the door beyond was fully opened and a woman came out silently on to the little porch she stood looking down into the garden this way and that but by then i was in the bushes taking stock peering up through the leaves i could see her clearly and if this was bibi kalil i didnt mind a bit she was tall finefeatured as an afghan heavy of hip and bosom in her fringed trousers and jacket a matronly welterweight and just my style then she moved back inside and since my immediate business was round the corner on the ground floor i heaved a sigh and turned that way and stopped dead as i recalled a word that my guide had used friend that wasnt political talk brother or sister was usual and whoever had instructed her would have told her the exact words to say back to my mind came that other queer phrase in broadfoots message say nothing to your orderly that hadnt been quite pukka either they were just two tiny things but all of a sudden the dark seemed deeper and the night quieter cowards instinct if you like but if im still here and in good health bar my creaky kidneys and a tendency to wind its because i shy at motes never mind beams and i dont walk straight in where i can scout first so instead of going openly round the house as directed i skulked round behind the bushes until i was past the angle and could squint through the foliage into that welllit ground floor room with its open screens and have a quiet apoplectic fit to myself holding on to a branch for support there were half a dozen men in the room armed and waiting and they included inter alia general maka khan his knifetoting sidekick imam shah and that crazy akali whod denounced jeendan at the durbar leading men of the khalsa sworn enemies of the sirkar waiting for old flash to roll in friends bigod and i was meant to believe that broadfoot had directed me to them well i didnt not for an instant which was the time it took me to realise that something was hellishly horribly wrong that this was a trap and my head was all but in its jaws and nothing for it but instant flight you dont stop to reason how or why at times like that you grit your teeth to keep em from chattering and back away slowly through the bushes with your innards dissolving taking care not to rustle the leaves until youre close by the gate when you think you hear furtive movement out in the alley and start violently treading on a stick that snaps with a report like a bloody howitzer and you squeal and leap three feet and if youre lucky an angel of mercy in fringed trousers reappears on the porch overhead hissing flashman sahib this way quickly i was up that stair like a fox with an arseful of buckshot tripping on the top step and falling headlong past the woman and slap into the arms of a burly old ruffian who was hobbling nimbly out of the inner doorway i had a glimpse of huge white whiskers and glaring eyes under a black turban but before i could exclaim i was in a bears grip with a hand like a ham over my mouth chubrao khabadar growls he a thousand hells get your great infidel foot off my toe dont you english know what it is to have the gout then and to the woman have they heard she stood a moment on the porch listening and then slid in closing the door softly there are men in the alley and sounds from the garden room her voice was deep and husky and in the dim light i could see her poonts bouncing with agitation shaitan take them snarls he its now or not at all then down chabeli by the secret stair look for donkal and the horses he was bundling me into the room haste woman he wont be there yet whispers the woman with their lookouts in the streets he must even wait she shot me a swift look moistening her full lips besides i fear the dark do you go while i wait here with him god she would flirt on the edge of the pit fumes the old buck have ye no sense of fitness with the house crawling with foes and my foot like to burst away and look out from the street window i say you can ravish him another time she glared but went flitting across the shadowy chamber to a low door in the far wall while he stood gripping my arm the great whitewhiskered head raised to listen but the only sounds were my heart hammering and his own gusty breathing he glanced at me and spoke hoarse and low flashman the afghan killer aye ye have the beastly look they are down there rats of the khalsa lying in wait for you i know i saw them how you were lured with a false message subtle fellows these i stared horrorstricken but thats impossible it it cant be false no one could oho so youre not here and neither are they says he grinning savagely wait till their flayers set about you fool and youll change your mind are you armed i showed him and would you believe it he fell into whispered admiration of my pepperbox it turns so six shots you say a marvel with one of these who needs rent collectors by god at need we can cut our way out you with shot and i with steel fiend take the woman where is she ogling some prowler like as not ah my poor foot they say drink inflames it but i believe it comes of kneeling at prayer alas why did i rise from my bed this day all this in muttered whispers in the gloom and me beside myself with fear not knowing what the devil was up except that the hosts of midian were after me but that i seemed to have found two eccentric friends thank god and whoever they might be they werent common folk you dont take careful note at such times but even in the grip of funk i was aware that while the lady might have a wanton eye she talked like a sultana the tiny room was opulent as a palace with dim lamps shining on silk and silver and my gouty old sportsman could only be some tremendous swell command was in every line of the stout powerful figure bold curved nose and bristling beard and he was dressed like a fighting raja a great ruby in his turban silver studs on the quilted leather jack black silk pyjamys tucked into high boots and a jewelhilted broadsword on his hip who on earth was he keeping my voice down i asked him and he chuckled and answered in his growling whisper his eye on the door you cannot guess so much for fame ah but you know me well flashman sahib and that sweet hussy whose tardiness perils our safety aye yeve been busy about our affairs these two months he grinned at my bewilderment bibi kalil is only her pet name she is the widow of my brother soochet singh peace be on him and i am goolab singh if i stared it wasnt in disbelief he fitted the description in broadfoots packets even to the gout but goolab singh once pretender to the throne the rebel whod made himself king in kashmir in defiance of the durbar should have been behind a rock up jumoo way with fifty thousand hillmen as george had put it he must be the most wanted man in lahore this minute for while there had been some in the khalsa whod nominated him for wazir jeendan had since exposed him as a british ally which was fine by me just then but didnt explain his presence here let that explain it says he as bibi kalil emerged from the low door this is her house and the pretty widow has admirers he pointed downwards men high in the khalsa panches she makes them welcome they talk freely and i lying close to lahore in these days of trouble hear it all from her so when they hatch a plot to take you why here am i gout and all to prove my loyalty to the sirkar by rescuing its servant what the hell do they want with me to talk with you over a slow fire i believe well little jujube what of donkal no sign of him goolab there are men in the streets and others in the garden her voice shook and her eyes were wide in alarm but she wasnt one of your vapouring pieces i heard imam shah call for the wench who brought you she adds to me aye well theres an end to waiting says goolab cheerfully shell tell them you entered theyll beat the bushes then theyll bethink them of upstairs he cocked an ear as distant voices came from the garden below maka khan grows impatient have your revolving gun ready englishman bibi kalil gave a little gasp and pressed close to me trembling but i was in no case to enjoy it she put an arm round me and i clasped her instinctively for reassurance not lust i can tell you the questions that had been racing pellmell through my mind how id come to be trapped in this gilded hellhole how those khalsa swine had known i was coming why goolab and this palpitating armful were on hand to aid me mattered nothing beside those terrible words slow fire uttered almost idly by this crazy old bandit who with fifty thousand hillmen at his call had apparently brought only one who was farting about in the dark and then my blood froze and i clutched the widow for support as footsteps sounded on the outside stair she clung in return goolabs hand dropped to his hilt and we waited there still as death until a sharp knock fell on the door a moments pause and then a mans voice lady are you there my lady she turned those fine eyes on me helplessly and then goolab stepped close his lips at her ear who is he dye know him her reply was a faint perfumed breath sefreen singh aide to maka khan an admirer the old devil was bright with mischief even now and it was a moment before she shrugged and whispered from a distance another knock lady ask him what he wants whispers goolab i felt her tremble but she did it well calling out in a sleepy voice who is it sefreen singh my lady a pause are you pardon me are you alone she waited and then called im asleep what was that of course im alone goolab grimaced over her head at me he was enjoying this rot him a thousand pardons lady the voice was all apology i have orders to search there is a badmash about if you will please to open well hes not here she was beginning but goolab was at her ear again we must let him in but first beguile him he winked if he is to enter with a weapon ready let it not be a steel one she glared but nodded gave me a melting glance as she disengaged her right tit from my unwitting grasp and called out impatiently oh very well a moment goolab drew his sabre noiselessly passed it to me and took the short sword from my belt pricking his thumb on the point hes mine if i miss take off his head he limped swiftly to the latch side of the door motioned me to stand behind it and nodded to the widow she set her hand on the bolt and spoke softly sefreen singh are you alone honey wouldnt have melted why why yes my lady youre sure she gave a little murmuring laugh in that case if you promise to stay a while you may come in she slipped the bolt opened the door and turned away glancing over her shoulder and in steps barnacle bill not believing his luck to receive goolabs updriven point beneath his bearded chin before hed gone a step one savage expert thrust into the brain he went down without a sound goolab breaking his fall and when i turned from fumbling the door to with a shaking hand the old ruffian was wiping his blade on the dead mans shirt eightytwo chuckles he and bibi kalil gave a long shuddering sigh between clenched teeth her eyes were shining with excitement aye well thats india for you now away snaps goolab this buys us moments no more do you show him the way down chabeli ill bide here until youre at the street door why cries the widow oh to beguile my leisure snarls he in case others come knocking you witless heifer can i keep up with my foot afire but i can hold a door aye or parley perchance they may think twice before putting steel into goolab singh he thrust us away out with him woman so that he can sing the praise of this nights work to hardinge sahib go never fear ill follow but first she must embrace him and he laughed and kissed her saying that she was a goodsister to be proud of then she had me by the hand and we were through the low door and down stone steps to a passage which ended in an iron grille beyond it the alley lay dark and deserted but she shrank back gasping that we must wait between the danger behind and the unknown perils out yonder i was scared neutral and in a moment goolab came hobbling down yelping at each step i heard them on the outer stair gods love if this doesnt win me the white queens seal on kashmir theres no gratitude left what an empty street well empty or not we cannot wait my sabre flashman we stout bellies need a full sweep now harken back to back if we must but if it grows hot each for himself ill not leave you my lord cries bibi kalil youll do as i bid insolence at all costs he must win clear or our labours wasted now one either side of me and open the gate softly but donkal is not come wails the widow donkal be damned we have five feet among us but well lack three heads if we linger come on we stumbled into the alley the widow and i supporting his ponderous weight and blundered ahead into the dark myself in blind panic bibi kalil whimpering softly and the lord of kashmir gasping blasphemies and encouragement all we needed was a bowl to put to sea in from beyond the house we could hear voices raised and the distant sound of hammering on a door with someone calling for sefreen singh we reached the alley end and as bibi kalil sped ahead to scout goolab hung on my shoulder panting aye get up sefreen and let them in croaks he all clear sweetheart bless her plump limbs when we come to jumoo shell have a new emerald each day and singing girls to tell her stories aye and twenty stalwart lads as bodyguards on on quickly oh for five sound toes again we stumbled round the corner and on into a little court where four ways met and a torch guttered in a bracket overhead casting weird shadows bibi kalil sped to one of the openings and screamed suddenly darting back goolab stubbed his gouty foot and tumbled down cursing and as i hauled him up two men came bounding out of the alley and hurled themselves on us if theyd been out to kill wed have been done for with me hauling at the stranded goolab but capture was what they were after the first clutched for my swordarm and got my point in the shoulder for his pains shabash afghan killer roars goolab still on his knees and ran him through the body but even as the fellow went down his comrade threw himself on goolab choking off the triumphant yell of eightythree and bearing him to earth bibi kalil ran in screaming and tearing at the attackers face with her nails while i danced about making shrill noises and looking for a chance to pink him until it occurred to me that there were better uses for my time than this and i turned tail up the nearest alley well goolab had said each for himself but i wont pretend that ive ever needed leave to bolt i hadnt been given the precious gift of life to cast it away in back alleys brawling on behalf of fat rajas and randy widows and i was going like a startled fawn and rejoicing in my youth when i saw a glare of torchlight ahead of me and realised with horror that round the next corner running feet were approaching serve you right poltroon says you for leaving pals in the lurch now youll get your cocoa but we practised absconders dont give up so easy i can tell you i came to a slithering halt and as the powers of darkness came surging into view full of spite and action i was stockstill and pointing back to the little court where goolab and the widow could be seen apparently disembowelling the second robber who wasnt taking it quietly here they are brothers i shouted on on and take them theyre ours i even started back towards the court stumbling artistically to let them catch up and if you think it was a desperate stratagem well it was but it seldom fails and it would have succeeded then if id had the wit to follow a yard or two farther as they raced past me but i was too quick to turn again and flee one of them must have seen me from the tail of his eye and realised that this vociferous badmash wasnt one of the gang for he pulled up yelling and came after me i held my lead round one corner and the next saw a convenient opening and dodged through it and crouched gasping in the shadows as the pursuit went tearing by i leaned against the wall eyes closed utterly done with fear and exertion getting my breath back and only when i took a cautious peep out did it strike me that the scenery was familiar the little wicket in the opening i squealed aloud wheeling round and sure enough there before me was the outside stairway up to the porch and two fellows were carrying down the earthly remains of sefreen singh and from various parts of bibi kalils garden about a dozen bearded faces were regarding me with astonishment among them not ten feet away arms akimbo and scowling like a teetotal magistrate was general maka khan and beside him exclaiming with unholy delight was the akali fanatic ive said i dont give up easy and its with pride that i recall tumbling out into the alley and tottering away calling for the police but they were on me within five yards bearing me bodily into the garden while i announced my name and consequence at the top of my voice until they stuffed a gag into my mouth they dragged me round to the garden room and thrust me into a chair two holding my arms and a third my hair they were street rascals but the others who crowded in were khalsa to a man some in uniform apart from maka and the akali there were sikh officers a burly naik of artillery with a hideouslypitted face and imam shah knives and all he threw my bloodstained short sword on the table two dead in the street lord general says he and your aide sefreen the others who were with this one have not yet been found then stop the search says maka khan we have what we want and if one of the others is who i think he is the less we see of him the better and the widow cries the akali that practising slut who has betrayed us let them both go theyll do us less harm alive than if we had their deaths to answer for he pointed at me remove the gag they did and i choked down my fear and was beginning my diplomatic bluster demanding release and safeconduct and immunity and the rest but id barely got the length of warning them of the consequences of assaulting an accredited envoy when maka khan snapped me off short you are no envoy and youve forgotten what it is to be a soldier barks he you are a murderer and a spy its a lie i didnt kill him i swear it was goolab singh damn you all loose me this instant you villains or itll be the worse for you im an agent of sir henry hardinge an agent of blackcoat broadfoot blazes the akali shaking his fist you send out cyphers betraying the secrets of our durbar you put them in the holy book by your bed blaspheming your own putrid faith whence your old punkahwallah took them to a courier for simla aye until we found him out two weeks ago and questioned him gloats this maniac and learned enough to nail your guilt to your forehead aye gape spy we know no doubt i was gaping in part at the news that the mysterious messenger of second thessalonians was not mangla as id suspected but that leanshanked ancient whod operated my fan so inefficiently and who must have vanished without my noticing to be replaced by the clown id leathered only last night but they were bluffing they could question the old buffoon until hell froze those cyphers were greek to him and to everyone else save broadfoot and me i wasnt reasoning too clearly you understand but i saw the line i must take general maka khan cries i no doubt in indignant falsetto this is outrageous i demand to be set free at once to be sure i send coded messages to my chief so does every ambassador and you know it but to suggest that they contain any any secrets of the durbar is is why its a damnable insult they they were my confidential opinions on the soochet legacy for sir henry and his advisers including your opinion that the astrologers failure to find a date for our march was caused by a ladys fine punjabi hand says he sternly yes mr flashman we have read that message and every other that youve sent this ten days past as well as those coming to you from simla so that was why georges correspondence had dried up we have enough to hang you spy shouts the akali spraying me with spittle but first we would know what else youve betrayed and youll tell us you sneaking dog i wasnt hearing aright or they were lying they might have intercepted messages but they couldnt have deciphered them not in a century yet maka had just quoted my own words to broadfoot and goolab had spoken of a false message to entrap me i hadnt had time to ponder that impossibility no it couldnt be so the key to that cypher was based on random words in an english novel that theyd never heard of and even if they had it would be as useless to them as a safe to which they didnt know the combination its all false i tell you i stammered general i appeal to you those messages were innocent on my honour he gave me a long cold stare while i babbled and then he called out and in trooped the oddest trio a bespectacled little weed of a chichi in a soiled european suit and two jellyfat babus who smirked uneasily among all these rough military men the chichi carried a sheaf of papers which at a sign from maka khan were thrust before my eyes and my heart missed a beat for it was a manuscript in english copied exactly line for line space for space and the top sheet bore the unbelievable words crotchet castle by thomas love peacock and beneath the title in a clerkly indian hand but again in english were precise directions for using the book in the encoding of messages reviewing my career in india id say that of all the wonders i saw there that was the greatest i dare say one should be prepared for anything in a land where an illiterate peasant girl can give you the square root of a sixfigure number at first glance but when i reflect on the skill and speed of those copyists and the analytical genius that penetrated that code well it can still rob me of breath not as entirely as it did at the time though your punkahwallah confessed how you wrote your cyphers with the aid of a book sneers the akali it was copied in your absence and compared with the intercepted cyphers by these men who are skilled in cryptography an indian invention as major broadfoot should have borne in mind oah indeed a veree simple cypher chirps the chichi while the babus beamed and nodded quite elementaree you know page numbers dates of christian calendar initial letters of arltarnate lines that will do says maka khan and dismissed them but one of the babus couldnt resist a backward gleek at me doctor folliott and mr mcquedy are jolly good fun squeaks he and waddled out as fast as he could go i sat sick and trembling no wonder theyd been able to fake a message to trap me with one tiny error of style which id been fool enough to ignore what the devil had i written in my cyphers though theyd spotted the allusion to jeendan but i hadnt named her but what else had i said you see says maka khan what you have written of late we know what else have you learned up at the fort yonder nothing as gods my witness i bleated general upon my honour sir i protest your cryptographers are mistaken or lying yes thats it i hollered its a beastly plot to discredit me to give you an excuse for war well it wont serve you scoundrels what yes it will i mean youll learn fast enough lets have him below snarls the akali hell babble as freely as his creature did there were growls of agreement from the others and i fairly neighed in alarm what dyou mean damn you im a british officer and if you lay a finger they clapped the gag over my mouth again and i could only listen in horror while the akali swore that time was pressing so the sooner they set about me the better and they argued to and fro until maka khan turned them all out of the room except for my three guards and the pockmarked naik his face gave me the shudders but i took some comfort from the fact that maka had taken matters on himself damned uncivil hed been what with spy and murderer but he was a gentleman and a soldier after all and like calls to like you know why standing there tall and erect glaring at me and twisting his grizzled moustache he might have been any staff colonel at horse guards bar the turban better still he addressed me in english so that the others should be none the wiser you spoke of war says he it has begun our advance guard is already across the sutlej in a few days there will be a general engagement between the khalsa and the company army under sir hugh gough i tell you this so that you may understand your position you are now beyond help from simla so it had finally come and i was a prisoner of war well better here than there at least id be out of harms way no you are not a prisoner snaps maka khan you are a spy be quiet he took a turn about and leaned down to stare grimly into my face we of the khalsa know that our queen regent has turned traitor we also suspect the loyalty of lal singh our wazir and tej singh our field commander you have been mai jeendans intimate her lover we know she has sent assurances through you to broadfoot so much is plain from your recent cyphers but what has she betrayed in detail of our plan of campaign numbers dispositions lines of march objectives equipment he paused his black eyes boring into mine your one hope flashman lies in full disclosure immediately but i dont know anything i tell you nothing ive not heard a word of of plans or objectives or any such thing and i havent even seen mai jeendan for weeks her woman mangla visited you last night his words came out like rapid fire you spent hours together what did she tell you how have you passed it to simla through her or the man harlan who poses as your orderly or by some other means we know you sent no cypher today as gods my judge it aint true she told me nothing then why did she visit you why why because well weve grown friendly dont you know i mean we talk you see and not a word of politics i swear we just converse and so forth god it sounded lame as the truth often does and it drove him into a rage either youre a fool or you think i am he rasped very well ill waste no more time your punkahwallah spoke under persuasion in unspeakable pain which i trust you will spare yourself you have a choice speak to me now in this room or to this fellow he indicated the pockmarked naik who took a pace forward scowling in the cellar below for a moment i didnt believe my ears oh id been threatened with torture before by savages like gul shah and those beastly malagassies but this was a man of honour a general an aristocrat i wouldnt believe it not from someone who might have been cardigans own brother dammit you dont mean it i yelped i dont believe you its a trick a mean cowardly trick you wouldnt dare but youre trying to frighten me damn you yes i am his voice and eyes were dead level but it is no empty threat there is too much at stake we are beyond diplomatic niceties or the laws of war very soon now hundreds perhaps thousands of men will be dying in agony beyond the sutlej indian and british alike i cannot afford to spare you when the fate of the war may depend on what you can tell me by god he did mean it and before that iron stare i broke down utterly weeping and begging him to believe me but i dont know a damned thing for christs sake its the truth yes yes shes betraying you she promised to warn us and yes shes delayed and made the astrologers bungle it you tell me what i know already cries he impatiently but its all i know blast you she never said a word of plans oh if she had id tell you please sir for pitys sake dont let them torture me i cant bear it and itd do no good damn you you cruel old bastard because ive nothing to confess oh god if i had id tell you if i could i doubt it indeed i am sure you would not says he and before those words and tone suddenly so flat almost weary i left off blubbering to stare he was standing ramrod straight but not in disgust or contempt at my ravings if anything he looked regretful with a touch of ruptured nobility even i couldnt fathom it until to my horrified amazement he went on in the same quiet voice you overplay the cowards part too far mr flashman you would have me believe you an abject broken thing dead to honour a cur who would confess everything betray everything at a mere threat and on whom therefore torture would be wasted he shook his head major broadfoot does not employ such people and your own reputation belies you no you will tell nothing until pain robs you of your reason you know your duty as i know mine it drives us both to shameful extremes me to barbarism for my countrys sake you to this pretence of cowardice a legitimate ruse in a political agent but not convincing from the man who held pipers fort i am sorry his mouth worked for a moment and i wont swear there wasnt a tear in his blasted eye i can give you an hour before they begin for gods sake use it to see reason take him down he turned away like a strong suffering man whos had the last word he hadnt though pretence i screamed as they hauled me from the chair you bloody old halfwit its true im not shamming damn you i swear it i cant tell you anything oh jesus please please let me be mercy you foul old kite cant you see im telling the truth by that time they were dragging me through the garden to the back of the house thrusting me through a low ironshod door and down an immensely long flight of stone steps into the depths of a great cellar a dank tomb of rough stone walls with only a small window high up on the far side a choking acrid smell rose to meet us and as the naik set a burning torch in a bracket by the stair foot the source of that stench became horribly apparent are you weary daghabazi sahib cries he see we have a fine bed for you to rest on i looked and almost swooned in the centre of the earth floor lay a great rectangular tray in which charcoal glowed faintly under a coating of ash and about three feet above it was a rusty iron grill like a bedstead with manacles at head and foot watching my face the naik cackled with laughter and taking up a long poker went forward and tapped open two little vents on either side of the tray the charcoal near the vents glowed a little brighter gently blows the air gloats he and slowly grows the heat he laid a hand on the grill a little warm only but in an hour it will be warmer daghabazi sahib will begin to feel it then he may even find his tongue he tossed the poker aside put him to bed i cant describe the horror of it i couldnt even scream as they ran me forward and flung me down on that diabolic gridiron snapping the fetters on my wrists and ankles so that i was held supine unable to do more than writhe on the rusty bars and then the pockmarked fiend picked up a pair of bellows from the floor grinning with savage delight you will be in some discomfort when we return daghabazi sahib then we shall open the vents a little more your punkahwallah cooked slowly for many hours did he not jan oh he spoke long before he began to roast that followed though i think he had no more to tell he leaned down to laugh in my face and if you find it tedious we may hasten matters thus he thrust the bellows under the foot of the grill pumping once a sudden gust of heat struck my calves and i found my tongue at last in a shriek that tore my throat again and again as i struggled helplessly they crowed with laughter those devils as i raved in terror and imagined agony swearing i had nothing to tell pleading for mercy promising them anything a fortune if theyd let me go rupees and mohurs by the lakh god knows what else then perhaps i swooned in earnest for all i remember is the naiks jeering voice from far off in an hours time rest well daghabazi sahib and the clang of the iron door there are in case you didnt know it five degrees of torture as laid down by the spanish inquisition and i was now suffering the fourth the last before the bodily torment begins how i kept my sanity is a mystery im not sure but that i did go mad for a spell for i came out of my swoon babbling no no dawson i swear i didnt peach twasnt me it was speedicut he blabbed on you to her father not me i swear it oh please please dawson dont roast me and i could see the fat brutes great whiskered moon face leering into mine as he held me before the schoolroom fire vowing to bake me till i blistered i know now that that roasting at rugby was worse for real corporal anguish than my ordeal at lahore but at least id known that dawson must leave off at the last whereas in bibi kalils cellar with the growing heat only beginning to make my back and legs tingle and run rivers of sweat i knew that it would continue hotter and ever hotter to the unspeakable end thats the horror of the fourth degree as the inquisitors knew but while their heretics and religious idiots could always get off by telling the bloody dagoes what they wanted to hear i couldnt i didnt know the minds a strange mechanism chained to that abominable grill i began to burn and strained to arch my body away from the bars until i fainted again and when i came to my senses why i was only uncomfortably warm for a moment until i remembered where i was and in an instant my clothes were catching fire the flames were scorching my flesh and i shrieked my way into oblivion once more yet it was only in my mind my clothing was barely being singed whereas dawson burned my britches arse out the fat swine and i couldnt sit for a week i cant tell how long it was before i realised that while and merrily well whoop and holloa silence except for my gasps and groans then a scrambling rush a thud and through the suffocating mist a figure was looming over me and a horrified face was peering into mine holy jesus cries jassa and as the bolt rasped back in the door he fairly flung himself away burrowing among the rubble in the shadows along the wall the door swung open and the naik appeared on the threshold for a long awful moment he stood looking down at me as i struggled and panted on the grill in a frenzy of fear that hed seen jassa that the fatal hour was up and then he sang out is the bed to your liking daghabazi sahib what not warm enough yet oh patience only a moment now he guffawed at his own priceless wit and went out leaving the door ajar and here was jassa muttering hideous oaths as he worked at my fetters they were simple bolts and in a moment he had them loose and i had lurched off that hellish gridiron and was lying face down on the filthy cool earth panting and retching jassa knelt beside me urging haste and i forced myself up my back and legs were smarting but didnt feel as though they were badly burned and with the naik plainly about to return at any moment i was in a fever to be away can you climb whispers jassa and i saw there was a camel rope dangling from the window fifteen feet above our heads ill go first if you cant make it well haul you he seized the rope and walked up the wall like an acrobat until he had his legs over the sill up quick he hissed and i leaned on the wall a second to fetch my breath and my senses rubbed my hands on the dirt and laid hold on the rope i may not be brave but im strong and exhausted as i was i climbed by my arms alone hauling my dead weight hand over hand bumping and scraping against the wall no work for a weakling but my mortal funk was such that i could have done it with henry viiion my back up i went nearly sick with hope and the sill wasnt a yard above me when i heard the door thrown back in the cell below i almost let go my hold in despair but even as a yell sounded from the doorway jassas hand was on my collar and i heaved for my life i got an elbow on the sill looked down and saw the naik bounding down the steps with his gang at his heels jassa was through the window hauling at me and i got a leg over the sill from the tail of my eye i saw one of the ruffians below swinging back his hand there was a flash of steel and i winced away as a thrown knife struck sparks from the wall jassas pistol banged deafeningly before my face and i saw the naik stagger and fall i yelled with joy and then i was over the sill drop shouts jassa and i fell about ten feet landing with a jar that sent a stabbing pain through my left ankle i took one step and went down bleating as jassa dropped beside me and heaved me up again my heart went out to goolab singh and his gouty foot in that moment as i thought crocked bigod and only one leg to run with jassa had me by the shoulders he let out a piercing whistle and suddenly there was a man on my other side stooping beneath my arm between them they halfcarried me howling at every step two shots sounded somewhere to my left i saw pistolflashes in the gloom people were yelling branches whipped my face as we blundered along and then we were in an alley a mounted man was alongside and jassa was heaving me almost bodily up behind i clasped the rider round the waist turning to look back and there was bibi kalils gate and a cowled black figure was cutting with a sabre at someone within and then sprinting after us the alley seemed to be full of horsemen in fact there were only four including jassa voices were yelling behind us feet were pounding a torch was flaring in the gateway and then we were round the corner gently does the trick says jassa at my elbow they aint horsed you doing well there lieutenant right jemadar walkmarch trot he urged his beast ahead and we swung in behind him however he came there he was a complete hand our philadelphia sawbones left to myself id have been off full tilt blundering heaven knows where and coming to grief like as not jassa knew just where he wanted to go and what time he had in hand we trotted round a corner into a little court which i recognised as the one in which goolab and i had opened the batting and lo there were two more riders on post and to my astonishment i recognised them and my rescuers as black robes of alick gardners well no doubt all would be made clear presently they led the way up a long lane and at the end jassa reined in to look back by george there were torches entering the lane at a run a bare fifty paces behind and suddenly all my pain and fear and bewilderment vanished in overwhelming blind rage by god id make em pay the vile torturing scoundrels there was a pistol in my riders saddle holster and i plucked it out bellowing while jassa demanded to know what the devil i was about im going to kill one of those murdering bastards i roared lay hands on me you poxy vermin you broil me on a damned gridiron will you take that you sonsofbitches i blazed away and had the satisfaction of seeing the torches scatter though none of them went down say wont that larn em though cries jassa you feel better now lieutenant youre sure dont want to go back and burn their barn down fine achha jemadar jildi jao which we did at a steady canter in the broader ways and at a walk in the twisting alleys and as we rode i learned from jassa what had brought my saviours at the eleventh hour he it seemed had been keeping a closer eye on me for weeks than ever i knew he had spotted me leaving the fort and trailed me wondering to the french soldiers canteen and bibi kalils house skulking in the shadows hed seen me received by the widow and having a foul mind supposed i was bedded for the night fortunately hed skulked farther spied the khalsa bigwigs downstairs and realised that there was villainy afoot deciding that he could do nothing alone hed legged it for the fort and made straight for gardner i figured you were treed and needed help in numbers alick was the only hope he may not cotton to me exactly but when i told him how you were under the same roof as maka khan and the akali didnt he jump just didnt come himself though bad policy for him to be seen crossing the khalsa dont you know but he told off the jemadar and a detail and we hit the leather i scouted the house but no sign of you a couple of sentries perambulating in the garden though and then i heard you hollering from the back of the house i took a quiet slant that way and marked the window your noise seemed to be coming from say youre a right audible soldier aint you after that two of the jemadars fellows smoothed out the sentries and took station while he and i slipped along to your window and here you are theyre capable alicks boys no error but what took you into that bears den and what in creation were they doing to you i didnt tell him the events of the night were still a hideous jumble in my mind and reaction had me in its grip i was shaking so hard i barely kept the saddle i wanted to vomit and my ankle was throbbing with pain once again when all seemed well lahore had become a nightmare with enemies all about the only bright side was that there seemed no lack of worthy souls eager to pluck me out of the soup god bless america if you like theyd turned up trumps again at no small risk to themselves for if the khalsa got wind that gardner was aiding enemies of the state hed be in queer street dont you fret about alick snorts jassa hes got more livesn a cat and more nuts on the fire than you can count hes dalips man and jeendans man and best chums with broadfoot and hes goolab singhs agent in lahore and goolab singh that was another who took an uncommon interest in flashys welfare i was beginning to feel like a fives pill being thrashed about in a fourhand fifteenup with my seams split and the twine showing well to the devil with it id had enough i reined in and demanded of jassa where we were going id been half aware that we were threading our way through the alleys near the south wall and once or twice wed skirted under the wall itself wed passed the great looharree gate and the halfmoon battery and were abreast of the shah alumee which meant we were holding east and were no nearer the fort than when wed started not that i minded that for im not going back there i can tell you broadfoot can peddle his pack and be damned this bloody place aint safe thats what gardner reckoned says jassa he thinks you should make tracks for british territory you know the wars started yes sir the khalsas over the river at half a dozen places between harreekeputtan and ferozepore eighty thousand horse foot and guns on a thirtymile front god knows where gough is halfway to delhi with his tail between his legs if you believe the bazaar but i doubt it seven thousand at ferozepore i was thinking well littler was done for wheeler too with his pitiful five thousand at ludhiana unless gough had managed to reinforce id had no sure word for three weeks but it didnt seem possible that he could have concentrated strongly enough to resist the overwhelming sikh tide that was pouring over the sutlej i thought of the vast horde id seen on maian mir the massed battalions of foot the endless squadrons of horse those superb guns and of gough frustrated at every turn by that ass hardinge our sepoys on the edge of desertion or mutiny our piecemeal garrisons strung along the frontier and down the meerut road now it had come like a hammerblow and wed been caught napping as usual well gough had better have god on his side for if he didnt farewell india which mattered rather less to me than the fact that i was a fugitive with a game ankle in the heart of the enemy camp so much for broadfoots idiot notions id be safe in lahore during hostilities indeed a fat lot of protection jeendan could give me now with the khalsa wise to her treachery it would be a tulwar not a diamond that would be decorating her pretty navel shortly moochee gate says jassa and over the low hovels i saw the towers ahead and to our right we were approaching a broad street leading down to the gate and the mouth of the alley was crowded with bystanders even at that time of night all craning to see a band of music was playing a spirited march there was the steady tramp of feet and down the avenue to the gate came three regiments of khalsa infantry stalwart musketeers in white with black crossbelts their pieces at the shoulder bayonets fixed then dogra light infantry in green with white trousers muskets at the trail a battalion of spearmen in white flowing robes their sashes bristling with pistols their broad turbans wound round steel caps surmounted by green plumes they swung along with a fierce purpose that made my heart sink the flaring cressets on the wall glittering on that forest of steel as it passed under the arch the girls showering them with petals as they passed the chicos striding alongside shrilling with delight half lahore seemed to have left its bed that night to see the troops march away to join their comrades on the river as each regiment approached the arch it gave a great cheer and i thanked god for the shadows as i saw that they were saluting a little knot of mounted officers in gorgeous coats with the rotund figure of tej singh at their head he was wearing a puggaree as big as himself and enough jewellery to start a shop he shook a sheathed tulwar over his head in response to the troops weapons brandished in unison as they chanted khalsaji wa guruji ko futteh to delhi to london victory after them came cavalry regular units lancers in white and dragoons in red jingling by and finally a baggage train of camels and tej left off saluting the band gave over and people turned away to the booths and grog shops jassa told the jemadar to have the riders follow us singly and then my rider dismounted and jassa began to lead my beast down towards the gate hold on says i where away thats your way home wouldnt you say says he and when i reminded him that i was all in dry famished and onelegged he grinned all over his ugly mug and said that would be attended to directly id see so i let him lead on under the great arch past the spearmen standing guard in their mail coats and helms my puggaree like my sword and pepperbox had gone during the evenings activities but one of the riders had lent me a cloak with a hood which i kept close about my face no one gave us a second glance beyond the gate were the usual shanties and hovels of the beggars but farther out on the maidan a few camp fires were winking and jassa made for one beside a little grove of white poplars where a small tent was pitched with a couple of horses picketed close by the first streak of dawn was lightening the sky to the east silhouetting the camels and wagons on the southern road the night air was dry and bitter cold and i was shivering as we reached the fire a man squatting on a rug beside it rose at our approach and before i saw his face i recognised the long rangy figure of gardner he nodded curtly to me and asked jassa if there had been any trouble or pursuit now alick you know me cries that worthy and gardner growled that he did and how many signatures had he forged along the way the same genial gurdana khan i could see but just the sight of that fierce eye and jutting nose made me feel safe for the first time that night whats wrong with your foot snaps he as i climbed awkwardly down and leaned wincing on jassa i told him and he swore you have a singular gift for making the sparks fly upward lets have a look at it he prodded making me yelp damnation itll take days to mend very well doctor harlan theres cold water in the chatti lets see you exercise the medical skill that was the talk of pennsylvania i dont doubt theres curry in the pan and coffee on the fire he picketed the horse while i wolfed curry and chapattis and jassa bound my ankle with a cold cloth it was badly sprained and swollen like a football but he had a soothing touch and made it feel easier gardner came back to squat crosslegged beyond the fire drinking coffee with the aid of his iron neckclamp and eyeing me sourly hed left off his bumbee tartan rig no doubt to avoid notice and wore a cowled black robe with his khyber knife across his knees a damned discouraging sight all round with questions to match now mr flashman growls he explain yourself what folly took you among the khalsa and at such a time too well sir what were you doing in that house i knew i would be relying on him for my passage home so i told him all of it from the false message to jassas rescue and he listened with a face like flint the only interruption came from jassa when i mentioned my encounter with goolab singh you dont say the old golden hen now what would he be doing so far from kashmir gardner rounded on him minding his own dam business and youll do likewise josiah you hear me not a word about him yes while i think on it youd best take yourself out of earshot thats for mr flashman to say retorts jassa mr flashman agrees with me barks gardner fixing me with a cold eye so i nodded and jassa loafed off in a pet he did well by you tonight says gardner watching him go but i still wouldnt trust him across the street go on i finished my tale and he observed with grim satisfaction that it had all fallen out for the best i said i was glad he thought so and pointed out that it wasnt his arse that had been toasted over a slow fire he just grunted maka khand never ha gone through with it hed try to scare you but torture isnt his style the devil it aint good god man i was halfbroiled i tell you those swine would have stopped at nothing why they roasted my punkahwallah to death so they told you even if they did a noaccount niggers one thing a white officers another still you were lucky thanks to josiah yes and to goolab singh i asked him why he thought goolab and the widow had taken such risks on my behalf and he stared at me as though i were halfwitted he told you plain enough id say the more good turns he does the british the better theyll like him hes promised to stand by em in the war but protecting you is worth a thousand words hes counting on you to do him credit with hardinge and you do it dyou hear goolabs an old fox but hes a brave man and a strong ruler and deserves to have your people confirm him as king in kashmir when this wars over it seemed to me he was being optimistic in thinking wed be in a position to confirm anyone in kashmir when the khalsa had done with us but i didnt care to croak in front of a yankee so i said offhand you think well beat the khalsa quite handily then therell be some damned long faces in lahore fort if you dont says he bluntly and before i could ask him to explain that bewildering remark he added but youll be able to watch the fight from the ringside yourself before the weeks out i dont see that says i i agree i cant stay in lahore but im in no case to ride for the frontier in a hurry either not with this confounded leg i mean even in disguise you never know i might have to cut and run and id rather have two sound pins for that what so youd best find me a safe comfortable spot to lie up in meanwhile was what i was hinting and waited for him to agree he didnt we cant wait for your leg to mend this war is liable to be won and lost in a few days at most which means you must be across the sutlej without delay even if you have to be carried he glared at me whiskers bristling the fate of india may well depend on that mr flashman the sun couldnt have got him not in december and he wasnt tight tactfully i asked him how the fate of india came into it since i had no vital intelligence to take with me and my addition to the forces of the company while no doubt welcome in its small way could hardly be decisive forces of the company my aunts petticoat snarls he youre going in with the khalsa if life has taught me anything at all its how to keep my countenance in the presence of strong authoritative men whose rightful place is in a padded cell ive known a power of them to my cost and alick gardners a minor figure in a list that includes the likes of bismarck palmerston lincoln gordon john charity spring ma george custer and the white raja to say nothing of my beloved mentor dr arnold and my old guvnor many of them men of genius no doubt but all sharing the delusion that they could put any proposal however lunatic to young flashy and make him like it theres no arguing with such fellows of course all you can do if youre lucky is nod and say well sir thats an interesting notion to be sure just before you tell me more about it would you excuse me for a moment and once youre round the corner make for the high ground ive seldom had that chance unfortunately and theres nothing for it but to sit with an expression of attentive idiocy trying to figure a way out which is what i did with gardner while he elaborated his monstrous suggestion youre going with the khalsa says he to ensure its defeat its doomed and damned already thanks to mai jeendan but you can make it certain you see what i mean the man was plainly must were received in india and supposedly were affected by sunstroke doolali afflicted of allah too long in the hills altogether but one doesnt like to say so straight out not to a chap who affects tartan pants and has a khyber knife across his lap so i avoided the main point for a lesser but equally curious one i dont quite follow gardner old fellow says i you say the khalsas doomed and its jeendans doing but she never wanted this war you know shes been working to avoid it hocussing the khalsa delaying em holding em back they know it too maka khan told me and now theyve broken loose in spite of her in spite of why you jackass cries he glaring like the ancient mariner she started it dont you understand shes been planning this war for months why to destroy the khalsa of course to see it exterminated root and branch sure she held em back until the cold weather until shed fixed it so they have the worst possible generals until shed bought time for gough but not to avoid war no sir just to make sure that when she did send em in the khalsa would get whipped five ways to sunday dont you know that talk sense why should she want to destroy her own army because if she doesnt it will sure as hell destroy her in the end he fetched a deep breath see here you know the khalsas gotten too big for its britches dont you for six years its been ruining the punjab defying government doing as it dam well pleases i know all that but well dont you see the ruling clique jeendan and the nobles have had their power and fortunes wiped out their very existence threatened so of course they want the khalsa crushed and the only force on earth that can do that is john company thats why theyve been trying to provoke a war thats why jawaheer wanted one but they murdered him and thats another score mai jeendan has to settle you remember her that night at maian mir dont you she was sentencing the khalsa then mr flashman now shes executing them i remembered her screaming hate at the khalsa over jawaheers body but gardner still wasnt making sense dammit if the khalsa goes under shell go with it i protested shes their queen and you say shes set them on well if they lose shell be finished wont she he sighed shaking his head son it wont even take the dander out of her hair when they lose shes won consider britain doesnt want to conquer the punjab too much trouble it just wants it nice and quiet with no khalsa running wild and a stable sikh government wholl do what hardinge tells em so when the khalsas licked your chiefs wont annex the punjab no sir theyll find it convenient to keep little dalip on the throne with jeendan as regent which means that she and the nobles will be riding high again squeezing the fat out of the country just like old times and with no khalsa to worry about hold on are you saying that this wars a putup job that they know in simla that jeendan is hoping well destroy her army for her own benefit i wont have that why itd be collusion conspiracy aiding and abetting no such thing oh they know in simla what shes after or they suspect leastways but what can they do about it give the khalsa free passage to delhi he snorted hardinges got to fight whether he likes it or not and while he may not welcome the war there are plenty of forward policy men like broadfoot who do but that doesnt mean theyre in cahoots with mai jeendan the way shes fixed things they dont need to be i sat silent trying to take it in and feeling no end of a fool evidently i had misjudged the lady oh id guessed there was steel inside my drunken avid little houri but hardly of the temper that could slaughter scores of thousands of men just for her own political convenience and personal comfort mind you what other reasons do statesmen and princes ever have for making war when all the shams been stripped away oh and she had her sot of a brother to avenge to be sure but i wondered if her calculations were right i could spot one almighty imponderable and i voiced it to gardner whether it sounded like croaking or not but suppose we dont beat the khalsa how can she be so sure we will theres a hell of a lot of em and were spread thin wait though maka khan was in a great sweat in case shed betrayed their plans of campaign well has she gardner shook his head shes done better than that shes put the conduct of the war in the hands of lal singh her wazir and lover and tej singh her commanderinchief whod set fire to his own mother to keep warm he nodded grimly theyll see to it that gough doesnt have too much trouble suddenly i remembered lal singhs words to me i wonder how we should acquit ourselves against such a seasoned campaigner as sir hugh gough my god says i with reverence you mean theyre ready to to fight a cross to sell the pass but does gough know i mean have they arranged with him no sir thats your part thats why you have to join the khalsa he leaned forward the hawk face close to mine youre going to lal singh by tomorrow hell be lying before ferozepore with twenty thousand gorracharra hell tell you his plans and tej singhs numbers armaments dispositions intentions all of it and youll carry them to gough and hardinge and then well it should be an interesting little war whats the matter id been struggling for speech during this fearful recital but when i found words it wasnt to protest or argue or scream but to pose a profound military question but hells bells look here they can give away plans arrange for a few regiments to go astray lose a battle on purpose i dare say but man alive how do they betray an army of a hundred thousand men i mean how dyou sell a whole war itll take management no denying as i said an interesting little war he tossed another billet on the fire and rose when its over and youre back in lahore with the british peace mission you can tell me all about it my first thought as i sat by the fire with my head in my hands was this is broadfoots doing hes planned the whole hideous thing start to finish and kept me in the dark till the last moment the treacherous crooked conniving scotch political well i was doing him an injustice for once george was innocent he might welcome the war as gardner had said and have a shrewd notion that jeendan was launching the khalsa in the hope of seeing it wrecked but neither he nor anyone else in simla knew that the sikhs two leading commanders were under her orders to give the whole game away nor could he guess the base use that was being made of his prize agent lieutenant flashman late th hussars in this hour of crisis the notion that i should be the messenger of betrayal had been another inspiration of jeendans according to gardner how long shed had me in mind for the role of gobetween he didnt know shed confided it to him only the previous day and he and mangla would have brought me my marching orders that same night if i hadnt been away gallivanting with the khalsa and goolab and the merry widow most inconsiderate of me but alls ill that ends ill here i was still ankle crocked and guts fermenting with fright meet to be hurled into the soup in furtherance of that degenerate royal doxys intrigues and no way to cry off that i could see i tried you may be sure pleading my ankle and the impossibility of taking orders from any but my own chiefs and the folly of venturing again among enemies whod already toasted me to a turn gardner answered every objection with the blunt fact that someone had to take lals plans to gough and no one else had my qualifications it was my duty says he and if you wonder that i bowed to his authority well take a squint at the portrait in his memoirs that should convince you im still not sure by the way exactly where his loyalties lay to dalip and jeendan certainly what she ordered he performed but he played a staunch game on our behalf too and on goolab singhs when i ventured to ask him where he stood he looked down that beak of a nose and snapped on my own two feet so there he had jeendans infernal scheme all pat and after id had a couple of hours sleep and jassa had rebound my swollen ankle he lined it out to me horrid risky it sounded you ride straight hence to lals camp beyond the sutlej with four of my men as escort all of you disguised as gorracharra ganpat there will act as leader and spokesman hes a safe man this was his jemadar a lean punjabi with an abanazar moustache he and the halfdozen other riders had come out from the city by now and were loafing round the fire chewing betel and spitting while gardner bullied me privately youll arrive by night presenting yourselves as messengers from the durbar thatll see you into lals presence hell be expecting you word of mouth goes to him today from jeendan suppose maka khan or that bloody akali turn up theyll recognise me straight off theyll be nowhere near theyre infantrymen lal commands only cavalry and horse guns besides no ones going to know you in gorracharra gear and you wont be in their camp long enough to signify a few hours at most just long enough to learn what lal and tej mean to do theyll take ferozepore says i thats plain theyre bound to put littler out of the game before gough can relieve him he gave an impatient snarl thats what theyd do if they wanted to win the goddam war they dont but their brigadiers and colonels do so lal and tej are going to have to look as though theyre trying like hell lals going to have to think of some damned good reason for not storming ferozepore and since hes a duffer of a soldier as well as a yellowbelly hes liable to go crosseyed if his subordinates present him with a sound plan now what it wont do i bleated maka khan told me the khalsa already suspect them of disloyalty well heavens above the moment lal makes a move or gives an order even that looks fishy why theyll see hes pissing on his own wicket will they whos to say whats a fishy move or why its being made you were in afghanistan how many times did elphinstone do the sensible thing tell me that he was always wrong godammit yes but that was fatheadedness not treachery who knows the difference confound it you did what you were told and so will the khalsa colonels what do they know if theyre told to march from a to b or retire from c or open a candy store at d they cant see the whole canvas only their own corner of it sure they know lal and tej are cowardly rascals whod turn tail sooner than eat but theyre still bound to obey he gnawed his whiskers growling i said itll take managing by lal and tej and by gough once hes learned from you what theyre about he stabbed me with a bony finger from you thats the point if lal sent a native agent promising betrayal gough wouldnt give him the time of day but he knows you and can trust what you tell him and much good it would do him i thought for however lal and tej mismanaged the khalsa they couldnt alter its numbers or the zeal of its colonels or the quality of its soldiers or the calibre of its guns they might supply gough with full intelligence but he was still going to have to engage and break a disciplined army of a hundred thousand men with a company force onethird the size and undergunned id not have wagered two pice on his chances but then you see i didnt know him for that matter i didnt know much about war afghanistan had been a rout not a campaign and borneo an apprenticeship in piracy id never seen a pukka battle or the way a seasoned commander can manage an army or the effect of centuries of training and discipline or that phenomenon which i still dont understand but which ive watched too often to doubt the british peasant looking death in the face and hitching his belt and waiting my chief concern of course was the prospect of venturing into the heart of the khalsa and conspiring with a viper like lal singh with a game leg to prevent me lighting out at speed if things went amiss as they were bound to do even sitting a mount hurt like sin and to make matters worse gardner said jassa must stay behind i couldnt demur half the punjab knew that crafty phiz and that he was my orderly but hed pulled me clear twice now and id feel naked without him broadfoot needs a foot on the ground here anyway says gardner never fear dear josiah will be safe under my wing and under my eye while the war lasts im to be governor of lahore which between ourselves is liable to consist of protecting mai jeendan when her disappointed soldiery come pouring back over the river yes sir we surely earn our wages he surveyed me in my gorracharra outfit of which the most important part was a steel cap like a roundheads with long cheekpieces that helped conceal my face youll do let your beard grow and leave the talking to ganpat youll make kussoor this afternoon lie up there and go down to the river ghat after dark and you should fetch up with lal singh around dawn tomorrow ill ride along with you a little ways we set off the six of us at about ten oclock riding parallel with the south road it was heavy with traffic for the khalsa baggage and ration carts ammunition wagons even teams of guns for we were riding with the rearguard of the army a vast host spread across the dusty plain moving slowly south and east ahead of us the doab would be alive with the main body as far as the sutlej beyond which lal singh was already investing ferozepore and tej singhs infantry would be advancing whither we rode at a fast trot which troubled my ankle but gardner insisted we must keep up the pace if i was to reach lal in time hes been over the sutlej two days now gough must be moving and lals going to have to take order pretty sharp or his colonels will want to know why i only hope says gardner grimly that the weakkneed sonofabitch doesnt run away in which case we might just have the gorracharra under the command of someone who knows what the hell hes doing the more i thought of it the madder the whole thing sounded but the maddest part of it was still to be revealed wed made our noon halt and gardner was turning back to lahore but first he rode a little way apart with me to make sure i had it all straight we were on a little knoll about a furlong from the road along which a battalion of sikh infantry was marching tall stalwarts all in olive green with their colonel riding ahead colours flying drums beating bugles sounding a rousing air gardner may have said something to prompt my question but i dont recall at any rate i asked him see here i know the khalsas been spoiling for this but if they know their own maharani has been conspiring with the enemy and suspect their own commanders well even the rank and file must have a shrewd idea their rulers want to see em beat so why are they allowing themselves to be sent to war at all he pondered this and gave one of his rare wintry smiles they reckon they can whip john company whoever may be crossing or betraying em dont matter they think they can be champions of england in which case theyll be the masters of hindoostan with an empire to plunder maybe mai jeendan has that possibility in mind too and figures shell win either way oh she could charm away the suspicions of treason most of em still worship her another reason they have for marching is that they believe you british will invade them sooner or later so they might as well strike first he paused for a moment frowning and then said but thats not the half of it theyre going to war because theyve taken their oaths to dalip singh maharaja and hes sent them out in his name never mind who put the words in his mouth so even if they knew they were doomed beyond a doubt theyd go to the sacrifice he turned to look at me you dont know the sikhs sir i do theyll fight their way to hell and back for that little boy and for their salt he sat gazing across the plain where the marching battalion was disappearing into the heat haze the sun twinkling on the bayonets the sound of the bugles dying away he shaded his eyes and it was as though he was talking to himself and when the khalsas beat and jeendan and her noble crew are firm in the saddle again and the punjabs quiet under britannias benevolent eye and little dalips getting his hide tanned at eton college why then he gestured towards the road then sir john company will find he has a hundred thousand of the best recruits on earth ready to fight for the white queen because thats their trade and itll all have turned out best for everybody i guess lot of good men will have died first though sikh indian british he glanced at me and nodded thats why hardinge has held off all this time hes probably the only man in india who thinks the price is too high now its going to be paid he was a strange bird this all bark and fury most of the time then quiet and philosophical which sorted most oddly with his ghazi figurehead he chucked the reins and wheeled his pony good luck soldier give my salaams to old georgie broadfoot ive never cared much for service with foreign forces at best its unfamiliar and uncomfortable and the rations are liable to play havoc with your innards the american confederates werent bad i suppose bar their habit of spitting on carpets and the worst i can say of the yankees is that they took soldiering seriously and seemed to be under the impression that they had invented it but the malagassy army of which i was sergeantgeneral was simply disgusting the apaches stink and know dam all about camp discipline no one in the foreign legion speaks decent french the boots dont fit and the bayonet scabbard is a clanking piece of scrap all round the only aliens in whose military employ i could ever be called happy were the skyblue wolves of khokand and that was only because i was full of hashish administered by their generals mistress after id rogered her in his absence as for the khalsa the one good thing about my service in its ranks was that it was short and to the point i count it from the moment we set out south the six of us in column of twos gorracharra to the life in our oddments of mail and plate and eccentric weapons gardner had furnished me with two pistols and a sabre and while id have swapped the lot for my old pepperbox i consoled myself that with luck id never need to use them i was in two minds as we cantered down towards loolianee on the one hand i was relieved to elation at leaving the horrors of lahore behind me when i thought of that hellish gridiron and chaund cours bath and the ghastly fate of jawaheer even the knowledge that i was venturing into the heart of the khalsa didnt seem so fearful a glance at the scowling unshaven thug reflected in gardners pocket mirror had told me that i neednt fear detection i might have come straight from peshawar valley and no questions asked and lal singh being up to his arse in treason would be sure to speed me on my way in quick time in two days at most id be with my own people again with fresh laurels too as the man who brought the news that saved the army if it did save it that is that was tother side of the coin and as we rode into the thick of the invading army all my old fears came flooding back we kept clear of the road which was choked with transport trains but even on the doab we found ourselves riding through regiment after regiment marching in open order across the great sunbaked plain twice as you know id seen the khalsa mustered but it seemed that the half hadnt been shown unto me now they covered the land to the horizon men wagons horses camels and elephants churning up the red dust into a great haze that hung overhead in the windless air making noontide like dusk and filling the eyes and nostrils and lungs when we came to kussoor late in the afternoon it was one great park of artillery line upon line of massive guns and pounders and i thought of our pathetic and pounders and horse artillery and wondered how much use lals betrayal would be well whatever befell id just have to play my game leg for all it was worth and keep well clear of the action theres great debate by the way about how large the khalsa was and how long it took to cross the sutlej but the fact is that even the sikhs dont know i reckoned about a hundred thousand were on the move from lahore to the river and i know now that theyd been crossing in strength for days and already had fifty thousand on the south bank while gough and hardinge were trying to scramble their dispersed thirty thousand together but muster rolls dont win wars concentration does not only getting there fustest with the mostest as the chap said but bringing em to bear in the right place thats the secret and if you run into lars porsena hell be the first to tell you at the time i only knew what i could see camp fires all about us in a vast twinkling sea as we came down by night to the ferozepore ghat even in the small hours they were swarming over the ferry in an endless tide great burning bales had been set on high poles on either bank glaring red on the three hundred yards of oily water and men and guns and beasts and wagons were being poled across on anything that could float barges and rafts and even rowing boats there were whole regiments waiting in the dark to take their turn and the ghat itself was bedlam but ganpat thrust ahead bawling that we were durbar couriers and we were given passage in a fisher craft carrying a general and his staff they ignored us poor gorracharra and presently we came to the noisy confusion of the southern bank and made our way by inquiry to the wazirs headquarters ferozepore itself lay a couple of miles or so from the river with the sikhs in between and how far their camp extended up the south bank god alone knows theyd been crossing as far up as hurreeke and i suppose theyd made a bridgehead of about thirty miles but i aint certain as near as ive been able to figure lals headquarters lay about two miles due north of ferozepore but it was still dark when we passed through the lines of tentlanes all ablaze with torches most of his force were gorracharra like ourselves and my memory is of fierce bearded faces and steel caps beasts stamping in the dark and the steady throb of drums that they kept up all night doubtless to encourage littler in his beleaguered outpost two miles away lals quarters were in a pavilion big enough to hold astleys circus it even had smaller tents within it to house him and his retinue of staff and servants and personal bodyguard these last were tall villains with long chainmail headdresses and ribbons on their muskets they barred our way until ganpat announced our business which caused a great scurry and consultation with chamberlains and butlers although it was still the last watch and the great man was asleep it was decided to wake him at once so we didnt have to wait above an hour before being ushered into his sleeping pavilion a silken sanctum decked out like a bordello with lal sitting up naked in bed while one wench dressed his hair and combed his beard another sprayed him with perfume and a third plied him with drink and titbits ive never seen a man in such a funk in my life at our previous meetings hed been as cool urbane and commanding as a handsome young sikh noble can be now he was like a virgin with the vapours he gave me one terrified glance and looked quickly away his fingers tugging nervously at the bedclothes while the wenches completed his toilet and when one of them dropped her comb he squealed like a spoiled child slapped her and drove them out with shrill curses ganpat followed them and the moment hed gone lal was tumbling out of bed hauling his robe about him and yammering at me in a hoarse whisper praise god you are here at last i thought you would never come what is to be done he was fairly quivering with fright ive been at my wits end for two days and tej singh is no help the swine he sits at arufka pretending he must supervise the assembly and leaves me here alone everyone is looking to me for orders what in gods name am ito say to them what have you said already why that we must wait what else can i say man but we cant wait forever they keep telling me that ferozepore can be plucked like a ripe fruit if i will but give the word and how can i answer them how can i justify delay i dont know he seized me by the wrist pleading you are a soldier you can think of reasons what shall i tell them i hadnt reckoned on this id always thought myself gods own original coward but this fellow could have given me ten yards in the hundred and won screaming well gardner had warned me of that and also that lal might have difficulty thinking of reasons for not attacking ferozepore but i hadnt expected to find him at such a complete nonplus as this the man was on the edge of hysterics and plainly the first thing to be done was to calm his panic and find out how the land lay i began by pointing out that i was an invalid id only been able to limp into his presence with the aid of a stick and that my first need was food drink and a doctor to look at my ankle that took him aback it always does when you remind an oriental of his manners and his women were summoned to bring refreshments while a little hakim clucked over my swollen joint and said i must keep my bed for a week what they thought to see a hairy gorracharra sowar treated with such consideration by their wazir i dont know lal fretted up and down and couldnt wait to drive them out again and renew his appeals for guidance by that time id got my thoughts into some order at least as far as his ferozepore dilemma was concerned there are always a hundred good reasons for doing nothing and id hit on a couple but first i must have information i asked him how many men he had ready to march at hand twentytwo thousand cavalry they are lying a bare mile from ferozepore with the enemy lines in full view i tell you and littler sahib has a bare seven thousand only one british regiment and the rest sepoys ready to desert to us we know this from some who have already come over he gulped at his cup his teeth chattering on the rim we could overrun him in an hour even a child can see that have you sent messengers to him as if i would dare who could i trust already these khalsa bastards look at me askance let them suspect that i traffic with the enemy and he rolled his eyes and flung his cup away in a passion and that drunken bitch in lahore gives me no help no orders while she couples with her grooms i wait to be butchered like jawaheer now see here wazir says i roughly for his whining was starting to give me the shakes you take hold dyou hear your position aint all that desperate you see a way out quavers he clutching at me again oh my dear friend i knew you would not fail me tell me tell me then and let me embrace you you keep your bloody distance says i whats littler doing fortifying his lines yesterday he came out with his whole garrison and we thought he meant to attack us and held our ground but my colonels say it was a feint to gain time and that i must storm his trenches oh god what can i hold on hes entrenched you say is he still digging capital you can tell your colonels hes mining his defences but will they believe me he wrung his hands suppose the deserters deny it why should you trust deserting sepoys how dye know littler hasnt sent em to give you false reports of his strength eh to lure you into attacking him ferozepores a ripe fruit is it come raja you know the british foxy bastards every one of us deuced odd aint it that weve left a weak garrison cut off just asking to be attacked what he stared wideeyed is this true i doubt it but you dont know that says i warming to my work anyway its a dam good reason to give your colonels for not attacking headlong now then what force has tej singh and where thirty thousand infantry with heavy guns behind us along the river he shuddered thank god i have only light artillery with heavy pieces i should have no excuse for not blowing littlers position to rubble never mind littler what news of gough two days ago he was at lutwalla a hundred miles away he will be here in two days but word is that he has scarcely ten thousand men only half of them british if he comes on we are sure to defeat him he was almost crying wrenching off his beard net and trembling like a fever case what can i do to prevent it even if i give reasons for not taking ferozepore i cannot avoid battle with the jangi lat help me flashman bahadur tell me what i must do well this was a real facer if you like gardner for all his misgivings about lal had been sure that he and tej would have some scheme for leading their army to destruction that was what i was here for dammit to carry their plans to gough and it was plain as a pikestaff that they hadnt any and lal expected me a junior officer to plot his own defeat for him and as i stared at that shivering helpless clown it came to me with awful clarity that if i didnt no one else would it aint the kind of problem you meet every day i doubt if its ever been posed at staff college now then mr flashman you command an army fifty thousand strong with heavy guns well supplied their lines of communication protected by an excellent river against you is a force of only ten thousand with light guns exhausted after a weeks forced marching short of food and fodder and damned near dying of thirst now then sir answer directly no hedging how do you lose hey come come youve just given excellent reasons for not taking a town thats lying at your mercy this should be childs play to a man with your godgiven gift of catastrophe well sir lal was gibbering at me his eyes full of terrified entreaty and i knew that if i wavered now it would be all up with him hed break and his colonels would either hang or depose him and put a decent soldier in his place the very thing that gardner had feared and that would be the end of goughs advancing force and perhaps the war and british india and no doubt of me but if i could rally this spineless wreck and think of some plan that would satisfy his colonels and at the same time bring the khalsa to destruction aye just so to gain time i asked for a map and he pawed among his gear and produced a splendid illuminated document with all the forts in red and the rivers in turquoise and little bearded wallahs with tulwars chasing each other round the margin on elephants i studied it trying to think and gripping my belt to keep my hand from trembling ive told you i didnt know much about war in those days tactically i was a novice who could bungle a section flanking movement with the worst of them but strategys another matter at its simplest its mere common sense and if the first sikh war was anything it was simple thank god also strategy seldom involves your own neck so i conned the map weighing the facts that lal had given me and applied the ageold laws that you learn in the school playground to win the khalsa need only take ferozepore and wait for gough to come and be slaughtered by overwhelming odds and big guns to lose they must be divided and the weaker part sent to meet gough with as little artillery as possible if i could contrive that the first battle was on near level terms or even odds of three to two against us id have given gough victory on a lordly dish daft he might be but he could still outmanoeuvre any sikh commander and if they didnt have their big guns along british cavalry and infantry would do the business gough believed in the bayonet give him a chance to use it and the khalsa were beat in the first battle at least after that paddy would have to take care of the war himself so i figured with the sweat cold on my skin my ankle giving me hells delight and lal mumping at my elbow dyou know that steadied me encountering a liver whiter than my own well it dont happen that often this is what i told him call your staff together generals and brigadiers no colonels tej singh as well tell em you wont attack ferozepore because its mined you dont trust the deserters tale of littlers weakness and as wazir its beneath your dignity to engage anyone but the jangi lat himself also theres a risk that if you get embroiled with littler and gough arrives early you may be caught between two fires dont let em argue simply say that ferozepore dont matter dyou see it can be wiped up when youve settled gough lay down the law highhanded very good he nodded rubbing his face and biting his knuckle he had the wind up to such a tune that i swear if id told him to march on ceylon hed have cried amen now your gorracharra are deployed already send them against gough with their horse artillery pointing out that they outnumber him two to one youll meet him somewhere between here and woodnee and if you detach some of your force to entrench at ferozeshah or sultan khan wallah youll reduce the odds dyou see gough will do the rest but tej singh he bleated he has thirty thousand infantry and the heavy guns hes to sit down here and watch littler in place of your gorracharra yes yes i know that dont take thirty thousand men he must divide his force in turn leaving only enough to watch ferozepore while the rest follow you as slowly as tej can decently arrange itll take him time to bring em down here from the river and if he sets about it in the right spirit he can waste the best part of a week i dare say but to divide the khalsa goggles he it is not good strategy surely the generals will not permit to hell with the generals youre the wazir cries i its bloody good strategy you can tell em to send your most mobile troops to meet the jangi lat when he leasts expects em and his own men are so fagged theyll be marching on their chinstraps tej singh will back you up if you prime him first but suppose suppose we beat the jangi lat he has only ten thousand and as you say they will be tired tired or not theyll tear your gorracharra to pieces if the odds aint too heavy and i doubt if goughs as weak as you think good god man hes got another twenty thousand somewhere between ludhiana and umballa he aint going to send em on furlough you know and the khalsa will be in three parts dont you see well none of those three parts is going to be a match for paddy goughs boys let me tell you i believed it too and if i wasnt altogether right it was because i lacked experience i was trusting to the old maxim that one british soldier is worth any two niggers any day its a fair rule of thumb mind you but i can look back now on my military career and count four exceptions who always gave atkins a damned good run for his money three of them were zulu john gurkha and fuzzywuzzy i wasnt to know then that the fourth one was the sikh it took me another hour of explanation and argument to convince lal that my scheme was his only hope of getting his army properly leathered it was hard sledding for he was the kind of coward whos too far gone even to clutch at straws not my kind of funk at all in the end i gave him jeendans recipe to jawaheer which youll recall was to rattle a wench to put him in fighting trim but whether lal took it or not i cant say for i caulked out in an alcove of his pavilion and didnt wake until noon by that time tej singh had arrived still fat as butter and quite as reliable to judge from the furtive enthusiasm with which he greeted me but while he was every bit as windy as lal he was a sight smarter and once the flashman plan had been expounded he hailed it as a masterpiece let my directions be followed and gough would have the khalsa looking like a frenchmans knapsack in no time was tejs view i guessed that what really commended my scheme to him was that hed be well away from the firing but he showed a good grasp of the details and had some sound notions of his own one i remember was that he would take care to keep his guarding force on the north and west of ferozepore so that littler would be able to slip away and join gough without hindrance if he wanted to that as youll see proved to be of prime importance so i reckon tej earned himself a ferozeshah medal for that alone if everyone had his due you must imagine our conference being carried on in lowered voices in lals sleeping quarters and a bonny trio we were our gallant wazir when he wasnt peeping out to make sure there were no eavesdroppers was brisking himself up with copious pinches of peshawar snuff which i suspect contained something a sight more stimulating than powdered tobacco he seemed to take heart from the confidence of tej singh who paced the apartment like napoleon at marengo heaving his guts before him and tripping over his sabre while describing to me in a gloating whisper how the khalsa would flee in disorder at the first setback i lay nursing my ankle trying to forget my own perilous situation and praying that lal singh could browbeat his staff into obedience before the effect of the snuff wore off i wonder if there was ever such a conspiracy in the history of war two generals intent on scuppering their own army confabulating sotto voce with an agent from the enemy while their commanders waited impatiently outside for the word that would send them marching to ruin you would think not but knowing human nature and the military mind id not wager on it i stayed hidden when lal and tej went out in the afternoon to announce their intentions to the divisional commanders lal was brave in silver armour with a desperate glitter in his eye half fear half hashish i would guess and they held their conference on horseback with ferozepore in view tej told me later that the wazir was in capital form lining out my plan like a drill sergeant and snarling down any hint of opposition of which there was less than id feared the fact was you see that the strategy looked sound enough but what impressed them most apparently was lals refusal to engage any commander except gough himself that argued pride and confidence and they cheered him to the echo and couldnt wait to get under way the gorracharra were riding east before dusk and tej by his own account made a great meal of sending orders to mobilise his foot and guns with gallopers riding in all directions bugles blowing and the commanderinchief finally retiring to lals tent having issued orders which with luck would take days to untangle the final scene of the comedy took place that night before i rode out lal was keen that i should make straight for gough to let him know what good boys lal and tej were being offering up the khalsa for destruction but i wasnt having that gough might be anywhere over the eastern horizon and i had no intention of hunting him through country which by now was swarming with gorracharra far better i said if i rode the couple of miles to ferozepore where littler would see that gough got the glad news in good time tej agreed and said i should go under a flag of truce ostensibly carrying the wazirs final demand to littler to surrender lal boggled at that but tej grew excited pointing out the risk if i tried to sneak into littlers lines unobserved suppose he were shot by a sentry squeaks he waving his podgy hands then the jangi iat would never know of our good will to him or the plans we have made for the destruction of these khalsa swine and our dear friend that was me would have died in vain it is not to be thought of i found myself liking tej singhs style better by the minute but will the colonels not suspect treason if they see a courier sent to littler sahib cries lal the puggle had worn off by now and he was lying exhausted on his silken bed fretting himself witless they will not even know cries tej and only think once our dear bahadur has spoken with littler sahib our credit with the sirkar is assured whatever may happen our friendship will have been made plain that was the great thing with him to stand well with simla whatever happened to the khalsa he even proposed that i carry a written message expressing lals undying devotion to the sirkar it would be so much more convincing than mere word of mouth this so horrified lal that he almost hid under the sheets a written message are you mad what if it went astray am i to sign my own deathwarrant he flung about in a passion you write it then you announce your treason over your signature why not youre commanderinchief you fat tub of dung you are wazir retorts tej this is a high political affair and what am i but a soldier he shrugged complacently you need say nothing of military matters a mere expression of friendship will suffice lal said hed see him damned first and they snarled and whined with lal weeping and tearing the bedclothes finally he gave in and penned the following remarkable note to nicolson the political i have crossed with the khalsa you know my friendship for the british tell me what to do he bilked at signing though and after more shrill bickering tej turned to me it will have to do tell nicolson sahib it is from the wazir from both of us you greasy bastard yelps lal make that clear flashman bahadur both of us and tell them in gods name that we and the bibi sahiba are their loyal friends and that we beg them to cut up these badmashes and burchast of the khalsa and free us all from this evil tell them that so it was that in the small hours a gorracharra rider with a game leg and a white flag on his lance rode out of the khalsa lines and down to ferozepore leaving behind two sikh generals one fat and frightened and tother having hysterics with a pillow over his face both conscious of duty well done i dont doubt as for me i went half a mile and sat down under a thorn tree to wait for dawn for one thing now that i was so nearly home i wanted a moment to study how best to wring credit out of my unexpected arrival with such momentous news and for another flag of truce or not i wasnt risking a bullet from a nervous sepoy in the halflight i was dogtired what with lack of sleep funk and bodily anguish but i was a happy man i can tell you and happier yet three hours later when id been admitted by a sentry of the nd whose whitechapel challenge was music to my ears and hobbled painfully into the presence of peter nicolson whod seen me off across the sutlej three months ago he didnt know me at first and then he was on his feet steadying me as i staggered artistically bravely gritting my teeth against the agony of my ankle flashman what on earth are you doin here good lord man youre all in are you wounded that dont matter gasps i subsiding on his cot small memento from a khalsa dungeon what see here peter theres no time to lose i shoved lals note at him and gave him the marrow of the business in a few brief sentences insisting that a galloper must ride to gough at once to let him know that the philistines were on the move and ready to be smitten hip and thigh i didnt add courtesy of h flashman just then that was a conclusion they could leap to presently he was a smart political nicolson he grasped the thing at once bawled for his orderly to fetch colonel van cortlandt pumped my hand in delight said he could hardly credit it but it was the finest piece of work hed ever heard id come through the khalsa in disguise been with lal and tej made em split their forces come away with their plans good god hed never heard the like etc etc jallalabad all over again thinks i contentedly and while he strode out shouting that a galloper must ride directly to littler who was out on a reconnoitre i heaved up for a dekko in the mirror over his washstand gad i looked like the last survivor of fort nowhere capital i slumped back on the cot and had to be revived with brandy when he and van cortlandt arrived full of questions i rallied gamely and described in detail what id told lal and tej to do van cortlandt whom id heard of as a former mercenary with runjeet singh and a knowing bird just nodded grimly while nicolson slapped his forehead was ever such a pair of villains sellin their own comrades the dastards my stars it passes belief no it dont says van cortlandt it fits exactly with our information that the durbar wants the khalsa destroyed and with what i know of lal singh he eyed me frowning when did you learn they were ready to sell out did they approach you in lahore this was the moment for my tired boyish grin with a little gasp as i moved my leg i could have told em the whole horrid tale and made their hair stand on end but that aint the way to do it you see offhand and laconic thats the ticket and let their imaginations do the rest i shook my head wearylike no sir i approached them just a few hours ago in their camp over there id had word two nights ago in lahore that they were ready to turn traitor who told you demands van cortlandt perhaps id better not say sir just yet i was shot if i was giving gardner credit when id done all the bloody work i reckoned id better get to lal and see what he was up to but i had a spot o trouble getting clear of lahore fact is if old goolab singh hadnt popped up in a tight corner goolab singh cries he incredulously why yes we had to cut our way out you see but he aint as spry as he was and i was rearguard so to speak and well the khalsas bulldogs laid hold of me you said somethin about a dungeon cries nicolson did i oh aye i brushed it aside and then bit my lip shifting my foot no no dont fuss peter i doubt if its broken just held me up a bit ah i clenched my teeth recovered and spoke urgently to van cortlandt but see here sir what happened in lahore dont matter or how i got to lal its what he and tej are doing now dont you see sir hugh gough must be warned he will be never fear says van cortlandt looking keen and noble flashman he hesitated nodded and gave me a quick clap on the shoulder you lie down young feller nicolson we must see littler as soon as he returns have two gallopers ready this is one message that mustnt miscarry lets see that map if goughs approaching maulah and the sikhs have reached ferozeshah they should meet about moodkee in a few hours well touch wood in the meantime young flashman well have that leg seen too good lord hes gone fast asleep there was a pause fellows often do when theyve had a bad time says nicolson anxiously god knows what hes been through i say dyou think the swine tortured him i mean he didnt say so but hes not the kind who would from all ive heard says van cortlandt sale told me that after the pipers fort business they couldnt get a word out of him about himself i mean only about his men heavens hes just a boy broadfoot says hes the bravest man hes ever met says nicolson reverently there you are then come on lets find littler you see what i mean it would be all over camp within the hour and the army soon after good old flashys done it again and this time if i says it myself didnt i deserve their golden opinions even if i had been passing wind the whole way i felt quite virtuous and put on a game show trying to struggle to my feet and having to be restrained when they returned presently with littler a wiry old piece of teak who looked as though hed swallowed the poker he was very trim in spotless overalls chin thrust out and hands behind his back as he ran a brisk eye over me more compliments thinks i until he spoke in a cold level voice let me understand this you say that twenty thousand sikh cavalry are moving to attack the commanderinchief and this is at your prompting i see he took a deliberate breath through his thin nose and ive seen kinder eyes on a cobra you a junior political officer took it upon yourself to direct the course of the war you did not think fit although you knew these two traitors were bent on courting defeat to send or bring word to the nearest general officer myself so that their actions might be directed by someone of less limited military experience he paused his mouth like a rattrap well sir i dont know what i thought only what i said once id recovered from the shock of the icy sonofabitchs sarcasm it was so unexpected that i could only blurt out there wasnt time sir lal singh was desperate if i hadnt told him something god knows what hed have done nicolson was standing mum van cortlandt was frowning i i acted as i thought best sir i could have burst into tears quite so it sounded like a left and right with a sabre and from your vast political experience you are confident that the wazirs desperation was genuine and that he has indeed acted on your ingenious instructions he could not have been deceiving you of course and perhaps making quite other dispositions of his army with respect sir put in van cortlandt im quite sure thank you colonel van cortlandt i recognise your concern for a fellow political officer your certainty however is by the way i am concerned with mr flashmans christ yes im sure you will not blaspheme in my presence sir the steely voice didnt rise even a fraction deliberately he went on well we must hope that you are right must we not we must resign ourselves to the fact that the fate of the army rests on the strategic acumen of one selfsufficient subaltern distinguished in his way no doubt he gave me one last withering glance unfortunately that distinction has not been gained in command of any formation larger than a troop of cavalry i lost my head and my temper with it i cant explain it for im the last man to defy authority it may have been the sneering voice and supercilious eye or the contrast with the decency of van cortlandt and nicolson or all the fear and pain and weariness of weeks boiling up or the sheer injustice when for once id done my best and my duty and this was the thanks i got well it was the wrong side of enough and i heaved half off the bed almost weeping with rage and indignation damnation i bawled very well sir what should i have done then it aint too late you know tell me what youd have done and ill ride back to lal singh this very minute hes still cowering in bed ill be bound not two bloody miles away hell be glad to change his orders if he knows they come from you sir i knew even in my childish fury that there wasnt a chance hed take me at my word or id have confined myself to cussing you may be sure nicolson had me by the arm begging me to be calm and van cortlandt was muttering excuses on my behalf littler didnt turn a hair he waited until nicolson had settled me then i doubt if that would be prudent says he quietly no we can only wait upon events whether our messengers find sir hugh or not he will still face the battle which you mr flashman have made inevitable he moved forward to look at me and his face was like flint if all goes well he and his army will very properly receive the credit if on the other hand he is defeated then you sir he inclined his head towards me will bear the blame alone you will certainly be broken probably imprisoned possibly even shot he paused do not misunderstand me mr flashman the questions i have asked you are only those that will be put to you by the prosecution at your courtmartial a proceeding at which let me assure you i shall be the first witness on your behalf to testify that in my judgment you have done your duty with exemplary courage and resource and in the highest traditions of the service unusual chap littler and not only because he came from cheshire which not many people do in my experience i cant recall a man who so scared the innards out of me and yet was so reassuring all in one go for he was right you know i had done the proper thing and done it well and much good itd do me whatever befell if gough was wiped up theyd need a scapegoat and who so handy as one of those cocky politicals whom the rest of the army detested contrariwise if the khalsa was beat the last thing john bull would want to hear was that it had been managed by a dirty deal with two treacherous sikh generals wheres the glory to britannias arms in that so it would be kept quiet as it has been to this very day you may wonder then how i found any reassurance in littlers tirade well the thought of having that acid little iceberg in my corner if it came to a courtmartial was decidedly comforting ive prosecuted myself and god be thanked i never ran into a defence witness like him and broadfoot would stand by me and van cortlandt and my afghan reputation must tell in my favour i got a whiff of that later in the day when i was nursing my leg and chewing my nails on the verandah after tiffen and heard littlers three brigadiers talking behind the chick nicolson must have been spreading the tale of my exploits and they were full of it sikhs are doin what flashman told em off his own bat ill be damned no end to the cheek o these politicals not to flashmans anyway ask any woman in simla oh in the skirt line is he odd that wifes a regular stunner seen her blonde gel blue eyes she does sound a stunner is she tiptop altogether i say ladys name not in the mess havent mentioned her name just that shes a stunner money too im told scamps like flashman always seem to get both noticed that popular chap of course not with cardigan kicked him out o the cherrypickers somethin in the lads favour what for dont recall feller like that might be anythin true well god help him if gough gets bowled out god will youll see they cant break the man who saved jallalabad when did cardigan do that didnt flashman did in you were in tenasserim was i ah yes i recollect now he held some fort or other oh they cant touch him then dam well think not public wouldnt stand for it not if his wifes a stunner all of which was heartening though i didnt care to hear elspeth bandied about quite so freely but it was still a long day waiting in the baking heat of the ferozepore lines with the nd sweating in their red coats in the entrenchments and the bluejacketed sepoy gunners lying in the shade of their pieces while only two miles away the sun twinkled on the arms of tej singhs mighty host littler and his staff spent all day in the saddle riding out southeast to scan the hazy distance gough was somewhere out yonder marching to meet the gorracharra that lal singh had dispatched against him if he had dispatched them suppose he hadnt suppose hed ignored my plan or bungled it suppose littlers fear was wellfounded and lal had been humbugging me but no that couldnt be the fellow had been almost out of his wits he must be advancing to meet gough but would he mind what id said about detaching regiments along the way so as to even the odds suppose oh suppose any number of things all i could do was wait keeping out of littlers way limping gamely around the mess aware of the eyes that glanced and looked away it was about four and the sun was starting to dip when we heard the first rumble to eastward and huthwaite the gunner colonel stood stockstill on the verandah mouth open listening and then cries those are big fellows s sikh for certain how far asks someone cant tell twenty miles at least might be thirty thats moodkee then quiet cant you huthwaite had his eyes closed those are howitzers thats gough and it was white fighting coat and all with an exhausted army at his heels illfed illwatered and in no kind of order outgunned but not thank god outnumbered and going for his enemy in the only style he knew bullatagate and damn the consequences we knew nothing of that at the time we could only stand on the verandah with the moths clustering round the lamps listening to the distant cannonade which went on hour after hour long after sunset when we could even see the flashes reflected on the distant night sky not until one of harriotts light cavalry scouts came back choked with dust and excitement did we have any notion of what was happening in that astonishing action the first in the great sikh war midnight moodkee when i sport my tin on dress occasions i have clasps lor a score of engagements from cabul to khedive sudan but not for that one the battle i started i dont mind that i wasnt there praise the lord and it wasnt a famous victory for anyone but i like to think i prevented it from being a catastrophe goughs army which a wellmanaged khalsa should have smothered by sheer weight lived to fight another day because id squared the odds for them and because there are no better horse soldiers in the world than the light brigade between them hardinge and gough came damned near to making a hash of it one by his oldwife caution tother by his donnybrook recklessness thanks to hardinge we were illprepared for war with regiments held back from the front no proper supply stations on their line of march not even a field hospital ready to move and paddy having to drive ahead with his fighting force forcedmarching thirty miles a day and devil take the transport and auxiliaries straggling behind him all the way to umballa meanwhile hardinge had decided to stop being governorgeneral and become a soldier again he went careering off to ludhiana and brought the garrison down to join the march so that when they reached moodkee they had about twelve thousand men pretty fagged out after a days march and there were lals gorracharra waiting for them ten thousand strong and a couple of thousand infantry now it was paddys turn the sikhs had stationed their foot and guns in jungle and gough instead of waiting for them to come on must fly at their throats in case they escaped him that was all he knew the artillery duelled away kicking up a deuce of a dust hardinges son told me later that it was like fighting in london fog and the fact is that no two accounts of the battle agree because no one could see a damned thing for most of the time certainly the gorracharra were in such numbers that they threatened to envelop us but our own cavalry took em in flank both sides and broke them the rd lights were riding in among the sikh guns and infantry but when paddy launched a frontal infantry assault they ran into a great storm of grape and it was touch and go for a while for when they reached the jungle the sikh guns were still doing great execution and there was horrid scrimmaging among the trees it was dark by now and fellows were firing on their comrades some of our sepoy regiments were absolutely blazing into the air everything was confusion on both sides and then the sikhs withdrew leaving seventeen guns behind them we lost over dead and three times as many wounded the sikhs losses im told were greater but nobody knows you might call it a draw in our favour but it settled a few things wed taken the ground and the guns so the khalsa could be beaten at a cost for theyd fought like tigers among the trees and took no prisoners our sepoys had lost some of their fear of the sikhs and our cavalry british and indian had seen the backs of the gorracharra if gough could follow up quickly enough and dispose of the rest of lals force which was concentrated on ferozeshah twelve miles away before tejs host came to reinforce it wed be in a fair way to settling the whole business but if the khalsa reunited well that would be another story some of this was clear as early as next morning but by then i had other concerns one of the gallopers whom littler had sent with news of my arrangement with lal and tej had reached gough at the height of the battle it had been an astonishing sight with twenty thousand horse foot and guns tearing at each other in the starlight and the old madman himself raging because he couldnt take part personally in the rd lights charge on the sikh flank its damnable so it is heres me an theres them an i might as well be in me bed away ye go mickey an give em one for me hurroo boys the galloper had wisely decided that thered be no talking sense to him for a while and it wasnt until near midnight when the fighting was done that the news had been broken to gough and hardinge with broadfoot in tow as they left the field the galloper said it was like a strange dream a huge golden moon shining on the scrubby plain and jungle the sikh guns with their dead crews heaped around them the mutilated corpses of our light dragoons and indian lancers marking the path of their charge through the heart of the khalsa position the great confused masses of men and horses and camels scattered dead and dying on the plain the wailing chorus of the wounded and the shouts of our people as they sought their fellows among the fallen the mound of bodies piled up like a cairn where harry smith had ridden ahead on his arab jim crow planted the queens owns colour at the head of a khalsa column and roared to our fellows to come and get it which they had gough and hardinge standing a little apart talking quietly in the moonlight and paddy finally giving the galloper his reply and adding the words which brought my heart into my mouth my respects to sir john littler an tell him hell be hearin from me presently an hell oblige me by sendin that young flashman to me as soon as he likes i want a word with that one it wasnt a hard word though indeed the first thing he said when i limped into his presence in the big messtent at moodkee was whats amiss with your leg boy sit ye down an baxull get ye a glass of beer thirsty ridin these days first though i must be presented to hardinge who was with him at dinner a plainfaced tightmouthed sobersides with the empty cuff of his missing left hand tucked into his coat i disliked him on sight and it was mutual he gave me a frosty nod but broadfoot was there with a great grin and a hearty handclasp that was welcome i can tell you the thirtymile ride from ferozepore skirting south in case of gorracharra scouts and with only six nc sowars for escort had given me the blue devils and done my game ankle no good at all and on reaching moodkee id had a most horrid shock wed come in at sunset from the south and so saw nothing of the battlefield but they were burying the dead in scores and id chanced to glance aside through an open tentfly and there wrapped in a cloak was the body of old bob sale it quite undid me hed been such a hearty kind old soul i could see him mopping the noble tears from his red cheeks at my bedside in jallalabad or grinning from his tablehead at florentias wilder flights or thumping his knee therell be no retreat from lahore what now they were blowing retreat over him old fighting bob the grapeshot had got him when they stormed the jungle the quartermastergeneral charging with the infantry well thank god i wouldnt have to break the news to her but poor old bob was soon forgotten in the presence of the gg and the army chief for now i must tell my tale again to that distinguished audience thackwell the cavalry boss was there and hardinges son charlie and young gough paddys nephew but only three faces counted hardinge cold and grave his finger laid along his cheek gough leaning forward the brown handsome old face alight with interest tugging his white moustache and broadfoot all red whiskers and bottle glasses watching them to see how they took it like a master while his prize boy construes it sounded well and i told it straight with no falsemodest tricks which i knew would be wasted here bogus message goolab singh maka khan gridiron escape gardners intervention my meeting with lal and tej when id done there was a silence into which george stepped laying down the law may i say at once excellency that i support all mr flashmans actions unreservedly they are precisely such as i should have wished him to take hear hear says gough and tapped the table good lad hardinge didnt care for it i guessed that like littler he thought id taken a heap too much on myself but unlike littler he wasnt prepared to admit that id been right fortunately no harm appears to have been done says he coldly however the less said of this the better i think you will agree major broadfoot that any publication of the sikhs treachery might have the gravest consequences without waiting for georges reply he went on to me and i would not wish your ordeal at the hands of the enemy to be noised abroad it was a dreadful thing he might have been discussing the weather and i congratulate you on your deliverance but if it were to become known it must have an inflammatory effect and that could serve no good end never mind the inflammatory effect it had had on my end even in the middle of a war he was fretting about our harmonious relations with the punjab when it was all over and flashys scorched arse mustnt be allowed to mar the prospect i hadnt liked henry hardinge before but now i loathed him so i agreed at once like a good little toady and gough whod been fidgeting impatiently got a word in tell me this my boy an if youre proved wrong ill not hold it against ye this tej singh now ye know the man can we rely on him to do his worst by his own side yes sir says i i believe so hed sit in front of ferozepore forever but his officers may force his hand for him i think sir hugh drawls hardinge that it would be wiser to weigh the facts we know rather than mr flashmans opinion gough frowned at the tone but nodded no doubt sorr hinry but whatever it must be ferozeshah and as soon as maybe i was dismissed after that but not before gough had insisted on drinking my health hardinge barely lifted his glass from the table the hell with him i was too fagged to care and ready to sleep for a year but did i get the chance id barely pulled my boots off and was soaking my extremity in cold water when my tent was invaded by broadfoot bearing a bottle and full of bounce and congratulations which included himself for being so dam clever in sending me to lahore in the first place i said hardinge didnt seem to think so and he snorted and said hardinge was an ass and a puffedup snob who had no use for politicals but never mind that i must tell him all about lahore every word and down he plumped on my charpoy spectacles agleam to hear it well you know it all and by midnight so did he bar the jolly parts with jeendan and mangla which i had too much delicacy to mention i made much of my friendship with little dalip spoke in admiring terms of gardner and put in a word for jassa dyou know hed been aware of that remarkable rascals identity all along but had kept it from me on principle when id finished he rubbed his hands with satisfaction all this will be of the greatest value what matters of course is that you have gained the confidence of the young maharaja and his mother he glanced sharply at me and i met his eye with boyish innocence at which he went pink and polished his glasses yes and goolab singh also those three will be the vital figures when all this is over yes he went off into one of his celtic trances for a moment and then roused himself flashy im going to ask you to do a hard thing you wont like it but it must be done dye see oh jesus thinks i what now he wants me to go to burma or dye my hair green or kidnap the king of afghanistan well the blazes with it ive run my mile and be damned to him so of course i asked him eagerly what it might be and he glanced at my injured ankle which id laid still pink and puffy on a wet towel still painful i see but it didnt stop ye riding thirty miles today and if theres a cavalry charge against the khalsa tomorrow youll be in it if it kills you wont you i should dam well hope so cries i with my heart in my boots at the mere thought and he shook his head in stern admiration i knew it no sooner out o the frying pan than youre itching to be at the fire ye were just the same on the kabul retreat he clapped me on the shoulder well im sorry my boy its not to be tomorrow i dont want you to be able to walk a step let alone back a horse dye follow i didnt but i smelled something damned fishy its this way says he earnestly last night we fought the sternest action i ever saw these sikhs are the starkest bravest fellows on earth worth two ghazis every man of em i killed four myself says he solemnly and i tell ye flashy they died hard they did that he paused frowning have you ever noticed how soft a mans head is aye well what we did last night well be doing again presently gough must destroy lals half of the khalsa at ferozeshah and unless im mistaken itll be the bloodiest day that ever was seen in india he wagged a finger it may well decide this war yes yes cries i all eagerness feeling ready to puke but whats all this gammon about me not being able to walk at all costs says he impressively you must be kept out of the fighting one reason is that the credit and confidence youve achieved with the folk wholl be ruling the punjab under our thumb next year is far too valuable to he risked i wont allow it so when gough asks for you as a galloper tomorrow which i know he will well he cant have you but i dont choose to tell him why because he has no more political sense than the ministers cat and wouldnt understand so we must hoodwink him and the rest of the army and your game leg will serve our turn he laid a hand on my shoulder owling at me its not a nice thing but its for the good o the service i know its asking a deal from you of all men that you stand back when the rest of us fall in but what dye say old fellow you can picture my emotion thats the beauty of a heroic reputation but you must know how to live up to it i assumed the right expression of pained bewildered indignation and put a catch into my voice george says i as though hed struck the queen youre asking me to shirk oh yes you are though well it wont do see here ive done your job in lahore and all dont i deserve the chance to be a soldier again besides cries i in a fine passion i owe those bastards something and you expect me to hang back he looked manly compassionate i said it was a hard thing hard dammit its its the wrong side of enough no george i wont have it what to sham sick humbug dear old paddy of all the cowardly notions i paused red in the face fearful of coming it too strong in case he relented i changed tack why am i so confounded precious anyway when the wars over itll be all one who plays politics in lahore i said that was one reason he cut in theres another i need you back in lahore now or as soon as may be while its all in the balance i must have someone near the seat of power and youre the man its the part i designed for you from the first remember but your return must be a secret known only to you me and hardinge well if you sham sick no one will wonder why youre being kept out of harms way in the meantime he grinned complacently oh i ken im a devious crater i need tae be so youll go on a crutch the morn and let your beard grow when you go north again itll be as badoo the badmash well ye can hardly ask admission to lahore fort as mr flashman can ye fortunately perhaps i was speechless i just stared at the redwhiskered brute and he took silence for consent when in truth it didnt even signify comprehension the whole thing was too monstrous for words and while i sat openmouthed he laughed and clapped me on the back that puts things in a different light does it not youll be shirking your way into the lions den you see so you neednt envy the rest of us our wee fight at ferozeshah he stood up ill speak to hardinge now and in a day or two ill give you full particulars of what youll be doing when you get to lahore until then take care of that ankle eh sleep well badoo he winked heavily pulling back the tentfly and paused here i say harry smith told me a good one today why is a soldier of the khalsa like a beggar can you tell eh give it up i give up george and by god i meant it because hes a sikh in arms cries he you twig aseekin alms he guffawed not bad what goodnight old chap and he went off chortling a sikh in arms they were the last words i ever heard him speak youll have difficulty finding ferozeshah in the atlas nowadays its a scrubby little hamlet about halfway between ferozepore and moodkee but in its way its a greater place than delhi or calcutta or bombay for its where the fate of india was settled appropriately by treachery folly and idiot courage beyond belief and most of all by blind luck it was where lal singh on my advice had left half his force when he marched to meet gough and it was where his battered advance guard retired after moodkee so there he was now twenty thousand strong with a hundred splendid guns all nicely entrenched and snug as bugs and gough must attack him at once for who could tell when tej singh loafing before ferozepore a mere dozen miles away would be forced by his colonels to do the sensible thing and join lal thereby facing paddy with a khalsa of over fifty thousand outnumbering us more than three to one so it was bundle and go at moodkee next day with the last of the dead being shovelled under the native infantry deploying for a night march the th marching in from the umballa track their red coats as yellow as their facings with the rolling dust and the band thumping out royal windsor the elephant teams squealing as they hauled up the heavy pieces camels braying in the lines fellows shouting and waving papers in every tent opening the munition carts rolling through and gough in his shirtsleeves at an openair table with his staff scampering round him and the discerning eye would also have noted a stalwart figure propped up on a charpoy with his leg swathed to the knee in an enormous bandage cursing the luck which kept him out of the fun i say cust cries abbott have you seen flashys got the gout has to have beef tea and sal volatile and kameela drenches twice a day comes of boozin with maharanis at lahore i dare say says cust while the rest of us poor politicals have to work for a living when did politicals ever work says hore you stay where you are flashy and keep out of the sun mind if the goin gets sticky well haul you up to wave your crutch at the sikhs wait till im walking and ill wave more than a crutch cries i you fellows think youre clever ill be ahead of you all yet youll see at which they all made game of me and said theyd leave a few sikh wounded for me to cut up cheery stuff you see broadfoot himself had pronounced me hors de combat and i got a deal of sympathy among all the chaff but gough insisted that i should be brought along to ferozeshah anyway to deal with casualty returns of which there were likely to be aplenty if he cant ride he can still write says paddy besides if i know the boy hell be in at the death before alls done live in hope old paddy thinks i id expected to be left behind at moodkee with the wounded but at least id be well out of the way at advance headquarters while the rest of them got on with the serious work broadfoot and his afghans were out all day scouting the sikh position so i never saw him i went hot and cold by turns when i thought of the awful prospect hed unfolded to me the previous night sneaking back to lahore in disguise no doubt to carry treasonable messages to jeendan and keep an eye on her and her court of snakes how the devil was it to be done and why but sufficient unto the day id find out soon enough we marched after a broiling day of confused preparation in the freezing small hours the army in column of route and your humble obedient borne in a dooli by minions which caused much hilarity among the staffwallopers who kept stopping by to ask if i needed any gruel or a stone pig to warm my toes i responded with bluff repartee and noticed that as the march progressed the comedians fell silent we came within earshot of the sikh drums soon after dawn and by nine were deploying within sight of ferozeshah i bade my doolibearers set me down in a little grove not far from the headquarters group to be out of the heat with interesting results as youll see for while most of what i tell you of that momentous day is hearsay one vital incident was played out under my nose alone this is what happened the scouts had reported that the place was heavily entrenched on all sides in a rough mile square about the village with the sikhs heavy guns among the mounds and ditches that enclosed it on three sides there were jungly patches which would hinder our attack but on the eastern side facing us it was flat maidan and gough honest man could see only one way open up with the guns and sweep straight in trusting to the bayonets of his twelve thousand to do the trick against twenty thousand khalsa during the night littler had slipped out of ferozepore with almost his whole seven thousand leaving tej guarding an empty town paddys notion may have been to drive the sikhs out of ferozeshah and into littlers path but i aint sure at all events i was reclining in my dooli in the shade discussing beef and hardtack and coughing contentedly over my cheroot admiring the view of our army deployed across my front and feeling patriotic when there was a commotion fifty yards off where the hq staff were at breakfast hardinge trying to hog the marmalade again thinks i but when i peeped out here was the man himself striding towards my grove looking stern and five yards behind paddy gough with his white coat flapping and bright murder in his eye hardinge stops just inside the grove and says well sir hugh well indeed sorr hinry cries paddy irish with fury i tell ye again youre lookin at the foinest victory that ever was won in india bigad an and i tell you sir hugh it is not to be thought of why you are outnumbered two to one in men and even more in cannon and they are in cover sir and dont i know that then i tell ye still ill put ferozeshah in your hand by noon dear man our infantry arent portuguese that was a dig at hardinge whod served with the portugoosers in the peninsula his tone was freezing as he replied i cannot entertain it you must wait for littler to come up an if i wait that long suren the rabbitsll be runnin through ferozeshah tis the shortest day o the year man and will ye tell me plain now who commands this army you do snaps hardinge and did ye not offer me your services as a soldier in whutsoivver capacity now ye did and i accepted gratefully but it seems ye wont take my orders in the field sir i shall obey you implicitly but as governorgeneral i shall if necessary exert my civil authority over the commanderinchief and i will not hazard the army in such a risk as this oh my dear sir hugh he went on trying to smooth things but paddy wasnt at home in short son hinry yere questionin my military judgment as to that sir hugh i have been a soldier as long as you i know it i know also ye havent smelt powder since waterloo an all the staff college lectures in creation dont make a battlefield general so now hardinge was a staff college man paddy you may suspect was not this is unseemly sir says hardinge our opinions differ as governorgeneral i positively forbid an attack until you are supported by sir john littler that is my last word sir and this is mine son but ill be havin another one later cries paddy if we come adrift through this with our fellows shootin each other in the dark as they did at moodkee well son i wont hold myself responsible unless i am thank you sir hugh thank you son hinry and off they stumped after a conference unique i believe in military history as to which was right god knows on the one hand hardinge had to think of all india and the odds scared him against that paddy was the fighting soldier daft as a brush granted but he knew men and ground and the smell of victory or defeat heads or tails if you ask me so hardinge had his way and the army set off again southwest to meet littler crossing the sikh front with our flank wide as a barn door if theyd care to come out and fall on us they didnt thanks to lal singh who refused to budge while his staff tore their hair at the missed chance littler hove in view at shukoor and our force turned north again now eighteen thousand strong and stormed ferozeshah i didnt see the battle since i was installed in a hut at misreewallah more than a mile away surrounded by clerks and runners and sipping grog while i waited for the butchers bill so i shant elaborate the bare facts you can read the full horror in the official accounts if youre curious i heard it though and saw the results that was enough for me it was shockingly botched on both sides gough had to launch his force in frontal assault on the south and west entrenchments which were the strongest just as the sun was westering our fellows were caught in a hail of grape and musketry with mines going off under them but they stormed in with the bayonet and drove the sikhs from their camp and the village beyond just on dusk the sikhs magazine exploded and soon there were fires everywhere and it was slaughter all the way but there was such confusion in the dark with regiments going astray and harry smith as usual miles ahead of the rest that gough decided to reform and the retire was sounded our fellows with ferozeshah in their hands came out again and the sikhs walked back in resuming the entrenchments wed taken at such fearful cost and they wonder why folk go to sea so we were back where we began in the freezing night with the khalsa sharpshooters hammering our bivouacs and wells oh aye and lumley the adjutantgeneral went off his rocker and ran about telling everyone we must retire on ferozepore luckily no one minded him my memories of that night are a mixture of confused pictures ferozeshah two miles away like a vision of hell a sea of flames under red clouds with explosions everywhere men lurching out of the dark carrying wounded comrades the long dark mass of our bivouacs on the open ground and the unceasing screams and groans of the wounded all night long bloody hands thrusting bloody papers before me under the stormlantern littler had lost men in only ten minutes i remember the crash of our artillery at the sikh sharpshooters hardinge his hat gone and his coat bloody calling charles where are the ninth i must visit all my old peninsulars see if they have a lady in barracks what a corporal of the nd his trousers soaked in blood sitting at my hut door with his hussif open carefully stitching a tear in the white cover of his hat the sudden blare of bugles and rattle of drums sounding the alarm as a regiment was mustered to make a sortie against a sikh gun emplacement a light dragoon face black with powder and a skinny little bhisti buckets in their hands and the dragoon crying whod make a dash with them for the well cos bill must have water and the chaggles were dry the little german prince whod played billiards while i romped mrs madison putting in his head to ask ever so politely if dr hoffmeister of whom id never heard was on my lists he wasnt but he was dead anyway and a hoarse voice singing softly in the dark wrap me up in my tarpaulin jacket jacket an say a poor buffer lies low lies low an six stalwart lancers shall carry me carry me with steps that are mournful an slow then send for six brandies an soda soda an set em up all in a row a row i hobbled across to headquarters on my unnecessary crutch to sniff the wind it was a big bare basha with fellows curled up asleep on the earth and at the far end gough and hardinge with a map across their knees and an aide holding a light by the door baxu the butler and young charlie hardinge were packing a valise i asked what was to do off to moodkee says charlie currie must be ready to burn his papers what is it all up then touch an go anyway i say flashy have you seen the cabbagewalloper prince waldemar ive to take him out of it confound him blasted civilians says charlie who was one himself secretarying papa seem to think wars a sightseein tour baxu handed him a dress sword and charlie chuckled i say mustnt forget that baxu nay sahib wellesley sahib would be damdispleased charlie tucked it under his coat wouldnt mind havin its owner walk in this minute though whos that then i asked boney wellington gave it to the guvnor after waterloo cant let the khalsa get hold of napoleons sidearm can we i didnt care for this when the swells start sending their valuables down the road god help the rest of us i asked abbott who was smoking by the door with his arm in a bloody sling what was afoot were goin in again at dawn nothin else for it with only half a days fodder for us an the guns its ferozeshah or six feet under some asses were talkin about terms or cuttin out for ferozepore but the gg an paddy gave em the rightabout he lowered his voice mind you i dont know if we can stand another gruellin like today hows the pension parade he meant our casualties at a guess maybe one in ten could be worse but there aint a whole man on the staff says he oh i say did you hear georgie broadfoots dead i didnt take it in at all i heard the words but they meant nothing at first and i just stood staring at him while he went on im sorry he was a chum o yours wasnt he i was with him you see the damnedest thing id been hit he touched his sling an thought i was gone when old georgie rides up shouting get up sandy cant go to sleep you know so up i jumped an then georgie tumbled out of his saddle shot in the leg but he popped straight up again an says to me there you are you see come on it was fairly rainin grape from the south entrenchment an a second later he went down again so i yelled come on george sleepyhead yourself he fumbled inside his shirt and so he is now for keeps the dear old chap you want these here take em they were georges spectacles with one lens broken i took them not believing it seeing sale dead had been bad enough but broadfoot the great red giant always busy always scheming nothing could kill him surely no hed walk in presently damning someones eyes mine like enough for no reason i took a look through the remaining glass and couldnt see a thing he must have been blind as a bat without them and then it dawned on me that if he was dead thered be no one to send me to lahore again and no need whatever ploy hed had in mind would have died with him for even hardinge wouldnt know the ins and outs of it so i was clear and relief was flooding through me making me tremble and i choked between tears and laughter here dont take on cries abbott catching my wrist never fret flashy georgell be paid for youll see why if he aint hell haunt us the old ruffian giglamps an all were bound to take ferozeshah and they did a second time they went in briton and sepoy in ragged red lines under the lifting mist of dawn with the horse guns thundering ahead of them and the khalsa trenches bright with flame the sikh gunners fairly battered the advancing regiments and picked off our ammunition wagons so that our ranks seemed to be moving through pillars of fiery cloud with the white trails of our congreves piercing the black smoke its the last madness thinks i watching awestruck from the rear for theyd no right to be on their feet even let alone marching into that tempest of metal exhausted halfstarved frozen stiff and barely a swallow of water among them with hardinge riding ahead his empty sleeve tucked into his belt telling his aides hed seen nothing like it since the peninsula and gough leading the right spreading the tails of his white coat to be the better seen then they had vanished into the smoke the scarecrow lines and the tattered standards and the twinkling cavalry sabres and i thanked god i was here and not there as i led the rocketeers in three cheers for our gallant comrades before being borne back into the shade to a wellearned breakfast of bread and brandy being new to the business i halfexpected to see em back shortly in bloody rout but beyond our view they were storming the defences again and going through ferozeshah like an iron fist and by noon there wasnt a live punjabi in the position and wed taken seventy guns dont ask me how they say some of the khalsa infantry cut stick in the night and the rest were all at sea because lal singh and his cronies had fled with the akalis howling for his blood but that dont explain it not to me they still werent outnumbered and had the defensive advantage and fought their guns to the finish so how did we beat em i dont know i wasnt there but then i still dont understand the alma and balaclava and cawnpore and i was in the thick of them god help me and no fault of mine i aint one of your by jingoes and i wont swear that the british soldier is braver than any other or even as charley gordon said that hes brave for a little while longer but i will swear that theres no soldier on earth who believes so strongly in the courage of the men alongside him and thats worth an extra division any day provided youre not standing alongside me that is all morning the wounded kept coming back but fewer by far than yesterday and now they were jubilant twice theyd beaten the khalsa against the odds and there wouldnt be a third ferozeshah not with lals forces in flight for the sutlej and our cavalry scouting their retreat tik hai johnnie roars a sergeant of the th limping down with a naik of native infantry they had two sound legs between them and used their muskets as crutches oos got a tot o rum for my johnnie then e may ave fired wide at moodkee but you earned yer chapattis today didnt yer ye little black bugger and everyone roared and cheered and helped them along the towheaded redfaced ruffian and the sleek brown bengali both of them grinning with the same wild light in their eyes thats victory it was in all their eyes even those of a pale young cornet of the rd lights with his arm off at the elbow raving as they carried him past at the run and of a private with a tulwar gash in his cheek spitting blood at every word as he told me how gough was entrenched in the sikhs position in case of counterattack but there was no fear of that we done for em sir cries he and his yellow facings were as red as his coat with his own gore they wont stop runnin till they gets to laore i reckon you should ear em cheer ole daddy gough aint e the boy though he peered at me holding a grimy cloth to his wound ere you orl right sir fair done in you looks if youll scuse my sayin so it was true i who hadnt been near the fight and had been right as rain was all at once ready to keel over where i sat and it wasnt the heat or the excitement or the sight of his teeth showing through his cheek or the screaming from the hospital basha or the stench of stale blood and acrid smoke from the battle or the dull ache in my ankle none of that i believe it was the knowledge that at last it was all over and i could give way to the numbing fatigue that had been growing through one of the worst weeks of my life id had one nights sleep out of eight counting from the first which id spend galloping mangla then thered been my khalsa frolic the sutlej crossing the ride from lal and tej to ferozepore the vigil as we listened to distant moodkee uneasy slumber after broadfoot had given me his bad news the freezing march to misreewallah and finally the first night of ferozeshah oh i was luckier than many but i was beat all to nothing and now it was past and i was safe and could lurch from my stool and fall facedown on the charpoy dead to the world now when im dogtired with shock i have nightmares worthy of cheese and lobster but this one laid it over them all for i fell slowly through the charpoy into a bath of warm water and when i rolled over i was staring up at a ceiling painting of gough and hardinge and broadfoot all figged out like persian princes having dinner with mrs madison who tilted her glass and poured oil all over me which made me so slippery that i couldnt hope to transfer the whole soochet legacy coin by coin from my navel to queen ranavalonas as she pinned me down on a redhot billiardtable then she began to pummel and shake me and i knew she was trying to make me get up because gough wanted me and when i said i couldnt because of my ankle the late lamented dr arnold wearing a great tartan puggaree came by on an elephant crying that he would take me for the chief needed a greek translation of crotchet castle instanter and if i didnt take it to tej singh elspeth would commit suttee then i was following him floating across a great dusty plain and the smell of burning was everywhere and filthy ash was falling like snow and there were terrible bearded faces of dead men smeared with blood and corpses all about us with ghastly wounds from which their entrails spilled out on earth that was sodden crimson and there were great cannon lying on their sides or tumbled into pits and everywhere the charred wreckage of tents and carts and huts some of them still in flames there was a mighty tumult too a great cannonading and the shriek and crash of shot striking home the rattle of musketry and bugles blowing there were voices yelling on all sides in a great confusion of orders by sections right walkmarch trot and battalion halt into line left turn and troop seven left incline forward but arnold wouldnt stop though i shouted to him and i couldnt see where the troops were for the horse i was riding was going too fast and the sun was in my eyes i raised my left hand to shield them but the suns rays burned more fiercely than ever causing me such pain that i cried out for it was burning a hole in my palm and i clutched at arnold with my other hand and suddenly he was mad charley west gripping me round the shoulders and yelling to me to hold on and my left hand was pumping blood from a ragged hole near the thumb causing excruciating agony and all hell was loose around me that was the moment when i realised that i wasnt dreaming an eminent medico has since explained that exhaustion and strain induced a trancelike state when i sank down on the charpoy and that while my nightmares turned to reality i didnt come to properly until i was wounded in the hand which is the most immediately painful place in the whole body and i should know since ive been hit in most others in between mad charley had wakened me helped me to mount and wed ridden at speed through the carnage of the recent battle to goughs position beyond ferozeshah village and all id taken in were those disjointed pictures ive just described the sawbones had an impressive medical name for it but i doubt if theres one for the sensation i felt as i gripped my wounded hand to crush the pain away and took in the scene about me directly before me were two troops of native horse artillery firing as fast as they could load the little brown gunners springing aside to avoid the recoil the crash of the salvoes staggering my horse by its very violence to my left was a ragged square of british infantry the th for i saw the penny badge on their shakos and beyond them others sepoy and british kneeling and standing with the reserve ranks behind to my right it was the same more squares inclined back at a slight angle with their colours in the centre like the pictures of waterloo red squares with the dust boiling round them and shot screaming overhead or ploughing through with a clap like thunder men were falling sometimes singly sometimes hurtled aside as a shot tore into the ranks i saw a great swathe six files wide cut by grape at the corner of the ths square and the air filled with red spray before me a horse gun suddenly stood up on end its muzzle split like a stalk of celery and then it crashed down in a hellish tangle of fallen men and stricken horses it was as though a gale of iron rain was sweeping the ranks coming god knew whence for the dust and smoke enveloped us and mad charley was hauling at my bridle urging me through it theres never a time when pain and fear dont matter but sometimes shock is so bewildering that you dont think of them one such time is when you wake up to find that good artillery has got your range and is pounding you to pieces theres nothing to be done no time even to hope you wont be hit and you cant hurl yourself to the ground and lie there squealing not when you find youre alongside paddy gough himself and hes pulling off his bandana and telling you to wrap it round your fin and pay attention put your finger on the knot man there now look ahead and take close note of what ye see he yanked the bandage tight and pointed and through tears of anguish and terror i looked beyond the clouds of settling dust a bare halfmile away the plain was alive with horsemen the artillery teams whod been shelling us light camel swivels and heavier field pieces were wheeling away through the advancing ranks of a great tide of cavalry cantering towards us knee to knee it must have been five hundred yards from wing to wing with lancer regiments on the flanks and in the centre the heavy squadrons in tunics of white and red tulwars at the shoulder the low sun gleaming on polished helms from which stiff plumes stood up like scarlet combs and only when i remembered those same plumes at maian mir did i realise the full horror of what i was seeing these were sikh line cavalry and dazed and barely halfawake as i was i knew that could mean only one thing even if it was impossible we were facing the army of tej singh the cream of the khalsa thirty thousand strong who should have been miles away in futile watch on ferozepore now they were here beyond the approaching storm of horsemen i could see the massed ranks of infantry regiment on regiment with the great elephant guns before them and we were a bare ten thousand dropping with exhaustion after three battles which had decimated us and out of food water and shot historians say that on that one moment as the khalsas spearhead was rushing at our throat rested the three centuries of british india perhaps it was surely the moment in which goughs battered little army stared certain death and destruction in the face and whatever may have settled our fate later one man turned the hinge then and there without him we would have been swept away in bloody ruin ill wager youve never heard of him the forgotten brigadier mickey white it happened in split seconds even as i dashed the sweat from my eyes and stared again the bugles blared along those surging lines of khalsa horsemen the tulwars rose in a wave of steel and the great forest of lancepoints dipped as the canter became a gallop gough was roaring to our men to hold their fire and i heard huthwaite yelling that the guns were at the last round and the muskets of the infantry squares came to the present in a ragged fence of bayonets that must be ridden under as that magnificent sea of men and horses engulfed us i never saw the like in my life i who watched the great charge against campbells highlanders at balaclava but those were only russians while these were the fathers of the guides and probyns and the bengal lancers and the only thing to stop them at full tilt was a horse soldier as good as themselves he was there and he chose his time a few more seconds and the gallop would have been a charge but now a trumpet sounded on the right and wheeling out before our squares came the remnant of our own mounted division the blue tunics and sabres of the rd lights and the black fezzes and lances of the native cavalry with white at their head launching themselves at the charge against the enemys flank they didnt have the numbers i hey didnt have the weight and they were spent man and beast but they had the time and the place to perfection and in a twinkling the khalsa charge was a struggling confusion of rearing beasts and falling riders and flashing steel as the lights tore into its heart and the sowar lancers raked across its front my female and civilian readers may wonder how this could be that a small force of horsemen could confound one far greater well thats the beauty of the flank attack think of six hearty chaps racing forward in line and one artful dodger barges into the end man from the side theyre thrown out of kilter tumbling into one another and though theyre six to one five of em cant come at their attacker at its best a good flank movement can roll up the enemy like a window blind and while whites charge didnt do that it threw them quite off course and when that happens to cavalry in formation their momentums gone and good loose riders can play the devil with them so what happened under our noses was a deuce of a scrimmage and though whites horse went down he was here and there like a wildcat on foot with the lights closing round him the sabres swinging and gough up in his stirrups shouting youll do mick thats your sort my boy and who he roars at me are those fellows will ye tell me i shouted that they were khalsa regulars not gorracharra moutons and foulkess regiments for certain and gordons too though i couldnt be sure thats the pick of em then snaps he well whites put a flea in their ear so he has now take you this glass and tell me about their infantry west note it down so while the cavalry rumpus petered out with the khalsa horsemen drawing off and our own fellows half of them dismounted limping back to reform i surveyed that mass of infantry with a sinking heart calling them off by name allards courts avitabiles delusts alvarines and the rest of the divisions the standards were easy to read and so were those grim bearded faces sharp in my glass i could even make out the silver buckles on the black crossbelts the aigrets in the turbans and the buttons on the tunics white and red and blue and green just as id seen them on maian mir how the devil came they here had tejs colonels lost patience and made him march to the sound of the guns that must be it and now that white had played our last card we could only wait for them to advance and swallow us the victory of ferozeshah had become a deathtrap and i remembered gardners words they reckon they can whip john company and now john company could barely stand up in his shottorn squares his pouches and magazines empty his guns silent his cavalry lame and only his bayonets left across the plain spurts of flame flickered along the khalsa batteries like an electric storm followed by the thunder of the discharge the howl of shot overhead and a hideous crashing and screaming as it burst open our squares they were making sure the bastards pounding us to death at leisure before sending in their foot regiments to cut up the remains again the dust boiled up as the grape and roundshot tore through the entrenchments we could stand or we could run john company chose to stand god knows why in my case he stood as close behind gough as might be too scared even to pray and a bad choice of position it was too for as the bombardment reached its height and the squares vanished in the rolling red clouds and our army died by inches with men going down like skittles and the blood running under our hooves and some heroic ass bawling die hard queens own and flashy wondering if he dared cut out under the eye of his chief and knowing i hadnt the game for it and even my wound forgotten as the deadly hail swept through us suddenly gough wheeled his horse looking right and left at the wreck of his army and the old fellow was absolutely weeping then he flung away his hat and i heard him growl oi nivver wuz bate an oi nivver will be bate west flashman follow me and he wheeled his charger and went racing out into the plain you fall on your bloody sword if you want to paddy thinks i and would have stood my ground or dived for cover more like but charley was away like a shot my beast followed suit like the idiot cavalry screw he was i clutched at the bridle with my shattered hand near fainted at the pain and found myself careering in their wake for a moment i thought the old fellow had gone crazy and was for charging the khalsa on his own but he veered away right making for the flank square and as he galloped clear of it and suddenly reined in on his haunches and rose in his stirrups with his arms wide i saw what he was at all india knew that white coat of goughs the famous fighting coat that the crazy old sonofabitch had been flaunting at his foes for fifty years from south africa and the peninsula to the northwest frontier now he was using it to draw the fire from his army to himself it was the maddestbrained trick you ever saw and damnation it worked i can see him still holding the tails out and showing his teeth his white hair streaming in the wind and the earth exploding round him for the sikh gunners took the bait and hammered us with everything they had and of course we werent hit try turning your batteries on three men at a thousand yards and see what it gets you but you dont reckon mathematical probabilities with a hurricane of shot whistling about your ears i forced my beast alongside him and yelled sir hugh you must withdraw the army cannot spare you sir which was inspiration if you like but wasted on that irish idiot he yelled something that i couldnt hear and then the miracle happened and if you dont believe it look in the books all of a sudden the firing died away and across the plain the bugles rang out and the drums rolled the great gold banners were raised in the rays of the setting sun and the khalsa began to move it came on in column by regiments with a line of jat light infantry leading green figures with their pieces at the trail and suddenly charley west was shouting look sir hugh our cavalry the guns my god theyre retiring not before time thinks i though it shocked me i can tell you for he was right where we sat perhaps a furlong ahead of our right flank we had a clear view of the appalling ruin of our army the dozen battered squares of red figures with great gaps in their ranks the regimental colours stirring in the evening wind the bodies sprawled on the earthworks the plain before them littered with dead and dying beasts and men the whole hideous scene mantled in dust and smoke from the charred wreckage and the cavalry what was left of it was trotting away southward across the front of our lefthand squares which were inclined slightly back from those on the right they were in column by troops native lancers and irregular horse and then the rd lights with the horse guns following bouncing along behind the teams they they cant be runnin cries west sir hugh shall i ride to em sir it must be a mistake surely gough was staring after them as though hed seen a ghost i guess it was something hed not seen in half a century horse and guns leaving the infantry to their fate but he didnt stare more than a moment after em west bring em back he snapped and mad charley was away head down and heels in drumming up the dust while gough turned to look again towards the khalsa they were well out on the plain now in splendid style infantry in the centre with the horse guns at intervals among them cavalry on the wings gough motioned to me and we began to trot back towards our position for the first time i saw hardinge with a little knot of officers just in front of the righthand squares he was looking through a glass and turning his head to call an order the kneeling squares stood up the men closing on each other pieces at the present the dying sun flickering on the line of bayonets gough reined up herell do as well as any place says he and shaded his eyes to look across the plain man but theres a fine sight is it not fit to gladden a soldiers heart so it is well heres to them and to us he nodded to me thank you me son he threw back the tail of his coat and drew his sabre loosing the frog to let the scabbard fall to the ground i think were all goin home says he i glanced over my shoulder behind me the plain was open beyond our right flank with jungle not a mile away my screw wasnt blown or lame and i was damned if id wait here to be butchered by that juggernaut tramping inexorably towards us the blare of their heathen music came before them and behind it the measured thunder of forty thousand feet from the squares came the hoarse shouts of command i stole another look at the distant jungle tightening my sound hand on the bridle dear god exclaims gough and i started guiltily round and what i saw was another impossibility but there it was the khalsa had halted in its tracks the dust was eddying up before the advance line of jats they were turning to look back at the main body we could hear voices shrilling orders and the music was dying away in a discordant wail the great standards seemed to be wavering the whole vast army was stirring like a swarm the rattle of a single kettledrum was taken up repeated from regiment to regiment and then it was as though a venetian blind had opened and closed across the front of the great host it was the ranks turning about churning up the dust and then they were moving away the khalsa was in full retreat there wasnt a sound from our squares then from somewhere behind me a man laughed and a voice called angrily for silence thats the only noise i remember but i wasnt paying much heed i could only watch in stricken bewilderment as twenty thousand of the best native troops in the world turned their backs on an exhausted helpless enemy and left the victory to us gough sat his horse like a statue staring after them a full minute passed before he chucked the reins turning his mount as he walked it past me towards the squares he nodded and says you get that hand seen to dye hear an when yere done with it ill be obliged for the return of my neckercher so that was ferozeshah as i saw it the indian waterloo the bloodiest battle we ever fought in the orient and certainly the queerest and while other accounts may not tally with mine on small points all are agreed on the essentials we took ferozeshah at terrible cost in two days of fighting and were at the end of our tether when tej singh hove in view with an overwhelming force and then sheered off when he could have eaten us for dinner the great controversy is why did he do it well you know why because ive told you he kept his word to us and betrayed his army and his country yet there are respected historians who wont believe it to this day some because they claim the evidence isnt strong enough others because they just wont have it that victory was won by anything other than sheer british valour well it played its part by god it did but the fact is it wouldnt have been enough without tejs treachery one of the things which confuses the historians is that tej himself who could lie truth out of india when he wanted to told so many different stories afterwards he assured henry lawrence that he didnt push home his attack because he was sure it must fail having seen the losses wed taken in capturing ferozeshah he decided it was a hopeless position to assail now that we were defending it he told the same tale to sandy abbott well thats all my eye he knew his strength and he knew we were at the last gasp so that wont wash another lie repeated to alick gardner was that he was off collecting reserves at the time if thats so and he wasnt even there who gave the khalsa the order to turn about the truth i believe is what he told me many years later hed have stayed before ferozepore till the sutlej froze if his colonels hadnt forced him to march to the battle and once in sight of ferozeshah he was in a pickle because he could see that victory was his for the taking he had to think up some damned fine excuse for not overwhelming us and chance provided it at the last moment when our guns and cavalry inexplicably withdrew leaving our infantry as lonely as the policeman at herne bay nows your time tej cries the khalsa give the word and the day is ours not a bit of it says clever tej those crafty bastards aint withdrawing at all theyre circling round to take us flank and rear back to the sutlej boys ill show you the way and the khalsa did as they were told well you can see why the three days of moodkee and ferozeshah had given their rank and file a great respect for us they didnt realise what poor fettle we were in or that the withdrawal of our horse and artillery was in fact an appalling mistake it looked as though it might have some sinister purpose to it as tej was suggesting and while they suspected his courage and character they also knew he wasnt a bad soldier and might be right for once so they obeyed him and we were saved when we should have been massacred you may ask why our cavalry and guns unexpectedly flew off into the blue giving tej his excuse for retreating well that was a gift from the gods i told you that lumley the adjutantgeneral had gone barmy during the first days fighting and kept saying we must retire on ferozepore well on the second day all his screws came loose together he got ferozepore on the brain entirely and at the height of the battle he ordered our guns and cavalry away in hardinges name if you please so off they went with the great loony urging them to make haste so thats how it was mickey white tej singh and lumley each doing his little bit in his own way odd business war wed lost dead and close on wounded including your humble obedient who spent the night under a tree almost freezing to death and utterly famished with hardinge and what was left of his staff there was no sleep to be had with my hand throbbing in agony but i darent bleat for abbott alongside me had three wounds to my one and was cheerful enough to sicken you round about dawn baxu the butler rolled up with some chapattis and milk and when wed wolfed it down and hardinge had prayed a bit we all crawled aboard an elephant and lumbered down to ferozepore which was to be our seat of government henceforth while gough and most of the army camped near ferozeshah it was a great procession of wounded and baggage all the way to ferozepore and when we reached the entrenchments who should emerge but the guns and cavalry who had abandoned ship at the fatal moment hardinge was in a bate to know why and one of the binkynabobs assured him it had been on urgent orders from hardinge himself transmitted by the adjutantgeneral so now the cry was lumley and presently he appeared very brisk and with a wild glint in his eye lashing the air with a flywhisk and giving sharp little cries he was dressed in pyjamys and a straw boater and was plainly on his way to the hatters for tea hardinge demanded why hed sent off the guns and lumley looked fierce and said they had needed fresh magazines of course and damned if hed known where they could get any bar ferozepore he sounded quite indignant twelve miles away cries hardinge what service could they hope to do in time supposing they had replenished lumley snapped back about as much as theyd ha done at ferozeshah with no charges left he seemed quite pleased with this and laughed loudly swatting flies while hardinge went purple and the cavalry then cries he why did you bid them retire escort says lumley picking imaginary mice off his shirt cant have guns goin about unguarded desperate fellows everywhere sikhs dont you know swoop pounce carry em off i assure you besides cavalry needed a rest quite played out and you did this in my name sir cries hardinge without my authority lumley said impatiently that if he hadnt no one would have paid him any heed he grew quite agitated in describing how on the first night hed told harry smith to retreat and harry had told him to go to hell usin foulest language sir damn the orders his very words though i said twas in your name and the battle was lost and we must buy the sikhs if we were to come off he wouldnt listen says lumley looking ready to cry well everyone except hardinge could see that the fellow was liable to start plaiting his toes into doormats but our pompous gg wouldnt let him alone why he demanded was lumley improperly dressed in pyjamys instead of uniform lumley gave a great guffaw and says ah well you see my overalls were so riddled with musketballs they dropped off me they sent him home which made me wonder if he was quite as tap as he sounded for at least he got out of it while the rest of us must soldier on waiting for paddy to plan his next bloodbath i had hopes of keeping clear with my hand shot through and my supposedly bad leg but once wed settled in ferozepore and taken stock blowed if i wasnt the fittest junior in view munro somerset and hore of hardinges staff were dead grant and becher were wounded abbott wouldnt recover for weeks and the toll among the politicals had been frightful with broadfoot and peter nicolson dead and mills and lake badly wounded its a damned dangerous game campaigning especially with a sawbones as heartily callous as old billy mgregor man thats a grand hole in your hand cries he sniffing it nae gangrene or broken bones yell be grippin a glass or a gun inside the week your ankle ach its fine ye could play peever this minute not what i care to hear from my medical man in wartime id been looking for a ticket to meerut at least but with politicals so scarce there was no hope of that and when saintly henry lawrence turned up to take broadfoots place i was kept hard at it among other duties seeing to the provision of fur boots for our elephants against the winter cold capital thinks i this is the way to nerve out the war in comfort for one thing now seemed plain the khalsa couldnt whip john company the bogy had been laid at ferozeshah india was safe and while they were still in strength beyond the river it remained only to bring them to one final action to break them for good and all so for the present we sat and watched them gough awaiting his chance to strike and hardinge turning his mind to great affairs of state and political settlements with lawrence who knew the punjab better even than broadfoot at his elbow ile was shockingly christian lawrence but an al political for all that he turned me inside out about lahore and wanted me in at the high powwows but hardinge said i was far too junior and overzealous the truth was he couldnt abide me and wanted to forget my existence heres why wed had a bloody close call in india and it was hardinges fault hed failed to secure the frontier through pussyfooting and hindering gough and the stark truth was that when the grip came two men had saved the day gough and i i aint bragging you know i never do id instructed lal and tejs treachery and paddy had held his ragbag army together got it to the gate in time and won his fights oh theyd been costly and hed fought head on and taken some hellish risks but hed done the business as few could have done it hardinge for one but that wasnt how hardinge saw it he believed hed stopped paddy from throwing the army away at ferozeshah and from that it was a short step to seeing himself as the saviour of india well he was governorgeneral after all and india had been saved qei indeed he seemed to think hed done it in spite of gough and inside a week of ferozeshah he was writing to peel in london urging that paddy be given the sack i saw the letter accidentallike when i was rummaging through his excellencys effects in search of cheroots and it was a beauty paddy wasnt fit to be trusted with the war the army was unsatisfactory hed no head for bandobast he didnt frame orders properly etc well dash my wig thinks i heres gratitude and the measure of henry hardinge framing orders my foot no doubt on ye go mickey give em one for me offended his staff college sensibilities but he might have remembered another general of his acquaintance whose style wasnt very different stand up guards now maitland nows your time if id been a man id have scrawled it across his precious letter it was plain why he was tattling to peel though shift the blame for the butchers bill and the near squeak wed had onto gough and whod think back to the incompetence and fear of offending lahore and leadenhall street that had helped bring on the war in the first place and damned near lost it it was artfully done too with a tribute to paddys energy and courage you could imagine peel shuddering at the name of gough and thanking god that hardinge had been on hand dont misunderstand i aint championing the old mick who was a bloodthirsty savage and a splendid chap to avoid but i liked him because hed no side and was jolly and offended the quality by commissioning rankers and damn the royal prerogative aye and by winning wars with his tipperary tactics perhaps that was his greatest offence oh i know hardinge was an honourable man who never stole a boxcar in his life and that most of what he said of paddy was true that aint the point that letter would have been shabby if id written it dammit coining from a man of honour it was unpardonable but it showed how the wind set and i wasnt surprised on rooting farther through hardinges satchels to find a note in his daybook politicals of no real use so there plainly flashy would get no credit either my work with lal and tej would be conveniently forgotten well thankee sir henry and i hope your rabbit dies and you cant sell the hutch i pondered about informing paddy anonymously that he was being nobbled but decided to let it be mischiefs all very well but you never know where it may end so i lay low running errands for lawrence he was a gaunt illtempered scarecrow but hed known me in afghanistan and thought i was another heroic ruffian like himself so we dealt pretty well hed seen from broadfoots papers that george had been meaning to send me back to lahore but i cant think why can you anyway i doubt if the gg would approve he thinks youve meddled enough in punjabi politics but youd best let your beard grow just in case so i did and the weeks went by while we waited for the khalsa to move and our own army recovered and grew strong we celebrated christmas with the first decorated tree ever i saw a great fir brought down from the hills and sprinkled with flour to represent snow our caledonians boozed in the new year with raucous mirth and unspeakable song the reinforcements arrived from umballa and we saw the scarlet and blue of british lancer regiments the green of the little gurkha hillmen strutting by with their knives bouncing on their rickety arses the tenth foot with band playing and colours flying and everyone pouring out of the tents to sing them in for tis my delight of a shining night in the season of the year behind came native cavalry and marching sepoy battalions with sappers and artillery paddy had men now and the young lancer bucks strutted and hawhawed and asked when were these sikh wallahs goin to show us some sport hey god i love newcomers in at the death dont i just there was one quiet lancer though a blackwhiskered scotch nemesis who said never a word and played the bull fiddle for his recreation he caught my eye then and again fifteen years later when he led the march to peking the most terrible killing gentleman you ever saw hope grant so there we were cocked and ready to fire and beyond the river although we didnt know it little dalips throne was shaking for it was touch and go whether the khalsa raging in defeat and convinced theyd been betrayed would fight us or march on lahore to slake their fury on jeendan and the durbar theyd have hanged lal singh if they could have caught him but hed hidden in a hayrick after ferozeshah and then in a bakers oven before sneaking back to lahore where jeendan mocked and abused him when she was sober and galloped him when she was drunk between bouts she was sending messages of encouragement to her halfmutinous army telling them not to give up but to march on and conquer at the same time she shut the city gates against the fugitives from lals contingent whod deserted in thousands and even ordered gardner to recall a muslim brigade from the front to protect her in case the khalsa sikhs came looking for her resourceful lass she was egging on her army while she turned her capital into an armed camp against them goolab singh was playing the same game from kashmir the khalsa pleaded with him to bring his hillmen to the war and even offered to make him maharaja but the old fox saw we had the game won and put them off with promises that hed join once the campaign was fully launched while making a great display of sending them ripply convoys which he made sure were only quarter loaded and moved at a snails pace meanwhile tej singh was scheming how to lead the khalsa to final destruction he had the bulk of them in hand outnumbering us three to one and must do something before they lost patience with him so he threw a bridge of boats over the sutlej at sobraon and built a strong position on the south bank in a bend of the river where paddy darent attack him without heavy guns which we still lacked at the same time another sikh army struck over the river farther up threatening ludhiana and our lines of communication so gough moved north to contain tejs bridgehead and sent harry smith to deal with the ludhiana incursion smith full of conceit and ginger as usual stalked the invaders to and fro in the last week of january and then handed them a fearful thrashing at aliwal killing and taking over fifty guns and that did rattle the khalsa for the beaten commander runjoor singh was a firstclass man and smith had licked him with a smaller force and no excuse of treachery this time i was in goughs camp at sobraon when the news came through for hardinge was in the habit of riding the twenty miles from ferozepore every other day with his new staff of toadies to have a sniff and a carp at goughs dispositions and lawrence always went along with your correspondent bringing up the rear a great roar of cheering ran through the lines and paddy fairly danced with joy and then scudded off to his tent for a pray lawrence and other holy joes took their cue and i was about to sidle off to the staff mess when i heard a great groan close by and there was old gravedigger havelock clasping his bony paws in supplication and looking like thomas carlyle with rheumatics i never seemed to see that man but he was calling on god for something or other possibly it was the sight of me that did it hed prayed over me like a mad monk at jallalabad but the last id seen of him had been his boots viewed from under the pool table while i rogered mrs madison amen booms he and left off addressing heaven to wring my hand glaring joyfully it is flashman my boy how long since last i saw you sales billiardroom at simla says i not thinking and he frowned and said i hadnt been there that evening surely neither i was says i hastily must have been some other chap lets see when did we last meet church somewhere was it i have thought of you often since afghanistan cries he still mangling my fin ah we smelled the battle afar off the thunder of the captains and the shouting didnt we just though ah yes well now but come will you not join your voice with that of our chief in gratitude to him who hath vouchsafed us this victory oh rather but i say youll have to give me a lead graved skipper i mean you always put it so dashed well praying dont you know which tickled him no end and in two shakes we were on our hams outside goughs tent and it struck me as i looked at them old paddy havelock lawrence edwardes bagot and i fancy hope grant was there too that id never seen such a pack of born bloodspillers at their devotions in my life its an odd thing about deadly men theyre all addicted either to god or the devil and i aint sure but what the holy ones arent the more fatal breed of the two but mainly i recall that impromptu prayer meeting because it set me thinking of elspeth again when havelock invoked a blessing not only on our fallen comrades but on those yet to fall in the coming strife and on those dear distant homes which will be darkened with mourning under the wings of deaths angel amen thinks i but steer him clear of a brook street oh lord if you dont mind listening to gravedigger i could absolutely picture the melancholy scene with the wreath on our knocker and the blinds drawn and my fatherinlaw whining about the cost of crepe and my lovely oldenhaired elspeth her blue eyes dim with tears in her black veil and black gloves and dainty black satin slippers and long clocked stockings with purple rosettes on her garters and that shiny french corset with the patent laces that you just had to twitch and she came bursting out flashman was much moved i thought havelock said afterwards and so i was at the thought of all that voluptuous goodness so far away and going to waste at least i hoped it was but i had my doubts heaven knew how many my melting little innocent had thrashed the mattress with in my absence brooding on that over supper and finding no consolation in port and fond musings on my own indiscretions with jeendan and mangla and mrs madison i found myself getting quite jealous and hungry for that blonde beauty on tother side of the world time for a brisk stroll in the cold night air i decided we were stopping in goughs camp by sobraon so that he and hardinge could bicker over the next move and i sauntered along the lines arm the frosty dark listening to our artillery firing a royallute in celebration of smiths victory at aliwal barely a mile away i could see the watchfires of the khalsa entrenchments in the sutlej bend and as the crash of our guns died away hanged if the enemy didnt reply with a royal salute of their own and their bands playing youll never guess what in some ways it was the eeriest thing in that queer campaign the silence in our own lines as the gunsmoke drifted overhead the golden moon glow in the purple sky shining on the rows of tents and the distant twinkling fires and over the dark ground between the solemn strains of god save the queen i never heard it played so well as by the khalsa and for the life of me i dont know to this day whether it was in derision or salute with sikhs you can never tell i was thinking about that and the impossibility of ever knowing what goes on behind indian eyes and how id misread them all and reflecting that with any luck id soon have seen the last of them thank heaven and in that very moment an orderly came running to say please sir major lawrences compliments and would i wait on the governorgeneral at once it never occurred to me that my thoughts had been tempting fate and as i waited in the empty annexe which served as an anteroom to hardinges pavilion i felt only mild curiosity as to why he wanted me voices sounded in the inner sanctum but i gave no heed to them at first hardinge saying that something was a serious matter and lawrence replying that some time must be lost then goughs voice well then a flyin column under cover o dark an goin like billybedamneed send hope grant wi two squadrons of the th an he can be in and out before anyones the wiser no no sir hugh cries hardinge if it is to be done at all it must be secret that is insisted upon if indeed we are to believe that fellow suppose it is some infernal plot oh bring him in again charles and find whatever has happened to flashman i tell you it troubles me that he is named in this i was listening now all ears as young charlie hardinge emerged crying there i was and bustling me in hardinge was saying that it was all most precarious and no work for a junior man who had proved himself so headstrong he had the grace to break off at sight of me and sat looking peevish with lawrence and van cortlandt whom i hadnt seen since moodkee standing behind old paddy shivering in his cloak in a camp chair gave me good evening but no one else spoke and you could feel the anxiety in the air then charlie was back again ushermg in a figure whose un expected appearance set my innards cartwheeling in nameless alarm he sauntered in no whit abashed by the exalted company wearing his afghan rags as though they were ermine and his ugly face split into a grin as his eye lit on me why hollo there lieutenant says jassa hows tricks stand there under the lamp if you please snaps hardinge flashman do you know this man jassa grinned even wider and just from the glance between lawrence and van cortlandt i guessed theyd already identified him ten times over but hardinge as usual was proceeding by laborious rote i said yes he was dr harlan an agent of broadfoots lately posing as my orderly and formerly of hms service in burma jassa looked pleased say you remembered that thankee sir thats proud that will do says hardinge you may go hows that sir says jassa but hadnt i ought to stay i mean if the lieutenant is going to that will be all says hardinge down his nose so jassa shrugged muttered as he passed me that it wasnt his goddam powwow and loafed out hardinge exclaimed in irritation how came broadfoot to employ such a person hes an american he said it as though jassa were a fallen woman yes and a slippery one says van cortlandt he bore a bad name in the punjab in my time but if he comes from gardner thats the point does he lawrence was brusque he handed me a plain sealed note harlan brought this for you from colonel gardner in lahore says it will establish his bona fides the seal hasnt been touched wondering what the deuce this was about i broke the seal and had a sudden premonition of what i would read sure enough there it was one word wisconsin hes from gardner says i and they looked at it in turn i explained it was a password known only to gardner and me and hardinge sniffed another american are we to rely on a foreign mercenary in the employ of the enemy on this mercenary yes says van cortlandt curtly hes a sure friend without him flashman would not have left lahore alive thats no way to boost gardners stock thinks i hardinge raised his brows and sat back and lawrence turned to me harlan arrived an hour ago its bad news out of lahore gardner says the maharani and her son are in grave peril from their own army theres talk of plots to murder her to abduct the little maharaja and place him in the heart of the khalsa so that the panches can do as they please in his name that would mean the end of tej singh and the appointment of some trusted general who might well give us a long war he didnt need to add that it might be a disastrous war for us the khalsa were still in overwhelming strength if they had a leader who knew how to use it the boys the key says lawrence who holds him holds power the khalsa knows it and so does his mother she wants him out of lahore and under our protection at once it will be a week at least before we can finish the khalsa in battle ten days more like says gough that is the time the plotters have in which to strike lawrence paused and my mouth went dry as i realised they were all watching me gough and van cortlandt keenly hardinge with gloomy disapproval the maharani wants you to fetch him out secretly says lawrence thats her message given by gardner to harlan steady now thinks i mustnt puke or burst into tears keep a straight face and remember that the last thing hardinge wants is to have flashy stirring the punjab pot again thats your hole card my boy if this beastly proposal is to be scotched so i made a lip thoughtfullike choked down my supper and said straight out very good sir i have a free hand i suppose that did the trick hardinge leaped as though hed been gaffed no sir you do not no such thing you will keep your place until he glared flustered from lawrence to gough sir hugh i know not what to think this scheme fills me with misgivings what do we know of these these americans and this maharani if this were a plot to discredit us not by gardner snaps van cortlandt the maharani has good cause to fear for her childs safety says lawrence and her own if anything befell them well when this war is past we should find ourselves dealing with a state in anarchy she and the boy are our only hope of a good political solution gough spoke up an if we dont get one we must conquer the punjab i tell ye sir henry we have not the means for that hardinges face was a study he drummed his fingers and fretted i cannot like it suppose it were made to appear that we were kidnapping the boy why it might be charged that we made war on children oh never that cries lawrence wed be protecting him but if we do nothing and he is seized by the khalsa murdered perhaps and his mother with him well that would not be seen to our credit i believe i could have kicked him hed hit on the best argument to commit hardinge to this dreadful folly credit that was the thing what would london think what would the times say you could see our governorgeneral imagining the outcry if blasted little dalip got his weasand slit through our neglect he went pale and then his face cleared while he pretended to ponder the thing certainly the childs safety must weigh heavily with us says he solemnly humanity and policy both demand it sir hugh what is your thought get him out says paddy ye cannot do other even then hardinge must make a show of careful judgment frowning in silence while my heart sank to my boots then he sighed so be it then we must pray that we are not the dupes of some singular intrigue but i insist lawrence that either you or van cortlandt undertakes it he shot me a baleful glance an older head by your leave sir says lawrence flashman be good enough to wait in my tent ill join you presently so i left obediently and was round the outside of hardinges tent like a frightened stoat tripping over guyropes and slithering in the frosty dark before bearing up in the shadows with an ear cocked under the muslin screen of his window the man himself was in full cry and i caught the end of it less suitable for such delicate work i cannot conceive his conduct with the sikh leaders was irresponsible to a degree taking it upon himself to determine policy a mere junior political officer flown with selfesteem thank god he did says good old paddy very well sir hugh fortune favoured us but his conduct might have brought us to catastrophe i tell you what the mans a swaggerer no says this splendid and fatsighted statesman flashman shall not go to lahore he must retorted lawrence for whom i was conceiving a poisonous dislike who else can pass as a native speaking punjabi and knows the ins and outs of lahore fort and the little maharaja worships him harlan tells me he paused besides the maharani jeendan has asked for him by name whats that to the point cries hardinge if she wishes her child safe it is all one whom we send perhaps not sir she knows flashman and lawrence hesitated the fact is there is a bazaar rumour that she ah formed an attachment for him while he was in lahore he coughed and hummed as you k now sir she is a very lovely young woman of an ardent nature by all accounts good god cries hardinge you dont mean the young devil chuckles paddy oh well decidedly he must go wed best not neglect anything that will dispose her well to us says van cortlandt damn him and as lawrence says there is no one else eavesdropping fearfully my mind filled with the horrid prospect of lahore and its gridirons and ghastly bathrooms and akali fanatics and murderous swordsmen i couldnt help recalling that broadfoot had counted on my manly charms just as these calculating wretches were doing its too bad but if youre hells delight with the fair sex what would you ive no doubt its what persuaded that pious hypocrite hardinge with his mind fixed on political accommodations after the war by all means let flashy humour the hitch while he plucked her bloody infant to safety and wouldnt she be obliged to us just he didnt say as much but you could hear him thinking it as he gave his reluctant consent but hear me lawrence flashman must understand that he is to proceed in strict accordance to your instructions he must have no room for independent action of any kind whatsoever is that clear this fellow harlan has brought directions from what is his name gardner a fine business when we must rely on such people let alone this harebrained political you must question harlan closely on how it is to be effected above all no harm must befall the young prince flashman must understand that and the consequences should he fail i doubt if he needs instruction on that head sir says lawrence pretty cool for the rest i shall give him careful directions very well i shall hold you responsible you have an observation sir hugh eh no no sorr hinry nothin of consequence i was just after thinkin chuckles old paddy that i wish i was young again an spoke punjabi you never can say youve seen anything for the last time id have laid a million to one that id not return to that little stand of white poplars south of the moochee gate where id sat by the fire with gardner yet here i was only a few weeks later with the flames crackling under the billycan resting on the selfsame red stone with the crack in it to our right the road was busy with the wayfarers of daybreak under the great moochee arch the gates were swung back they were dousing the night torches and the guard was changing an uncommon heavy one it seemed to me for i counted twenty helmets in and shout the archway and since our arrival in the small hours there had been endless cavalry patrols circling the city walls red lancers with green puggarees and great activity of matchlockmen on the parapets muslim brigade says jassa yes sir shes got this old town laced up tightern jemimas stays waste o time since any plottersll be on the inside probly in the fort itself among her own people say i bet alick gardners sleepin light though it was our third morning on the road for we had taken a wide cast south crossing the sutlej at a ghat near mundole to avoid any enemy river watchers and keep clear of the khalsas main traffic on the upper road through pettee to sobraon wed ridden in cautious stages jassa and i and a trusted pathan ruffian of broadfoots old bodyguard ahmed shah gough had wanted to send an nc squadron disguised as gorracharra but lawrence had turned it down flat insisting that theyd be bound to give themselves away and anyway if all went well three would be enough while if it went ill a brigade would be too few no one would give any heed to three obvious afghan horsecopers with a string of beasts and thus far no one had i shant weary you with my emotions as we waited shivering in the frosty dawn round our fire ill say only that in addition to the blue funk i felt at the mere sight of lahores frowning gates and brooding towers i had the liveliest misgivings about the plan whereby we were to spirit young dalip out of the cobras nest it was gardners invention lined out precisely to jassa who had repeated it to lawrence and van cortlandt with flashy palpitating attentively and since our tartan pathan wasnt there to be argued with it was a case of take it or leave it i know which id ha done but lawrence had said it should serve admirably he wasnt going to be the one sneaking in and out of lahore fort in broad daylight after all that seemed to me an unnecessary lunacy why the devil couldnt gardner with all his powers as governor have contrived to smuggle the brat out to us jassa had explained that the city was tight as a tanner by night and the panches spies had their eye on little dalip most of the day the only hour to lift him was his bedtime to be out and away before curfew and have all night to make tracks and we must go into the fort to do it for his mother wouldnt rest unless she saw him placed under my protective wing as to our coming and going at the fort gardner would provide all we need do was be in the vicinity of runjeets tomb at noon of this the third day so now you see three kabuli copers herding their beasts through the dust and bustle of the rushnai gate and setting up shop in a crowded square by the buggywalla doudy at midday ahmed shah cried our wares asking exorbitant prices since the last thing we wanted was to tell our transport and i held the brutes heads and spat and looked ugly praying that no one would recognise jassa with a patch over his eye and his hair and fiveday heard dyed orange he had no such fears but loafed about freely with the other idlers gossiping as he said theres no concealment like open display i didnt see the touch made but presently he ambled off and i passed the halters to ahmed and followed across the great square by the marble barra deree to the palace gateway where id first seen gardner months fore there were no palace guards on the parapet now only greenjacketed muslim musketeers with great curling moustachioes watchful as vultures who scowled down at the crowds loitering in the square there must have been several thousand gathered and enough sikhs in assorted khalsa coats among them to set my innards churning they did nothing but stare up at the walls muttering among themselves but you could feel the sullen hostility hanging over the place like a cloud she aint venturing abroad this weather i reckon murmurs jassa as i joined him in the lee of the gateway yep theres a sizeable republican majority right here our guide is right behind us in the palki when i give the nod well tote it through the gate i glanced over my shoulder there was a palki with its curtains drawn set down by the wall but no bearers in night so that was how we were to get past the gate guard who were questioning all incomers even under my poshteen i could feel the sweat icy on my skin and for the twentieth time i fingered the cooper hidden in my sash not that six shots would buy much elbowroom if we came adrift all of a sudden the mutter of the crowd grew to a babble and then to a roar they were giving back to make way for a body of marching men advancing across the square from the hazooree gate on the town side sikhs almost to a man from half the divisions of the khalsa some of them with bandaged wounds and powder burns on their coats but swinging along like guardsmen behind their golden standard which to my amazement was borne by the whitewhiskered old rissaldarmajor id seen at maian mir and again at jeendans durbar and he was weeping so help me the tears running down to his beard his eyes fixed ahead and there behind him was imam shah he of the ivory knives bareheaded and with his arm in a sling i was in behind jassa doublequick i can tell you the crowd were in a frenzy waving and wailing and yelling khalsaji khalsaji showering them with petals as they marched by but not a man so much as glanced aside on they went in column of fours under the palace archway with the mob surging behind up to the gate taking up another cry see delhi see delhi heroes of the khalsa wa guruji to delhi to london now who the hell are they whispers jassa i guess maybe we got here just in time i hope come on we laid hold on the palki and shouldered our way through the mob to the gateway where a muslim subedar barred our way and stooped to question our passenger i heard a womans voice quick and indistinct and then he had waved us on and we carried the palki through the gate and for all my dread at reentering that fearsome den i found myself remembering stumps harrowell whod been the chairman at rugby when i was a boy and how wed run after him whipping his enormous fat calves while he could only rage helplessly between the shafts you should see your tormentor now stumps thinks i hoist with his own palki if you like our passenger was calling directions to jassa who was between the front shafts and presently we bore up in a little secluded court and out she jumped walking quickly to a low doorway which she unlocked motioning us to follow she led us up a long dim passage several flights of stairs and more passages and then i knew where we were i had been conducted along this very way to jeendans rose boudoir and i knew that pretty little rump stirring under the tight sari mangla says i but she only beckoned us on to a little illfurnished room where id never been only when she had the door closed did she throw off her veil and i looked again on that lovely kashmiri face with its slanting gazelle eyes but there was no insolence in them now only fear whats amiss snaps jassa scenting catastrophe you saw those men of the khalsa the five hundred her voice was steady enough but quick with alarm they are a deputation from tej singhs army men of moodkee and ferozeshah they have come to plead with the rani for arms and food for the army and for a leader o take tejs place so that we may still sweep the jangi lat back to the gates of delhi the way she spat it out you would have wondered which side she was on even traitors still have patriotic pride you see but they were not to have audience of the durbar until tomorrow they have come before their time well what of it says i she can fob them off shes done it before they were not a beaten army then they had not been led to defeat by tej and lal or learned to mistrust mai jeendan herself now when they come to durbar and find themselves ringed in by muslim muskets and call to her for aid which she cannot give them what then they are hungry men and desperate she shrugged you say she has wheedled them before aye but she is not given to null words these days she fears for dalip and herself she hates the khalsa for jawaheers sake and the feeds her rage on wine shes like to answer their mutinous clamour by blackening their faces for them and who knows what they may do if she provokes them red murder like as not and then wed have some usurper displacing tej singh and reviving the khalsa for another slap at us and here was i back on the lions lip thanks to gardners idiot plots should i throw in now and bolt for india or could we still get dalip out before all hell broke loose whens the durbar in two hours perhaps can gardner bring the boy to us beforehand now run in daylight cries jassa wed never make it mangla shook her head the maharaja must be seen at the durbar who knows mai jeendan may answer them well enough and if she fails they may still be quiet with a thousand muslims ready to fall on them at a word from gurdana khan then when you have seen mai jeendan i dont need to see her or anyone except her blasted son tell gardner why heres a change says she with a flash of the old mangla you were eager enough once well she wishes to see you flashman bahadur and she will have her way what the devil for affairs of state belike she gave her insolent slow smile meanwhile you must wait you are safe here i shall tell gurdana and bring word when the durbar begins and she slipped out having added bewilderment to my fears what could jeendan want with me id thought it rum at the time her insistence that i should be dalips rescuer to be sure the kid liked me but shed as good as made me a condition of the plan to paddy goughs ribald amusement coarse old brute but it couldnt be that at such a time mind you with partial females you never can tell especially when theyre foxed but all this was small beer beside the menace of the khalsa deputies could she hocus them again by playing her charms and beguiling them with sweet words and fair promises well she didnt even try as we saw when mangla returned after two hours of fretful waiting to conduct us to that same spyhole from which id watched an earlier durbar this was a different indaba altogether then ere had been tumult and high spirits laughter even but w we heard the angry clamour of the deputation and r shrill replies even before we reached the eyrie when i am at a glance that this was an ugly business with the mother of all sikhs on her highest horse and damn the consequences the five hundred were in uproar in the main body of the peat hall before the durbar screen but keeping their ranks and it was easy to see why they were wearing their tulwars but round the walls of the chamber there must have been a full battalion of muslim riflemen with their pieces at the high port primed and ready imam shah was standing forward addressing the screen with the old risnaldarmajor a pace behind the golden standard lay before the throne on which little dalip sat in lonely state the tiny figure brave in crimson and with the kohinoor ablaze in his aigret behind the purdah more muslims lined the walls and before them stood gardner in his tartan fig the point of his naked sabre resting between his feet close by the screen jeendan was pacing to and fro pausing from time to time to listen then resuming her furious sentrygo for she was in a great rage and well advanced in liquor by the look of her she had a cup in hand and a flagon on the table but for once she was modestly clad as modest anyway as a voluptuous doll can he in a tight sari of purple silk with her red hair unbound to her shoulders and that delilah face unveiled imam shah was in full grievance shouting hoarsely at the screen for three days your faithful khalsa have lived on grain and raw carrots they are starving kunwari and eaten up wiith cold and want only send them the food and munitians you promised and they will sweep the host of the jangilat to sweep them as you swept them at ferozeshah and moodkee cries jeendan aye there was a fine sweeping my waiting women could have swept as heartily she waited head thrown back for the effect of this imam stood in silent anger and she went on goolab has sent you supplies enough why every wheatporter in kashmir makes an endless train from jumoo to the river laden she was drowned in a roar of derision from the five hundred and imam advanced a yard to bawl his answer aye in single file on pain of mutilation by the golden hen who makes a brave show of assistance but sends not breakfast for a bird chiriakihazrif thats what we get from goolab singh if he vishes us well let him come and lead us in place of that bladder of lard you made our general bid him come kunwari a word from you and hell be in the saddle for sobraon uproar followed goolab goolab give us the dogra for general but still they kept their ranks goolab is under the heel of the malki lat and you know it snaps jeendan even so there are those among you who would make him maharaja my loyal khalsa there was silence on the instant you send him ambassadors they tell me aye in breach of your sacred oath you whine for food on the one hand and make treason on the other you the khalsa the pure and she reviled them in fishwife terms as she had at maian mir until gardner stepped swiftly forward and caught her by the arm she shook him off but took the hint and none too soon for beyond the screen the five hundred were fingering their hilts and imam was black with fury that is a lie kunwari no man here would serve goolab as maharaja but he can fight by god he does not skulk in his tent like tej or flee like your bedman lull he can lead so let him lead us to delhi to victory she let the shouting die and spoke in a cold voice ringing with scorn i have said i will not have goolab singh and he will not have you whos to blame him are you worth having you heroes who strut out to battle with your banners and brave songs and crawl back whimpering that you are hungry can you do nothing but complain we can fight roars a voice and in a moment they were echoing it stirring forward in their ranks shaking their fists some even weeping openly theyd come for supplies and what they were getting was shame and insult keep a civil tongue in your head cant you i was whispering for it was plain theyd had their fill of her abuse give us guns give us powder and shot powder and shot cries jeendan and for a moment i thought she was going to be out and at them did i not give you both and to spare arms and food and great guns never was such an army seen in hindoostan and what did you make of it the food youve guzzled the british have your great guns and the arms you flung away doubtless as you ran cheeping like mice from what from a tired old man in a white coat with a handful of redfaced infidels and bengali sweepers her voice rose to a shriek as she faced the curtain fists clenched face contorted and foot stamping and beside me jassa gasped and mangla gave a little sob as we saw the ranks of the five hundred start forward and there was steel glittering amongst them shed gone too far the drunken slut for imam shah was on the dais the khalsa coats were surging behind him shouting with rage gardner was turning to snap an order the muslim muskets were dropping to the present and jeendan was fumbling beneath her skirt swearing like a harpy there was a rending of cloth and in an instant she had whirled her petticoat into a ball and hurled it over the screen it fell at imams feet draping over his boot there was no doubting what it was and in the shocked silence her voice rang out wear that you cowards wear it i say or ill go in trousers and fight myself it was as though theyd been stricken by a spell while you could count ten there wasnt a sound i see them yet an akali his sword halfout poised like a gladiators statue imam shah staring down at the scarlet shift the old rissaldarmajor mouth open hands raised in dismay little dalip like a graven image on his throne the mass of men still as death staring at the screen and then imam shah picked up the golden standard raised it and shouted in a voice of thunder dalip singh maharaja we go to die for your kingdom we go to die for the khalsaji then he added almost in a whisper though it carried round the hall we will go to the sacrifice he thrust the standard into the rissaldarmajors hand and in that moment unprompted little dalip stood up a seconds pause and the whole five hundred roared maharaja maharaja khalsaji then they turned as one man and marched out of the open double doors behind them gardner was at the corner of the screen in four quick strides staring after them then coming out to take dalips hand behind the purdah jeendan yawned shook her red hair and stirred her shoulders as though to ease them took a deep drink and began to straighten her sari now that is exactly what i saw and so did alick gardner as his memoirs testify and neither of us can explain it those khalsa fanatics stung to madness by her insults would have rushed the purdah and cut her down im certain and been slaughtered by the muslims god knows what would have followed but she threw her petticoat at them and they went out like lambs prepared to do or die intuition on her part gardner calls it very well it did the business mind you young dalip stood up at exactly the right time jassa was breathing relief and mangla was smiling ile low us came a series of thunderous crashes as the muslims ordered arms and began to file out of the chamber little dalip was behind the purdah being enfolded in mamas tipsy embrace but gardner had disappeared mangla touched my arm and signing to jassa to wait led me up to the rose boudoir i felt exhausted even looking at it and through to the passage beyond and a little room which i guessed must be the schoolroom of dalip and his playfellows for there were half a dozen little desks and a blackboard and even a globe and fairytale pictures on the walls there she left me and a moment later gardner strode in breathing fire and wonder you saw that just now goddam but that womans a bearcat for nerve a bearcat sir petticoats by thunder i wouldnt ha credited it sometimes i think he used eyeing me with a curious frown i think shes a mite deranged what with drink and well no matter and george broadfoots dead well thats hard hearing you didnt see it well you have one as good in henry lawrence let me tell you that maybe even better as an agent not a better man mind you no sir they dont come better than the blackcoated infidel he was standing arms akimbo staring at the floor and i sensed disturbance not because he hadnt greeted me or made reference to my recent adventures for that was never his style but there was something on his mind for aii that he tried to cover it with a show of briskness its past four and you and josiah must be clear of the gates before six youll go as you came bearing the palki but this time dalip will be your freight dressed as a girl my subedar will have the palace gate so youll be clear there once beyond the rushnai keep to the doab due southeast and dawn should see you at jupindar its about forty miles and not on the map but youll see it clear enough its a big cluster of black rocks among low hillocks the only ones for miles around there youll be met by whom our people gough wanted to by sure people he gave me a hard stare all you need do is get that far and i dont have to tell you that youre carrying the punjab on your back whoever gets that boy it must not be the khalsa mallum hes a good little horseman by the way so you can keep up the pace dawn at jupindar mind that due southeast and youll fall over it for the first time i felt excitement rather than fear he had it pat and it would do we were going to bring it off what else says he ah yes one thing dr josiah harlan i gave him a bad name to you and he deserved every word but i allow hes played a straight hand this time and i incline to revise my opinion that being the case youd better keep a closer eye on him than ever well thats all i guess he paused avoiding my eye once youve paid your respects to the maharani you can be off now there was something up gardner uneasy was a sight id never thought to see but he was scratching his grizzled beard and keeping his face averted and i felt a strange foreboding he cleared his throat ah did mangla say nothing to you no well oh dooce take it he looked me full in the face mai jeendan wants to marry you there now heaven knows why my first reaction was to look in the mirror on the classroom wall a fierceeyed khyberie ruffian stared back at me which was no help nor was my recollection of what i looked like when civilised and possibly the punjab had exhausted my capacity for astonishment for once the first shock of that amazing proposal had been absorbed i felt nothing but immense gratification after all its one thing to win a maiden heart and very fine but when a maneater whos sampled the best from peshawar to poona cries eureka over you well its no wonder if you glance at the mirror at the same time its quite a facer and my first words possibly instinctive were christ she aint pregnant is she how the devil should i know cries gardner astonished on my word now sir ive told you so there you are well she cant im married dammit i know that but she does not and its best she should not for the moment he glared at me and took a turn round the room while i sank on to one of the infants stools which gave way beneath me gardner swore yanked me to my feet and thrust me into the teachers chair see here mr flashman says he this is how it is mai jeendan is a woman of strange character and damned irregular habits as youre well aware but shes no fool for years now shes had it in mind to marry a british officer as security for herself and her sons throne well thats sound policy especially now when britains hand is on the punjab for months past this is sober truth her agents in india have been sending her portraits of eligible men shes even had young hardinges likeness in her well twas the only one she took to amritsar and the rest have been with the lumber ever since nothing to say to that of course i kept a straight face and he took station in front of me mighty stern very well its impossible you have a wife and even if you hadnt i dare say youd not care to pass your days as consort to an eastern queen myself while i admire her many good qualities says he with feeling id not hitch with jeendan for all the cotton in dixie so help me hannah but she has a deep fondness for you and this is no time to blight that affection northern indias in the balance and shes the pivot steady enough but not to be disturbed in any way he stooped suddenly and seized my wrist staring into my eyes grim as a frost giant so when you see her presently you will not disappoint her hopes oh shell make no direct proposal thats not punjabi royal style but shell sound you out probably offer you employment in sikh service for after the war with a clear hint of her intentions to all of which youd best give eager assent for all our sakes especially your own hell hath no fury you remember he let go straightening up i guess you know how to jolly her along oh aye by god its a rum go though whatll happen later when she finds i aint a starter the warll be over then and it wont signify says he bleakly i dare say shell get over it dirty game politics shes a great woman you know drunk and all as she is you ought to be flattered by the by have you any aristocratic kinfolk my mother was a paget is that high style better make her a duchess then mai jeendan likes to think that youre a lord after all she was once married to a maharaja as it happened my lineage aristocratic and otherwise was not discussed in the rose boudoir mainly because there wasnt time when gardner had spoken of not disappointing her id supposed that i must not dash her hopes of becoming mrs flashman accordingly i bowled in prepared for an exchange of nods and becks and coy blushes on her part and ardent protestations on mine only when i stood blinking in the dark and two plump arms encircled me from behind that familiar drunken chuckle sounded in my ear and she turned up the lamp to reveal herself clad only in oil and bangles did i suspect that further proof of my devotion was required i liked you better shaven whispers she and dalip or no dalip there was nothing for it but to give eager consent as gardner had put it luckily she was no protractor of the capital act as i knew and i didnt even need to take my hoots off a quick plunge round the room horse artillery style and she was squealing her soul out and then it was beck to the winecup and exhausted ecstatic sighs mingled with tipsy murmurs about the loneliness of widowhood and what bliss it would be to have a man about the house again fairly incoherent you understand but not to be misunderstood so i responded with rapturous endearments you will abide with me always whispers she nuzzling in and i said id like to see anyone stop me just did did love her truly well to be sure i did she muttered something about writing to hardinge and i thought by george thatll spoil his toast and coffee for him no error but mostly it was fond drunken babble and clinging kisses before she turned over and began to snore well thats that and youve done your duty thinks i its did repaired the sweet disorder in my dress and slid out with a last backward glance at that jolly rump glistening in the lamplight i imagined you see that i was looking my last on her and i do like to carry away happy memories but twenty minutes later when jassa and i were fretting impatiently in the schoolroom and gardner was damning manglas tardiness in bringing young dalip in comes a waiting woman to say that the kunwari and the maharaja were awaiting us in her drawingloom this was a fine apartment close by the boudoir and there was the mother of all sikhs enthroned in her armchair as respectable a young matron as ever you saw and not more than halfsoused how the deuce shed got into parade order in the time was beyond me she was soothing young dalip who was standing by in a black fury and a childs sari with veil and bangles and a silk shawl round his small shoulders dont look at me cries he turning his face away and she petted him and kissed away his tears whispering that he must be a maharaja for he was going among the white queens soldiers and must do credit to his house and people and this goes with you the symbol of your kingship says she and held out a silver locket with the great kohinoor glittering in a bed of velvet she closed the case and hung its chain about his neck guard it well dearest for it was your fathers treasure and remains your peoples honour with my life mama sobs he and hung upon her neck she wept a little holding him close and then stood up and led him to me flashman sahib will take care of you says she so mind you obey him in all things farewell my little prince my own darling she kissed him and put his hand in mine god speed you sahib until we meet again she extended a hand and i kissed it one warm glassy look she gave me with that little curl of her thick lips she was swaying slightly and her waiting woman had to step lively to steady her then gardner was bustling us away with jassa carrying dalip for greater speed and it was bundleandgo down to the palki in the little court with mangla at my elbow insisting that his majesty must eat no oranges for they gave him the trots and here was a lotion for the rash on his arm and a letter for the governess who must be engaged for him in india a kashmiri lady gentle and wellread if one can be found but not some stern english memsahib for he is but a little fellow i have written of his diet and his lessons kidnapping aint just a matter of lifting the infant you see and on my other side gardner was snarling that the gates would be closing in half an hour we bundled dalip into the palki and now he was blubbering that he didnt want to go and clinging to mangla and gardner was fuming while two of his black robes scouted ahead to see that all was clear and jassa and i got between the shafts and mangla kissed me quickly on the cheek leaving a drift of perfume as she hurried away and gardner turned to me in the fading light of the little court due southeast forty miles jupindar rocks snaps he i guess we wont see you in lahore again mr flashman if i was you id stay well south of the sutlej for the next fifty years or so and that goes double for you josiah you stretched your luck doctor come nigh me again and im liable to snap it for you jao yes you an the continental congress retorts jessa go change your sentries gardner thats your sort jao i say growls gardner and the last i remember of him is the brown hawk face with its fierce moustache twisted in a sour grin under the tartan puggaree we came down to the buggywalla doudy just as the sun was dipping behind the badshai musjit mosque through the bustling noisy crowds all unaware that the two stalwart palkibearers were spiriting their ruler away to the enemy and him moping fretfully behind the curtains in his little sari and bangles ahmed shah was in a foul humour because hed had to sell two of our beasts leaving only five besides our own screws which meant only one remount for the four of us we slung the palki between two of the led horses and when i put my head in to see how dalip did he whimpered something piteous oh flashman sahib when can i put off these garments of shame see mangla has put my mans clothes in this bag aye and cakes and little sweets she always remembers says he and his lip came out why could she not come with us now i shall have no song before i sleep and he began to weep i wish mangla were here mangla youll note not mama well id not have turned her away myself see here maharaj whispers i youll put on your own clothes directly and ride with us like a soldier but now you must stay close and quiet and when we come to journeys end see what i have for you i was far enough within the palki to slip the cooper from my sash for an instant and he squeaked and fell back on the cushions covering his eyes in joy we passed under the rushnai arch even as the chowkidars were crying the curfew and skirted the city walls to the little stand of white poplars crimson in the last of the sunset in the gloaming they were beyond eyeshot of the gate and we lost no time in rousting out little dalip for i wanted him in the saddle without delay so that we could abandon the cumbersome palki and put distance between us and lahore he tumbled out eagerly tearing off his sari and veil and scattering his bangles with childish curses and was shivering in his vest while jassa helped him into his little jodhpurs when there was a clatter of hooves and out of the deepening dusk came a troop of gorracharra making for the city in haste before the gates closed there was no time to hide the imp we must stand pat while they cantered by and then their officer reined up staring at the sight of a halfclad infant surrounded by three burly copers and their beasts where away at this hour horsesellers cries he i answered offhand hoping to keep him at a distance for even in the fading light it was ten to one hed recognise his own monarch if he came any closer amritsar captain sahib says i we take my masters son to his grandmother who is ill and calls for him hurry yakub or the child will catch cold this to jassa who was helping dalip into his coat and thrusting him up into the saddle i swung aboard my own screw with my heart pounding ignoring the officer hoping to heaven the inquisitive brute would ride on after his troop who had vanished into the twilight wait he was sitting forward staring harder than over and with a thrill of horror i realised that dalips coat was his ceremonial cloth of gold packed by that imbecile mangla and even in that uncertain light proclaiming its wearer a most unlikely companion for three frontier ruffians your masters son you say lets have a look at him he wheeled his horse towards us his hand dropping to his pistol butt and the three of us acted as one man jassa vaulted into his saddle and snatched dalips bridle even as i slashed my reins across the beasts rump and ahmed shah dug in his heels and charged slap into the advancing sikh rolling him from the saddle then we were away across the maidan dalip and jassa leading ahmed and i behind with the led horses thundering alongside there was a shout from the dusk and the crack iii a shot and little dalip yelled with delight dragging his bridle from jassas grip i can ride fellow let me alone aicc shabash shabash there had been nothing else for it with detection certain and as i pulled out my compass and roared to jassa to change course to port i was reckoning that no great harm had been done we were on fresh horses while the gorracharra had been in the saddle all day it would take time to mount any kind of pursuit from the city supposing they thought it worth while with night coming down the odds were theyd make inquiry first to see if any child of a wealthy family was missing for i was sure the officer had taken us for common kidnappers hed never have risked a shot at us if hed known who dalip was and if by some astonishing chance it was discovered that the mahajara had taken wing well wed be over the river and far away by then i called a halt after the first couple of miles to tighten girths take stock and make certain of my bearing and then we rode on more slowly it was pitch dark by now and while we might have trotted on a road we darent go above a brisk walk over open country the moon wouldnt be up for six or seven hours yet so we must contain ourselves in the sure knowledge that the dark was our friend and no pursuers could hope to find us while it lasted meanwhile we bore on southeast with dalip asleep in the crook of my arm what with distress and elation he was quite used up and being lulled by tom bowling instead of manglas song didnt trouble him a bit is this how soldiers sleep yawns he then you must wake me when it is my time to ride guard and you shall rest it was a wearisome trek and a cold one hour after hour in the freezing dark but at least it was without alarm and by the time we had put twenty miles behind us i was convinced that there would be no pursuit at about midnight we pulled up to water the horses at a little stream and stamp some warmth back into our limbs there was a faint starshine over the doab now and i was remarking to jassa that wed be able to raise the pace when ahmed shah called to us he was squatting down by a big peepal tree with his sabre driven into the trunk just above the ground and his finger on the foible of the blade i exclaimed for i knew that trick of old from gentleman jim skinner on the road above gandamack sure enough after a moment ahmed shook his head looking grim horsemen husoor twenty perhaps thirty coming south they are a scant five cos behind us if im a firm believer in headlong flight as a rule its probably because ive known such a horrid variety of pursuers in my time apaches in the jornada udloko zulus on the veldt cossacks along the arrow of arabat amazons in the dahomey forest chink hatchetmen through the streets of singapore no wonder my hairs white but there are times when you should pause and consider and this was one no one was riding the bari doab that night for recreation so it was a fair bet that the inquisitive officer had deduced who our costlyclad infant was and that every rider from the lahore garrison was sweeping the land from kussoor to amritsar still we had spare mounts so a sprain or a cast shoe was no matter our pursuers must be riding blind since even an australian bushman couldnt have tracked us on that ground seven miles is a long lead with only fifteen to go and there were friends waiting at the finish even so having your tail ridden is nervous work and we didnt linger over the next few miles not pausing to listen and keeping steadily southeast when the moon came up we changed to our remounts ahmeds ear to the ground detected nothing and there was no movement on the plain behind us it was fairly open country now with a few scrubby thickets occasional belts of jungle and now and then a village when i reckoned we had only about five miles to go and still three hours to dawn we eased to a walk for dalip had awoken demanding food and after wed halted for a bite and there was still no sign of pursuers it seemed sensible to go at a pace that would let him sleep of course he wouldnt and kept up such a stream of questions and drivel that i came close to fetching him a clip over the head i didnt mind you for it dont pay to offend royalty however junior they grow up there was still no sign of the jupindar rocks and i guessed wed come a degree or two off course so i climbed the first tall tree we came to for a dekko about the moonlight gave a clear sight for miles around and sure enough about three miles to our left the ground rose in a long slope to a summit of tangled rocks jupindar for certain and i was just preparing to swing down when i took a last look astern and almost fell out of the tree wed just come through a jungly strip and behind it the doab lay flat as a flagstone to the horizon halfway across it a bare mile away a line of horsemen were coming at the canter a full troop well spread in line only regular cavalry ride like that and only when theyre searching i was out of that tree like a startled monkey yelling to jassa who was standing guard while young dalip squatted in the bushes the little bastard must have had an orange cached somewhere for hed done his bit three times since midnight a precious minute was lost while he got himself to rights bleating that he wasnt done yet and jassa fairly threw him into the saddle then we were away drumming across the doab for those distant rocks where unless gardner had lied friends were waiting there was a mile of scrub and trees before the rocks came into view at the top of a long incline dotted with sandy hillocks and there far off on our flank the first of the pursuing horsemen were clearing the jungle a faint halloo sounded on the frosty air and now it was a straight race for jupindar before they could head us off it was going to be closerun for with our southeast course having carried us wide we were having to cut back at an angle while the pursuing troop had only to make straight forrard there was nothing in it for distance the best horsemen would be first to the post and these were lancers i could make out the long poles thank god little dalip could ride seven years old spoiled garrulous and loosebowelled he might be but he could wear my colours in the national any day he lay flat to his beasts neck talking to it when he wasnt squealing with excitement his long hair flying as he took the jumps over the little dry nullahs that crossed our course he led me by a length with jassa and ahmed pounding on my quarters as we breasted the slope for the last mile we were gaining but there wasnt a sign of life from the rocks looming ahead god had gardners people failed at the rendezvous i loosed a warning shot from my cooper and in the same moment i saw dalips horse stumble for a moment i thought he was gone but there must have been a dash of cumanche in him for he let the bridle go clutching the mane the horse made a long stagger and recovered but it was dead lame and hobbling and as i swept by i swung him clear by his waistband heaving him across before me out of the tail of my eye l saw the lancers swinging up the slope a bare furlong behind us jassas pistol cracked and dead ahead glorious sight riders were racing down from the jupindar rocks two long files at the gallop riding wide one circling in behind us and the other swinging out in a great arc to envelop our pursuers i never saw it better done there were five hundred of em if there was one gorracharra by the look of them and going like thunderbolts there were yells of confusion in our rear and as i steadied my screw and looked back the lancers were closing on each other in fair disorder sewn heat as a cat in a bag by those two lines of irregular horsemen enclosing them front flanks and rear well met by moonlight thinks i you have some capable pals gardner little dalip had scrambled to a sitting position before me clapping and piping cheers at the top of his voice and jassa and ahmed were reining up alongside there was a hail from above and ahead of us and i saw that there was a narrow gorge in the rocks and at its mouth a little knot of horsemen in mail and with lanced pennons overhead a standard was fluttering and to the fore was a burly old stager in spiked helm and steel backandbreast who raised a hand and roared a greeting salaam maharaj salaam flashman bahadur satsreeakal his companions took up the cry advancing to meet us but did had eyes only for their leader grinning all over his ruddy face and white whiskers sitting his pony at ease for all that he had only one foot in the stirrup the other swathed in bandages rested in a silken sling hanging from his saddlebow well met again afghankiller cries goolab singh sure people would meet us gardner had said and like a simpleton id taken his word without a thought he was such a squareshooting white man you see and i was so used to thinking of him as a faithful ally and friend well hed saved my hide twice that id clean overlooked that he had other allegiances in the tangled web of punjabi politics well hed done me brown and hardinge and lawrence wed plucked dalip singh out of lahore just so that he could be dropped into the lap of the whiskered old bandit beaming at me across the fire think not harshly of gurdana khan says he soothingly he has not betrayed thee or the malki lat rather has he done thee a service i can see me convincing sir henry hardinge of that says i of all the doubledyed yankee fakers nay nay now only consider mai jeendan rightly fearing for her sons safety wished to put him under british protection good on her behalf gurdana khan set the thing in train with your folk good but then as my friend and agent he bethought him that the child would be even better in the keeping of myself why because once the khalsa heard that their king was in the hands of the british they would smell treason aye they might even cut mai jeendans pretty throat and set up some new maharaja who would carry on this plaguey war for years he wagged his wicked head looking smug but now when they learn that i the admired goolab hold the child they will think no evil why they have lately offered me the throne and the wazirship and command of the khalsa and i know not what so well do they respect me but i have no such ambitions what to king it in lahore and find a quick grave like jawaheer and all those other fortunate occupants of that throne of serpents not i friend kashmir will do for me the british will confirm me there but never in lahore you think they will after this youve used us and gardners aided and abetted you and what harm is done the child is as safe with me as in his mothers bosom safer by god there is less traffic and when this war is over i shall have the credit of leading him by the hand into the presence of the malkilat crows the old villain think of the good will i shall earn i shall have proved my loyalty to my maharaja and the british alike and id been sneaking about lahore fort in peril of my life conspiring and kidnapping and being hounded by khalsa lancers just so that this ancient iniquity could cut a dash in the last act why the devil did gardner have to bring us into it at all couldnt you have lifted the boy for yourself mai jeendan would never have allowed it she trusts me not says he shrugging all innocentlike only to flashman bahadur would she yield up her precious ewe lamb ah what it is to be young and straight and lusty and british he twinkled at me approvingly shaking with laughter and refilled my cup with brandy your health soldier what we have stood together you and i and heard the cold steel sing youll never grudge old goolab the chance to stand well with your masters that was gammon for one thing id no choice and the plain fact was that in dalip the only maharaja acceptable to all parties he now held the trump card hed been trafficking with us for months while hedging his bets with the khalsa and now that the dice had finally fallen in our favour he was making sure that he could dictate his own terms and hardinge could only swallow it and look pleasant why shouldnt he with dalip and jeendan secure in lahore and goolab confirmed in kashmir the northwest frontier would be safe as never before and it will be only for a day or two at most he went on then i shall take dalip maharaja and place him in the sirkars arms aye flashman the war is done the khalsa is bought and sold and not by tej singh only they think themselves secure in their strong position at sobraon where even the jangi fat can hardly assail them be his guns ever so big they still dream of sweeping on to delhi he leaned forward grinning like a fat tiger and even now plans of those fine fortifications are on their way to white coat gough aye by tomorrow your engineers will know every trench and tower every rampart and gun emplacement in that fine trap the khalsa have built for themselves in the elbow of the river their fortress their coffin rather for not a man of them shall escape and the khalsa will be no more than an evil memory he filled his cup again drank and licked his lips pickwick in a puggaree nodding benevolently at me that is my gift to your government bahadur is it enough think you will it set the seal on kashmir for me theres a point you know where treachery is so complete and unashamed that it becomes statesmanship given a shift of fortune at moodkee or ferozeshah and this genial evil old barbarian would have been heart and soul with the khalsa leading em on to delhi no doubt as it was he was ensuring their slaughter and revelling in the prospect like the cruel savage that he was i often wish i could have introduced him to otto bismarck a fine matched pair theyd have made well he had shored up his credit with our side sure enough with little dalip in his hands for good measure that was his affair and i wished him joy of it my own concern was that id failed in my own immediate mission thanks to him and gardner and what was i going to tell hardinge why that ye had the child safe but were hard pressed by khalsa riders when in the nick of time came loyal goolab to snatch thee and him to safety is it not true after all and perforce ye must leave the lad with goolab who would nowise part with him fearing for his safety with all these khalsa bravos loose about the country he chuckled and drank again wiping his whiskers you never saw roguery so pleased with itself it will make a brave tale so that ye tell it right he fixed me with a meaning eye it will profit us all flashman sahib i asked pretty sour how it could profit me and he gave me a leery look what would ye have that the king of kashmir can give when he comes into his own there is rich employment if you wish it up yonder aye and a warm welcome from that bonny widow my goodsister think on it bahadur ironic wasnt it a queen hoping to wed me a king offering me golden rewards when all my worldly ambition was to step from colaba causeway to the deck of a homewardbound indiaman and never see their dirty dangerous country again i could just thank my stars id come this far to this snug camp under jupindar rocks testing and boozing by goolabs fire with little dalip fast asleep in a tent close by and the khalsa lancers disarmed and under guard theyd taken it without a murmur once theyd discovered who their captor was thus far in safety and in the meantime all i could do was slope off over the river and report failure to hardinge hed enjoy that to my surprise i slept sound at jupindar and it was after noon when i broke the news to dalip that he would not be coming with me to the sirkars army after all but must stay awhile with his kinsman goolab singh until it was safe for him to go home to mama id expected a royal tantrum but he took it without a blink of those great brown eyes nodding gravely as he looked about the camp aswarm with goolabs followers aye i see how it is they are many and you are but three says he may i have my pistol now flashman bahadur that rattled me i confess here he was not two chamberpots high lifted in disguise from his mothers palace fired on and pursued through the dark and cold left in the hands of a ruffian of whom he could have heard nothing but evil and all that concerned him was the promised pepperbox no doubt sindiawalla princelings were used alarm and excursion from the cradle and god knows how much children understand anyway but it struck me that whatever faults dalip singh developed in later years funk wouldnt be one of them quite aweinspiring he was we were standing apart from the others while goolab drank his morning toddy on a rug outside his tent watching slantendicular and jassa and ahmed lounged by the horses i beckoned ahmed and took out the cooper dalip watching roundeyed as i drew the six loads i showed him the mechanism and set the gun in his small fist he had to grip well up the stock to get his finger near the ring ahmed shah will keep these rounds for you maharaj says i and load them at your need i can load says majesty struggling manfully with the cylinder and i would have the pistol charged i cannot shoot thieves and badmashes with an empty toy i assured him there were no thieves about and he gave me a fortyyearold look and that fat bearded one yonder the dogra whom you call my kinsman mangla says he would steal the droppings from a goat this boded well for goolabs guardianship no error now see here maharaj raja goolab is your friend and will guard you until your return to lahore which will be soon and ahmed shah here will bide with you also he is a soldier of the sirkar and my comrade so you must obey him in all things which was stretching it for i hardly knew ahmed but he was a broadfoot pathan and the best i could do to him i said on thy head yusufzai and he nodded and tapped his hilt dalip looked at him critically can he help me to shoot the gun at need well then so be it but that great belly yonder is still a thief i will stay with him and mind him but i will not trust him he may guard me and yet rob me too because i am little i le was examining the cooper as he delivered his judgment sotto voce on goolabs character but then he stuck the pistol in his sash and spoke clear in his shrill treble a gift for a gift bahadur bow your head wondering i stooped towards him and to my amazement he lifted the heavy silver locket from about his neck mid threw the chain over my head and for a moment his little arms locked tight holding me and i felt him tremble and his tears suddenly wet on my face i will be brave i will be brave bahadur whispers he sobbing but you must keep it for me till you come again to lahore then set him down and he stood rubbing his eyes angrily while goolab came limping to apologise for intruding on his majesty but it was time we were all on our various roads did asked where he would take the maharaja and he said no farther than pettee a few miles off where his fighting men were assembling he had brought forty thousand down from jumoo in case the jangi lat should need assistance against these rebel dogs of the khalsa haply we may cut them up as they flee from sobraon then and he bowed as far as his belly would let him we must see to it that your majesty has a new army of true men dalip took this with a good grace whatever he may have been thinking it was time to go and jassa mounted alongside me that was the moment when i knew for certain that he hadnt been party to gardners little plot hed seemed as stunned as i was to find goolab singh waiting at jupindar but that might have been acting the fact that he was riding back to hardinge with me was proof of his innocence i gave a last salutation to dalip standing very small and steady apart from old goolab and then jassa and i rode south from jupindar rocks with our tails between our legs if you like and two million pounds worth of crystallised carbon round my neck he was a canny infant and wise beyond his years young dalip wasnt he just he knew goolab wouldnt dare harm his person but his property was another matter if the old fox had guessed the kohinoor was within reach then that wondrous treasure would surely have found its way to kashmir and in his infant innocence dalip had passed it to me for safekeeping i brooded on that as we trotted south over the doab in the misty afternoon with jupindar fading from sight behind us and the distant green that marked the sutlej coming into view ahead by rights i should have been deciding where to cross and calculating our bearing from sobraon where presently all hell would be let loose but having the most precious object in the world bobbing against your belly concentrates the mind wonderfully it aint just the fearful responsibility either all kinds of mad fancies flit by not to be taken seriously you understand but food for wild imaginings like bleaching your hair and striking out for valparaiso under the name of butterworth and never looking near england again two million quid lord love us aye but how dyou dispose of a diamond the size of a tangerine not in amsterdam probably to some swindling shark whod set the traps after you i could picture myself going mad in a garret gibbering at a treasure i was too windy to sell but if you could and disappear gad the life you could lead estates palaces luxury by the bucket gold cigarboxes and silk drawers squads of slaves and battalions of willing women visions of xanadu and babylon and unlimited boozing and frolic no steak and kidney ever again though and no elspeth no sunny days at lords or strolls along the haymarket no hunt suppers or skittle pool or english rain or horse guards or quarts of homebrewed oh for elspeth bare and bouncing and a jug of october and bread and cheese by the bed all the jewels of golconda cant buy you that even supposing you had the nerve to bolt with them which i knew i had not no pinching kohinoor is like putting tother side in to bat you wont do it but theres no reason why you shouldnt think hard about it where you aim to cross lieutenant says jassa and i realised hed been gassing since we left jupindar full of bile against gardner and id hardly taken in a blessed word i asked him as one who knew the country where we were about five miles noreast of nuggur ford says he he sobraon ghats less than ten miles due east see that smokell be from the sikh lines he pointed to our left front and on the horizon above the distant green you could see it hanging like a dark mist we can scout the nuggur an if it aint clear we can cast downriver a piece he paused leastways you can something in his tone made me look round into the six barrels of his pistol hed reined in about ten feet behind me and there was a hard fixed grin on his ugly face what the hell are you about cries i put that damned thing up no sir says he now you sit right still cos i dont wish to harm you no dont start to holler an tear your hair neither just slip off that locket an chain an toss em over this way lively now lor a moment id been all at sea id forgotten you see that hed been there when jeendan had shown the stone to dalip and put it round his neck and again when dalip had passed the locket to me then you confounded fool i yelped halflaughing you cant steal this dont bet on it now you do as i say dye hear i was riding ahmed shahs screw with two long horse pistols in the saddle holsters but id no notion of reaching for them for the thing was wild hadnt i been turning it over academiclike for the past hour harlan youre daft says i look man put up that pepperbox and see reason this is the kohinoor and the punjab why yould not get twenty miles yould be running your head into a noose mr flashman you can shut up says he and the harsh face with its ghastly orange whiskers looked like a scared apes now sir you pass that item across directly or hold on says i and lifted the tarnished silver case in my hand hear me a moment i dont know how many carats this thing weighs or how you think you can turn it into cash even if you get clear of the sikhs let alone the british army good god man the mere sight of it and youll be clapped in irons you cant hope to sell youre trying my patience mister an youre forgetting i know this territory for a thousand miles around bettern any man alive i know jews in every town from prome to bokhara who can have that rock in twenty bits quickern you can spit he threw back his puggaree impatiently and raised the pistol and for all his brag his hand was shaking i dont want to shoot you out of the saddle but i will by the holy will you says i gardner said you wouldnt do murder but he was right about your being a thief that he was cries he an if you paid heed to him you know my story he was grinning like a maniac ive followed fortune half a lifetime an taken every chance i found i aint about to miss the best one yet an you can set the british an the punjab in a roar after me theres a war to finish an more empty trails between kabul an katmandu an quetta than anybodys ever thought of cept me ill count to three his knuckle was white on the ring so i slipped the chain over my neck weighed the locket a moment and tossed it to him he snapped it up by the chain his feverish eyes never leaving me for a second and dropped the locket into his boot his chest was heaving and he licked his lips highway robbery wasnt his style i could see now you climb down an keep your hands clear o those barkers i dismounted and he sidestepped in and seized my reins youre not leaving me afoot and unarmed for gods sake i cried and he backed his horse away covering me still and drawing my mount with him youre lessn two hours from the river says he grinning more easy now youll make it safe enough well lieutenant we had our ups an downs but no hard feelings my side fact im almost sorry to part youre my sort you know he gave a highpitched laugh thats why im not offering you a partnership in kohinoor unlimited did wouldnt take it how long have you been planning this bout twenty minutes here catch hold he unslung the maggie from ahmeds saddle and threw it towards me hot day have a drink on me he wheeled his horse and was off at the gallop making north with my screw behind leaving me alone on the doab i waited until the scrub hid him and then turned and ran at full speed in the direction of nuggur ford there was a belt of jungle that way and i wanted to be in cover as i ran i kept my hand cupped to my side feeling the reassuring bulge of the kohinoor under my sash i may daydream occasional but when im carrying priceless valuables in the company of the likes of dr josiah harlan i slip em out of sight in the first five minutes you may be sure if hed had the wit to open the locket well that would have been another story but if hed had that much wit hed not have been reduced to running errands for broadfoot in the first place the fact is for all his experience of rascality jassa was a prentice hand the man who would be king but never was only the other day my little greatniece selina the pretty one whose loose conduct almost led me to commit murder in baker street but thats another story remarked to me that she couldnt abide dickens because his books were full of coincidences i replied by telling her about the chap who lost a rifle in france and tripped over it in west africa twenty years later and added for good measure an account of my own strange experience after i parted from harlan in the doab that was coincidence if you like and damnably mixed luck too for while it may have saved my life it also landed me centre stage in the last act of the punjab war once i reached the jungle belt chortling at the thought of jassa stopping presently to gloat over his booty i went to ground even when he found out hed been diddled hed never dare come back to look for me so i decided to stay put and cross the river when night fell in my kabuli attire i could pass for a gorrachar well enough but the less i was seen the better so i planned to leave my jungly lair a couple of hours before dusk slip down to the river swim across it wasnt above four hundred yards wide and lie up on the far shore until daylight it began to rain heavily towards evening so i was glad enough of my shelter and only when the light began to fade did i venture out onto a beaten track leading down to the sutlej it took me through a little wood and i was striding boldly along eager to catch a glimpse of the river when i rounded a bend in the trees and there not twenty yards ahead was a troop of regular khalsa cavalry with their beasts picketed and a fire going it was too late to turn back so i walked on prepared to pass the time of day and pick up the shave and only when i was almost on them did i notice six or seven bodies hanging from trees within the wood i bore up in natural alarm and that was fatal they were already looking towards me and now someone yelled an order and before i knew it i had been seized by grinning sowars and hauled into the presence of a burly daffadar standing by the fire a messtin in his hand and his tunic unbuttoned he eyed me malevolently brushing crumbs from his beard another of them growls he gorracharra are you aye the faithless rabble and what tale have you got to tell tale daffadar sahib says i bewildered why none i heres a change most of you have sick mothers at which all his louts hooted with laughter well gorrachar wheres your horse your arms your regiment he suddenly threw the messtin aside and slapped me across the face back and forth your honour you cowardly scum it struck the sense out of me for a moment and i was starting to babble some nonsense about being waylaid by bandits when he hit me again robbed were you and they left you this he snatched the silverhilted persian knife from my boot liar youre a deserter like those swine there he jerked a thumb at the swinging corpses and i saw that most of them were wearing some remnants of uniform well you can muster with them again carrion hang him up it was so brutally sudden so impossible i wasnt to know that for weeks theyd been hunting down deserters from half the regiments of the khalsa stringing them up on sight without charge let alone trial they were dragging me towards the trees before i recovered my wits and there was only one way to stop them daffadar i shouted youre under arrest for assault on a superior officer and attempted murder i am katte khan captain and aide to the sirdar heera sing topi of courts division it was a name from months ago the only one i could think of you i snapped at the goggling sowar holding my left arm take your polluting hand away or ill have you shot ill teach you to lay hands on me you damned povinda brigands it paralysed them as the voice of authority always does they loosed me in a twinkling and the daffadar openmouthed even began to button his tunic we are not of the povinda division silence wheres your officer in the village says he sullenly and only halfconvinced if you are what you say if give me the lie will you i dropped my voice from a bellow to a whisper which always rattles them daffadar i do not explain myself to the sweepings of the gutter bring your officer jao now he was convinced ill take you to him captain sahib youll bring him i roared and he leaped back a yard and sent one of the sowars off at the gallop while i turned on my heel and waited with my back to them so that they shouldnt see that i was shaking like a leaf it had all been so quick carefree one minute condemned the next that there hadnt been time for fear but now i was fit to faint what could i say to the officer i cudgelled my wits and then there was the sound of hooves and i turned to see the coincidence riding towards me he was a tall finelooking young sikh his yellow tunic stained with weeks of campaigning he reined in demanding of the daffadar what the devil was up swinging out of the saddle and striding towards me and to my consternation i knew him and any hope of maintaining my disguise vanished for it was long odds hed recognise me too and if he did a wild thought suddenly struck me and before he could speak i had drawn myself up bowed and in my best verandah manner asked him to send his men out of earshot my style must have impressed him for he waved them away sardul singh says i quietly and he started im flashman you escorted me from ferozepore to lahore six months ago its vital that these men should not know im a british officer he gasped and stepped closer peering at me in the gathering dark what the devil are you doing here i took a deep breath and prayed ive come from lahore from the maharani this morning i was with raja goolab singh who is now at pettee with his army i was on my way to the malki lat with messages of the highest importance when by ill chance these fellows took me for a deserter thank god its you who wait wait says he you are from lahore on an embassy then why this disguise why envoys dont travel in uniform these days says i and pitched my tale as urgent as i knew how look i should not tell you but i must there are secret negotiations in hand i cant explain but the whole future of the state depends on them i must get across the river without delay matters are at a most delicate stage and my messages where are they where eh oh lord above theyre not written theyre here i tapped my head which youll agree was an appropriate gesture but you have some passport surely no no i cant carry anything that might betray me this is the most confidential affair you see believe me sardul singh every moment is precious i must cross secretly to a moment says he and my heart sank for while the fine young face wasnt suspicious it was damned keen if you must pass unseen why have you come so close to our army why not by hurreeke or south by ferozepore because hardinge sahib is with the british army across from sobraon i had to come this way yet you might have crossed beyond our patrols and lost little time he considered me frowning forgive me but you might be a spy there have been many scouting our lines i give you my word of honour im no spy what i say is true and if you hold me here you may be dooming your army to death and mine and your country to ruin by god i was doing it purple but my only hope was that being a welleducated aristocrat he must know the desperate intrigue and dealing that were woven into this war and if he believed me hed be a damned bold subaltern to hamper a diplomatic courier on such a vital errand alas though subalterns minds travel a fixed road and his was no exception faced with a momentous decision my dashing escort of the lahore road had turned into a slave of duty and safety this is beyond me he shook his handsome head it may be as you say but i cannot let you go i have not the authority my colonel will have to decide i made a last desperate cast that would be fatal if word of the negotiations gets out theyre bound to fail there is no fear of that my colonel is a safe man and he will know what to do relief was in his voice at the thought of passing the parcel to higher authority yes that will be best ill go to him myself as soon as our watch is ended you can stay here so that if he decides to release you it can be done without trouble and you will have lost little time i tried again urging the necessity for speed imploring him to trust me but it was no go the colonel must pronounce and so while he trotted back to his squadron post in the village i must wait under guard of the glowering daffadar and his mates resigned to capture of all the infernal luck at the last fence for it mattered not a bean whether his colonel believed my cockandbull story or not hed never speed me on my way without going higher still and god alone knew where that might end theyd hardly dare mistreat me in view of the tale id told even if they disbelieved it theyd not be mad enough to shoot me as a spy at this stage of the war surely mind you some of those akali fanatics were bloodthirsty enough for anything on such jolly reflections i settled down to wait in that dripping little camp for it was raining heavily again and either the colonel had gone absent without leave or sardul spent an unconscionable time gnawing his nails in indecision for it must have been well into the small hours before he returned by that time worn out with wet and despair he had sunk into a doze and when i came to with sardul shaking my shoulder i didnt know where i was for a moment all is well cries he and for a blessed second i thought he was going to speed me on my way i have spoken with the colonel sahib and told him of your diplomatic duty he dropped his voice glancing round in the firelight the colonel sahib thinks it best that he should not see you himself another reckless muttonhead ripe for staff college plainly he says this is a high political matter so i am to take you to tej singh come i have a horse for you if hed told me they were going to send me on shooting leave to ooti id have been less astonished but his next words provided the explanation the colonel sahib says that since tej singh is commanderinchief he will surely know of these secret negotiations and can decide what should be done and since he is in the camp below sobraon he will be able to send you to the malki lat with all speed indeed you will be there sooner than if i released you now that was what id talked myself into sobraon the very heart of the doomed khalsa yet what else could i have done when youve just been within an ace of being hanged out of hand youre liable to say the first thing that comes to mind and id had to tell sardul something still it could have been worse at least with tej id be safe and hed see me back to hardinge fast enough flag of truce a quick trot across no mans land and home in time for breakfast aye provided the dogs of war didnt come howling out of the kennel in the meantime what had goolab said a day or two at most before gough stormed the khalsa lines in the last great battle well lets be off hey cries i jumping up the sooner the better you know how far is it can we be there before first light he said it was only a few miles along the river bank but since that way was heavy with military traffic we would be best to take a detour round their positions still we should be there soon after dawn we set off in the rainy dark the whole troop of us he was taking no chances on my slipping my cable and my bridle was tied firmly to the daffadars pommel it was black as sin and no hope of a moon in this weather so we went at little better than a walk and before long i had lost all sense of time and direction it was my second night in the saddle i was weary and sore and sodden and fearful and every few moments i nodded off only to wake with a start clutching at the mane to save myselffrom falling how far we came before the teeming downpourceased and the sky began to lighten i cant tell but presently we could see the doab about us with wraiths of vapour hanging heavy over the scrub ahead a few lights were showing dimly and sardul reined up sobraon but it was only the village of that name which lies a mile or two north of the river and when we reached it we must turn sharp right to come down to the khalsas reserve positions on the northern bank beyond which the bridge of boats spanned the sutlej to the main sikh fortifications on the southern side hemmed in by goughs army as we wheeled and approached the rear of the reserve lines fires were flickering and massive shadows looming in the mist ahead and now we could see the entrenchments on either flank with heavy gun emplacements commanding the river which was still out of sight to our front as we trotted through a sea of churned mud to the lines trumpets were blaring the standto the sikh drums were beginning to rattle troops were swarming in the trenches and from all about us came the clamour and bustle of an army stirring like a giant rousing from sleep i didnt know nor did they as drum and trumpet called them that the khalsa was answering its last reveille but even as we entered the rearmost line from somewhere far beyond the grey blanket mantling the northern shore ahead of us came another sound stunning in its suddenness the thunder of gunfire echoing along the sutlej valley in a continuous roar of explosions shaking the ground underfoot reverberating through the mists of morning beyond our view on the southern shore an old irishman in a white coat was beating his shillelagh on the khalsas door and with a sinking heart i realised that i had come a hare hour too late the battle of sobraon had begun the best way to view a clash of armies is from a hotair balloon for not only can you see whats doing youre safely out of the line of fire ive done it once in paraguay and theres nothing to beat it provided some jealous swine of a husband doesnt take a cleaver to the cable the next best place is an eminence like the sapoune at balaclava or the bluffs above little bighorn and if i can speak with authority about both those engagements its not so much because i was lashing about in the thick of them as that i had the opportunity of overlooking the ground beforehand sobraon was like that the northern bank of the sutlej at that point is higher than the southern giving a sweeping view of the whole battlefield and miles beyond i wasnt to see it for another hour or so for when the cannonade began sardul called a halt and left me in the care of his troop while he dashed off to see what was up we waited in the clammy dawn while the sikh support troops stood to inspection in the trenches and gun emplacements about us and the gunners stripped the aprons from their heavy pieces piling the cartridges and rolling the big pound shot on to the stretchers all ready to load they were cool hands those artillerymen manning their positions quiet and orderly the brown bearded faces staring ahead towards the battle of barrages hidden beyond the river mist sardul came spurring back spattering the mud wild with excitement goughs batteries were hammering the fortifications on the southern shore but doing little harm and the sikh gunners were giving him shot for shot presently he will attack and be thrown back cries sardul exultantly the position is secure and we may go down in safety to tej singh come bahadur it is a splendid sight a hundred and fifty great guns thunder against each other but your jangi lat has blundered his range is too long and he wastes his powder come and see i believed him knowing paddy i could guess he was banging away just to please hardinge but couldnt wait for the moment when he would turn his bayonets loose that must be soon by the sound of it even if hed brought the whole magazine from umballa he couldnt keep up such a barrage for long never in all india has there been such a fight of heavy suns cries sardul their smoke is like a city burning oh what a day to see what a day he was like a boy at a fair as he led the way down through the silent gun positions and presently we came to a little flat promontory where a group of sikh staff officers were mounted very brave in their dress coats they spared us not so much as a glance for at that moment the mist lifted from the river like a raised curtain and an astonishing sight was unfolded before us twenty feet below the bluff the oily flood of the sutlej was swirling by in full spate the bubbling brown surface strewn with ramage which was piling up against the great bridge of boats four hundred yards long and anchored by massive chains that spanned the river to the southern shore there in a halfmoon a full mile in extent the khalsa lines lay in three huge concentric semicircles of ramparts ditches and bastions there were thirty thousand fighting sikhs in there the cream of the punjab with their backs to the river and seventy big guns crashing out their reply to our artillery positions a thousand yards away over the whole sikh stronghold hung an enormous pall of black gunsmoke and above the widespread distant arc of our guns a similar pall was hanging thinner and dispersing more quickly than theirs for while their batteries were concentrated within that milewide fortress our sixty pieces were scattered in a curved line twice as long and sardul was right their range was too great i could see our mortar shells bursting high over the sikh positions and the heavy shot throwing up fountains of red earth but causing little damage far to the right we had a rocket battery in action the long white trails crisscrossing the black clouds and some fires were burning at that end of the sikh lines but all along the forward fortifications the khalsa gunners were blazing away in style paddy wasnt going to win the shootingmatch that was certain even amidst the din of the cannonade we could hear them cheering in the entrenchments across the river and the blare of their military bands with drums throbbing and cymbals clashing and then the salvoes from the british guns died away and the smoke cleared over our distant positions the trumpets in the sikh camp were sounding the ceasefire and presently the last wraiths dispersed above their positions also and sam khalsa and john company looked each other in the eye across a halfmile of scrubby plain and patchy jungle like two boxers when their seconds and supporters have left off yelling abuse and each scrapes his feet and flexes his arms for the onset with the enemy snug behind his ramparts it was for gough to make the first move and he did it in classic style with a straight left sardul caught at my arm pointing and sure enough far off on our right front steel was glinting through the last of the mist he had a little spyglass clapped to his eye but now he passed it to me and my heart raced as i saw the white capcovers and red coats spring into close vision in the glass circle the fixed bayonets gleaming in the first sunlight the officers and drummers to the fore the colour stirring in the breeze i could even make out the embroidered x but it can only have been in imagination that i heard the fifes sounding the gamekeeper was watching us for him we did not care for we can wrestle and fight my boys and jump oer anywhere as the tenth lincoln came on in line their pieces at the port with the horse guns bounding past their flank and alongside them the shakos and white belts of the native infantry and then another british colour but i couldnt make out which and again our guns began to crash as paddy poured his last rounds of covering fire over their heads and the dust billowed up on the khalsas right front the sikh batteries exploded in a torrent of flame and i saw our line stagger and recover and come on again before the clouds of smoke and dust hid them from sight on the extreme right a great body of horse emerged from the entrenchments swinging wide to charge our rocket batteries whose missiles were weaving in above the advancing infantry and exploding on the breastworks the sikh horse rounded our flank and went for the rocket stand like irishmen on holiday but the battery commander must have seen his danger and given the word to raise the frames for he let them come to pointblank range before loosing the whole barrage at ground level whizzing in to burst among the horsemen and the charge dissolved in a cloud of white smoke and orange flame the staff men beside us were suddenly shouting and pointing while goughs left wing was closing through the smoke on the sikhs right front out on the plain beyond the scrub and jungle there was a stirring in the heat haze tiny figures red blue and green were coming into view long extended lines of them with the horse guns in the intervals between i swung the glass on them and here were the yellow facings of the th there the buff of the st everywhere the red coats and crossbelts of the native infantry the red and blue of the queens own on the flank the dark figures of the th lancers and the blue coats and puggarees of the bengali horsemen the crimsonstreaked plumes of the rd lights the little goblin figures of the gurkhas trotting to keep up and even as i watched there was a flash of silver rippling along their front as the great leafbladed knives came out the whole of our army was on the move towards the centre and left of the khalsas position twenty thousand british and native foot horse and guns coming in against odds of three to two and the sikhs heavy metal was ranging on them kicking up the dustplumes all along the great arc of our advance now all the forward entrenchments were exploding sweeping the ground with a hail of grape and canister blotting out the scene in a thick haze of dust and smoke i caught my breath in horror for it was ferozeshah all over again with that raving old spudwalloper risking everything on the sabre and the bayonet hand to hand but then the sikhs had been groggy from moodkee in positions hastily dug and manned while now they were entrenched in a miniature tones vedras with ditchanddyke works twenty feet high enfiladed by murderous camelswivels and packed with tulwarswinging lunatics fairly itching to die for the guru you cant do it paddy thinks i it wont answer this time youll break your great t hick irish head against this fortress of shot and steel and have your army torn to ribbons and lose the war and never see tipperary again you benighted old bogtrotter you come calls sardul and i tore my eyes away from that billowing mirk beyond which our army was advancing to certain death and followed him down the muddy slope to the bridge of boats they were big barges lashed thwart to thwart and paved with heavy timbers which made a road as straight and solid as dry ground hollo says i theres a white sapper in the woodpile damn him for no punjabi ever put this together we drummed across with the troop at our heels and came into the rear of the khalsa position their last line of defence where the general staff directed operations aides hurried to and fro between the tents and hutments carts of wounded rumbled through to the bridge and all was activity and uproar but it was a disciplined bedlam i noticed in spite of the deafening crash of guns and musketry rolling back from the lines there was a knot of senior men grouped round a great scale model of the fortifications i caught only a glimpse of it but it must have been twenty feet across with every trench and parapet and gun just so and a splendid old whitebearded sirdar with a mail vest over his silk tunic was prodding it with a long wand and bellowing orders above the din while his listeners despatched messengers into the sulphurous reek which blotted out everything beyond fifty yards and made the air nigh unbreathable this was clearly the high command but no sign of tej singh general and guiding spirit of the khalsa god help it until i heard his voice piercing the uproar at full screech three hundred and thirtythree long grains of rice he was shouting then get them idiot am i a storekeeper fetch a sack from the kitchen run you pervert son of a shameless mother close by the bridgehead was a curious structure like a huge beehive about ten feet high and built of stone blocks before it in full fig of gold coat turbaned helmet and jewelled swordbelt stood tej himself he wasnt above ten yards from the staff conference but they might have been in bombay for all the heed each paid to the other before him cringed a couple of attendants a chico held a coloured brolly over his head and at a table near the beehives entrance an ancient wallah in an enormous puggaree was studying charts through a magnifying glass and making notes watching the scene with some amusement was an undoubted european in kepi shirtsleeves and a goatee beard that is what i saw through the drifting smoke and confusion the following above the thunder of the great battle in which india was being lost and won is what i heard and its stark truth ancient wallah the inner circumference is too small according to the stars it must be thirteen and a half times the girth of your excellencys belly tej my belly what in gods name has my belly to do with it aw it is your excellencys shelter and must be built in relation to your proportions or the influence of your planets will not sustain it i must know your circumference taken precisely about the navel european a metre and a half at least here this is marked in english inches tej i am to measure my belly at such a time european what else have you to do the sirdars have the defence in hand and my fortifications will not be overrun if they are properly manned by the way three hundred and thirtythree long grains of rice make about three and a quarter english yards aw the measurement must be exact european a grain of rice may be exact in the stars astrologer but not on earth anyway three yards of stone will stop any missile the british are likely to throw at us aw not if the circumference is too small it must be enlarged european or the general must lose weight tej damn you hurbon and who in satans name are you and what do you want for by this time sardul singh was before him saluting and then whispering urgently tej gave a start and turned an uncomprehending stare at me as though id been a ghost then he recovered beckoned me urgently and dived into the beehive i followed and found myself in a tiny circular chamber stuffy and stinking from a single oil lamp tej wrenched the door to and the sound of battle died to a distant murmur he fairly clutched at me his chops wobbling is it you my dear friend ah thank god is this thing true is there a secret negotiation i told him there wasnt that it was a lie id told sardul on the spur of the moment and he let out a great wail of dismay then what am i to do i cannot control these madmen you saw them out yonder they pretend that i do not exist and take my command away the mutinous swine sham singh directs the defence and your army will be dashed to pieces i did not seek this engagement why oh why did gough sahib force it upon me he began to rave and curse beating his fat fists on the stone if the jangi lat is beaten what will become of me i am lost i am lost and he subsided on the floor a quaking blubber in his gold coat weeping and railing against gough and sham singh and jeendan and lal singh and anyone else he could call to mind i didnt interrupt him it may have been the sudden quiet of that little refuge but for the first time in hours i found myself able to think and was deep in fearful calculation for here i was by the strangest turn of fate prisoner in the heart of the enemys camp at the supreme moment of imperial crisis while all yet hung in the balance and a small voice in my coward soul was telling me what had to be done only to think of the risk set me shaking anyway it all depended on one thing i waited until tejs lamentation reached a high pitch slid quietly out of the beehive closed the door and looked about me my heart racing everywhere was choking confusion with visibility a poor twenty yards but round the command group was a cheering press of sikhs dancing and waving tulwars so our first attack had failed although the pounding of gunfire was as deafening as ever a horse artillery team came clattering from the bridge a wounded officer his blue coat sodden with blood was being carried past by servants the european hurbon was mounting a pony and riding off into the smoke the old astrologer was still muttering over his charts but the one thing for which id been hoping had come to pass sardul singh and his troop having done their duty by delivering me were gone and with all attention directed towards the deathstruggle just up the road no one was paying the least heed to the big kabuli badmash scratching himself furtively outside the commanderinchiefs funkhole it was my heavensent chance to act on the inspiration which had come to me while tej blubbered at my feet i braced myself breathed a silent prayer took a dozen flying strides gathering speed as i went and with one last almighty bound hurled myself from the bank and plunged into the boiling flood of the sutlej according to the morning post or the keswick reminder i forget which i was pursued by a horde of furious foes whose discharges rent the waters about my head but the truth is that no one saw my spirited dash for freedom except a couple of dhobiwallahs slapping laundry in the shallows which just shows that you should never trust what you read in the papers why they even credited me with breaking free from my bonds and cutting down a couple of swarthy foemen in the course of my escape from the jaws of the seekh khalsa well i never said so the facts are as ive stated and while i may have embroidered em a little for henry lawrences benefit the lurid press accounts were pure gammon but its a journalistic law you see that heroes can never do anything ordinary when flashy the hector of afghanistan beats a reluctant retreat there must be an army howling at his heels or the public cancel their subscriptions you knowing the truth of my inglorious evasion may cry out in disgust at my desertion in the hour of need well good luck to you i shant even remark that twould have served no purpose to stay or pretend that if there had been a bomb handy id have paused to heave it at the khalsas high command before lighting out someone would have been sure to notice i was intent only on flight and the sutlej called to me as i ploughed frantically away from the bank i was prepared to drift all the way to ferozepore if need be rejoicing in the knowledge that the flood was carrying me beyond the reach of foe and friend alike and so it might have done if the river hadnt been swollen seven feet above its normal level developing currents that bore me almost diagonally to the northern bank struggle as i might i couldnt stay in midstream for there was a terrific undertow that kept sucking me down and it was all i could do to stay afloat im a good swimmer but a river in spate is a fearsome thing and i was halfdrowned when i found myself in the northern shallows and struggled spewing and gasping on to the muddy shore i lay for a couple of minutes taking breath and when i peeped out from among the reeds there before me on the far side was the extreme flank of the khalsa fortifications with the bridge of boats a bare halfmile upstream which meant that on the bluff directly above me were the sikh reserve batteries wed passed through on the way in and if an idle gunner chanced to look over the edge there was i like a fish on a slab i burrowed through the reeds cursing my luck and crawled into the lee of the bluff which was about thirty feet high above me just below the overhanging lip was what looked like a sandy ledge if i could clamber up to it i should be hidden both from above and below so i began to climb the almost perpendicular bank gouging holds in the wet clay it was heavy going but my one fear was that at any moment a dusky head would pop over and challenge me nearing the top i could hear them chattering in the emplacements which fortunately were about twenty yards back from the edge i scrambled the last few feet with my heart in my mouth gained the ledge and was overjoyed to find that it extended back a good yard beneath the overhang in two shakes i was prone beneath the lip safe hidden but with a clear view for a mile upriver and across the khalsa position on the southern shore and there before my eyes was the great battle of sobraon any soldier will tell you that in the heat of a fight sights and sounds imprint themselves on your memory and stay vivid for fifty years but you lose all sense of time did can still see george pagets cheroot clamped in his teeth as he leaned from the saddle to haul me to my feet in the balaclava battery i can hear custers odd little cough as he rocked back on his heels with the blood trickling over his lip but how long those actions lasted god alone knows balaclava was twenty minutes they tell me and greasy grass about fifteen well i was through both start to finish and id have put them at an hour at least at sobraon where admittedly i was more spectator than actor it was tother way round from the moment sardul and i rode down to the bridge to the time i reached my ledge id have reckoned half an hour at most in fact it was between two hours and three and in that space while tej was bickering about the size of his hideyhole and i was swallowing the sutlej by the gallon sobraon was being lost and won this is how it was the attack by our left wing which id witnessed had been beaten back with heavy loss our advance on the other flank and centre had been intended as a feint but when paddy saw our left come adrift he changed the feint into a pukka assault through a murderous hail of fire somehow our men survived it and stormed the sikh defences along almost the whole curved front of two and a half miles and for nigh on an hour it was a hideous hackingmatch over the ditches and ramparts our people were repulsed time and again but still they forged ahead british and indian bayonets and gurkha knives against the tulwars with shocking slaughter no manoeuvring or scientific soldiering but handtohand butchery that was fighting as paddy gough understood it and werent the sikhs ready to oblige him they fought like madmen and perhaps that was their undoing for whenever an attack was beaten back they leaped down into the ditches to mutilate our wounded well you dont do that to atkins and sepoy and gurkha if you know whats good for you our people stormed back at em in a killing rage and when the scalingladders wouldnt reach they climbed on each others shoulders and on the piled dead and fairly pitchforked the sikhs out of their first line entrenchments almost without firing a shot good bayonet fighters will beat swordsmen and spearmen every time and they ran the sikhs back over two furlongs of rough ground to the second line where the khalsa gunners made a stand and then paddy showed that he was a bit of a general as well as a hooligan from my eyrie to the sikhs second line was a bare halfmile and i could see their gunners plain as day for the wind was streaming their smoke away downriver they were working their field pieces and camelswivels and musketry until they must have been redhot the line looked as though it was on fire so constant was the roar of the discharges sweeping the ground and almost blotting out in a duststorm the outer entrenchments from which our infantry and horseguns were trying to advance between the sikhs second line and the river the khalsa horse and foot were reforming in their thousands preparing to counterattack if the chance arose gough made sure it never did directly across from me there was a sudden colossal explosion in the flank entrenchments of the second line bodies were flying like dolls a fieldgun went cartwheeling end over end and a huge pillar of dust arose like a genie from a bottle as it cleared i saw that our sappers had driven a great cleft in the ramparts and through it who should come trotting but old joe thackwell as easy as though he were in the row with a single file of rd lights at his heels wheeling into line as they cleared the gap behind them were the blue puggarees and white pants of the bengali irregulars and before the sikhs knew what was up joe was rising in his stirrups waving his sabre and the rd lights were sweeping down the rear of the gun positions brushing aside the supporting infantry sabring and riding down everything in their path in a moment the rear of the second line was a turmoil of men and horses with the sabres rising and falling in the sunlight and into it the bengalis drove like a thunderbolt farther down the line our infantry were pouring over the ramparts a wave of red coats and bayonets and all in a moment the whole line had caved in and the khalsa battalions were falling back to the third line of entrenchments a bare two hundred yards from the river they werent running though they retired like guardsmen pouring volley after volley into our advance while the bengalis and dragoons harried them front and flank and our horseguns came careering through the outer lines to unlimber and turn their fire on the doomed sikh army for it was done at last solid as a rock it looked as it stood in the elbow of the river squares formed squadrons ordered standards raised and the ground before it heaped with its dead but it was hemmed in by an enemy who had overcome odds of three to two by sheer refusal to be stopped and it had lost its guns now as the horse artillery and field pieces cut great lanes in its ranks it could reply only with musketry and steel to the charges of our horse and the steady advance of our infantry it swayed and fell back almost step by step contesting every inch and i looked to see the standards come down in token of surrender but they didnt the khalsa the pure was dying on its feet with its sirdars and generals scrambling up on the broken entrenchments willing it to stand firm i even made out the tall figure of the old warhorse id seen directing the high command he was up on a shattered gun carriage his white robes gleaming in the sunlight shield on arm and tulwar raised like some spirit of the khalsa and then the smoke enveloped him and when it cleared he was gone then they broke it was like a dyke bursting with first a trickle of men making for the river and then the main body giving back and suddenly that magnificent host that id gaped at on maian mir had dissolved into a mass of fugitives pouring back to the bridge of boats spilling into the river on either side of it or trying to escape along the banks in a few moments the whole length of the bridge was jammed with struggling men and horses and even gunteams vainly trying to win across the sheer weight of them and the force of the stream caused the great line of barges to bend downriver like a gigantic bow drawn to the limit it swayed to and fro halfsubmerged with the brown water boiling over it like a weir and then it snapped the two ends surged apart and the milling thousands were pitched into the flood in an instant the whole width of the river beneath me was alive with men and beasts and wreckage sweeping past it was like a lumberjam when great areas of the water cannot be seen for the whirling mass of logs but here the logs were men and horses and a great tangle of gear bound together by the force of the current upturned barges black with men clinging to them were dashed against each other rolling over and over to be lost in the spray or flung onto the mudbanks for the first time above the din of the firing i could hear human sounds the shrieks of wounded and drowning men some may have lived through that first appalling maelstrom when the bridge gave way but not many for even as they were carried downstream our horse artillery were tearing along the southern shore unlimbering and wheeling their pieces to rake the river from bank to bank with grape and canister churning it into a foaming slaughterhouse the yankees talk of shooting fish in a barrel that was the fate of the khalsa floundering and helpless in the sutlej farther up beyond the bridge the carnage was even worse for there the water was shallower and as the great closepacked mass of fugitives struggled neckdeep to cross the ford they were caught in a murderous crossfire of musketry and artillery even those who managed to reach the north bank were caught in the deadly hail of grape as they struggled ashore and only a few im told managed to scramble away to safety below me bodies both still and struggling were being borne past or swept ashore by a brown tide hideously streaked with red while the shot lashed the water around them close to the shore where the current bore in most strongly the sutlej was running blood directly across from my position i could see the red coats of our infantry british and indian lining the banks firing as fast as they could load among them were horseguns and captured camelswivels pouring their fire into the stricken wreck of an army shots were slapping into the bank below me and i huddled back into my refuge flat on my face and instinctively clawing the soil as though to burrow into it how long it lasted i cant say ten minutes perhaps and then that hellish cannonade began to slacken a bugle on the far side was blowing the ceasefire and gradually the guns fell silent and the only sound in my halfdeafened ears was the river rushing past i lay for a good halfhour too shaken to drag myself from the bosom of mother earth and then i inched my way forward on the ledge and looked down below me as far as i could see on either hand the shore was thick with corpses some on the bank itself others washing to and fro in the crimson shallows more drifting by on the current out in the stream the low mudbanks were covered with them here and there a few were stirring but i dont recall hearing a single cry that was the uncanny part of it for on every other battlefield ive seen theres been a ceaseless chorus of screams and wails above the groaning hum of the wounded and dying here there was nothing but the swish of the stream through the reeds i lay staring down in the noon sunlight too used up to move and by and by there were no more bodies drifting down from the upper ford and the shattered bridgeheads and the smoking lines of sobraon then the vultures came but you wont care to hear of that and i didnt care to watch i closed my stinging eyes and rested my head on my arms listening to the distant thump of explosions from the other shore as the fires burning in the sikh lines reached the abandoned magazines the hutments at the bridgehead were burning too and the smoke was hanging low over the river if you wonder why i continued to lie there it was part exhaustion but mostly caution i knew there must be some survivors on my side of the water doubtless full of spleen and resentment and id no wish to meet them there was no sound from the reserve positions behind me and i imagined the sikh gunners had taken their leave but i wasnt stirring until i was sure of a clear coast and friends at hand i doubted if our lot would cross the river today john company would be dogtired binding his wounds taking off his boots and thanking god that was the end of it for it was over now no question in most wars you see killing is only the means to a political end but in the sutlej campaign it was an end in itself the war had been fought to destroy the khalsa root and branch and the result was lying in uncounted thousands on the banks below sobraon the sikh rulers and leaders had engineered it john company had executed it and the khalsa had gone to the sacrifice well salaam khalsa ji satsreeakal high time mind you for that little boy and for their salt gardners words came back to me as i lay on that sandy ledge letting the pictures of memory have their way as they will on the edge of sleep the bearded faces of those splendid battalions in review at maian mir and swinging down to the war through the moochee gate imam shah staring down at the petticoat draped across his boot maka khan grim and straight while the panches roared behind him to delhi to london that raging akali arm outflung in denunciation sardul singh shouting with excitement as we rode to the river the old rissaldarmajor tears streaming down his face and a red and gold houri wantoning it in her durbar teasing them in her cups cajoling them winning them so that she could betray them to this butchery standing halfnaked above the bleeding rags of her brothers body sword in hand i will throw the snake in your bosom well shed done all of that jawaheer was paid for and if you ask me what shed have thought if she could have gazed into some magic crystal that day and seen the result of her handiwork along the banks of the sutlej well i reckon shed have smiled drunk another slow draught stretched and called in rai and the python they say ten thousand khalsa died in the sutlej well i didnt mind and i still dont they started it and hell mend them as old colin campbell used to say and if you tell me that every mans death diminishes me ill retort that it diminishes him a hell of a sight more and if hes a khalsa sikh serve him right knowing me you wont marvel at my callousness but you may wonder why paddy gough as kindly an old stick as ever patted a toddlers head hammered em so mercilessly when they were beat and running well he had good reasons one being that you dont let up on a courageous adversary until he hollers uncle which the sikhs aint inclined to do and i wouldnt trust em if they did nor do you feel much charity towards an enemy who never takes prisoners and absolutely enjoys chopping up wounded as happened at sobraon and ferozeshah both even if gough had wanted to stop the slaughter i doubt if anyone would have heeded him but the best reason for murdering the khalsa was that if enough of the brutes had escaped the whole beastly business would have been to do again with consequent loss of british and sepoy lives thats something the moralists overlook when they cry pity the beaten foe what theyre saying in effect is kill our fellows tomorrow rather than the enemy today but they dont care to have it put to them like that they want their wars won clean and comfortable with a clear conscience well thats fine if youre sitting in the liberal club with a bellyful of port on top of your dinner but if you rang the bell and it was answered not by a steward with a napkin but an akali with a tulwar you might change your mind distance always lends enlightenment to the view ive noticed being uncomfortable close myself my one concern when id slept the night away was to slide out in safety and rejoin the army the difficulty was that when i crawled out of my refuge and stood up i tumbled straight down again and almost rolled over the ledge i had another go with the same result and realised that my head ached i felt shockingly ill and dizzy i was sweating like an aden collier and some infernal sutlej bug was performing a polka in my lower bowels dysentery in fact which can be anything from fatal to a damned nuisance but even at best leaves you weak as a rat which is inconvenient when the nearest certain help is twenty miles away for while i could hear our bugles playing charlie charlie across the river i wasnt fit to holler above a whimper let alone swim by moving mostly on hands and knees i made a cautious scout of the emplacements on the bank behind me luckily they were empty the sikh reserve having decamped taking their guns with them but that was small consolation and i was considering the wild notion of crawling down to the corpselittered bank finding a piece of timber and floating down to ferozepore ghat when out of the dawn mist came the prettiest sight id seen that year the blue tunics and red puggarees of a troop of native cavalry with a pink little cornet at their head i waved and yelped feebly and when id convinced him that i wasnt a fugitive gorrachar and received the inevitable heartwarming response we got along famously they were th lights from greys division which had been watching the river at attaree and had been ordered across the previous night as soon as gough knew he had the battle won more of our troops were invading over the ferozepore ghat and nuggur ford for paddy was in a sweat to secure the northern bank and tidy up the remnants of the khalsa before they could get up to mischief ten thousand had got away from sobraon with all their reserve guns and there were rumoured to be another twenty thousand up amritsar way as well as the hill garrisons far more than we had in the field ourselves but they aint worth a button now cries my pink lad the shave is that their sirdars have hooked it and theyre quite without supplies or ammunition and the hidin they got yesterday will have knocked all the puff out of em i dare say he added regretfully i say were you in the thick of it lor dont i just wish id had your luck of all the beastly sells to be ploddin up an down on river patrol and not so much as a smell of a sikh the whole time what id give for a cut at the rascals between his babble and having to totter into the bushes every halfmile while the troop tactfully looked the other way i was in poor trim by the time we reached nuggur ford where they slung me a hammock in a makeshift hospital basha and a native medical orderly filled me with jalap i gave my little fireeater a note to be forwarded to lawrence wherever he was describing my whereabouts and condition and after a couple of days in that mouldering hovel watching the lizards scuttle along the musty beams and wishing i were dead received the following reply political department camp kussoor february my dear flashman i rejoice that you are safe and trust that when this reaches you your indisposition will have mended sufficiently to enable you to join me here without delay the matter is urgent yrs c h m lawrence it gave me qualms i can tell you urgent matters were the last thing i needed just then but it was reassuring too for there was no reference to my dalip fiasco and i guessed that goolab had lost no time in advising lawrence and hardinge that he was looking after the lad like a mother hen still i hadnt covered myself with glory and knowing hardinges dislike of me it was surprising to find myself in such demand id have thought hed be happy to keep me at arms length until the peace settlement was concluded i knew too much about the whole punjabi mischief for anyones comfort and now that theyd be patching it all up to mutual satisfaction and profit with lofty humbug couched in fair terms neither side would want to be reminded of all the intrigue and knavery that had been consummated at moodkee and ferozeshah and sobraon things would be easier all round if the prime agent in the whole foul business wasnt leering coyly at the back of the durbar tent when they signed the peace and it wasnt just that id be a spectre at the diplomatic feast i suspected that hardinges aversion to me was rooted in a feeling that i spoiled the picture he had in mind of the whole sikh war my face didnt fit it was a blot on the landscape all the more disfiguring because he knew it belonged there i believe he dreamed of some noble canvas for exhibition in the great historic gallery of public approval a true enough picture mind you of british heroism and faith unto death in the face of impossible odds aye and of gallantry by that stubborn enemy who died on the sutlej well you know what i think of heroism and gallantry but i recognise em as only a born coward can but they would be there rightly on the noble canvas with hardinge stern and forbearing planting a magisterial boot on a dead sikh and raising a penitent awestruck dalip by the hand while gough addressed heaven with upraised sword before a background of cannonsmoke and resolute britons bayoneting gnashing niggers and mars and mother india floating overhead in suitable draperies dam fine well you cant mar a spectacle like that with a punch cartoon border of flashy rogering dusky damsels and spying and conniving dirty deals with lal and tej can you now however lawrences summons had to be obeyed so i struggled from my bed of pain removed my beard obtained a clean set of civilian linens hastened down to ferozepore by river barge and tooled up to kussoor looking pale and interesting with a cushion on my saddle while id been laid up with the dolorous skitters gough and hardinge had been prosecuting the peace with vigour paddy had the whole army north of the sutlej within three days of sobraon and lawrence had been in touch with goolab who now figured it was safe to accept openly the wazirship which the khalsa had been pressing on him and come forward to negotiate on their behalf there were still upward of thirty thousand of them under arms you remember and hardinge was on fire to come to terms before the brutes could work up a new head of steam for it was a ticklish position politically we simply hadnt the men and means as paddy had pointed out to conquer the punjab what was needed was a treaty that would give us effective control dissolve the last remnants of the khalsa and keep goolab jeendan and the rest of the noble scavengers content so hardinge with a speed and zeal which would have been useful months ago had his terms cut and dried and ready to shove down goolabs throat a mere five days after the war ended kussoor lies a bare thirty miles from lahore and hardinge had installed himself and his retinue in tents near the old town with the army encamped on the plain around as i trotted through the lines i could feel that air of contented elation that comes at the end of a campaign the men are tired and would like to sleep for a year but they dont want to miss the warm feeling of survival and comradeship so they lie blinking in the sun or rouse themselves to skylark and play leapfrog i remember the lancers at baseball and a young gunner sitting on a limber licking his pencil and writing to the dictation of a farriersergeant with his arm in a sling an tell sammy is dad as got a sikh sword wot e shall ave if es bin good an a silk shawl for is mum stay make that is dear mum an my best gel sepoys were at drill groups of fellows in vests and overalls were boiling their billies on the section fires the long tentlines and ruined mosques drowsed in the heat the bugles sounded in the distance the reek of native cooking wafted down from the host of campfollowers fifty thousand of them camped beyond the artillery park somewhere a colour sergeant was waking the echoes and a redhaired ruffian with a black eye was tied to a gunwheel for field punishment exchanging genial abuse with his mates stopped for a word with bob napier the sapper who had his easel up and was painting a bengali sowar sweating patiently in full fig of blue coat red sash and white breeches but took care to avoid gravedigger havelock who sat reading outside his tent it was all calm and lazy after sixty days of fire and fury in which theyd held the gates of india the army of the sutlej was at peace theyd earned it there were fewer of them than there had been and wounded in the ferozepore barracks against that theyd killed punjabis and broken the best army east of suez there was a great outcry at home by the way over our losses having seen the savagery of two of the four battles and knowing the quality of the enemy id say we were lucky the butchers bill was so small with paddy in charge it was nothing short of a miracle if there was an unbuttoned air about the troops headquarters resembled horse guards during a fire alarm hardinge had just issued a proclamation to say that the war was over it had all been the sikhs fault we desired no extension of territory and were fairly bursting with pacific forbearance but if the local rulers didnt cooperate to rescue the state from anarchy hmg would have to make other arrangements so there in consequence messengers scurried clerks sweated armies of bearers ran about with everything from refreshments to furniture and bouquets of new young aides lounged about looking bored no doubt im uncharitable but ive noticed that as soon as the last shots fired platoons of these exquisites arrive as by magic vaguely employed hawhawing fortissimo pinching the gin to make cocktails and stinking of pomade there was a group outside lawrences tent all guffaws and flywhisks i say you feller says one cant go in there major aint receivin civilians today oh please sir says i uncovering its most awfully important you know if youre sellin spirits says he go an see the what dye call him tommy oh yaas the khansamah the butler to you snooks who shall i say sent me says i humbly major lawrences doorkeepers mind your manners my man cries he who the devil are you anyway flashman says i and enjoyed seeing them gape no no dont get up you might land on your arse and speaking of butlers why dont you go and help baxu polish the spoons i felt better after that and better still when lawrence at first sight of me dismissed his officewallahs and shook hands as though he meant it he was leaner and more harassed than ever in his shirtsleeves at a table littered with papers and maps but he listened intently to the recital of my adventures and dismissed my failure to deliver dalip as of no account not your fault snaps he in his curt style goolab writes that the boy is well thats all that matters anyway thats past my concern is the future and what i have to tell you is under the rose clear he fixed me with that gimlet eye pushed out his lantern jaw and pitched in sir henry hardinge doesnt like you flashman he thinks youre a whippersnapper too independent and careless of authority your conduct in the war with which im well pleased let me tell you doesnt please him broadfoot antics you understand i may tell you that when he learned that goolab had got the boy he spoke of courtmartialling you even wondered if you had acted in collusion with gardner thats the curse of indian politics they make you suspect everyone anyway i soon disabused him for an instant ill swear the dour horse face was triumphant then he was glowering again at all events he doesnt care for you or regard you as reliable my own sentiments about hardinge exactly but i held my peace now goolab singh comes here tomorrow to learn the treaty terms and im sending you to meet him and conduct him into camp thats why i summoned you you have the old foxs confidence if anyone does and i wish that to be seen and known especially by sir henry he maynt like it but i want him to understand that you are necessary is that clear i said it was but why because when this treaty is settled i cant tell you the terms theyre secret until goolab hears them it is likely that a british presence will be required at lahore with a resident to keep the durbar on a tight rein ill be that resident and i want you as my chief assistant coming from the great henry i guess it was as high a compliment as wellingtons handshake or one of elspeths ecstatic moans but it was so unexpected and ridiculous that i almost laughed aloud thats why im putting you forward now goolab will be the йminence grise and if he is seen to respect and trust you it will help me to win the gg over to your appointment he gave a sour grin they dont call us politicals for nothing ill have to persuade currie too and the rest of the calcutta wallahs but ill manage it when i think of the number of eminent men and women who have taken me at face value and formed a high opinion of my character and abilities it makes me tremble for my countrys future i mean if they cant spot me as a wrong un who can they spot still its pleasant to be well thought of and has made my fortune at the expense of some hellish perils and minor difficulties such as conveying tactfully to henry lawrence that i wouldnt have touched his disgusting proposal with a long pole my prime reason being that i was sick to loathing of india and the service the sikhs and bloody carnage and deadly danger and being terrified and bullied and harried and used when all i wanted was the fleshpots of home and bulling elspeth and civilised women and never to stir out of england again i darent tell him that but fortunately there was a way out thats most kind of you sir says i im honoured deed i am but im afraid i have to decline whats that you say he was bristling in an instant ready to fight with his own shadow if it contradicted him was hml i cant stay in the punjab sir and now that the wars over i intend to go home do you indeed and may i ask why he was fairly boiling its not easy to explain sir id take it as a favour if youd just allow me to decline with regret i assure you ill do no such thing cant stay in the punjab indeed he calmed abruptly eyeing me is this because of hardinge no sir not at all im simply applying to be sent home he sat back tapping a finger youve never shirked so there must be a good reason for this this nonsense come man what is it out with it very well sir since you press me i figured it was time to explode my mine the fact is you aint the only one who wants me at lahore there is a lady there who has intentions honourable of course and well it wont do you see shes good god im probably the only man who ever made henry lawrence take the name of the lord in vain not the maharani yes sir shes made it perfectly plain im afraid and im married you know for some reason god knows what i added mrs flashman wouldnt like it a bit he didnt say anything for about three minutes dyou know im sure the blighter was absolutely wondering what advantage there might be to having the queen mother of the punjab panting for his assistant theyre all alike these blasted politicals finally he shook his head and said he took my point but while it ruled out lahore there was no reason why i should not be employed elsewhere no sir says i firmly im going home if necessary ill sell out perhaps it was that i hadnt got over my illness but i was sick and tired and ready for a standup tight if he wanted one i think he sensed it for he became quite reasonable and said he would see to it he wasnt a bad chap you know and quite halfhuman as he showed towards the end of our conversation i can see that you might furnish me with material for another romantic novel says he looking whimsical tell me is the lady as personable as they say he wasnt the only one to ask me that kind of question it has been my fate to make the acquaintance of several mysterious beauties who excited the randy interest of my superiors i recall elgin going quite pink with curiosity about the empress of china and the gleam in the eyes of colin campbell and hugh rose when they crossexamined me about the rani of jhansi lincoln and palmerston too i told lawrence she was a little stunner but given to alcoholic excess and on no account to be trusted political information you see but no lascivious details he said hed be interested to meet her and i advised him that gardner was his man youll conduct goolab singh at least says he which i didnt mind since it was sure to infuriate hardinge and the next afternoon found me trotting out along the lahore road in uniform again to meet the elephant train bringing the khalsa emissaries down from loolianee lawrence had told me that they were to be shown no ceremony and i should wait about half a mile out and let them come to me for forms sake but they halted a good mile from the town and i could see the mahouts picketing the beasts and tents being raised for the sirdars while a small body of gorracharra mounted guard about them i continued to sit my pony waiting and presently i saw a solitary horseman cantering down towards me and it was goolab himself he gave a wave and a great bellow of salaam soldier as he drew rein alongside grinning all over his rogues red face and taking my hand to my surprise he was wearing no armour or finery only a simple robe and turban it is not for the envoy of a beaten foe to come in state and pride says he i am but a poor suppliant seeking mercy from the malki lat and so i dress the part and a single soldier comes to meet me albeit a distinguished one ah well these are hard times i asked him where dalip was in good hands a wilful child who shows me no respect he has been too much among women so doubtless they will be his downfall some day presently i shall bring him leading him by the hand remember he chuckled and looked sly but only when the treaty is agreed beyond peradventure until then i keep the bird in my hand we were moving at a walk towards the kussoor lines for he seemed in no hurry indeed fora man bound on a delicate embassy he was uncommon carefree joking and making small talk with an air of great contentment only when i mentioned that id be going home in a day or two did he rein up in astonishment but why when fortune awaits you here no not that royal slut in lahore fort gurdana has told me of that you would not be such a fool as well mate with a krait but in kashmir with me he was grinning and frowning together did you doubt me when i promised you a golden future yonder regiments to command a generals rank lordships and revenues gurdana has accepted already aye he leaves lahore to come to me and why should not you is the bloody lance of afghanistan less of a soldier than gurdana or that dogdirt harlan who lorded it under runjeet or avitabile and the rest he struck me on the shoulder and we have stood up together you and i and who stands with goolab has a friend if that was how he remembered our scuffle in the lahore alleys let him but wasnt there a movement to recruit flashy these days just reputation and credit theres no currency to touch them lawrence goolab even a queen setting her cap at me aye but they aint home i thanked him explaining politely that i wasnt a soldier of fortune and he shook his head threw up his great shoulders and let it go i asked him if he was so sure of getting kashmir and he said it was in the treaty it was my turn to stare but the terms are secret you dont know em yet do i not oh not from lawence sahib or any of your people he rumbled with laughter is this the punjab and shall i not know what passes a treaty of sixteen articles whereby the durbar will give up to britain the sutlej banks and the jullundur doab and keep only a kutch khalsa of a mere bayonets and horse and pay a mighty indemnity of a million and a half sterling he burst out laughing at my amazement you need not tell lawrence sahib and the malki lat that i know it all let them sleep at nights but if you should it is no matter they will keep the bargain because it is all they need a rich province of the punjab to punish us and show the world the folly of challenging the sirkar a tiny feeble khalsa oh aye to be commanded by that lion among warriors tej singh with lal as wazir and a submissive durbar to do your bidding with dalip and his mother obedient puppets handsomely subsidised to be sure so the punjab remains free but its mistress is the white queen i didnt doubt his information in a land of spies there are no secrets and it was the best of bargains for us control without conquest one thing though i couldnt see how on earth is the lahore durbar to pay a fine of a million and a half theyre bankrupt aint they assuredly so having no money they will pay in kind by ceding kashmir and the hill country to the british and well give you kashmir for services rendered he sighed no you will sell me kashmir for half a million your countrymen dont overlook opportunities for profit and they say the jews are sharp the price is not mentioned in the treaty nor is another item which is to be surrendered as a token of punjabi good faith and loyalty whats that you have heard of our mountain of light kohinoor the great diamond of golconda well that too is to be taken from us as a trophy for your queen ye dont say her majestys share of the loot eh well well let her have it says goolab magnanimously to the strong the prize and to the patient goldbought slave kashmir hardinge evidently hadnt been warned that i was infesting headquarters again for he started visibly when i ushered goolab into the big durbar tent and darted an indignant glance at lawrence there was a fine gallery including mackeson who had narrowly lost the agents post to lawrence after broadfoots death currie the government secretary and any number of calcutta wallahs as lawrence had called them as i presented his highness the raja goolab singh i could almost read hardinges mind conspiracy he was thinking the little buggers been wangling a year lease on the khyber pass he was all frost and dignity to goolab who truckled like a good un leaning on a stick and making much of his gouty foot in the hope of being asked to sit which he wasnt hardinge returned his greeting with a formal statement conveying that the terms which he would shortly hear had been designed to cut the punjab down to size and they could think themselves lucky to get off so lightly he then turned the old chief over to currie and lawrence who would explain the treaty and they took him off hardinge gave me another cold glare and for a moment i thought he was going to address me but he changed his mind from the way the calcutta toadies sniffed and eyed me askance i could see that the word was out that flashy was a bad penny so i lit a cheroot hoping to be rebuked i wasnt so i tooled out to take the air lawrence had told me that morning that i should go down to umballa the following day so when i left the durbar i made a few calls to collect letters and any trinkets that my comrades might want transported quicker and safer than the army post you see there was general lamentation at my departure and dear old paddy gough absolutely called me into his command tent and insisted on my having a glass with him the best men always get kilt or married or retire says he pledging me yeve done the last two flashman my son heres wishin you never do the first which reminds me did ye give that neckercher back after ferozeshah ye did nott ye lightfingered young divil would ye believe it smith a staff galloper that plunders his own ginerals effects in the presence o the inimy he did though ye nivver saw the like o that in the peninsula ill be bound this was to harry smith looking more like wellington than usual never trust a political says he health flashman and as they drank dye know i felt quite moved for paddy had been having some conference or other and his marquee was full of leading men joe thackwell and gilbert with his arm in a sling from sobraon and the gravedigger and younger fellows like edwardes and johnny nicholson and rake hodson and hope grant well tisnt every day you have your health drunk by chaps like those their talk was all of sobraon of course the gravedigger had had his fifth horse of the campaign shot out from under him and thackwell said theyd have to start charging him for remounts harry smith said it was the fourth worst scrap hed ever been in the first three being waterloo badajoz and new orleans in that order which set them arguing old mgregor the poulticewalloper enthralled me with a charming dissertation on the different effects on the frame of a musket ball and a grapeshot with a tasteful description of kneewounds and i made them laugh with my account of tej singhs funkhole and a modestly doctored version of my escape across the sutlej an i thought it was just sikhs we were shootin at cries hodson oh flashy if only wed known and in the midst of all the noise and laughter who should come mincing in but the little squirt of an aide with whom id bandied words outside lawrences tent the day before in that company youd have thought hed have slipped in quietly but he was fresh from eton or addiscombe or one of those shops for he marched straight up to paddys table took off his hat and in a shrill voice asked permission to deliver a message from the governorgeneral no compliments or anything of the sort but paddy at ease with his glass and supposing it was for him told him to fire away the squirt turned to me with a malicious glint in his eye mr flashman squeaks he and as he spoke the chatter died away altogether sir henry hardinge understands that you are leaving the army of the sutlej tomorrow he instructs me to tell you that your services are no longer required on his personal staff and that you are to consider yourself withdrawn from all military and political duties forthwith i am also to remind you that smoking in the durbar tent is strictly prohibited there wasnt a sound for a moment except mgregors wheezing then someone said good god and i dumbfounded by that deliberate insult uttered in the presence of the flower of the army somehow found the wit to reply quietly my compliments to the governorgeneral says i and my thanks for his courtesy thats all you can go he couldnt though while everyone after a stunned pause was talking to his neighbour loudly as though nothing had happened the gravedigger was looming over the squirt like an avenging angel boy thunders he and ill swear the lad quivered are you lost to propriety are you unaware that a personal communication is delivered in private outside sir this instant and when you have purged your insolence you may return to offer your apology to this officer and to the commanderinchief now go i was told pipes the oaf do you defy me roars havelock go and he went leaving me with my cheeks burning and black rage inside me to be spoken to in that company by a niddering green from the nursery and not a thing to be done about it but it couldnt have happened before better men in a moment they were laughing and prosing away and gough gave me a grin and a shake of the head harry smith got to his feet and as he passed out he clapped my arm and whispered hardinge never intended that you know and johnny nicholson and hodson rallied round and mgregor told a joke about amputations looking back i dont blame hardinge altogether with all his faults he knew what was fitting and i dont doubt that in his irritation at seeing me to the fore with goolab he had muttered something like that damned pup is everywhere leaving tomorrow is he not before time tell him hes suspended from duty before he does any more mischief and smoking too as though he were in a pothouse and charlie or someone passed it on and the squirt was given the message and thought to hand me a setdown he knew no better aye but hardinge should have seen that the thing was done decently dammit he could have sent for me himself and coupled rebuke with a word of thanks for my services whether he meant it or not but he hadnt and his creature had made me look a fool well perhaps two could play at that game in the meantime old goolab singh was closeted in talk with currie and lawrence and no doubt holding up his paws in horror as each successive clause of the treaty was put to him im sure he never let on that he knew it all beforehand but had a jolly time shaking his grizzled beard and protesting that the durbar would never agree to such harsh terms the negotiations went on all afternoon and evening leastways goolab did for currie gave up after a few hours and left him and lawrence lay down on his charpoy and pretended sleep it was all gammon for goolab was bound to agree in the end but he kept at it for appearances sake and didnt run out of wind till the small hours i was on hand indulging my satiable curiosity when lawrence saw him off but didnt speak to him he limped away from the tent climbed stiffly aboard his pony and trotted off towards the sirdars camp and that was the last i ever saw of him a burly old buffer on horseback looking like ali baba off to gather firewood in the moonlight all right and tight and ready to be signed when we come to lahore says lawrence prosy old beggar well pleased though if im a judge he should be you dont have a kingdom dropped into your lap every day hell bring the little maharaja to hardinge in a day or two he yawned and stretched looking at the night sky but by then youll be hasting home you fortunate fellow stay a moment and well have a rumshrub to set you on your way this was condescension for he wasnt sociable as a rule i took a turn along the tentlines as i waited admiring the moon shadows drifting across the empty doab and looking along the grey straight ribbon of the lahore road which god willing id never take again not long ago it had shaken to the tramp of a hundred thousand men and the rumble of great guns khalsaji to delhi to london and the march had ended in the burning ruins of ferozeshah and the waters under sobraon the whirlwind had come raging out of the five rivers country and now it was gone without a whisper and as lawrence put it i was hasting home hardinge had his peace and his hand on the reins of the punjab goolab had his kashmir britain her frontier beyond the sutlej where the hills began and the northern door of india was fast against the moslem tide little dalip would have his throne and his delectable mother the trappings of power and luxurious ease with all the booze and bedmen she desired tej singh and lal singh could enjoy the fruits of their treachery and old paddy had still nivver bin bate alick gardner would have his fine estate in the high hills beyond jumoo dreaming no doubt of far wisconsin and broadfoot and sale and nicolson their lines in the gazette maka khan and imam shah had their graves by sobraon ghat mangla was still the richest slavegirl in lahore and like to be richer i could feel a twinge at the thought of her and still do whenever i see black gauze and jassa had got an open road out of town which is usually the best his kind can ever hope for all in all not a bad little war would you say everyone had got what they wanted more or less perhaps in their own mad way even the khalsa twenty thousand dead sikh indian and british a lot of good men as gardner said but peace for the rest and plenty for the few which reminds me i never did discover what happened to the soochet legacy no one could foresee then that it would all be to do over that in three short years the sikhs would be in arms again paddys white coat would come out of the closet reeking of camphor and the bayonets and tulwars would cross once more at chillianwalla and gujerat and afterwards the union flag would fly over the punjab at last broadfoot could rest easy and the twicebeaten but neverconquered khalsa would be reborn in the regiments which stood fast in the mutiny and have held the rajs northern border all through my time for the white queen and for their salt the little boy whod exulted over my pepperbox and ridden laughing to jupindar rocks would live out a wastrel life in exile and mai jeendan the dancing queen and mother of all sikhs her appetite undiminished and her beauty undimmed would pass away of all places in england but all that happened another day when i was up the mississippi with the bailiffs after me my punjab story ends here and i cant croak for like all the others i too had my hearts desire a whole skin and a clear run home i wouldnt have minded a share of the credit but i didnt care that much most of my campaigns have ended with undeserved roses all the way to buckingham palace so i can even smile at the irony that when for once id done good service and come close to lying in the ground for it all i received was the cold shoulder to be meekly endured well more or less lawrence and i walked over to the big marquee which served as mess and diningroom everyone seemed to be there for hardinge had waited up for news of the treaty talk with goolab and he and the calcutta gang were enjoying a congratulatory prose before turning in lawrence gave me a quick glance as we entered as much as to say would i rather we went to his quarters but i steered ahead gough and smith and the best of the army were there too and i chaffed with hodson and edwardes while lawrence called up the shrub i downed a glass to settle myself and then took an amble over to where hardinge was sitting with currie and the other diploma tics good evening sir says i toadylike or good morning rather im off today you know ah yes says he stuffy offhand indeed well goodbye flashman and a safe journey to you he didnt offer his hand but turned away to talk to currie well thankee your excellency says i thats handsome of you may i offer my congratulations on a successful issue from our recent ah troubles and so forth he shot me a look his brow darkening suspecting insolence but not sure thank you snaps he and showed me his shoulder treaty all settled too i believe says i genially but loud enough to cause heads to turn paddy had stopped talking to gilbert and mackeson havelock was frowning under his beetlebrows and nicholson and hope grant and a dozen others were watching me curiously hardinge himself came round impatiently affronted at my familiarity and lawrence was at my elbow twitching my sleeve to come away good bandobast all round says i but one of the clauses will need a little arrangement i fancy well taint a clause exactly more of an understanding dont you know are you intoxicated sir i advise you to go to your quarters directly stone cold sober excellency i assure you the leith police dismisseth us british constitution no you see one of the treaty clauses or rather the understanding i mentioned cant take effect without my assistance so before i take my leave major lawrence be good enough to conduct this officer no sir hear me out do it the great diamond you see the kohinoor which the sikhs are to hand over well they cant do that if they havent got it can they so perhaps youd best give it em back first then they can present it to you all officiallike with proper ceremony here catch appendix i the sutlej crisis the origins of the first sikh war are not to be summed up in a few paragraphs flashman has given a reasonably fair account of the developing crisis from close range and perhaps all that can usefully be done is to stand farther back and try to balance some of the factors which seem specially important it is easy to say that with a powerful arrogant khalsa bent on invasion war was inevitable no one in the punjab could restrain them so what could the british do but prepare to meet the storm something according to cunningham a most respected historian who believed that while the khalsa took the initiative the british were mainly to blame for the war his conclusion has been eagerly seized on in some quarters but his argument boils down to the suggestion that britain an intelligent power faced with a half barbarous military dominion should have acted with more wisdom and foresight it is rather lofty even for and perhaps equally or partially would be fairer than mainly at the same time george bruce is certainly right when he accuses hardinge of mental paralysis and of making no rational move to prevent war he points to the massive failure of communication still considering the state of the lahore durbar and the motives at work among its principals perhaps britain should not be shouldered with too much of the responsibility granted that broadfoot was not the ideal man for the sensitive post of northwest agent like many britons he obviously felt that the sooner britain was running the punjab the better but then considering what had been happening north of the sutlej for years can he be blamed for that there is a tendency to cast him as the villain of the piece and certainly he was belligerently ready to make the worst of the situation but so were many on the other side jeendan and her associates wanted the khalsa destroyed and the khalsa was ready to rush to destruction it would have taken an agent of massive forbearance and a governorgeneral of genius which hardinge certainly was not to settle matters peacefully the impression one gets of the british peace lobby as personified by hardinge is that they wished the punjab would go away or rather that it would settle down into the strong disciplined stability it had known under runjeet singh but hardinge had no idea of how that was to be achieved on the sikh side one can understand their apprehension below the sutlej they were well aware was a giant who had shown an alarming tendency to conquest sind was a recent appalling example the sikh who did not take seriously the possibility that britain was bent on swallowing the punjab would have been a fool if he was objective he would see the logic of it that the company had neither the power nor the inclination for farther expansion would not be evident in lahore and the khalsa bellicose and itching for a slap at the reigning champion as they were they had some reason to suspect that if they didnt start the fight britain would these are very general observations and to every one of them can be added the qualification yes but one may scan broadfoots correspondence or the provocations offered from the sikh side in detail but weighing all such things as evenly as one can it seems that the war happened because it was actively desired by the khalsa with jeendan and others egging them on for deplorable reasons while on the british side there were some including hardinge who lacked foresight and flexibility and others who were ready with varying degrees of eagerness to let it happen it should be remembered too that the fighting men on either side underestimated each other for all their fears the british with far greater experience had a deep conviction of invincibility and while it was rudely shaken in the field it was justified in the end the khalsa seem to have had no doubts at all and even with the treachery of their leaders stacked against them they kept their confidence until the last moments of sobraon even then after the peace with the punjab a british protectorate the spirit of the khalsa remained they would come again the fuel was there in the british presence at lahore which began by protecting the position of the punjabs nominal rulers and ended by assuming power in the intrigues of jeendan and lal singh who found the new order of things less rewarding than they had expected but most of all perhaps in the abiding belief of the sikh soldiery that what they had nearly done once could be done at the second attempt the result was the second sikh war of which ended in complete british victory gough hesitant for once fought a costly action at chillianwalla and was about to be replaced but before his successor arrived he had won the decisive victory at gujerat the punjab was annexed dalip singh was deposed and as gardner had foretold britain inherited something infinitely more valuable than the punjab or the kohinoor those magnificent regiments whose valour and loyalty became a byword for a hundred years from the great mutiny to meiktila and the rangoon road appendix ii jeendan and mangla there is no way of verifying all flashmans recollections of maharani jeendan and her court one can say only that they are entirely consistent with the accounts of reputable contemporary writers a strange blend of the prostitute the tigress and machiavellis prince henry lawrence called her and he was right on all three counts strikingly beautiful brave wanton and dissipated a brilliant and unscrupulous politician and a quite shameless exhibitionist she would have been a darling of the modern tabloid press who could have invented nothing more sensational than the story of her rise to power and her exploitation of it she was born apparently about the daughter of runjeet singhs kennelkeeper and for the lurid details of her early life we are indebted to carmichael smyth he had much of his information from gardner who knew her well and greatly admired her and who has left an account of his own jeendans father was a sort of unlicensed jester to runjeet and pestered the maharaja with his daughter then only a child suggesting jokingly that she would make a suitable queen gardners version has runjeet taking her into his harem where the little beauty used to gambol and frolic and tease and managed to captivate him in a way that smote the real wives with jealousy she was sent to a guardian in amritsar when she was thirteen and went through a series of lovers before being brought back to lahore to enliven the night scenes of the palace in she went through a form of marriage with runjeet but continued to take other lovers with the maharajas knowledge and even his encouragement to give a detail of scenes acted in the presence of the old chief himself and at his instigation would be an outrage on common decency not surprisingly when dalip was born in there were doubts about his paternity but runjeet was happy to acknowledge him after the old maharajas death little is heard of jeendan until dalips accession in thereafter as queen mother and coregent with her brother she was occupied with intrigue pacifying the khalsa and what broadfoot agog for scandal called her misconduct and notorious immorality the agent said he felt more like a parish constable outside a brothel than a government representative compared her to messalina and was in no doubt that drink and debauchery had turned her mind no doubt he was ready to retail all the salacious gossip he ould get with the implication that such a corrupt regime called out for british intervention but even allowing for exaggeration there is no doubt that as khushwant singh puts it the durbar abandoned itself to the delights of the flesh and even before her brothers murder jeendan and her confederates were conspiring to betray the country for their safety and profit jawaheers death was what finally determined her to launch the khalsa to destruction thus did the rani plan to avenge herself on the murderers how she did it flashman recounts fairly and in greater detail than is to be found elsewhere it was a delicate dangerous operation which she managed with considerable skill and unlike many later war criminals she got away with it for a time at least after the war she continued as regent until the end of when under a new treaty the british resident at lahore was given full authority and jeendan was pensioned off she did not take it meekly and h ad to be removed from court dragged out by the hair in her own words and kept under guard suspected of conspiracy she was deported from the punjab and suddenly with discontent against the british rising she was a national heroine and the darling of the khalsa again but there was to be no happy return and when the second sikh war ended and dalip had gone into english exile she followed him she was only in her midforties when she died in and her son took her ashes back to india mangla was perhaps a more important influence on the lahore durbar than flashman realised the child of whiteslavers she was born about and sold by her parents when she was ten she worked in a brothel at kangra and was bought by a munshi as his concubine before setting up as a prostitute on her own account in lahore she prospered and became the mistress of one gulloo mooskee a personal attendant of runjeet singhs he passed her on to his nephew a lover of jeendans this was in and the two young women began a partnership in intrigue which was to last for many years p mangla became a member of runjeets harem and played a leading role in convincing him that he was the father of dalip singh in the next ten years she made herself indispensable to jeendan as adviser and gobetween became the lover of jawaheer singh and after his death obtained control of the treasury adding to her already considerable fortune less beautiful than her friend an mistress mangla had a pair of fine hazel eyes of which she could make a most effective use and an easy winning carriage and address mary and queen elizabeth who wore it at the coronation of her husband george vi it is now in her platinum crown in the tower the last male to wear the kohinoor little maharaja dalip singh had his share of misfortune deposed and exiled he saw the great diamond again when it was shown to him by queen victoria on his arrival in england and expressed pleasure that she should wear it he was sixteen at the time and unusually handsome and the queen was much taken with him unfortunately his good looks were not jeendans only legacy for he became a noted libertine to the queens distress and died poor portly and promiscuous in he is buried in the grounds of his home elveden hall suffolk notes a very extraordinary and interesting sight as the queen recorded in her journal on may whether at flashmans prompting or not the queen engaged two indian attendants in the following month one of whom was the pushing and acquisitive abdul karim known as munshi he became almost as great a royal favourite as the celebrated ghillie john brown had been and was even more unpopular at court munshi not only tutored the queen in hindustani which she began to learn in august but was given access to her correspondence blotted her signature and even buttered her toast at teatime he claimed to be the son of an eminent physician but investigation showed that his father was a prison pharmacist at agra there was as flashman says a very indian flavour to the queens jubilee celebrations of during her reign the population of the rest of the empire had increased from to while that of the subcontinent had risen from to a staggering the indian festivities began on february and ranged from illuminations and banquets to the opening of new libraries schools hospitals and colleges all over the country in gwalior all arrears of landtax were remitted in britain itself the celebrations did not reach their climax until june when the queen at the head of a procession led by the indian princes attended a service in westminster abbey there were loyal demonstrations everywhere and much rejoicing in the united states where the mayor of new york presided over a great festival of thanksgiving by robert wilson which has a detailed account of the jubilee victoria by stanley weintraub flashmans memory is slightly at fault here he was not as he says retired on halfpay at this time in fact he had been in singapore inspecting australian horses for the east india company army and it was during this visit that his wife elspeth was kidnapped by borneo pirates and the adventure began which culminated in the flashmans rescue from madagascar in june in the circumstances his failure to remember his exact military status is understandable as to his allowing himself to be bullied into going to india he may not have been quite as reluctant as he suggests the governor of mauritius certainly had no power to compel him and it may well have been that the punjab crisis seemed a less daunting prospect than returning to face his illwillers in england elphy bey was majorgeneral william elphinstone commander of the british force which was wiped out on the retreat from kabul in in which flashman ingloriously won his first laurels a fine soldier who distinguished himself at waterloo elphinstone was hopelessly inept in afghanistan crippled by gout worn out and according to one historian prematurely senile he was incapable of opposing either his political advisers or the afghans but in fairness he was less to blame than those who appointed him to a post for which he was unfitted flashman gives a perceptive but characteristically uncharitable sketch of him in the first volume of the flashman papers subedar sita rams from sepoy to subedar and patrick macrorys signal catastrophe john company the honourable east india company described by macaulay as the strangest of all govermnents for the strangest of all empires was britains presence in india with its own armed forces civil service and judiciary until after the indian mutiny of when it was replaced by direct rule of the crown flashmans definition of its boundaries in is roughly correct and although at this period it controlled less than half of the subcontinent his expression lord of the land is well chosen the company was easily the strongest force in asia and at its height had a revenue greater than britains and governed almost onefifth of the worlds population flashman writing in the early years of the present century occasionally uses the word sirkar when referring to the british power the word in this sense means government but it was probably not applied exclusively to british authority as early as the origins and development of the sutlej crisis are controversial and it is difficult even today to give an account that will satisfy everyone nevertheless flashmans summary seems an eminently fair one his racy little narrative of the power struggle at lahore after the death of runjeet singh is accurate so far as it goes indeed it spares readers some of the gorier details hisview of the gathering storm the precarious position of the lahore durbar the menace of the khalsa and the misgivings of the british authorities about the loyalty of their native troops and their ability to deal with an invasion are reflected in the journals and letters of his contemporaries other points and

arm it is said to illustrate one of the many critical moments in his career when at sobraon he shouted what withdraw indeed i will not tell sir robert dick to move on in the name of god byron farwell eminent victorian soldiers and other works cited in these notes sir robert sale was another highly combative general celebrated for leading from the front and once when his men were mutinous inviting them to shoot him he fought in burma and in the afghan war where he was secondincommand of the army and earned distinction as the defender of jallalabad war with the gurkhas in brought the british to simla and the first european house was built there in the s by one captain kennedy the local superintendent whose hospitality may have laid the foundations of its popularity as a resort emily eden was the sister of lord auckland governorgeneral adapting raleighs famous judgment on henry viii one may say that if all the patterns and pictures of the memsahibs of british india were lost to the world they might be painted to the life from lady sale born florentia wynch she was when she married the dashing young captain robert sale by whom she had twelve children one of whom as mrs alexandrine sturt shared with her mother the horrors of the march from kabul lady sale was then but although she was twice wounded and had her clothing shot through by jezzail bullets she worked tirelessly for the sick and wounded and for the women and children who took part in that fearful journey over the snowbound afghan passes throughout the march and during the months which she suffered in afghan captivity she kept the diary which is the classic account of the kabul retreat in which all but a handful died out of it is one of the great military journals and a remarkable personal memoir of an indomitable woman who recorded battle massacre earthquake hardship escape and everyday detail with a sharp and often caustic eye her reaction when soldiers were reluctant to take up their muskets to form an advance guard was you had better give me one and i will lead the party other typical observations are i had fortunately only one ball in my arm and the brisk entry for july when she was a prisoner at two pm mrs sturt presented me with a granddaughter another female captive during the march her soninlaw captain sturt had died beside her in the snow her heroism on the march was rewarded by an annual pension of ј from queen victoria and when she died in her sixtysixth year her tombstone was given the appropriate inscription under this stone reposes all that could die of lady sale flashman writes of her with considerable affection no doubt her forthright and unconventional style appealed to him her habit of putting a foot on the table to ease her gout is also recorded by one of simlas medical officers henry oldfield ed patrick macrory barr and desmond dnb eugene sues the wandering jew was published in and may conceivably have been available in simla that september but flashmans memory has probably confused it with the authors equally popular mysteries of paris which appeared in dumass the three musketeers was first published in flashman may well have borrowed it from one of the french officers who rescued him from madagascar in june george broadfoot a large redhaired heavilybespectacled and pugnacious orcadian was one of the early paladins of the northwest frontier he had distinguished himself in the afghan war as a ferocious fighter engineer and military organiser and it was in large part due to him that jallalabad was successfully defended after the disastrous kabul retreat he was awarded a cb and a special mention in despatches and went on to serve in burma before being appointed northwest agent in he and flashman served together on the kabul road and broadfoots brother william had been killed in the residency siege of november in which flashman took a reluctant part the reference to broadfoots scotch burr is interesting since although he was born in kirkwall he had lived in london and india from the age of ten captain henry havelock known to flashman as the gravedigger no doubt because of his grim appearance and religious zeal was to become famous in the indian mutiny where he relieved and was besieged in lucknow flashman knew him there and also during the afghan campaign the cabbageeating nobleman with the lisp was certainly prince waldemar of prussia who visited simla in and subsequently accompanied the british army in the field he travelled under the name of count ravensburg but his hosts seem to have addressed him by his real title the rate of pay for an east india company sepoy at this time was rupees a month the khalsa was paying and rupees for cavalrymen sind the territory lying between the punjab and the sea was annexed in by lord ellenborough sir henry hardinges predecessor as governorgeneral this gave britain control of the indus and an important buffer against possible moslem invasion from the northwest it was a cynical piece of work in which ellenborough goaded the sind amirs by forcing an unacceptable treaty on them when this provoked an attack by the baluchi warriors sir charles napier promptly conquered the country winning the battles of miani and hyderabad public reaction to the annexation was reflected by the house of commons which postponed for a year the normal vote of thanks to the successful general and by punch which gleefully accepted a contribution from a miss catherine winkworth aged suggesting that napiers despatch to ellenborough must have read peccavi i have scinde the annexation did not pass unnoticed in lahore and no doubt convinced many sikhs that it would be their turn next young as he was flashman should have known that afghanistan was not an exception and that political officers who were usually army normally fought along with the rest it is true that no post in battle was more dangerous than generals aide and he may well have been right to assume that it would be especially perilous when the general was hugh gough alexander burnes had been flashmans political chief at kabul where sir william mcnaghten was head of the political mission he saw both of them murdered by the afghans the details which flashman gives of the soochet legacy case are substantially correct raja soochet had sent his fortune amounting to lakhs of rupees to ferozepore shortly before his death in march it was buried there in three huge copper vessels and dug up by captain saunders abbott dispute as to the ownership then arose with the lahore durbar claiming its return and the british government holding that it was the property of soochets heirs the famous shalamar or shalimar gardens and pleasure grounds were laid out in the seventeenth century by shah jehan creator of the taj mahal originally there were seven gardens representing the seven divisions of paradise but now only three remain covering about acres the lahore shalamar is not to be confused with the gardens of the same name in kashmir when flashman talks of the khalsa he means simply the punjabi army but the term has much deeper significance the sikhs founded by nanak in the fifteenth century as a peaceful religious sect were transformed two hundred years later by their tenth and last guru gobind singh into a military power to resist muslim persecution gobind founded the khalsa the pure a baptised brotherhood which has been likened to the templars and the praetorian guard and rapidly became the leading order of sikhism and the embodiment of sikh nationhood among gobinds institutions were the abolition of caste the adoption of the surnames singh and kaur and the famous five ks it was a fighting order soon numbering and under runjeet singh it reached the height of its power contact with the british seems to have inspired him to build an army on european lines with the assistance of french italian british american german and russian instructors the result was a superb force quite as disciplined and formidable as flashman describes it well trained and equipped and bent on conquest once runjeets iron hand was gone the khalsa was the real power in the punjab whose rulers could only hope to conciliate it the panches which controlled it were elected by the men in accordance with village tradition at runjeets death the numerical strength of the khalsa was estimated at with guns by this had risen to regular infantry regular cavalry and irregular horse with guns that this figure rose further during the year seems certain flashman and his contemporaries mention both and but how many of these would be effectives it is impossible to say he also uses the terms khalsa sikhs and punjabis loosely when referring to the punjab army it should be remarked that the khalsa as he knew it was not composed exclusively of sikhs the akalis were the commandos of the khalsa a strict sect known variously as the timeless ones the children of god the immortal and the crocodiles a footnote to george broadfoots biography typically describes them as devoted to misrule and plunder since flashman refers later in the manuscript to a cooper pepperbox it is probable that the pistol he drew on dalip singh was a cooper also they were manufactured from about by j r cooper a british gunsmith and fired six rounds there is a mystery here the tough shrewdlooking heavyweight who called on flashman with bhai ram singh hardly sounds like the good kind and polite old fakir azizudeen who had been runjeet singhs foreign minister and was still to the fore at this time although he died of natural causes a few weeks later both the physical description and the style are inconsistent indeed the only way in which bhai rams companion resembles azizudeen is in his uncompromising honesty either flashmans visitor was another courtier altogether and he has simply got the name wrong or his descriptive memory is playing him false for once flashman has caught the spirit but slightly misquoted the letter of robert herricks upon julias clothes next when i cast mine eyes and see that brave vibration each way free how that glittering taketh me he quotes herrick again but it is doubtful if he had any special affection for the poet or would even have recognised his name the flashman papers abound in erratic literary allusions the present volume contains echoes of donne shakespeare macaulay coleridge voltaire dickens scott congreve byron pope lewis carroll norse mythology and obscure corners of the old testament but it would be rash to conclude that flashman had any close acquaintance with the authors more probably the allusions were picked up second hand from conversations and casual reading with two exceptions he knew macaulay personally and had certainly read his lays and he seems to have had a genuine liking for thomas love peacock whose caustic humour and strictures on whiggery political economy and academics probably appealed to him for the rest we may judge that flashmans frequent references to punch pierce egans tom and jerry and sensational fiction like varney the vampire more fairly reflect his literary taste we know from an earlier volume that the word trollope meant only one thing to him and it was not the author alexander haughton campbell gardner gurdana khan is an extraordinary figure even for an age and region which saw such adventurers as sekundar burnes count ignatieff yakub beg pottinger connolly avitabile and john nicholson he was born on the shore of lake superior in what is now wisconsin the son of a scottish surgeon and his anglospanish wife dr gardner had served on the american side in the war of independence and knew both washington and lafayette young alexander spent some years in ireland where he seems to have learned military gunnery possibly in the british army went to egypt and travelled by caravan from jericho to russia where his brother was a government engineer thence he went to central asia where for several years his life was one of continual warfare raid ambush escape and exploration among the wild tribes he fought as a mercenary and for a time appears to have been little more than a wandering bandit food we obtained by levying contributions from everyone we could master he writes in his memoirs but we did not slaughter except in selfdefence he seems to have had to defend himself with fatal frequency both as soldier and freebooter as well as escaping from slavetraders being attacked by a wolfpack leading an expedition against peshawar under the sacred banner of the khalifa and spending nine months in an underground dungeon he rose to command a hill region with his own private fort under the rebel habibullah khan who was opposing the afghan monarch dost mohammed and it was on a foray to kidnap a princess from dost mohammeds harem that he met his first wife an incident described in his best laconic style in the course of the running fight to our stronghold i was enabled to see the beautiful face of a young girl who accompanied the princess i rode for a considerable time beside her pretending that my respect for the elder lady made me choose that side of her camel on the following morning habibulla khan richly rewarded his followers but i refused my share of the gold and begged for this girl to be given to me in marriage she was and for two years they lived happily until gardner returned from an action in which he had lost men out of to find that his fort had been attacked and his wife had stabbed herself rather than be taken prisoner their baby son had also been murdered although he continued in afghanistan for some years and was reconciled with dost mohammed he eventually took service in the punjab with runjeet singh training the khalsa in gunnery fought in various actions and was in lahore in the six years of bloodshed and intrigue following runjeets death he was guard commander to the infant dalip singh and rani jeendan at the time of his meeting with flashman but he was strongly probritish and believed that indias future would be best served by ever closer communion with the united kingdom in his letter from john bull of india to john bull of england he envisaged the development of india as a great industrial nation with indians playing their part in the highest posts in civil and military life and being represented in both houses at westminster physically gardner was as flashman describes him six feet tall fierce lean and of iron constitution as a result of one of his numerous wounds he was unable to swallow solid food and could drink only with the help of an iron collar but even in his eightieth year he was said to be as active as a man of fifty lively and humorous and speaking an english which was quaint graphic and wonderfully good considering his fifty years among asiatics the photograph in his memoirs shows a splendid old warhorse beaknosed and with bristling whiskers seated sword in hand and clad in a full suit of tartan even to his plumed turban he bought the cloth from a highland regiment in india but which tartan it is cannot be told from the monochrome picture and thereby hangs a small mystery flashman says it was the tartan of the th highlanders and describes it as red or crimson which is slightly puzzling since the ths kilt is largely dark blue being a hybrid of the macdonald and a crimson element from the lochiel cameron it may be that flashman who knew his military tartans regarded it as red only by contrast with those of the four other highland regiments which are predominantly dark bluegreen the only other explanation is that he was entirely mistaken and gardner was wearing not the th tartan but the red and resplendent lochiel cameron in which case the colonel must have been a sight to behold it is quite possible that kipling based daniel dravot the hero of the man who would be king on dr harlan he would surely have heard of the american and there is a strong echo in dravots fictional kafiristan adventure of harlans aspirations first to the throne of afghanistan and later successfully to the kingship of ghor as described in gardners memoirs whether harlans story was true is beside the point like many passages in his astonishing career it lacks corroboration on the other hand it was accepted along with the rest by such authorities as major pearse who was gardners editor and the celebrated dr wolff josiah harlan was born in newlin township pennsylvania the son of a merchant whose family came from county durham he studied medicine sailed as a supercargo to china and after being jilted by his american fiancee returned to the east serving as surgeon with the british army in burma he then wandered to afghanistan where he embarked on that career as diplomat spy mercenary soldier and double agent which so enraged colonel gardner the details are confused but it seems that harlan after trying to take dost mohammeds throne and capturing a fortress fell into the hands of runjeet singh the sikh maharaja recognising a rascal of genius when he saw one sent him as envoy to dost mohammed harlan travelling disguised as a dervish was also working to subvert dosts throne on behalf of shah sujah the exiled afghan king not content with this he ingratiated himself with dost and became his agent in the punjab in effect serving three masters against each other although as one contemporary remarks with masterly understatement harlans life was now somewhat complicated he satisfied at least two of his employers shah sujah made him a companion of the imperial stirrup and runjeet gave him the government of three provinces which he administered until it is said the maharaja discovered that he was running a coining plant on the pretence of studying chemistry even then runjeet continued to use him as an agent and it was harlan who successfully suborned the governor of peshawar to betray the province to the sikhs he then took service with dost mohammed and was sent with an expedition against the prince of kunduz it was in this campaign that the patriotic doctor surmounted the indian caucasus and unfurled my countrys banner to the breeze under a salute of gunsthe starspangled banner waved gracefully among the icy peaks what this accomplished is unclear but soon afterwards harlan managed to obtain the throne of ghor from its hereditary prince this was in a year later he was acting as dosts negotiator with the british invaders at kabul dost subsequently fled and harlan was last seen having breakfast with sekundar burnes the british political agent thus far harlans story rests largely on a biographical sketch by the missionary dr joseph wolff they met briefly during harlans governorship of gujerat but wolff confesses that he knows nothing of the american after in fact harlan returned to the us in married in raised harlans light horse for the union in the civil war was invalided out and ended his days practising medicine in san francisco obviously he must have revisited the punjab in the s when flashman knew him of his appearance and character other contemporaries tell us little dr wolff describes a fine tall gentleman given to whistling yankee doodle and found him affable and engaging gardner mentions meeting him at gujerat in the s but speaks no ill of him at that time his biographer dr joseph wolff dd lld was a scholar traveller and linguist whose adventures were even more eccentric than harlans known as the christian dervish and the protestant xavier he was born in germany the son of a jewish rabbi and during his extraordinary nomadic career converted to christianity was expelled from rome for questioning papal infallibility scoured the middle and far east in search of the lost tribes of israel preached christianity in jerusalem was shipwrecked in cephalonia captured by central asian slavetraders and walked miles through afghanistan in a state of nudity according to the dictionary of national biography he made a daring return to afghanistan in search of the missing british agents stoddart and connolly and narrowly escaped death at the hands of their executioner at other times dr wolff preached to the us congress was a deacon in new jersey an anglican priest in ireland and finally became vicar of a parish in somerset as flashman has remarked there were some odd fellows about in the earlies dictionary of american biography dnb flashmans is by far the fullest of the many descriptions of the murder of jawaheer singh on the th of assin he differs from other versions only in minor details obviously he was unaware that two of the wazirs attendants were also killed and that for a time dalip singh was a prisoner of the troops but his description of the ranis reaction while more graphic in detail is borne out by other writers who testify to her hysteria and threats of vengeance that jawaheer knew of his peril is certain he had as flashman says attempted to buy his security on the previous evening but on the fatal day he seems to have believed that he would escape with his life in fact he was foredoomed not only because of peshora singhs death but because the khalsa believed he would bring in the british at first glance flashmans comparison of jeendan to clytemnestra would seem to refer to the hon j colliers celebrated painting of agamemnons queen but this cannot be the case flashman wrote the present memoir before so much is clear from his noting on p that it was written before his borneo adventure which he set down in or soon after that year since colliers painting was not exhibited until the royal academy of flashman must be referring to some earlier as yet unidentified painting of clytemnestra confirmation of the details of this deplorable episode is to be found in carmichael smyth flashmans detailed eyewitness account of this durbar cannot be confirmed in all its particulars but its substance is to be found in other authorities including such contemporaries as broadfoot and carmichael smyth jeendan plainly knew how to manage her troops whether by overawing them with royal dignity or captivating them by appearing unveiled and dressed as a dancinggirl carmichael smyth describes her initial refusal to listen to their entreaties after jawaheers death her dictation of terms at the summum boorj her insistence on lal singh as wazir rather than goolab and her dispersal of the khalsa on the understanding that she would soon launch it across the sutlej broadfoots account quoting nicolson speaks for itself courts brigade was in favour of making raja gulab singh minister the other brigades seemed disposed to support the rani who behaved at this crisis with great courage sometimes as many as two thousand of these reckless and insubordinate soldiers would attend the darbar at one time the ranee against the remonstrances of the chiefs receives them unveiled with which they are so charmed that even courts brigade agreed to confirm her in the government if she would move to their camp and let them see her unveiled whenever they thought proper these strange disorderly ruffians even when under the direct influence of her great beauty and personal attractions reproved her for her unconcealed misconduct with raja lal singh and recommended her as she seemed to dislike solitude to marry they told her she might select whom she pleased out of three classes namely chiefs akalis or wise men she adopted a bold tone with the troops and not only reproached them but abused them in the grossest language whilst they listened with pretended humility flashman is consistently vague about dates and does nothing to clear up the longstanding mystery of when exactly the sikhs invaded across the sutlej december is the favourite date but estimates by both british and indian historians vary from the th to the th sir henry hardinge formally declared war on the th and as khushwant singh points out this almost certainly followed the crossing of the first sikh units the whole operation must have taken some days nicolson at ferozepore says the invasion began on the th abbott however is definite that broadfoot received word of it on the morning of the th if flashman were not so positive one might be tempted to regard this reference to drink puppy drink as another misplaced musical memory elsewhere in the papers he occasionally errs in remembering tunes before they have been written at first sight drink puppy drink and the tarpaulin jacket which he quotes on p look like similar cases of faulty recollection both were written by flashmans fellowofficer george whytemelville none of whose writings appear to have been published before his first retirement from the army in so how can flashman have known them in and be so sure of drink puppy drink that he refers to it no fewer than three times in his memoirs of that year there is a plausible explanation although no reference to whytemelville has yet appeared in the flashman papers it is quite possible that they met as early as their first year in the army when flashman was stationed at glasgow and whytemelville was a subaltern in the rd highlanders in such a small society it would be strange if two young men with so much in common did not come together they were the sons of landed gentlemen who had married into the aristocracy were both outstanding horsemen keen sportsmen and popular convivialists and may even have discovered a bond of suffering from their schooldays and when it is remembered that whytemelvilles considerable literary talent was of that precocious carefree kind which may be called amateur in the true sense it seems quite probable that such songs as drink puppy drink were being sung in messes and clubs long before their genial author had even thought of looking for a publisher an interesting discovery from flashmans dungeon ordeal is that in roasting tom brown so memorably before the schoolroom fire at rugby he was simply passing on a lesson learned from the deplorable dawson to whom he also refers in flashman in the great game how many sikhs crossed the sutlej it is impossible to say far less how many were in the field on both sides of the river flashmanseventual figure of may not be far out but it can be regarded as a maximum cunninghams estimate is plus another force of unspecified size advancing on ludhiana against this gough had about at most but only of these were on or near the frontier and they were widely dispersed the khalsa according to cunningham had a superiority of almost two to one in artillery lal singh did send this note to peter nicolson word for word except that where flashman gives khalsa lal wrote sikh army he also informed nicolson of jeendans friendship with the hope that the british would cut up the invaders nicolsons reply was that lal should not attack ferozepore but delay and march to meet the british thus confirming what flashman had already told the wazir these proofs of treachery by the khalsas own leaders were not published immediately as a result of nicolsons death but dr mgregor writing within a year of the event obviously knew the truth having pointed out that a leader like runjeet singh would have caused as much havoc as possible by burning and sacking on a wide front he adds we are almost tempted to believe that the sikh leaders wished to keep their troops together in order that the british might have a full and fair opportunity of destroying them in cunningham was stating bluntly that the object of the sikh leaders was to get their own troops dispersed by the he knew of lals correspondence with nicolson but not the details in the light of what these two respected historians wrote at the time it is remarkable to find william broadfoot forty years later disputing the charge of treachery against lal and tej nor was he alone at least one other british historian discounted it if in the light of the evidence available any doubt remained flashman has surely dispelled it flashmans memory is almost certainly at fault lieutcol huthwaite may well have been able to tell which guns were being used but the british howitzers did not arrive at mudki until the following day a fair judgment and flashman had cause to be pleased with his strategy for although the british force was only slightly larger than the sikh it had an advantage of four or five to one in infantry which was decisive unsatisfactory and unduly costly is fortescues verdict and he is rightly critical of gough for attacking headon an enemy stationed in jungle but considering that the british force had covered sixty miles in two days before going into action it could have been worse this remarkable observation so characteristic of broadfoot was originally made by him after a skirmish in afghanistan from which he emerged perspiring heavily and with a bloodstained sabre having killed three men and been wounded himself this is the only existing account of the extraordinary exchange between hardinge and gough before ferozeshah although the gist of their conversation was communicated to intimates soon afterwards charles hardinge in his fathers biography was an eyewitness from a distance but apparently out of earshot unique or not the dispute arose from hardinges decision to place himself under the military command of gough while retaining overall authority as governorgeneral in theory it was a risky arrangement but understandable it would have been foolish not to use hardinges military experience he had been twice wounded in the peninsular war losing a hand served as deputy quartermastergeneral of the portuguese army and been attached to prussian headquarters in the waterloo campaign in which he was again badly wounded he was active in politics serving as wellingtons secretary for war before being sent to india as governorgeneral this military pleasantry was still going the rounds in the second world war only the th foot could take a lady into barracks the lady being the figure of britannia on their cap badge historians disagree about the behaviour of the sikh cavalry one describes their advance as hesitant fortescue says they were stationary but an eyewitness called it the most splendid sight of the campaign their horses caracoling and bounding and the bright sunlight flashed from steel armour and spears they came on at a rapid pace to within four hundred yards of the british line goughs biographer hardly mentions it obviously it depends on the point of view but flashman is probably right in thinking that whites intervention was decisive this incident is true gough with my gallant aide deliberately rode ahead to draw the khalsas fire and succeeded he has been criticised for needlessly endangering himself on the other hand it has been argued that the effect on his troops morale was considerable gough himself probably never gave a thought either to danger or morale he seems to have acted emotionally on the spur of the moment flashmans account of the two days of ferozeshah is so full and accurate that little need be added to it for both sides it was a battle of missed opportunities the british should have had it won on the first day but they ran out of daylight and in the confusion of the night fighting they lost the advantage they had gained the sikhs should have overwhelmed goughs force on the second afternoon but tejs treachery robbed them of victory a point flashman does not mention is that tej seems to have waited until he was sure lal singhs defending force had been thoroughly routed it has been suggested that on the first night of the battle the british commanders had decided to surrender one sikh historian says it quite flatly quoting the diary of robert cust a young political officer who was not even at ferozeshah in fact it is plain from the papers of both gough and hardinge that surrender was never contemplated hardinge says clearly that he was approached by some officers with timid counsels of retreat which he flatly rejected gough too was approached by officers who urged retreat two of them claiming that they spoke for hardinge gough did not believe them stated his intention of fighting on and consulted hardinge who repudiated the officers statement and agreed with gough that retreat was not to be considered for a moment plainly there were some in favour of retreat just as plainly gough and hardinge gave them short shrift flashman has dealt fully with tej singh subscribing to the general view that it was his treachery alone that turned the tide that tej was a traitor seems obvious but it is just possible that the reasons he gave for not attacking goughs exhausted force had some justification he probably did not know for example that the british artillery was out of ammunition and hesitated to attack their fortified position it is also possible that some of his commanders agreed with him for what seemed to them sound military reasons at any rate it is difficult to believe that the sikh army were turned back against the united will of their regimental commanders simply by tejs word alone napoleons sword which had been presented to hardinge by wellington was sent back from ferozeshah and dr hoffmeister one of prince waldemars suite was killed on the first day cunningham broadfoot mgregor and history of the bengal european regiment by p r innes n this was in fact the excuse given to hardinge by lumley for appearing in informal dress flashmans attitudes to his military superiors vary from affection to poisonous hatred with degrees of respect contempt and amused anxiety in between and most of them are understandable why he so disliked hardinge is less obvious for the governorgeneral seems to have been an amiable man enough and not unpopular his portrait gives no hint of the pomposity and coldness that flashman found in him it is quite likely that their instant mutual antipathy was our heros fault enjoying the euphoria of having done good service for once he probably let his natural impudence show and was less inclined than usual to toady the bouncy young political no doubt brought out the worst in hardinge and flashman a ready hater has repaid with interest in a portrait which probably does the governorgeneral less than justice especially where gough is concerned hardinge was surely sincere in writing to peel that gough was not the officer who ought to be entrusted with the conduct of the war and can hardly be blamed for seeking the appointment of a less mercurial cinc disaster had been avoided by a miracle and the governorgeneral might well be nervous of a general who was once heard to say when his guns ran out of ammunition thank god then ill be at them with the bayonet at the same time hardinge failed to recognise that many of goughs difficulties had been created by hardinge himself and it may well be as goughs biographer suggests that the governorgeneral had a tendency to attribute to himself all vigorous action and to take all credit for success whether he was right to override gough at ferozeshah we cannot know he may have averted a catastrophe or prevented gough winning a victory at less cost in lives it was a curious and difficult situation for both men and it says much for them that they remained on good terms and cooperated efficiently throughout the campaign gough never knew of the letter to peel and while flashman would emphatically disagree this was probably tact on hardinges part christmas trees were reintroduced into england by prince albert after his marriage to queen victoria in gough and hardinge were repeating at sobraon their quarrel at ferozeshah gough wanted to make a frontal attack but hardinge insisted that he must wait for heavy artillery from umballa the governorgeneral proposed that an attack be made by crossing the river and falling on the sikhs reserve position but this was vetoed by gough this scene is described in detail by gardner he gives the strength of the ranis guard as four battalions the rani used to wonder why a matrimonial alliance was not formed for her with some officer who would then manage state affairs with her she used to send for portraits of all the officers and in one especially she took great interest and said that he must be a lord this fortunate individuals name has not transpired and much to the maharanis mortification the affair went no further she considered that such a marriage would have secured the future of herself and her son plans of the khalsa fortifications certainly reached the british but they apparently added little to their knowledge this certainly refers to the curious case of captain battreau who as a young private soldier in the french army carried a chassepot rifle serial number in the francogerman war of in during a skirmish in the dahomey jungle battreau now an officer in the foreign legion disarmed an enemy and discovered that the weapon he had captured was the same chassepot he had handed in at the end of the campaign the story was verified by p c wren himself an exlegionnaire who included it in his book flawed blades flashman died in and his own legion service preceded battreaus by many years so it seems probable that he read the story in a french newspaper in the private shelter which tej singh had built for himself at sobraon was as flashman describes it it was constructed according to the specifications laid down by a brahmin astrologer the inner circumference was thirteen and a half times tejs waist measurement and the wall itself had a thickness of long grains of rice laid end to end tej spent more time supervising its building than he did on his duties as commanderinchief retiring within it frequently to pray assistance in measurement was lent by a european engineer with a footrule colonel hurbon a spaniard was the only european officer who served against the british in the sikh war he is said to have designed the fortifications at sobraon which the historian cunningham who was also an engineer dismissed as unscientific perhaps they were since superior numbers did not suffice to hold them gardner describes him simply as a fine soldier and remarks on his bravery almost certainly this was sham singh attariwala a veteran of more than forty years service who led the khalsas last stand at sobraon sobraon was the decisive battle of the sikh war perhaps one of the decisive battles of history for it secured britain in india for another century with all that that implied for the future of asia gough described it as the indian waterloo and there are few controversies about it for once treachery played little part in what was a straight contest between the khalsa and the company luck was against the sikhs insofar as the unusual rise of the sutlej denied them any possibility of retreat and fighting another day hemmed in they could only fight it out which they did with a discipline and courage which excited unanimous admiration from their enemy gough in particular policy precluded me publicly recording my sentiments on the splendid gallantry or the acts of heroism displayedby the sikh army he wrote i could have wept to have witnessed the fearful slaughter of so devoted a body of men they who led the british cavalry said simply they never ran hardinge wrote few escaped none it may be said surrendered there is hning a difference of collapse of the bridge st boats manysbeon one lieve hat it was destroyed deliberately tej singh who fled during the battle and supposedly had one of the middle barges removed on the other hd id charles hardinge actually saw it collapse and his accours like flashmans suggests that it was unbroken until the weight of the fugitives caused it to carry away i saw the ridge at that moment overcrowded with guns horses and saldiers of all arms swaying to and fro till at last with a elash it disappeared the river seemed alive with a struowing mass of men the sikh losses were bout against dead and more than wounded on the british side but it has to be remembered that most e the khalsa died in the river and for a time the battle ha been on a knifeedge after the repulse of his first attack gough launched an assault on the right and centre and has recorded comment as he watched gilberts men storming the ramparts was good god theyll be annihilated the hardinge inns rait khushwant singh and others later fieldmarshal lofd napier of magdala famous for perhaps the most successful campaign in british imperial history the mai h on magdala abyssinia in which flashman is bjlieved to have taken part napier was a brilliant soldier organiser and engineer but his great devotion was to art and e was still taking lessons at the age of is sir henry lawrence best known for his defence of lucknow in the indian mutiny in which he was killed but he previously had a distinguished career in the army and the political service serving in burma and in the afghan and sikh wars tall gaunt hottempered and impatient of contradiction he also had a romantic side and was the author of a love story adventurer in the punjaub which according to dr mgregor was also a mine of information about the country and its politics and he succeeded in seeing the maharani jeendan in lahore after the war when gardner persuaded her to show her head and shoulders over a garden wall to the gratification of the officers as in previous volumes of the papers one is reminded of how small was the group of officers who shaped the course of empire in africa and the far east the same names cross flashmans path again and again napier havelock broadfoot lawrence herbert edwardes who was lawrences assistant and won great fame in the mutiny wild john nicholson who was literally worshipped as a divinity by a frontier sect the nickleseynites hope grant the monosyllabic celloplaying scot who led the march to peking and was rated by flashman the most dangerous fighting man alive rake hodson the violent ruffian who commanded the famous guides and founded hodsons horse and others whom he knew elsewhere but not in the punjab frederick roberts garnet wolseley the original model of a modern majorgeneral chinese gordon of khartoum and onearmed sam browne whose belt has made him the most famous of them all a distinguished company who tended to go one of two ways knighthood and general rank or a grave in the outposts dr w l mgregor who served throughout the sikh war is one of its major historians and an enthusiast on military medicine anyone wishing to study the war is recommended to him and to captain j d cunningham who also served in the campaign and was in political intelligence they do not always agree with each other but their knowledge of the punjab and its personalities makes them invaluable sources the terms of the first treaty of lahore march are to be found in cunningham mgregor and hardinge they are as goolab singh predicted with additional clauses giving britain passage for troops through the punjab a pledge not to interfere in punjabi internal affairs and a prohibition on the enlistment of european or american mercenaries in the punjab without british consent supplementary articles provided for the stationing of a british force at lahore for one year this was at the request of the lahore durbar who rightly conceived themselves to be in need of protection goolab singh the golden hen and stormy petrel of kashmir was every bit as deplorable and quite as personally engaging as flashman portrays him he was born about and to describe his career of intrigue murder warfare and knavery would take a long chapter it suffices to say that as a leading light of the dogra hindus who opposed the sikhs in the power struggle following runjeet singhs death he not only survived but ended with a kingdom of his own kashmir he did it by shameless duplicity conspiring with the british while pretending sympathy for the punjab cause and no one was ever more expert at playing both ends against the middle his character was admirably summed up by his friend and agent colonel gardner who described it as repulsive ambitious avaricious and capable of the most inhuman systematic cruelty simply to invest his name with terror at the same time he was charming genial opiumaddicted given to telling long stories and hailfellow with the poorest of his subjects a fine soldier and sturdy fighter he was also a wise and careful ruler and perhaps the most revealing thing about him is that while gardner published his character study in goolabs lifetime they remained the best of friends
