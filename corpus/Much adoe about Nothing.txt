lady fame i found him heere as melancholy as a lodge in a warren i told him and i thinke told him true that your grace had got the will of this young lady and i offered him my company to a willow tree either to make him a garland as being forsaken or to binde him a rod as being worthy to be whipt pedro to be whipt whats his fault bene the flat transgression of a schooleboy who being ouerioyed with finding a birds nest shewes it his companion and he steales it pedro wilt thou make a trust a transgression the transgression is in the stealer ben yet it had not been amisse the rod had beene made and the garland too for the garland he might haue worne himselfe and the rod hee might haue bestowed on you who as i take it haue stolne his birds nest pedro i will but teach them to sing and restore

waiting gentlewoman to hero iohn i remember bor i can at any vnseasonable instant of the night appoint her to looke out at her ladies chamber window iohn what life is in that to be the death of this marriage bor the poyson of that lies in you to temper goe you to the prince your brother spare not to tell him that hee hath wronged his honor in marrying the renowned claudio whose estimation do you mightily hold vp to a contaminated stale such a one as hero iohn what proofe shall i make of that bor proofe enough to misuse the prince to vexe claudio to vndoe hero and kill leonato looke you for any other issue iohn onely to despight them i will endeauour any thing bor goe then finde me a meete howre to draw on pedro and the count claudio alone tell them that you know that hero loues me intend a kinde of zeale both to the prince and claudio as in a loue of your brothers honor who hath made this match and his friends reputation who is thus like to be cosend with the semblance of a maid that you haue discouerd thus they will scarcely beleeue this without triall offer them instances which shall beare no lesse likelihood than to see mee at her chamber window heare me call margaret hero heare margaret terme me claudio and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding for in the meane time i will so fashion the matter that hero shall be absent and there shall

heere againe i doe much wonder that one man seeing how much another man is a foole when he dedicates his behauiours to loue will after hee hath laught at such shallow follies in others become the argument of his owne scorne by falling in loue such a man is claudio i haue known when there was no musicke with him but the drum and the fife and now had hee rather heare the taber and the pipe i haue knowne when he would haue walkt ten mile afoot to see a good armor and now will he lie ten nights awake caruing the fashion of a new dublet he was wont to speake plaine to the purpose like an honest man a souldier and now is he turnd orthography his words are a very fantasticall banquet iust so many strange dishes may i be so conuerted see with these eyes i cannot tell i thinke not i will not bee sworne but loue may transforme me to an oyster but ile take my oath on it till he haue made an oyster of me he shall neuer make me such a foole one woman is faire yet i am well another is wise

balth o good my lord taxe not so bad a voyce to slander musicke any more then once prin it is the witnesse still of excellency to slander musicke any more then once prince it is the witnesse still of

thinkes not worthy yet he wooes yet will he sweare he loues prince nay pray thee come or if thou wilt hold longer argument doe it in notes balth note this before my notes theres not a note of mine thats worth the noting prince why these are very crotchets that he speaks note notes forsooth and nothing bene now diuine aire now is his soule rauisht is it not strange that sheepes guts should hale

thou heare balthasar i pray thee get vs some excellent musick for to morrow night we would haue it at the lady heroes chamber window balth the best i can my lord exit balthasar prince do so farewell come hither leonato what was it you told me of to day that your niece beatrice was in loue with signior benedicke cla o i stalke on stalke on the foule sits i did neuer thinke that lady would haue loued any man leon no nor i neither but most wonderful that she should so dote on signior benedicke whom shee hath in all outward behauiours seemed euer to abhorre bene ist possible sits the winde in that corner leo by my troth my lord i cannot tell what to thinke of it but that she loues him with an inraged affection it is past the infinite of thought prince may be she doth but counterfeit claud faith like enough leon o god counterfeit there was neuer counterfeit of passion came so neere the life of passion as she discouers it prince why what effects of passion shewes she claud baite the hooke well this fish will bite leon what effects my lord shee will sit you you heard my daughter tell you how clau she did indeed prince how how i pray you you amaze me i would haue thought her spirit had beene inuincible against all assaults of affection leo i would haue sworne it had my lord especially against benedicke bene i should thinke this a gull but that the whitebearded fellow speakes it knauery cannot sure hide himselfe in such reuerence claud he hath tane th infection hold it vp prince hath shee made her affection known to benedicke leonato no and sweares she neuer will thats her torment claud tis true indeed so your daughter saies shall i saies she that haue so oft encountred him with scorne write to him that i loue him leo this saies shee now when shee is beginning to write to him for sheell be vp twenty times a night and there will she sit in her smocke till she haue writ a sheet of paper my daughter tells vs all clau now you talke of a sheet of paper i remember a pretty iest your daughter told vs of leon o when she had writ it was reading it ouer she found benedicke and beatrice betweene the sheete clau that leon o she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence raild at her self that she should be so immodest to write to one that shee knew would flout her i measure him saies she by my owne spirit for i should flout him if hee writ to mee yea though i loue him i should clau then downe vpon her knees she falls weepes sobs beates her heart teares her hayre praies curses o sweet benedicke god giue me patience leon she doth indeed my daughter saies so and the extasie hath so much ouerborne her that my daughter is somtime afeard she will doe a desperate outrage to her selfe it is very true prince it were good that benedicke knew of it by some other if she will not discouer it clau to what end he would but make a sport of it and torment the poore lady worse prin and he should it were an almes to hang him shees an excellent sweet lady and out of all suspition she is vertuous claudio and she is exceeding wise prince in euery thing but in louing benedicke leon o my lord wisedome and bloud combating in so tender a body we haue ten proofes to one that bloud hath the victory i am sorry for her as i haue iust cause being her vncle and her guardian prince i would shee had bestowed this dotage on mee i would haue daft all other respects and made her halfe my selfe i pray you tell benedicke of it and heare what he will say leon were it good thinke you clau hero thinkes surely she wil die for she saies she will die if hee loue her not and shee will die ere shee make her loue knowne and she will die if hee wooe her rather than shee will bate one breath of her accustomed crossenesse prince she doth well if she should make tender of her loue tis very possible heel scorne it for the man as you know all hath a contemptible spirit clau he is a very proper man prin he hath indeed a good outward happines clau fore god and in my minde very wise prin he doth indeed shew some sparkes that are like wit leon and i take him to be valiant prin as hector i assure you and in the managing of quarrels you may see hee is wise for either hee auoydes them with great discretion or vndertakes them with a christianlike feare leon if hee doe feare god a must necessarilie keepe peace if hee breake the peace hee ought to enter into a quarrell with feare and trembling prin and so will he doe for the man doth fear god howsoeuer it seemes not in him by some large ieasts hee will make well i am sorry for your niece shall we goe see benedicke and tell him of her loue claud neuer tell him my lord let her weare it out with good counsell leon nay thats impossible she may weare her heart out first prin well we will heare further of it by your daughter let it coole the while i loue benedicke well and i could wish he would modestly examine himselfe to see how much he is vnworthy to haue so good a lady leon my lord will you walke dinner is ready clau if he do not doat on her vpon this i wil neuer trust my expectation prin let there be the same net spread for her and that must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry the sport will be when they hold one an opinion of anothers dotage and no such matter thats the scene that i would see which will be meerely a dumbe shew let vs send her to call him into dinner exeunt bene this can be no tricke the conference was sadly borne they haue the truth of this from hero they seeme to pittie the lady it seemes her affections haue the full bent loue me why it must be requited i heare how i am censurd they say i will beare my selfe proudly if i perceiue the loue come from her they say too that she will rather die than giue any signe of affection i did neuer thinke to marry i must not seeme proud happy are they that heare their detractions and can put them to mending they say the lady is faire tis a truth i can beare them witnesse and vertuous tis so i cannot reprooue it and wise but for louing me by my troth it is no addition to her witte nor no great argument of her folly for i wil be horribly in loue with her i may chance haue some odde quirkes and remnants of witte broken on mee because i haue raild so long against marriage but doth not the appetite alter a man loues the meat in his youth that he cannot indure in his age shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the braine awe a man from the careere of his humour no the world must be peopled when i said i would die a batcheler i did not think i should liue till i were maried here comes beatrice by this day shees a faire lady i doe spie some markes of loue in her enter beatrice beat against my wil i am sent to bid you come in to dinner bene faire beatrice i thanke you for your paines beat i tooke no more paines for those thankes then you take paines to thanke me if it had been painefull i would not haue come bene you take pleasure then in the message beat yea iust so much as you may take vpon a kniues point and choake a daw withall you haue no stomacke signior fare you well enter bene ha against my will i am sent to bid you come into dinner theres a double meaning in that i tooke no more paines for those thankes then you took paines to thanke me thats as much as to say any paines that i take for you is as easie as thankes if i do not take pitty of her i am a villaine if i doe not loue her i am a iew i will goe get her picture enter actus tertius enter hero and two gentlemen margaret and vrsula hero good margaret runne thee to the parlour there shalt thou finde my cosin beatrice proposing with the prince and claudio whisper her eare and tell her i and vrsula walke in the orchard and our whole discourse is all of her say that thou ouerheardst vs and bid her steale into the pleached bower where honysuckles ripened by the sunne forbid the sunne to enter like fauourites made proud by princes that aduance their pride against that power that bred it there will she hide her to listen our purpose this is thy office beare thee well in it and leaue vs alone marg ile make her come i warrant you presently hero now vrsula when beatrice doth come as we do trace this alley vp and downe our talke must onely be of benedicke when i doe name him let it be thy part to praise him more then euer man did merit my talke to thee must be how benedicke is sicke in loue with beatrice of this matter is little cupids crafty arrow made that onely wounds by hearesay now begin enter beatrice for looke where beatrice like a lapwing runs close by the ground to heare our conference vrs the pleasantst angling is to see the fish cut with her golden ores the siluer streame and greedily deuoure the treacherous baite so angle we for beatrice who euen now is couched in the woodbine couerture feare you not my part of the dialogue her then go we neare her that her eare loose nothing of the false sweete baite that we lay for it no truely vrsula she is too disdainfull i know her spirits are as coy and wilde as haggerds of the rocke vrsula but are you sure that benedicke loues beatrice so intirely her so saies the prince and my new trothed lord vrs and did they bid you tell her of it madam her they did intreate me to acquaint her of it but i perswaded them if they loud benedicke to wish him wrastle with affection and neuer to let beatrice know of it vrsula why did you so doth not the gentleman deserue as full as fortunate a bed as euer beatrice shall couch vpon hero o god of loue i know he doth deserue as much as may be yeelded to a man but nature neuer framd a womans heart of prowder stuffe then that of beatrice disdaine and scorne ride sparkling in her eyes misprizing what they looke on and her wit values it selfe so highly that to her all matter else seemes weake she cannot loue nor take no shape nor proiect of affection shee is so selfe indeared vrsula sure i thinke so and therefore certainely it were not good she knew his loue lest she make sport at it hero why you speake truth i neuer yet saw man how wise how noble yong how rarely featurd but she would spell him backward if faire facd she would sweare the gentleman should be her sister if blacke why nature drawing of an anticke made a foule blot if tall a launce ill headed if low an agot very vildlie cut if speaking why a vane blowne with all windes if silent why a blocke moued with none so turnes she euery man the wrong side out and neuer giues to truth and vertue that which simplenesse and merit purchaseth vrsu sure sure such carping is not commendable hero no not to be so odde and from all fashions as beatrice is cannot be commendable but who dare tell her so if i should speake she would mocke me into ayre o she would laugh me out of my selfe presse me to death with wit therefore let benedicke like couered fire consume away in sighes waste inwardly it were a better death to die with mockes which is as bad as die with tickling vrsu yet tell her of it heare what shee will say hero no rather i will goe to benedicke and counsaile him to fight against his passion and truly ile deuise some honest slanders to staine my cosin with one doth not know how much an ill word may impoison liking vrsu o doe not doe your cosin such a wrong she cannot be so much without true iudgement hauing so swift and excellent a wit as she is prisde to haue as to refuse so rare a gentleman as signior benedicke hero he is the onely man of italy alwaies excepted my deare claudio vrsu i pray you be not angry with me madame speaking my fancy signior benedicke for shape for bearing argument and valour goes formost in report through italy hero indeed he hath an excellent good name vrsu his excellence did earne it ere he had it when are you married madame hero why euerie day to morrow come goe in ile shew thee some attires and haue thy counsell which is the best to furnish me to morrow vrsu shees tane i warrant you we haue caught her madame hero if it proue so then louing goes by haps some cupid kills with arrowes some with traps enter beat what fire is in mine eares can this be true stand i condemnd for pride and scorne so much contempt farewell and maiden pride adew no glory liues behinde the backe of such and benedicke loue on i will requite thee taming my wilde heart to thy louing hand if thou dost loue my kindnesse shall incite thee to binde our loues vp in a holy band for others say thou dost deserue and i beleeue it better then reportingly enter enter prince claudio benedicke and leonato prince i doe but stay till your marriage be consummate and then go i toward arragon clau ile bring you thither my lord if youl vouchsafe me prin nay that would be as great a soyle in the new glosse of your marriage as to shew a childe his new coat and forbid him to weare it i will onely bee bold with benedicke for his companie for from the crowne of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth he hath twice or thrice cut cupids bowstring and the little hangman dare not shoot at him he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinkes his tongue speakes bene gallants i am not as i haue bin leo so say i methinkes you are sadder claud i hope he be in loue prin hang him truant theres no true drop of bloud in him to be truly toucht with loue if he be sad he wants money bene i haue the toothach prin draw it bene hang it claud you must hang it first and draw it afterwards prin what sigh for the toothach leon where is but a humour or a worme bene well euery one cannot master a griefe but hee that has it clau yet say i he is in loue prin there is no appearance of fancie in him vnlesse it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises as to bee a dutchman to day a frenchman to morrow vnlesse hee haue a fancy to this foolery as it appeares hee hath hee is no foole for fancy as you would haue it to appeare he is clau if he be not in loue with some woman there is no beleeuing old signes a brushes his hat a mornings what should that bode prin hath any man seene him at the barbers clau no but the barbers man hath beene seen with him and the olde ornament of his cheeke hath alreadie stuft tennis balls leon indeed he lookes yonger than hee did by the losse of a beard prin nay a rubs himselfe with ciuit can you smell him out by that clau thats as much as to say the sweet youths in loue prin the greatest note of it is his melancholy clau and when was he wont to wash his face prin yea or to paint himselfe for the which i heare what they say of him clau nay but his iesting spirit which is now crept into a lutestring and now gouernd by stops prin indeed that tels a heauy tale for him conclude he is in loue clau nay but i know who loues him prince that would i know too i warrant one that knowes him not cla yes and his ill conditions and in despight of all dies for him prin shee shall be buried with her face vpwards bene yet is this no charme for the toothake old signior walke aside with mee i haue studied eight or nine wise words to speake to you which these hobbyhorses must not heare prin for my life to breake with him about beatrice clau tis euen so hero and margaret haue by this played their parts with beatrice and then the
