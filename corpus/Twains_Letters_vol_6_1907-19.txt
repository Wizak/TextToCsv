 mark twains letters arranged with comment by albert bigelow paine volume vi xlvi letters a degree from oxford the new home at redding the author j howard moore sent a copy of his book the universal kinship with a letter in which he said most humorists have no anxiety except to glorify themselves and add substance to their pocketbooks by making their readers laugh you have shown on many occasions that your mission is not simply to antidote the melancholy of a world but includes a real and intelligent concern for the general welfare of your fellowman the universal kinship was the kind of a book that mark twain appreciated as his acknowledgment clearly shows to mr j howard moore feb dear mr moore the book has furnished me several days of deep pleasure and satisfaction it has compelled my gratitude at the same time since it saves me the labor of stating my own longcherished opinions and reflections and resentments by doing it lucidly and fervently and irascibly for me there is one thing that always puzzles me as inheritors of the mentality of our reptile ancestors we have improved the inheritance by a thousand grades but in the matter of the morals which they left us we have gone backward as many grades that evolution is strange and to me unaccountable and unnatural necessarily we started equipped with their perfect and blemishless morals now we are wholly destitute we have no real morals but only artificial ones morals created and preserved by the forced suppression of natural and hellish instincts yet we are dull enough to be vain of them certainly we are a sufficiently comical invention we humans sincerely yours s l clemens mark twains own books were always being excommunicated by some librarian and the matter never failed to invite the attention and amusement of the press and the indignation of many correspondents usually the books were tom sawyer and huck finn the morals of which were not regarded as wholly exemplary but in a small library in a very small town attained a days national notoriety by putting the ban on eves diary not so much on account of its text as for the chaste and exquisite illustrations by lester ralph when the reporters came in a troop to learn about it the author said i believe this time the trouble is mainly with the pictures i did not draw them i wish i had they are so beautiful just at this time dr william lyon phelps of yale was giving a literary talk to the teachers club of hartford dwelling on the superlative value of mark twains writings for readers old and young mrs f g whitmore an old hartford friend wrote clemens of the things that phelps had said as consolation for eves latest banishment this gave him a chance to add something to what he had said to the reporters to mrs whitmore in hartford feb dear mrs whitmore but the truth is that when a library expels a book of mine and leaves an unexpurgated bible lying around where unprotected youth and age can get hold of it the deep unconscious irony of it delights me and doesnt anger me but even if it angered me such words as those of professor phelps would take the sting all out nobody attaches weight to the freaks of the charlton library but when a man like phelps speaks the world gives attention some day i hope to meet him and thank him for his courage for saying those things out in public custom is to think a handsome thing in private but tame it down in the utterance i hope you are all well and happy and thereto i add my love sincerely yours s l clemens in may mark twain was invited to england to receive from oxford the degree of literary doctor it was an honor that came to him as a sort of laurel crown at the end of a great career and gratified him exceedingly to moberly bell of the london times he expressed his appreciation bell had been over in april and clemens believed him concerned in the matter to moberly bell in london fifth avenue may dear mr bell your hand is in it and you have my best thanks although i wouldnt cross an ocean again for the price of the ship that carried me i am glad to do it for an oxford degree i shall plan to sail for england a shade before the middle of june so that i can have a few days in london before the th sincerely s l clemens he had taken a house at tuxedo for the summer desiring to be near new york city and in the next letter he writes mr rogers concerning his london plans we discover also in this letter that he has begun work on the redding home and the cost is to come entirely out of the autobiographical chapters then running in the north american review it may be of passing interest to note here that he had the usual housebuilders fortune he received thirty thousand dollars for the chapters the house cost him nearly double that amount to h h rogers in new york tuxedo park may dear admiral why hang it i am not going to see you and mrs rogers at all in england it is a great disappointment i leave there a month from now june no i shall see you for by your itinerary you are most likely to come to london june st or along there so that is very good and satisfactory i have declined all engagements but two whitelaw reid dinner june and the pilgrims lunch june the oxford ceremony is june i have paid my return passage in the minnesomething but it is just possible that i may want to stay in england a week or two longer i cant tell yet i do very much want to meet up with the boys for the last time i have signed the contract for the building of the house on my connecticut farm and specified the cost limit and work has been begun the cost has to all come out of a years instalments of autobiography in the n a review clara is winning her way to success and distinction with sure and steady strides by all accounts she is singing like a bird and is not afraid on the concert stage any more tuxedo is a charming place i think it hasnt its equal anywhere very best wishes to you both s l c the story of mark twains extraordinary reception and triumph in england has been told mark twain a biography chaps cclvicclix it was in fact the crowning glory of his career perhaps one of the most satisfactory incidents of his sojourn was a dinner given to him by the staff of punch in the historic offices at bouverie street where no other foreign visitor had been thus honored a notable distinction when the dinner ended little joy agnew daughter of the chief editor entered and presented to the chief guest the original drawing of a cartoon by bernard partridge which had appeared on the front page of punch in this picture the presiding genius of the paper is offering to mark twain health long life and happiness from the punch bowl a short time after his return to america he received a pretty childish letter from little miss agnew acknowledging a photograph he had sent her and giving a list of her pets and occupations such a letter always delighted mark twain and his pleasure in this one is reflected in his reply to miss joy agnew in london tuxedo park new york unto you greetings and salutation and worship you dear sweet little rightlynamed joy i can see you now almost as vividly as i saw you that night when you sat flashing and beaming upon those sombre swallowtails fair as a star when only one is shining in the sky oh you were indeed the only one there wasnt even the remotest chance of competition with you dear ah you are a decoration you little witch the idea of your house going to the wanton expense of a flower garden arent you enough and what do you want to go and discourage the other flowers for is that the right spirit is it considerate is it kind how do you suppose they feel when you come around looking the way you look and you so pink and sweet and dainty and lovely and supernatural why it makes them feel embarrassed and artificial of course and in my opinion it is just as pathetic as it can be now then you want to reform dear and do right well certainly you are well off joy bantams goldfish doves canaries dogs cat all you need now to be permanently beyond the reach of want is one more dog just one more good gentle high principled affectionate loyal dog who wouldnt want any nobler service than the golden privilege of lying at your door nights and biting everything that came along and i am that very one and ready to come at the dropping of a hat do you think you could convey my love and thanks to your daddy and owen seaman and those other oppressed and downtrodden subjects of yours you darling small tyrant on my knees these with the kiss of fealty from your other subject mark twain elinor glyn author of three weeks and other erotic tales was in america that winter and asked permission to call on mark twain an appointment was made and clemens discussed with her for an hour or more those crucial phases of life which have made living a complex problem since the days of eve in eden mrs glyn had never before heard anything like mark twains wonderful talk and she was anxious to print their interview she wrote what she could remember of it and sent it to him for approval if his conversation had been frank his refusal was hardly less so to mrs elinor glyn in new york jan dear mrs glyn it reads pretty poorly i get the sense of it but it is a poor literary job however it would have to be that because nobody can be reported even approximately except by a stenographer approximations synopsized speeches translated poems artificial flowers and chromos all have a sort of value but it is small if you had put upon paper what i really said it would have wrecked your typemachine i said some fetid overvigorous things but that was because it was a confidential conversation i said nothing for print my own report of the same conversation reads like satan roasting a sunday school it and certain other readable chapters of my autobiography will not be published until all the clemens family are dead dead and correspondingly indifferent they were written to entertain me not the rest of the world i am not here to do good at least not to do it intentionally you must pardon me for dictating this letter i am sick abed and not feeling as well as i might sincerely yours s l clemens among the cultured men of england mark twain had no greater admirer or warmer friend than andrew lang they were at one on most literary subjects and especially so in their admiration of the life and character of joan of arc both had written of her and both held her to be something almost more than mortal when therefore anatole france published his exhaustive biography of the maid of domremy a book in which he followed with exaggerated minuteness and innumerable footnotes every step of joans physical career at the expense of her spiritual life which he was inclined to cheapen lang wrote feelingly and with some contempt of the performance inviting the author of the personal recollections to come to the rescue of their heroine compare every one of his statements with the passages he cites from authorities and make him the laughter of the world he wrote if you are lazy about comparing i can make you a complete set of what the authorities say and of what this amazing novelist says that they say when i tell you that he thinks the epiphany january twelfth night is december th christmas dayyou begin to see what an egregious ass he is treat him like dowden and oblige a reference to mark twains defense of harriet shelley in which he had heaped ridicule on dowdens life of the poet a masterly performance one of the best that ever came from mark twains pen langs suggestion would seem to have been a welcome one to andrew lang in london new york april dear mr lang i havent seen the book nor any review of it but only not veryunderstandable references to it of a sort which discomforted me but of course set my interest on fire i dont want to have to read it in french i should lose the nice shades and should do a lot of gross misinterpreting too but therell be a translation soon nicht wahr i will wait for it i note with joy that you say if you are lazy about comparing which i most certainly am i can make you a complete set of what the authorities say and of what this amazing novelist says that they say ah do it for me then i will attempt the article and if i succeed in doing it to my satisfaction will publish it it is long since i touched a pen years and i was intending to continue this happy holiday to the gallows but there are things that could beguile me to break this blessed sabbath yours very sincerely s l clemens certainly it is an interesting fact that an englishman one of the race that burned joan should feel moved to defend her memory against the topheavy perversions of a distinguished french author but lang seems never to have sent the notes the copying would have been a tremendous task and perhaps he never found the time for it we may regret today that he did not for mark twains article on the french authors joan would have been at least unique samuel clemens could never accustom himself to the loss of his wife from the time of her death marriagewhich had brought him his greatest joy in lifepresented itself to him always with the thought of bereavement waiting somewhere just behind the news of an approaching wedding saddened him and there was nearly always a somber tinge in his congratulations of which the following to a dear friend is an example to father fitzsimon in washington june dear father fitzsimon marriage yes it is the supreme felicity of life i concede it and it is also the supreme tragedy of life the deeper the love the surer the tragedy and the more disconsolating when it comes and so i congratulate you not perfunctorily not lukewarmly but with a fervency and fire that no word in the dictionary is strong enough to convey and in the same breath and with the same depth and sincerity i grieve for you not for both of you and not for the one that shall go first but for the one that is fated to be left behind for that one there is no recompense for that one no recompense is possible there are times thousands of times when i can expose the half of my mind and conceal the other half but in the matter of the tragedy of marriage i feel too deeply for that and i have to bleed it all out or shut it all in and so you must consider what i have been through and am passing through and be charitable with me make the most of the sunshine and i hope it will last long ever so long i do not really want to be present yet for friendships sake and because i honor you so i would be there if i could most sincerely your friend s l clemens the new home at redding was completed in the spring of and on the th of june when it was entirely fitted and furnished mark twain entered it for the first time he had never even seen the place nor carefully examined plans which john howells had made for his house he preferred the surprise of it and the general avoidance of detail that he was satisfied with the result will be seen in his letters he named it at first innocence at home later changing this title to stormfield the letter which follows is an acknowledgment of an interesting souvenir from the battlefield of tewksbury and some relics of the cavalier and roundhead regiments encamped at tewksbury in to an english admirer innocence at home redding connecticut aug dear sir i highly prize the pipes and shall intimate to people that raleigh smoked them and doubtless he did after a little practice i shall be able to go further and say he did they will then be the most interesting features of my librarys decorations the horseshoe is attracting a good deal of attention because i have intimated that the conquerors horse cast it it will attract more when i get my hand in and say he cast it i thank you for the pipes and the shoe and also for the official guide which i read through at a single sitting if a person should say that about a book of mine i should regard it as good evidence of the books interest very truly yours s l clemens in his philosophy what is man and now and again in his other writings we find mark twain giving small credit to the human mind as an originator of ideas the most original writer of his time he took no credit for pure invention and allowed none to others the mind he declared adapted consciously or unconsciously it did not create in a letter which follows he elucidates this doctrine the reference in it to the captain and to the kerosene as the reader may remember have to do with captain hurricane jones and his theory of the miracles of isaac and of the prophets of baal as expounded in some rambling notes of an idle excursion by a trick of memory clemens gives the little duke as his suggestion for the prince and the pauper he should have written the prince and the page by the same author to rev f y christ in new york redding conn aug dear sir you say i often owe my best sermons to a suggestion received in reading or from other exterior sources your remark is not quite in accordance with the facts we must change it to i owe all my thoughts sermons and ideas to suggestions received from sources outside of myself the simplified english of this proposition is no mans brains ever originated an idea it is an astonishing thing that after all these ages the world goes on thinking the human brain machinery can originate a thought it cant it never has done it in all cases little and big the thought is born of a suggestion and in all cases the suggestions come to the brain from the outside the brain never acts except from exterior impulse a man can satisfy himself of the truth of this by a single process let him examine every idea that occurs to him in an hour a day in a week in a lifetime if he please he will always find that an outside something suggested the thought something which he saw with his eyes or heard with his ears or perceived by his touch not necessarily today nor yesterday nor last year nor twenty years ago but sometime or other usually the source of the suggestion is immediately traceable but sometimes it isnt however if you will examine every thought that occurs to you for the next two days you will find that in at least nine cases out of ten you can put your finger on the outside suggestion and that ought to convince you that no had that source too although you cannot at present hunt it down and find it the idea of writing to me would have had to wait a long time if it waited until your brain originated it it was born of an outside suggestion sir thomas and my old captain the hypnotist thinks he has invented a new thing suggestion this is very sad i dont know where my captain got his kerosene idea it was fortyone years ago and he is long ago dead but i know that it didnt originate in his head but it was born from a suggestion from the outside yesterday a guest said how did you come to think of writing the prince and the pauper i didnt the thought came to me from the outside suggested by that pleasant and picturesque little historybook charlotte m yonges little duke i doubt if mrs burnett knows whence came to her the suggestion to write little lord fauntleroy but i know it came to her from reading the prince and the pauper in all my life i have never originated an idea and neither has she nor anybody else mans mind is a clever machine and can work up materials into ingenious fancies and ideas but it cant create the material none but the gods can do that in sweden i saw a vast machine receive a block of wood and turn it into marketable matches in two minutes it could do everything but make the wood that is the kind of machine the human mind is maybe this is not a large compliment but it is all i can afford your friend and wellwisher s l clemens to mrs h h rogers in fair hawn mass redding conn aug dear mrs rogers i believe i am the wellest man on the planet today and good for a trip to fair haven which i discussed with the captain of the new bedford boat who pleasantly accosted me in the grand central august but the doctor came up from new york day before yesterday and gave positive orders that i must not stir from here before frost it is because i was threatened with a swoon or days ago and went to new york a day or two later to attend my nephews funeral and got horribly exhausted by the heat and came back here and had a bilious collapse in hours i was as sound as a nut again but nobody believes it but me this is a prodigiously satisfactory place and i am so glad i dont have to go back to the turmoil and rush of new york the house stands high and the horizons are wide yet the seclusion is perfect the nearest public road is half a mile away so there is nobody to look in and i dont have to wear clothes if i dont want to i have been down stairs in nightgown and slippers a couple of hours and have been photographed in that costume but i will dress now and behave myself that doctor had half an idea that there is something the matter with my brain doctors do know so little and they do charge so much for it i wish henry rogers would come here and i wish you would come with him you cant rest in that crowded place but you could rest here for sure i would learn bridge and entertain you and rob you with love to you both ever yours s l c in the foregoing letter we get the first intimation of mark twains failing health the nephew who had died was samuel e moffett son of pamela clemens moffett who was a distinguished journalist an editorial writer on colliers weekly a man beloved by all who knew him had been drowned in the surf off the jersey beach to w d howells kittery point maine aug dear howells wont you and mrs howells and mildred come and give us as many days as you can spare and examine johns triumph it is the most satisfactory house i am acquainted with and the most satisfactorily situated but it is no place to work in because one is outside of it all the time while the sun and the moon are on duty outside of it in the loggia where the breezes blow and the tall arches divide up the scenery and frame it its a ghastly long distance to come and i wouldnt travel such a distance to see anything short of a memorial museum but if you cant come now you can at least come later when you return to new york for the journey will be only an hour and a half per expresstrain things are gradually and steadily taking shape inside the house and nature is taking care of the outside in her ingenious and wonderful fashion and she is competent and asks no help and gets none i have retired from new york for good i have retired from labor for good i have dismissed my stenographer and have entered upon a holiday whose other end is in the cemetery yours ever mark from a gentleman in buffalo clemens one day received a letter inclosing an incompleted list of the worlds one hundred greatest men men who had exerted the largest visible influence on the life and activities of the race the writer asked that mark twain examine the list and suggest names adding would you include jesus as the founder of christianity in the list to the list of statesmen clemens added the name of thomas paine to the list of inventors edison and alexander graham bell the question he answered in detail to buffalo n y private redding conn aug dear sir by private i mean dont print any remarks of mine i like your list the largest visible influence these terms require you to add jesus and they doubly and trebly require you to add satan from ad to ad these gentlemen exercised a vaster influence over a fifth part of the human race than was exercised over that fraction of the race by all other influences combined ninetynine hundredths of this influence proceeded from satan the remaining fraction of it from jesus during those years the fear of satan and hell made christians where love of god and heaven landed one during those years satans influence was worth very nearly a hundred times as much to the business as was the influence of all the rest of the holy family put together you have asked me a question and i have answered it seriously and sincerely you have put in buddha a god with a following at one time greater than jesus ever had a god with perhaps a little better evidence of his godship than that which is offered for jesuss how then in fairness can you leave jesus out and if you put him in how can you logically leave satan out thunder is good thunder is impressive but it is the lightning that does the work very truly yours s l clemens the childrens theatre of the next letter was an institution of the new york east side in which mark twain was deeply interested the children were most if not all of hebrew parentage and the performances they gave under the direction of alice m herts were really remarkable it seemed a pity that lack of funds should have brought this excellent educational venture to an untimely end the following letter was in reply to one inclosing a newspaper clipping reporting a performance of the prince and the pauper given by chicago school children to mrs hookway in chicago sept dear mrs hookway although i am full of the spirit of work this morning a rarity with me lately i must steal a moment or two for a word in person for i have been reading the eloquent account in the recordherald and am pleasurably stirred to my deepest deeps the reading brings vividly back to me my pet and pride the childrens theatre of the east side new york and it supports and reaffirms what i have so often and strenuously said in public that a childrens theatre is easily the most valuable adjunct that any educational institution for the young can have and that no otherwise good school is complete without it it is much the most effective teacher of morals and promoter of good conduct that the ingenuity of man has yet devised for the reason that its lessons are not taught wearily by book and by dreary homily but by visible and enthusing action and they go straight to the heart which is the rightest of right places for them book morals often get no further than the intellect if they even get that far on their spectral and shadowy pilgrimage but when they travel from a childrens theatre they do not stop permanently at that halfway house but go on home the childrens theatre is the only teacher of morals and conduct and high ideals that never bores the pupil but always leaves him sorry when the lesson is over and as for history no other teacher is for a moment comparable to it no other can make the dead heroes of the world rise up and shake the dust of the ages from their bones and live and move and breathe and speak and be real to the looker and listener no other can make the study of the lives and times of the illustrious dead a delight a splendid interest a passion and no other can paint a historylesson in colors that will stay and stay and never fade it is my conviction that the childrens theatre is one of the very very great inventions of the twentieth century and that its vast educational value now but dimly perceived and but vaguely understood will presently come to be recognized by the article which i have been reading i find the same things happening in the howland school that we have become familiar with in our childrens theatre of which i am president and sufficiently vain of the distinction these things among others the educating historystudy does not stop with the little players but the whole school catches the infection and revels in it and it doesnt even stop there the children carry it home and infect the family with it even the parents and grandparents and the whole household fall to studying history and bygone manners and customs and costumes with eager interest and this interest is carried along to the studying of costumes in old bookplates and beyond that to the selecting of fabrics and the making of clothes hundreds of our children learn the plays by listening without book and by making notes then the listener goes home and plays the piece all the parts to the family and the family are glad and proud glad to listen to the explanations and analyses glad to learn glad to be lifted to planes above their dreary workaday lives our childrens theatre is educating children and their families when we put on a play of shakespeare they fall to studying it diligently so that they may be qualified to enjoy it to the limit when the piece is staged your howland school children do the constructionwork stagedecorations etc that is our way too our young folks do everything that is needed by the theatre with their own hands scenedesigning scenepainting gasfitting electric work costumedesigning costume making everything and all things indeed and their orchestra and its leader are from their own ranks the article which i have been reading says speaking of the historical play produced by the pupils of the howland school the question naturally arises what has this drama done for those who so enthusiastically took part the touching story has made a year out of the past live for the children as could no chronology or bald statement of historical events it has cultivated the fancy and given to the imagination strength and purity work in composition has ceased to be drudgery for when all other themes fall flat a subject dealing with some aspect of the drama presented never fails to arouse interest and a rapid pushing of pens over paper that is entirely true the interest is not confined to the dramas story it spreads out all around the period of the story and gives to all the outlying and unrelated happenings of that period a fascinating interest an interest which does not fade out with the years but remains always fresh always inspiring always welcome historyfacts dug by the job with sweat and tears out of a dry and spiritless textbook but never mind all who have suffered know what that is i remain dear madam sincerely yours s l clemens mark twain had a special fondness for cats as a boy he always owned one and it generally had a seat beside him at the table there were cats at quarry farm and at hartford and in the house at redding there was a gray mothercat named tammany of which he was especially fond kittens capering about were his chief delight in a letter to a chicago woman he tells how those of tammany assisted at his favorite game to mrs mabel larkin patterson in chicago redding connecticut oct dear mrs patterson the contents of your letter are very pleasant and very welcome and i thank you for them sincerely if i can find a photograph of my tammany and her kittens i will enclose it in this one of them likes to be crammed into a cornerpocket of the billiard table which he fits as snugly as does a finger in a glove and then he watches the game and obstructs it by the hour and spoils many a shot by putting out his paw and changing the direction of a passing ball whenever a ball is in his arms or so close to him that it cannot be played upon without risk of hurting him the player is privileged to remove it to anyone of the spots that chances to be vacant ah no my lecturing days are over for good and all sincerely yours s l clemens the letter to howells which follows was written a short time before the passage of the copyright extension bill which rendered mark twains new plan here mentioned unneeded at least for the time to w d howells in new york monday oct oh i say where are you hiding and why are you hiding you promised to come here and you didnt keep your word this sounds like astonishment but dont be misled by that come fire up again on your fictionmill and give us another good promise and this time keep it for it is your turn to be astonished come and stay as long as you possibly can i invented a new copyright extension scheme last friday and sat up all night arranging its details it will interest you yesterday i got it down on paper in as compact a form as i could harvey and i have examined the scheme and tomorrow or next day he will send me a couple of copyrightexperts to arrange about getting certain statistics for me authors publishers and the public have always been damaged by the copyright laws the proposed amendment will advantage all three the public most of all i think congress will pass it and settle the vexed question permanently i shall need your assent and the assent of about a dozen other authors also the assent of all the large firms of the publishers these authors and publishers will furnish said assent i am sure not even the pirates will be able to furnish a serious objection i think come along this place seemed at its best when all around was summergreen later it seemed at its best when all around was burning with the autumn splendors and now once more it seems at its best with the trees naked and the ground a painters palette yours ever mark clemens was a great admirer of the sea stories of w w jacobs and generally kept one or more of this authors volumes in reach of his bed where most of his reading was done the acknowledgment that follows was sent when he had finished salthaven to w w jacobs in england redding conn oct dear mr jacobs it has a delightful look i will not venture to say how delightful because the words would sound extravagant and would thereby lose some of their strength and to that degree misrepresent me it is my conviction that dialstone lane holds the supremacy over all purely humorous books in our language but i feel about salthaven as the cape cod poet feels about simon hanks the lord knows all things great and small with doubt hes not perplexed tis him alone that knows it all but simon hanks comes next the poet was moved by envy and malice and jealousy but i am not i place salthaven close up next to dialstone because i think it has a fair and honest right to that high position i have kept the other book moving i shall begin to hand this one around now and many thanks to you for remembering me this house is out in the solitudes of the woods and the hills an hour and a half from new york and i mean to stay in it winter and summer the rest of my days i beg you to come and help occupy it a few days the next time you visit the us sincerely yours s l clemens one of the attractions of stormfield was a beautiful mantel in the billiard room presented by the hawaiian promotion committee it had not arrived when the rest of the house was completed but came in time to be set in place early in the morning of the owners seventythird birthday it was made of a variety of hawaiian woods and was the work of a native carver f m otremba clemens was deeply touched by the offering from those western isles the memory of which was always so sweet to him to mr wood in hawaii nov dear mr wood the beautiful mantel was put in its place an hour ago and its friendly aloha was the first uttered greeting my rd birthday received it is rich in color rich in quality and rich in decoration therefore it exactly harmonizes with the taste for such things which was born in me and which i have seldom been able to indulge to my content it will be a great pleasure to me daily renewed to have under my eye this lovely reminder of the loveliest fleet of islands that lies anchored in any ocean and i beg to thank the committee for providing me that pleasure sincerely yours s l clemens xlvii letters to howells and others life at stormfield copyright extension death of jean clemens clemens remained at stormfield all that winter new york was sixty miles away and he did not often care to make the journey he was constantly invited to this or that public gathering or private party but such affairs had lost interest for him he preferred the quiet of his luxurious home with its beautiful outlook while for entertainment he found the billiard afternoons sufficient guests came from the city now and again for weekend visits and if he ever was restless or lonely he did not show it among the invitations that came was one from general o o howard asking him to preside at a meeting to raise an endowment fund for a lincoln memorial university at cumberland gap tennessee closing his letter general howard said never mind if you did fight on the other side to general o o howard stormfield redding connecticut jan dear general howard you pay me a most gratifying compliment in asking me to preside and it causes me very real regret that i am obliged to decline for the object of the meeting appeals strongly to me since that object is to aid in raising the endowment fund for lincoln memorial university the endowment fund will be the most fitting of all the memorials the country will dedicate to the memory of lincoln serving as it will to uplift his very own people i hope you will meet with complete success and i am sorry i cannot be there to witness it and help you rejoice but i am older than people think and besides i live away out in the country and never stir from home except at geological intervals to fill leftover engagements in mesozoic times when i was younger and indiscreeter you ought not to say sarcastic things about my fighting on the other side general grant did not act like that general grant paid me compliments he bracketed me with zenophon it is there in his memoirs for anybody to read he said if all the confederate soldiers had followed my example and adopted my military arts he could never have caught enough of them in a bunch to inconvenience the rebellion general grant was a fair man and recognized my worth but you are prejudiced and you have hurt my feelings but i have an affection for you anyway mark twain one of mark twains friends was hennikerheaton the socalled father of penny postage between england and america when after long years of effort he succeeded in getting the rate established he at once bent his energies in the direction of cheap cable service and a letter from him came one day to stormfield concerning his new plans this letter happened to be overweight which gave mark twain a chance for some amusing exaggerations at his expense to hennikerheaton in london stormfield redding connecticut jan dear hennikerheaton i do hope you will succeed to your hearts desire in your cheapcablegram campaign and i feel sure you will indeed your cheappostage victory achieved in spite of a quartercentury of determined opposition is good and rational prophecy that you will wireless not being as yet imprisoned in a chinese wall of private cash and highplaced and formidable influence will come to your aid and make your new campaign briefer and easier than the other one was now then after uttering my serious word am i privileged to be frivolous for a moment when you shall have achieved cheap telegraphy are you going to employ it for just your own selfish profit and other peoples pecuniary damage the way you are doing with your cheap postage you get letterpostage reduced to cents an ounce then you mail me a ounce letter with a cent stamp on it and i have to pay the extra freight at this end of the line i return your envelope for inspection look at it stamped in one place is a vast t and under it the figures and under those figures appears an l a sinister and suspicious and mysterious l in another place stamped within a circle in offensively large capitals you find the words due cents finally in the midst of a desert space up nornoreastard from that circle you find a figure of quite unnecessarily aggressive and insolent magnitude and done with a blue pencil so as to be as conspicuous as possible i inquired about these strange signs and symbols of the postman he said they were p o department signals for his instruction instruction for what to get extra postage is it so explain tell me about the large t and the its short for take or as we postmen say grab go on please while i think up some words to swear with due means grab more continue the bluepencil was an afterthought there arent any stamps for afterthoughts the sums vary according to inspiration and they whirl in the one that suggests itself at the last moment sometimes they go several times higher than this one this one only means hog cents more and so if youve got cents about you or can borrow it tell me who gets this corruption half of it goes to the man in england who ships the letter on short postage and the other half goes to the pod to protect cheap postage from inaugurating a deficit i cant blame you i would say it myself in your place if these ladies were not present but you see im only obeying orders i cant help myself oh i know it im not blaming you finally what does that l stand for get the money or give him l its english you know take it and go its the last cent ive got in the world after seeing the oxford pageant file by the grand stand picture after picture splendor after splendor three thousand five hundred strong the most moving and beautiful and impressive and historicallyinstructive show conceivable you are not to think i would miss the london pageant of next year with its shining host of historical english men and women dug from the misty books of all the vanished ages and marching in the light of the sun all alive and looking just as they were used to look mr lascelles spent yesterday here on the farm and told me all about it i shall be in the middle of my th year then and interested in pageants for personal and prospective reasons i beg you to give my best thanks to the bath club for the offer of its hospitalities but i shall not be able to take advantage of it because i am to be a guest in a private house during my stay in london sincerely yours s l clemens it was in that clemens had seen the oxford pageant during the week when he had been awarded his doctors degree it gave him the greatest delight and he fully expected to see the next one planned for in the letter to howells which follows we get another glimpse of mark twains philosophy of man the irresponsible machine to w d howells in new york stormfield redding conn jan dear howells i have to write a line lazy as i am to say how your poe article delighted me and to say that i am in agreement with substantially all you say about his literature to me his prose is unreadable like jane austins no there is a difference i could read his prose on salary but not janes jane is entirely impossible it seems a great pity that they allowed her to die a natural death another thing you grant that god and circumstances sinned against poe but you also grant that he sinned against himself a thing which he couldnt do and didnt do it is lively up here now i wish you could come yrs ever mark to w d howells in new york stormfield redding connecticut in the morning apl written with pencil my pen has gone dry and the ink is out of reach howells did you write me daybeforeday before yesterday or did i dream it in my minds eye i most vividly see your handwrite on a square blue envelop in the mailpile i have hunted the house over but there is no such letter was it an illusion i am reading lowells letter and smoking i woke an hour ago and am reading to keep from wasting the time on page vol i i have just margined a note young friend i like that you ought to see him now it seemed startlingly strange to hear a person call you young it was a brick out of a blue sky and knocked me groggy for a moment ah me the pathos of it is that we were young then and he why so was he but he didnt know it he didnt even know it years later when we saw him approaching and you warned me saying dont say anything about age he has just turned fifty and thinks he is old and broods over it well clara did sing and you wrote her a dear letter time to go to sleep yours ever mark to daniel kiefer no date danl kiefer esq dear sir i should be far from willing to have a political party named after me i would not be willing to belong to a party which allowed its members to have political aspirations or to push friends forward for political preferment yours very truly s l clemens the copyright extension for which the author had been working so long was granted by congress in largely as the result of that afternoon in washington when mark twain had received in uncle joe cannons private room and preached the gospel of copyright until the daylight faded and the rest of the capitol grew still champ clark was the last to linger that day and they had talked far into the dusk clark was powerful and had fathered the bill now he wrote to know if it was satisfactory to champ clark in washington stormfield redding conn june dear champ clark is the new copyright law acceptable to me emphatically yes clark it is the only sane and clearly defined and just and righteous copyright law that has ever existed in the united states whosoever will compare it with its predecessors will have no trouble in arriving at that decision the bill which was before the committee two years ago when i was down there was the most stupefying jumble of conflicting and apparently irreconcilable interests that was ever seen and we all said the case is hopeless absolutely hopeless out of this chaos nothing can be built but we were in error out of that chaotic mass this excellent bill has been instructed the warring interests have been reconciled and the result is as comely and substantial a legislative edifice as lifts its domes and towers and protective lightning rods out of the statute book i think when i think of that other bill which even the deity couldnt understand and of this one which even i can understand i take off my hat to the man or men who devised this one was it r u johnson was it the authors league was it both together i dont know but i take off my hat anyway johnson has written a valuable article about the new law i enclose it at last at last and for the first time in copyright history we are ahead of england ahead of her in two ways by length of time and by fairness to all interests concerned does this sound like shouting then i must modify it all we possessed of copyrightjustice before the fourth of last march we owed to englands initiative truly yours s l clemens because mark twain amused himself with certain aspects of christian science and was critical of mrs eddy there grew up a wide impression that he jeered at the theory of mental healing when as a matter of fact he was one of its earliest converts and never lost faith in its power the letter which follows is an excellent exposition of his attitude toward the institution of christian science and the founder of the church in america to j wylie smith glasgow scotland stormfield august dear sir my view of the matter has not changed to wit that christian science is valuable that it has just the same value now that it had when mrs eddy stole it from quimby that its healing principle its most valuable asset possesses the same force now that it possessed a million years ago before quimby was born that mrs eddy organized that force and is entitled to high credit for that then with a splendid sagacity she hitched it to a religion the surest of all ways to secure friends for it and support in a fine and lofty way figuratively speaking it was a tramp stealing a ride on the lightning express ah how did that ignorant villageborn peasant woman know the human being so well she has no more intellect than a tadpole until it comes to business then she is a marvel am i sorry i wrote the book most certainly not you say you have converts in glasgow fifty years from now your posterity will not count them by the hundred but by the thousand i feel absolutely sure of this very truly yours s l clemens clemens wrote very little for publication that year but he enjoyed writing for his own amusement setting down the things that boiled or bubbled within him mainly chapters on the inconsistencies of human deportment human superstition and human creeds the letters from the earth referred to in the following were supposed to have been written by an immortal visitant from some far realm to a friend describing the absurdities of mankind it is true as he said that they would not do for publication though certainly the manuscript contains some of his mgt delicious writing miss wallace to whom the next letter is written had known mark twain in bermuda and after his death published a dainty volume entitled mark twain in the happy island stormfield redding connecticut nov dear betsy ive been writing letters from the earth and if you will come here and see us i will what put the ms in your hands with the places to skip marked no i wont trust you quite that far ill read messages to you this book will never be published in fact it couldnt be because it would be felony to soil the mails with it for it has much holy scripture in it of the kind that cant properly be read aloud except from the pulpit and in family worship paine enjoys it but paine is going to be damned one of these days i suppose the autumn splendors passed you by what a pity i wish you had been here it was beyond words it was heaven and hell and sunset and rainbows and the aurora all fused into one divine harmony and you couldnt look at it and keep the tears back all the hosannahing strong gorgeousnesses have gone back to heaven and hell and the pole now but no matter if you could look out of my bedroom window at this moment you would choke up and when you got your voice you would say this is not real this is a dream such a singing together and such a whispering together and such a snuggling together of cosy soft colors and such kissing and caressing and such pretty blushing when the sun breaks out and catches those dainty weeds at it you remember that weedgarden of mine and then then the far hills sleeping in a dim blue trance oh hearing about it is nothing you should be here to see it good i wish i could go on the platform and read and i could if it could be kept out of the papers theres a charityschool of young girls in boston that i would give my ears to talk to if i had some more but oh well i cant go and its no use to grieve about it this morning jean went to town also paine also the butler also katy also the laundress the cook and the maid and the boy and the roustabout and jeans coachman are left just enough to make it lonesome because they are around yet never visible however the harpers are sending leigh up to play billiards therefore i shall survive affectionately s l clemens early in june that year clemens had developed unmistakable symptoms of heart trouble of a very serious nature it was angina pectoris and while to all appearances he was as well as ever and usually felt so he was periodically visited by severe attacks of acute breast pains which as the months passed increased in frequency and severity he was alarmed and distressed not on his own account but because of his daughter jean a handsome girl who had long been subject to epileptic seizures in case of his death he feared that jean would be without permanent anchorage his other daughter clara following her marriage to ossip gabrilowitsch in october having taken up residence abroad this anxiety was soon ended on the morning of december th jean clemens was found dead in her apartment she was not drowned in her bath as was reported but died from heart exhaustion the result of her malady and the shock of cold water questionable diagnosis dw the blow to her father was terrible but heavy as it was one may perhaps understand that her passing in that swift painless way must have afforded him a measure of relief to mrs gabrilowitsch in europe redding conn dec o clara clara dear i am so glad she is out of it and safe safe i am not melancholy i shall never be melancholy again i think you see i was in such distress when i came to realize that you were gone far away and no one stood between her and danger but me and i could die at any moment and then oh then what would become of her for she was wilful you know and would not have been governable you cant imagine what a darling she was that last two or three days and how fine and good and sweet and nobleand joyful thank heaven and how intellectually brilliant i had never been acquainted with jean before i recognized that but i mustnt try to write about her i cant i have already poured my heart out with the pen recording that last day or two i will send you that and you must let no one but ossip read it goodbye i love you so and ossip father the writing mentioned in the last paragraph was his article the death of jean his last serious writing and one of the worlds most beautiful examples of elegiac prose harpers magazine dec and later in the volume what is man and other essays xlviii letters of last trip to bermuda letters to paine the last letter mark twain had returned from a months trip to bermuda a few days before jean died now by his physicians advice he went back to those balmy islands he had always loved them since his first trip there with twichell thirtythree years earlier and at bay house the residence of viceconsul allen where he was always a welcome guest he could have the attentions and care and comforts of a home taking claude the butler as his valet he sailed january th and presently sent back a letter in which he said again i am leading the ideal life and am immeasurably content by his wish the present writer and his family were keeping the stormfield house open for him in order that he might be able to return to its comforts at any time he sent frequent letters one or two by each steamer but as a rule they did not concern matters of general interest a little after his arrival however he wrote concerning an incident of his former visit a trivial matter but one which had annoyed him i had been with him in bermuda on the earlier visit and as i remember it there had been some slight oversight on his part in the matter of official etiquette something which doubtless no one had noticed but himself to a b paine in redding bay house jan dear paine there was a military lecture last night at the officers mess prospect and as the lecturer honored me with a special and urgent invitation and said he wanted to lecture to me particularly i being the greatest living master of the platformart i naturally packed helen and her mother into the provided carriage and went as soon as we landed at the door with the crowd the governor came to me at once and was very cordial and apparently as glad to see me as he said he was so that incident is closed and pleasantly and entirely satisfactorily everything is all right now and i am no longer in a clumsy and awkward situation i met up with that charming colonel chapman and other officers of the regiment and had a good time commandant peters of the carnegie will dine here tonight and arrange a private visit for us to his ship the crowd to be denied access sincerely yours s l c helen of this letter was mr and mrs allens young daughter a favorite companion of his walks and drives loomis and lark mentioned in the letters which follow were edward e loomis his nephew by marriage named by mark twain as one of the trustees of his estate and charles t lark mark twains attorney to a b paine in redding hamilton jan dear paine thanks for your letter and for its contenting news of the situation in that foreign and faroff and vaguelyremembered country where you and loomis and lark and other beloved friends are i have a letter from clara this morning she is solicitous and wants me well and watchfully taken care of my she ought to see helen and her parents and claude administer that trust also she says i hope to hear from you or mr paine very soon i am writing her and i know you will respond to your part of her prayer she is pretty desolate now after jeans emancipation the only kindness god ever did that poor unoffending child in all her hard life ys ever s l c send clara a copy of howellss gorgeous letter i want a copy of my article that he is speaking of the gorgeous letter was concerning mark twains article the turningpoint in my life which had just appeared in one of the harper publications howells wrote of it while your wonderful words are warm in my mind yet i want to tell you what you know already that you never wrote anything greater finer than that turningpoint paper of yours from the early bermuda letters we may gather that mark twains days were enjoyable enough and that his malady was not giving him serious trouble thus far near the end of january he wrote life continues here the same as usual there isnt a flaw in it good times good home tranquil contentment all day and every day without a break i shouldnt know how to go about bettering my situation he did little in the way of literary work probably finding neither time nor inclination for it when he wrote at all it was merely to set down some fanciful drolleries with no thought of publication to prof william lyon phelps yale college hamilton march dear professor phelps i thank you ever so much for the book professor phelpss essays on modern novelists which i find charming so charming indeed that i read it through in a single night and did not regret the lost nights sleep i am glad if i deserve what you have said about me and even if i dont i am proud and well contented since you think i deserve it yes i saw prof lounsbury and had a most pleasant time with him he ought to have staid longer in this little paradise partly for his own sake but mainly for mine i knew my poor jean had written you i shall not have so dear and sweet a secretary again good health to you and all good fortune attend you sincerely yours s l clemens he would appear to have written not many letters besides those to mrs gabrilowitsch and to stormfield but when a little girl sent him a report of a dream inspired by reading the prince and the pauper he took the time and trouble to acknowledge it realizing no doubt that a line from him would give the child happiness to miss sulamith in new york bay house bermuda march dear miss sulamith i think it is a remarkable dream for a girl of to have dreamed in fact for a person of any age to have dreamed because it moves by regular grade and sequence from the beginning to the end which is not the habit of dreams i think your report of it is a good piece of work a clear and effective statement of the vision i am glad to know you like the prince and the pauper so well and i believe with you that the dream is good evidence of that liking i think i may say with your sister that i like myself best when i am serious sincerely yours s l clemens through february and most of march letters and reports from him were about the same he had begun to plan for his return and concerning amusements at stormfield for the entertainment of the neighbors and for the benefit of the library which he had founded soon after his arrival in redding in these letters he seldom mentioned the angina pains that had tortured him earlier but once when he sent a small photograph of himself it seemed to us that his face had become thin and that he had suffered certainly his next letter was not reassuring to a b paine in redding dear paine we must look into the magiclantern business maybe the modern lantern is too elaborate and troublesome for backsettlement use but we can inquire we must have some kind of a show at stormfield to entertain the countryside with we are booked to sail in the bermudian april rd but dont tell anybody i dont want it known i may have to go sooner if the pain in my breast doesnt mend its ways pretty considerably i dont want to die here for this is an unkind place for a person in that condition i should have to lie in the undertakers cellar until the ship would remove me and it is dark down there and unpleasant the colliers will meet me on the pier and i may stay with them a week or two before going home it all depends on the breast pain i dont want to die there i am growing more and more particular about the place with love s l c this letter had been written by the hand of his secretary helen allen writing had become an effort to him yet we did not suspect how rapidly the end was approaching and only grew vaguely alarmed a week later however it became evident that his condition was critical dear paine i have been having a most uncomfortable time for the past days with that breastpain which turns out to be an affection of the heart just as i originally suspected the news from new york is to the effect that nonbronchial weather has arrived there at last therefore if i can get my breast trouble in traveling condition i may sail for home a week or two earlier than has heretofore been proposed yours as ever s l clemens per h s a in this letter he seems to have forgotten that his trouble had been pronounced an affection of the heart long before he left america though at first it had been thought that it might be gastritis the same mail brought a letter from mr allen explaining fully the seriousness of his condition i sailed immediately for bermuda arriving there on the th of april he was not suffering at the moment though the pains came now with alarming frequency and violence he was cheerful and brave he did not complain he gave no suggestion of a man whose days were nearly ended a part of the stormfield estate had been a farm which he had given to jean clemens where she had busied herself raising some live stock and poultry after her death he had wished the place to be sold and the returns devoted to some memorial purpose the sale had been made during the winter and the price received had been paid in cash i found him full of interest in all affairs and anxious to discuss the memorial plan a day or two later he dictated the following letterthe last he would ever send it seemed fitting that this final word from one who had so long given happiness to the whole world should record a special gift to his neighbors to charles t lark in new york hamilton bermuda april dear mr lark i have told paine that i want the money derived from the sale of the farm which i had given but not conveyed to my daughter jean to be used to erect a building for the mark twain library of redding the building to be called the jean l clemens memorial building i wish to place the money in the hands of three trustees paine and two others h a lounsbury and william e hazen all of redding these trustees to form a building committee to decide on the size and plan of the building needed and to arrange for and supervise the work in such a manner that the fund shall amply provide for the building complete with necessary furnishings leaving if possible a balance remaining sufficient for such repairs and additional furnishings as may be required for two years from the time of completion will you please draw a document covering these requirements and have it ready by the time i reach new york april th very sincerely s l clemens we sailed on the th of april reaching new york on the th as he had planned a day or two later mr and mrs gabrilowitsch summoned from italy by cable arrived he suffered very little after reaching stormfield and his mind was comparatively clear up to the last day on the afternoon of april st he sank into a state of coma and just at sunset he died three days later at elmira new york he was laid beside mrs clemens and those others who had preceded him the last day at stormfield by bliss carman at redding connecticut the april sunrise pours over the hardwood ridges softening and greening now in the first magic of spring the wild cherrytrees are in bloom the bloodroot is white underfoot the serene early light flows on touching with glory the world and flooding the large upper room where a sick man sleeps slowly he opens his eyes after long weariness smiles and stretches arms overhead while those about him take heart with his awakening strength morning and spring in the air the strong clean scents of earth the call of the golden shaft ringing across the hills he takes up his heartening book opens the volume and reads a page of old rugged carlyle the dour philosopher who looked askance upon life lurid ironical grim yet sound at the core but weariness returns he lays the book aside with his glasses upon the bed and gladly sleeps sleep blessed abundant sleep is all that he needs and when the close of day reddens upon the hills and washes the room with rose in the twilight hush the summoner comes to him ever so gently unseen touches him on the shoulder and with the departing sun our great funning friend is gone how he has made us laugh a whole generation of men smiled in the joy of his wit but who knows whether he was not like those deep jesters of old who dwelt at the courts of kings arthurs pendragons lears plying the wise fools trade making men merry at will hiding their deeper thoughts under a motley array keeneyed serious men watching the sorry world the gaudy pageant of life with pity and wisdom and love fearless extravagant wild his caustic merciless mirth was leveled at pompous shams doubt not behind that mask there dwelt the soul of a man resolute sorrowing sage as sure a champion of good as ever rode forth to fray haply who knows somewhere in avalon isle of dreams in vast contentment at last with every grief done away while chaucer and shakespeare wait and moliere hangs on his words and cervantes not far off listens and smiles apart with that incomparable drawl he is jesting with dagonet now
