the witchs head swell out sad harmonies from the slow cadence of the gathering years for life is bittersweet yet bounds the flood of human fears a deathcrowned queen from her hid throne she scatters smiles and tears until time turn aside and we slip past him towards the wide increase of all things beautiful then finding there our rest and peace the mournful strain is ended sorrow and song together cease a m barber book i chapter i ernests appearance come here boy let me look at you ernest advanced a step or two and looked his uncle in the face he was a noblelooking lad of about thirteen with large dark eyes black hair that curled over his head and the unmistakable air of breeding that marks englishmen of good race his uncle let his wandering glance stray round him but wandering as it was it seemed to take him in from top to toe presently he spoke again i like you boy ernest said nothing let me see your second name is beyton i am glad they called you beyton it was your grandmothers maiden name and a good old name too ernest beyton kershaw by the way have you ever seen anything of your other uncle sir hugh kershaw the boys cheek flushed no i have not and i never wish to he answered why not because when my mother wrote to him before she died here the lads voice choked just after the bank broke and she lost all her money he wrote back and said that because his brother i mean my father had made a low marriage that was no reason why he should support his child and widow but he sent her five pounds to go on with she sent it back that was like your mother she always had a high spirit he must be a cur and he does not speak the truth your mother comes of a better stock than the kershaws the carduses are one of the oldest families in the eastern counties why boy our family lived down in the fens by lynn there for centuries until your grandfather poor weak man got involved in his great lawsuit and ruined us all there there it has gone into the law but it is coming back it is coming back fast this sir hugh has only one son by the way do you know that if anything happened to him you would be next in the entail at any rate you would get the baronetcy i dont want his baronetcy said ernest sulkily i will have nothing of his a title boy is an incorporeal hereditament for which the holder is indebted to nobody it does not descend to him it vests in him but tell me how long was this before your mother died that he sent the five pounds i mean about three months mr cardus hesitated a little before he spoke again tapping his white fingers nervously on the table i hope my sister was not in want ernest he said jerkily for a fortnight before she died we had scarcely enough to eat was the blunt reply mr cardus turned himself to the window and for a minute the light of the dull december day shone and glistened upon his brow and head which was perfectly bald then before he spoke he drew himself back into the shadow perhaps to hide something like a tear that shone in his soft black eyes and why did she not appeal to me i could have helped her she said that when you had quarrelled with her about her marrying my father you told her never to write or speak to you again and that she never would then why did you not do it boy you knew how things were because we had begged once and i would not beg again ah muttered mr cardus the old spirit cropping up poor rose nearly starving and dying too and i with so much which i do not want o boy boy when you are a man never set up an idol for it frightens good spirits away nothing else can live in its temple it is a place where all things are forgotten duty and the claims of blood and sometimes those of honour too look now i have my idol and it has made me forget my sister and your mother had she not written at last when she was dying i should have forgotten you too the boy looked up puzzled an idol yes went on his uncle in his dreamy way an idol many people have them they keep them in the cupboard with their family skeleton sometimes the two are identical and they call them by many names too frequently it is a womans name sometimes that of a passion sometimes that of a vice but a virtues not often and what is the name of yours uncle asked the wondering boy mine o never mind at this moment a swingdoor in the side of the room was opened and a tall bony woman with beady eyes came through mr de talor to see you sir in the office mr cardus whistled softly ah he said tell him i am coming by the way grice this young gentleman has come to live here his room is ready is it not yes sir miss dorothy has been seeing to it good where is miss dorothy she has walked into kesterwick sir o and master jeremy he is about sir i saw him pass with a ferret a while back tell sampson or the groom to find him and send him to master ernest here that will do thank you now ernest i must go i hope that you will be pretty happy here my boy when your trouble has worn off a bit you will have jeremy for a companion he is a lout and an unpleasant lout it is true but i suppose that he is better than nobody and then there is dorothy and his voice softened as he muttered her name but she is a girl who are dorothy and jeremy broke in his nephew are they your children mr cardus started perceptibly and his thick white eyebrows contracted over his dark eyes till they almost met children he said sharply i have no children they are my wards their name is jones and he left the room well he is a rum sort reflected ernest to himself and i dont think i ever saw such a shiny head before i wonder if he oils it but at any rate he is kind to me perhaps it would have been better if mother had written to him before she might have gone on living then rubbing his hand across his face to clear away the water gathering in his eyes at the thought of his dead mother ernest made his way to the wide fireplace at the top end of the room peeped into the ancient inglenooks on each side and at the old dutch tiles with which it was lined and then lifting his coat after a grownup fashion proceeded to warm himself and inspect his surroundings it was a curious room in which he stood and its leading feature was old oakpanelling all down its considerable length the walls were oakclad to the low ceiling which was supported by enormous beams of the same material the shutters of the narrow windows which looked out on the sea were oak so were the doors and table and even the mantelshelf the general idea given by the display of so much timber was certainly one of stolidity but it could scarcely be called cheerful not even the numerous suits of armour and shining weapons which were placed about upon the walls could make it cheerful it was a remarkable room but its effect upon the observer was undoubtedly depressing just as ernest was beginning to realise this fact things were made more lively by the sudden appearance through the swingdoor of a large savagelooking bullterrier which began to steer for the fireplace where evidently it was accustomed to lie on seeing ernest it stopped and sniffed hullo good dog said ernest the terrier growled and showed its teeth ernest put out his leg towards it as a caution to keep it off it acknowledged the compliment by sending its teeth through his trousers then the lad growing wroth and being not free from fear seized the poker and hit the dog over the head so shrewdly that the blood streamed from the blow and the brute losing his grip turned and fled howling while ernest was yet warm with the glow of victory the door once more swung open violently this time and through it there came a boy of about his own age a dirty deepchested boy with uncut hair and a slow heavy face in which were set great grey eyes just now ablaze with indignation on seeing ernest he pulled up much as the dog had done and regarded him angrily did you hit my dog he asked i hit a dog replied ernest politely but i dont want your buts can you fight ernest inquired whether this question was put with a view of gaining general information or for any particular purpose can you fight was the only rejoinder slightly nettled ernest replied that under certain circumstances he could fight like a tomcat then look out im going to make your head as you have made my dogs ernest in the polite language of youth opined that there would be hair and toenails flying first to this sally jeremy jones for it was he replied only by springing at him his hair streaming behind like a red indians and smiting him severely in the left eye caused him to measure his length upon the floor arising quickly ernest returned the compliment with interest but this time they both went down together pummelling each other heartily with whom the victory would ultimately have remained could scarcely be doubtful for jeremy who even at that age gave promise of enormous physical strength which afterwards made him such a noted character must have crushed his antagonist in the end but while his strength still endured ernest was fighting with such ungovernable fury and such a complete disregard of personal consequences that he was for a while at any rate getting the best of it and luckily for him while matters were yet in the balanced scales of fate an interruption occurred for at that moment there rose before the blurred sight of the struggling boys a vision of a small woman at least she looked like a woman with an indignant little face and an uplifted forefinger o you wicked boys what will reginald say i should like to know o you bad jeremy i am ashamed to have such a brother get up my eye said jeremy thickly for his lip was cut its dolly chapter ii reginald cardus esq misanthrope when mr cardus left the sittingroom where he had been talking to ernest he passed down a passage in the rambling old house which led him into a courtyard on the farther side of the yard which was walled in stood a neat redbrick building one story high consisting of two rooms and a passage on to this building were attached a series of low greenhouses and against the wall at the farther end of these houses was a leanto in which stood the boiler that supplied the pipes with hot water the little redbrick building was mr carduss office for he was a lawyer by profession the long tail of glass behind it were his orchidhouses for orchidgrowing was his sole amusement the tout ensemble office and orchidhouses seemed curiously out of place in the grey and ancient courtyard where they stood looking as they did on to the old onestoried house scarred by the passage of centuries of tempestuous weather some such idea seemed to strike mr cardus as he closed the door behind him preparatory to crossing the courtyard queer contrast he muttered to himself very queer something like that between reginald cardus esquire misanthrope of dums ness and mr reginald cardus solicitor chairman of the stokesly board of guardians bailiff of kesterwick c and yet in both cases they are part of the same establishment case of old and new style mr cardus did not make his way straight to the office he struck off to the right and entered the long line of glasshouses walking up from house to house till he reached the compartment where the temperate sorts were placed to bloom which was connected with his office by a glass door through this last he walked softly with a catlike step till he reached the door where he paused to observe a large coarse man who was standing at the far end of the room looking out intently on the courtyard ah my friend he said to himself so the shoe is beginning to pinch well it is time then he pushed the door softly open passed into the room with the same catlike step closed it and seating himself at his writingtable took up a pen apparently the coarselooking man at the window was too much absorbed in his own thoughts to hear him for he still stood staring into space well mr de talor said the lawyer presently in his soft jerky voice i am at your service the person addressed started violently and turned sharply round good eavens cardus how did you get in through the door of course do you suppose i came down the chimney its very strange cardus but i never eard you come youve given me quite a start mr cardus laughed a hard little laugh you were too much occupied with your own thoughts mr de talor i fear that they are not pleasant ones can i help you how do you know that my thoughts are not pleasant cardus i never said so if we lawyers waited for our clients to tell us all their thoughts mr de talor it would often take us a long time to reach the truth we have to read their faces or even their backs sometimes you have no idea of how much expression a back is capable if you make such things your study yours for instance looks very uncomfortable today nothing gone wrong i hope no cardus no answered mr de talor dropping the subject of backs which was he felt beyond him that is nothing much merely a question of business on which i have come to ask your advice as a shrewd man my best advice is at your service mr de talor what is it well cardus its this and mr de talor seated his portly frame in an easychair and turned his broad vulgar face towards the lawyer its about the railwaygrease business which you own up in manchester yes thats it well then it ought to be a satisfactory subject to talk of it pays hand over fist does it not no cardus that is just the point it did pay it dont now hows that well you see when my father took out the patent and started the business his ouse was the only ouse on the market and he made a pot and i dont mind telling you ive made a pot too but now what do you think theres a beggarly firm called rastrick codley that took out a new patent last year and is underselling us with a better stuff at a cheaper price than we can turn ours out well well weve lowered our price to theirs but we are doing business at a loss we hoped to burst them but they dont burst theres somebody backing them confound them for rastrick codley aint worth a sixpence who it is the lord only knows i dont believe they know themselves that is unfortunate but what about it just this cardus i want to ask your advice about selling out our credit is good and we could sell up for a large pile not so large as we could have done but still large and i dont know whether to sell or hold mr cardus looked thoughtful it is a difficult point mr de talor but for myself i am always against caving in the other firm may smash after all and then you would be sorry if you were to sell now you would probably make their fortunes which i suppose you dont want to do no indeed then you are a very wealthy man you are not dependent on this grease business even if things were to go wrong you have all your landed property here at ceswicks ness to fall back on i should hold if i were you even if it was at a loss for a time and trust to the fortune of war mr de talor gave a sigh of relief thats my view too cardus you are a shrewd man and i am glad you jump with me damn rastrick codley say i o yes damn them by all means answered the lawyer with a smile as he rose to show his client to the door on the farther side of the passage was another door with a glass top to it which gave on to a room furnished after the ordinary fashion of a clerks office opposite this door mr de talor stopped to look at a man who was within sitting at a table writing the man was old of large size very powerfully built and dressed with extreme neatness in hunting costume boots breeches spurs and all over his large head grew tufts of coarse grey hair which hung down in dishevelled locks about his face giving him a wild appearance that was added to by a curious distortion of the mouth his left arm too hung almost helpless by his side mr cardus laughed as he followed his visitors gaze a curious sort of clerk eh he said mad dumb and halfparalysed not many lawyers could show such another mr de talor glanced at the object of their observation uneasily if hes so mad how can he do clerks work he asked o hes only mad in a way he copies beautifully he has quite lost his memory i suppose said de talor with another uneasy glance yes answered mr cardus with a smile he has perhaps it is as well he remembers nothing now but his delusions mr de talor looked relieved he has been with you many years now hasnt he cardus yes a great many why did you bring him ere at all did i never tell you the story then if you care to step back into my office i will it is not a long one you remember when our friend he nodded towards the office kept the hounds and they used to call him hardriding atterleigh yes i remember and ruined himself over them like a fool and of course you remember mary atterleigh his daughter with whom we were all in love when we were young mr de talors broad cheek took a deeper shade of crimson as he nodded assent then went on mr cardus in a voice meant to be indifferent but which now and again gave traces of emotion you will also remember that i was the fortunate man and with her fathers consent was engaged to be married to mary atterleigh so soon as i could show him that my income reached a certain sum here mr cardus paused a moment and then continued but i had to go to america about the great norwich bank case and it was a long job and travelling was slow in those days when i got back mary was married to a man called jones a friend of yours mr de talor he was staying at your house ceswicks ness when he met her but perhaps you are better acquainted with that part of the tale than i am mr de talor was looking very uneasy again now no i know nothing about it jones fell in love with her like the rest and the next i heard of it was that they were to be married it was rather rough on you eh cardus but lord you shouldnt have been fool enough to trust her mr cardus smiled a bitter smile yes it was a little rough but that has nothing to do with my story the marriage did not turn out well a curious fatality pursued all who had any hand in it mary had two children and then did the best thing she could do died of shame and sorrow jones who was rich went fraudulently bankrupt and ended by committing suicide hardriding atterleigh flourished for a while then lost his money on horses and a shipbuilding speculation and got a paralytic stroke that took away all his speech and most of his reason i brought him here to save him from the madhouse that was kind of you cardus oh no he is worth his keep and besides he is poor marys father he is under the fixed impression that i am the devil but that does not matter youve got her children too eh yes i have adopted them the girl reminds me of her mother though she will never have her mothers looks the boy is like old atterleigh i do not care about the boy but thank god they are neither of them like their father so you knew jones said de talor sharply yes i met him after his marriage oddly enough i was with him a few minutes before he destroyed himself there mr de talor i will not detain you any longer i thought that you could perhaps tell me something of the details of marys marriage the story has a fascination for me its results upon my own life have been so farreaching i am sure that i am not at the bottom of it yet mary wrote to me when she was dying and hinted at something that i cannot understand there was somebody behind who arranged the matter who assisted jones suit well well i shall find it all out in time and whoever it is will no doubt pay the price of his wickedness like the others providence has strange ways mr de talor but in the end it is a terrible avenger what are you going queer talk for a lawyers office isnt it here mr de talor rose looking pale and merely nodding to mr cardus left the room the lawyer watched him till the door had closed when suddenly his whole face changed the white eyebrows drew close together the delicate features worked and in the soft eyes there shone a look of hate he clenched his fists and shook them towards the door you liar you hound he said aloud god grant that i may live long enough to do to you as i have done to them one a suicide and one a paralytic madman you you shall be a beggar if it takes me twenty years to make you so yes that will hit you hardest o mary mary dead and dishonoured through you you scoundrel o my darling shall i ever find you again and this strange man dropped his head upon the desk before him and groaned chapter iii old dums ness when mr cardus came half an hour or so later to take his place at the dinnertable for in those days they dined in the middle of the day at dums ness he was not in a good mood the pool into which the records of an individual existence are ever gathering which we call our past will not often bear much stirring even when its waters are not bitter certainly mr carduss would not yet that morning he had stirred it violently enough in the long oakpanelled room used indifferently as a sitting and dining room mr cardus found hardriding atterleigh and his granddaughter little dorothy jones the old man was already seated at table and dorothy was busying herself cutting bread looking as composed and grownup as though she had been fourandtwenty instead of fourteen she was a strange child with her assured air and womans ways and dress her curious thoughtful face and her large blue eyes that shone steadily as the light of a lamp but just now the little face was more anxious than usual reginald she began as soon as he was in the room for by mr carduss wish she always called him by his christian name i am sorry to tell you that there has been a sad disturbance what is it he asked with a frown jeremy again mr cardus could be very stern where jeremy was concerned yes i am afraid it is the two boys but it was unnecessary for her to carry her explanations further for at that moment the swingdoor opened and through it appeared the young gentlemen in question driven in like sheep by the beadyeyed grice ernest was leading attempting the impossible feat of looking jaunty with a lump of raw beefsteak tied over one eye and presenting a general appearance that suggested the idea of the colours of the rainbow in a state of decomposition behind him shuffled jeremy his matted locks still wet from being pumped on but his wounds were either unsuited to the dreadful remedy of raw beefsteak or he had adopted in preference an heroic one of his own of which grease plentifully sprinkled with flour formed the basis for a moment there was silence then mr cardus with awful politeness asked jeremy what was the meaning of this sight weve been fighting answered the boy sulkily he hit thank you jeremy i dont want the particulars but i will take this opportunity to tell you before your sister and my nephew what i think of you you are a boor and a lout and what is more you are a coward at this unjust taunt the lad coloured to his eyes yes you may colour but let me tell you that it is cowardly to pick a quarrel with a boy the moment he sets foot inside my doors i say uncle broke in ernest who was unable to see anything cowardly about fighting an amusement to which he was rather partial himself and who thought that his late antagonist was getting more than his due i began it you know it was not true except in the sense that he had begun it by striking the dog nor did this statement produce any great effect on mr cardus who was evidently seriously angry with jeremy on more points than this but at least it was one of those wellmeant fibs at which the recording angel should not be offended i do not care who began it went on mr cardus angrily nor is it about this only that i am angry you are a discredit to me jeremy and a discredit to your sister you are dirty you are idle your ways are not those of a gentleman i sent you to school you ran away i give you good clothes you will not wear them i tell you boy that i will not stand it any longer now listen i am going to make arrangements with mr halford the clergyman at kesterwick to undertake ernests education you shall go with him and if i see no improvement in your ways in the course of the next few months i shall wash my hands of you do you understand me now the boy jeremy had during this oration been standing in the middle of the room first on one leg then on the other at its conclusion he brought the leg that was at the moment in the air down to the ground and stood firm well went on mr cardus what have you to say i have to say blurted out jeremy that i dont want your education you care nothing about me he went on his grey eyes flashing and his heavy face lighting up nobody cares about me except my dog nails yes you make a dog of me myself you throw things to me as i throw nails a bone i dont want your education and i wont have it i dont want the fine clothes you buy for me and i wont wear them i dont want to be a burden on you either let me go away and be a fisherlad and earn my bread if it hadnt been for her pointing to his sister who was sitting aghast at his outburst and for nails id have gone long ago i can tell you at any rate i should not be a dog then i should be earning my living and have no one to thank for it let me go i say where i shant be mocked at if i do my fair days work im strong enough let me go there ive spoken my mind now and the lad broke out into a storm of tears and turning tramped out of the room as he went all mr carduss wrath seemed to leave him i did not think he had so much spirit in him he said aloud well let us have our dinner at dinner the conversation flagged the scene that preceded it having presumably left a painful impression and ernest who was an observant youth fell to watching little dorothy doing the honours of the table cutting up her crazed old grandfathers food for him seeing that everybody had what he wanted and generally making herself unobtrusively useful in due course the meal came to an end and mr cardus and old atterleigh went back to the office leaving dorothy alone with ernest presently the former began to talk i hope that your eye is not painful she said jeremy hits very hard o no its all right im used to it when i was at school in london i often used to fight im sorry for him though your brother i mean jeremy o yes he is always in trouble and now i suppose that it will be worse than ever i do all i can to keep things smooth but it is no good if he wont go to mr halfords i am sure i dont know what will happen and the little lady sighed deeply o i daresay that he will go lets go and look for him and try and persuade him we might try she said doubtfully stop a minute and i will put on my hat and then if you will take that nasty thing off your eye we might walk on to kesterwick i want to take a book out of which i have been teaching myself french back to the cottage where old miss ceswick lives you know all right said ernest presently dorothy returned and they went out by the back way to a little room near the coachhouse where jeremy stuffed birds and kept his collection of eggs and butterflies but he was not there on inquiring of sampson the old scotch gardener who looked after mr carduss orchidhouses she discovered that jeremy had gone out to shoot snipe having borrowed sampsons gun for that purpose that is just like jeremy she sighed he is always going out shooting instead of attending to things can he hit birds flying then asked ernest hit them she answered with a touch of pride i dont think he ever misses them i wish he could do other things as well jeremy at once went up at least fifty per cent in ernests estimation on their way back to the house they peeped in through the office window and ernest saw hardriding atterleigh at his work copying deeds hes your grandfather isnt he yes does he know you in a sort of way but he is quite mad he thinks that reginald is the devil whom he must serve for a certain number of years he has got a stick with numbers of notches on it and he cuts out a notch every month it is all very sad i think it is a very sad world and she sighed again why does he wear huntingclothes asked ernest because he always used to ride a good deal he loves a horse now sometimes you will see him get up from his writing table and the tears come into his eyes if anybody comes into the yard on horseback once he came out and tried to get on to a horse and ride off but they stopped him why dont they let him ride o he would soon kill himself old jack tares who lives at kesterwick and gets his living by rats and ferrets used to be whip to grandfathers hounds when he had them and says that he always was a little mad about riding one moonlight night he and grandfather went out to hunt a stag that had strayed here out of some park they put the stag out of a little grove at a place called claffton five miles away and he took them round by starton and ashleigh and then came down the flats to the sea about a mile and a half below here just this side of the quicksand the moon was so bright that it was almost like day and for the last mile the stag was in view not more than a hundred yards in front of the hounds and the pace was racing when he came to the beach he went right through the waves out to the sea and the hounds after him and grandfather after them they caught him a hundred yards out and killed him and then grandfather turned his horses head and swam with the hounds my eye was ernests comment on this story and what did jack tares do o he stopped on the beach and said his prayers he thought that they would all be drowned then they passed through the old house which was built on a little ness or headland that jutted beyond the level of the shoreline and across which the wind swept and raved all the winter long driving the great waves in ceaseless thunder against the sandy cliffs it was a desolate spot that the grey and massive house of which the roof was secured by huge blocks of rock looked out upon nude of vegetation save for rank rushlike grass and plants of seaholly in front was the great ocean rushing in continually upon the sandy bulwarks and with but few ships to break its loneliness to the left far as the eye could reach ran a line of cliff till it was as full of gaps as an old crones jaw behind this stretched mile upon mile of desolatelooking land covered for the most part with ling and heath and cut up with dikes whence the water was pumped by means of windmills that gave a dutch appearance to the landscape look said dorothy pointing to a small white house about a mile and a half away up the shoreline that is the lockhouse where the great sluicegates are and beyond that is the dreadful quicksand in which a whole army was once swallowed up like the egyptians in the red sea my word said ernest much interested and i say did my uncle build this house you silly boy why it has been built for hundreds of years somebody of the name of dum built it and that is why it is called dums ness at least i suppose so there is an old chart that reginald has which was made in the time of henry vii and it is marked as dums ness there so dum must have lived before then look she went on as turning to the right they rounded the old house and reached the road which ran along the top of the cliff there are the ruins of titheburgh abbey and she pointed to the remains of an enormous church with a still perfect tower that stood within a few hundred yards of them almost upon the edge of the cliff why dont they build it up again asked ernest dorothy shook her head because in a few years the sea will swallow it nearly all the graveyard has gone already it is the same with kesterwick where we are going kesterwick was a great town once the kings of east anglia made it their capital and a bishop lived there after that it was a great port with thousands upon thousands of inhabitants but the sea came on and on and choked up the harbour and washed away the cliffs and they could not keep it out and now kesterwick is nothing but a little village with one fine old church left the real kesterwick lies there under the sea if you walk along the beach after a great gale you will find hundreds of bricks and tiles washed from the houses that are going to pieces down in the deep water just fancy on one sunday afternoon in the reign of queen elizabeth three of the parish churches were washed over the cliff into the sea so she went on telling the listening ernest tale after tale of the old town than which babylon had not fallen more completely till they came to a pretty little modern house bowered up in trees that is in summer for there were no leaves upon them now with which ernest was destined to become very well acquainted in after years dorothy left her companion at the gate while she went in to leave her book remarking that she would be ashamed to introduce a boy with so black an eye presently she came back again saying that miss ceswick was out who is miss ceswick asked ernest who at this period of his existence had a burning thirst for information of every sort she is a very beautiful old lady was dorothys answer her family lived for many years at a place called ceswicks ness but her brother lost all his money gambling and the place was sold and mr de talor that horrid fat man whom you saw drive away this morning bought it does she live alone yes but she has some nice nieces the daughter of her brother who is dead and whose mother is very ill and if she dies one of them is coming to live with her she is just my age so i hope she will come after this there was silence for a while ernest said the little woman presently you look kind so i will ask you i want you to help me about jeremy ernest feeling much puffed up at the compliment implied expressed his willingness to do anything he could you see ernest she went on fixing her sweet blue eyes on his face jeremy is a great trouble to me he will go his own way and he does not like reginald and reginald does not like him if reginald comes in at one door jeremy goes out at the other besides he always flies in reginalds face and you see it is not right of jeremy because after all reginald is very kind to us and there is no reason he should be except that i believe he was fond of our mother and if it was not for reginald whom i love very much though he is curious sometimes i dont know what would become of grandfather or us so you see i think that jeremy ought to behave better to him and i want to ask you to bear with his rough ways and try to be friends with him and get him to behave better it is not much for him to do in return for all your uncles kindness you see i can do a little something because i look after the housekeeping but he does nothing first i want you to get him to make no more trouble about going to mr halfords all right ill try but i say how do you learn you seem to know an awful lot o i teach myself in the evenings reginald wanted to get me a governess but i would not how should i ever get grice and the servants to obey me if they saw that i had to do what a strange woman told me it would not do at all just then they were passing the ruins of titheburgh abbey it was almost dark for the winters evening was closing in rapidly when suddenly dorothy gave a little shriek for from behind a ruined wall there rose up an armed mysterious figure with something white behind it next second she saw that it was jeremy who had returned from shooting and was apparently waiting for them o jeremy how you frightened me what is it i want to speak to him was the laconic reply ernest stood still wondering what was coming look here you told a lie to try to save me from catching it this morning you said that you began it you didnt i began it id have told him too and he jerked his thumb in the direction of dums ness only my mouth was so full of words that i could not get it out but i want to say i thank you and here take the dog hes a nasty tempered devil but hell grow very fond of you if you are kind to him and seizing the astonished nails by the collar he thrust him towards ernest for a moment there was a struggle in ernests mind for he greatly longed to possess a bullterrier dog but his gentlemanlike feeling prevailed i dont want the dog and i didnt do anything in particular yes you did though replied jeremy greatly relieved that ernest did not accept his dog which he loved or at least you did more than anybody ever did before but i tell you what ill do as much for you one day ill do anything you like will you though answered ernest who was a sharp youth and opportunely remembered dorothys request yes i will well then come to this fellow halford with me i dont want to go alone jeremy slowly rubbed his face with the back of an exceedingly dirty hand this was more than he had bargained for but his word was his word all right he answered ill come then whistling to his dog he vanished into the shadows thus began a friendship between these two that endured all their lives chapter iv boys together jeremy kept his word on the appointed day he appeared ready as he expressed it to tackle that bloke halford what is more he appeared with his hair cut a decent suit of clothes on and wonder of wonders his hands properly washed for all of which he was rewarded by finding that the tackling was not such a fearful business as he had anticipated it was moreover of an intermittent nature for the lads found plenty of time to indulge in every sort of manly exercise together in winter they would roam all over the wide marshlands in search of snipe and wild ducks which ernest missed and jeremy brought down with unerring aim and in summer they would swim or fish and birdnest to their hearts content in this way they contrived to combine the absorption of a little learning with that of a really extended knowledge of animal life and a large quantity of health and spirits they were happy years those for both the lads and to jeremy when he compared them to his life as it had been before ernest came they seemed perfectly heavenly for whether it was that he had improved in his manners since then or that ernest stood as a buffer between him and mr cardus it certainly happened that he came into collision with him far less often indeed it seemed to jeremy that the old gentleman it was the fashion to call mr cardus old though he was in reality only middleaged was more tolerant of him than formerly though he knew that he would never be a favourite as for ernest everybody loved the boy and then as afterwards he was a great favourite with women who would one and all do anything he asked it was a wonder that he did not get spoiled by it all but he did not it was not possible to know ernest kershaw at any period of his life without taking a fancy to him he was so eminently and unaffectedly a gentleman and so completely free from any sort of swagger always ready to do a kindness and never forgetting one done generous with his possessions to such an extent that he seemed to have a vague idea that they were the common property of his friends and himself possessing that greatest of gifts a sympathetic mind and true as steel no wonder that he was always popular both with men and women ernest grew into a handsome lad too as soon as he began to get his height with a shapely form a beautiful pair of eyes and an indescribable appearance of manliness and spirit but the greatest charm of his face was always its quick intelligence and unvarying kindliness as for jeremy he did not change much he simply expanded very largely year by year his form assumed more and more enormous proportions and his strength grew more and more abnormal as for his mind it did not grow with the same rapidity and was loth to admit a new idea but once it was in it never came out again he had a ruling passion too this dull giant and that was his intense affection and admiration for ernest it was an affection that grew with his growth till it became a part of himself increasing with the increasing years till at last it was nearly pathetic in its entirety it was but rarely that he parted from ernest except indeed on those occasions when ernest chose to go abroad to pursue his study of foreign languages of which he was rather fond then and then only jeremy would strike he disliked parting with ernest much but he objected being intensely insular to cohabit with foreigners yet more so on these occasions and these only for a while they separated so the years wore on till when they were eighteen mr cardus after his sudden fashion announced his intention of sending them both to cambridge ernest always remembered it for it was on that very day that he first made the acquaintance of florence ceswick he had just issued from his uncles presence and was seeking dolly to communicate the intelligence to her when he suddenly blundered in upon old miss ceswick and with her a young lady this young lady to whom miss ceswick introduced him as her niece at once attracted his attention on being introduced the girl who was about his own age touched his outstretched palm with her slender fingers throwing on him at the same moment so sharp a look from her brown eyes that he afterwards declared to jeremy that it seemed to go right through him she was a remarkablelooking girl the hair which curled profusely over a shapely head was like the eyes brown the complexion olive the features were small and the lips full curving over a beautiful set of teeth in person she was rather short but squarely built and at her early age her figure was perfectly formed indeed she might to all appearances have been much older than she was there was little of the typical girl about her while he was still observing her his uncle came into the room and was duly introduced by the old lady to her niece who had she said come to share her loneliness how do you like kesterwick miss florence asked mr cardus with his usual courtly smile it is much what i expected a little duller perhaps she answered composedly ah perhaps you have been accustomed to a gayer spot yes till my mother died we lived at brighton there is plenty of life there not that we could mix in it we were too poor but at any rate we could watch it do you like life miss florence yes we only live such a short time i should like she went on throwing her head back and halfclosing her eyes to see as much as i can and to exhaust every emotion perhaps miss florence you would find some of them rather unpleasant answered mr cardus with a smile possibly but it is better to travel through a bad country than to grow in a good one mr cardus smiled again the girl interested him rather do you know miss ceswick he said changing the subject and addressing the stately old lady who was sitting smoothing her laces and looking rather aghast at her nieces utterances that this young gentleman is going to college and jeremy too indeed said miss ceswick i hope that you will do great things there ernest while ernest was disclaiming any intentions of the sort miss florence cut in again raising her eyes from a deep contemplation of that young gentlemans long shanks which were writhing under her keen glance and twisting themselves serpentwise round the legs of the chair i did not know she said that they took boys at college then they took their leave and ernest stigmatised her to dorothy as a beast but she was at least attractive in her own peculiar fashion and during the next year or two he became rather intimate with her so ernest and jeremy went up to cambridge but did not set the place on fire nor were the voices of tutors loud in their praise jeremy it is true rowed one year in the varsity race and performed prodigies of strength and so covered himself with a sort of glory which personally being of a modest mind he did not particularly appreciate ernest did not even do that but by hook or by crook at the termination of their collegiate career they took some sort of degree and then departed from the shores of the cam on which they had spent many a jovial day jeremy to return to kesterwick and ernest to pay several visits to college friends in town and elsewhere thus ended the first little round of their days chapter v evas promise when on leaving cambridge jeremy got back to dums ness mr cardus received him with his usual semicontemptuous coldness a mental attitude that often nearly drove the young fellow wild with mortification not that mr cardus really felt any contempt for him now he had lost all that years ago when the boy had been so anxious to go and earn his bread but he could never forgive him for being the son of his father or conquer his inherent dislike to him on the other hand he certainly did not allow this to interfere with his treatment of the lad if anything indeed it made him more careful what he spent upon ernest the same sum he spent on jeremy pound for pound but there was this difference about it the money he spent on ernest he gave from love and that on jeremy from a sense of duty now jeremy knew all this well enough and it made him very anxious to earn his own living and become independent of mr cardus but it was one thing to be anxious to earn your own living and quite another to do it as many a poor wretch knows to his cost and when jeremy set his slow brain to consider how he should go about the task it quite failed to supply him with any feasible idea yet he did not want much jeremy was not of an ambitious temperament if he could earn enough to keep a cottage over his head and find himself in food and clothes and powder and shot he would be perfectly content indeed there were to be only two sine qua nons in his ideal occupation it must admit of a considerable amount of outdoor exercise and be of such a nature as would permit him to see plenty of ernest without more or less of ernests company life would not he considered be worth living for a week or more after his arrival home these perplexing reflections simmered incessantly inside jeremys head till at length feeling that they were getting too much for him he determined to consult his sister which as she had three times his brains he would have done well to think of before dolly fixed her steady blue eyes upon him and listened to his tale in silence and so you see doll he always called her doll he ended up im in a regular fix i dont know what im fit for unless its to row a boat or let myself out to bad shots to kill their game for them you see i must stick on to ernest i dont feel somehow as though i could get along without him if it wasnt for that id emigrate i should be just the chap to cut down big trees in vancouvers island or brand bullocks he added meditatively you are a great goose jeremy was his sisters comment he looked up not in any way disputing her statement but merely for further information you are a great goose i say what do you suppose that i have been doing all these three years and more that you have been rowing boats and wasting time up at college i have been thinking jeremy yes and so have i but there is no good in thinking no not if you stop there but ive been acting too ive spoken to reginald and made a plan and he has accepted my plan you always were clever doll youve got all the brains and ive got all the size and he surveyed as much as he could see of himself ruefully you dont ask what i have arranged she said sharply for in alluding to her want of stature jeremy had touched a sore point i am waiting for you to tell me well you are to be articled to reginald o lord groaned jeremy i dont like that at all be quiet till i have told you you are to be articled to reginald and he is to pay you an allowance of a hundred a year while you are articled so that if you dont like it you neednt live here but i dont like the business doll i hate it it is a beastly business its a devils business i should like to know what right you have to talk like that mr knowall let me tell you that many better men than you are content to earn their living by lawyers work i suppose that a man can be honest as a lawyer as well as in any other trade jeremy shook his head doubtfully its bloodsucking he said energetically then you must suck blood she answered with decision look here jeremy dont be pigheaded and upset all my plans if you fall out with reginald over this he wont do anything else for you he doesnt like you you know and would be only too glad to pick a quarrel with you if he could do it with a clear conscience and then where would you be i should like to know jeremy was unable to form an opinion as to where he would be so she went on you must take it for the present at any rate then there is another thing to think of ernest is to go to the bar and unless you become a lawyer if anything happened to reginald there will be nobody to give him a start and im told that is everything at the bar this last jeremy admitted to be a weighty argument it is a precious queer sort of lawyer i shall make he said sadly about as good as grandfather yonder im thinking by the way how has he been getting on o just as usual write write write all day he thinks that he is working out his time he has got a new stick now on which he has nicked all the months and years that have to run before he has done little nicks for the months and big nicks for the years there are eight or ten big ones left now every month he cuts out a nick it is very dreadful you know he thinks that reginald is the devil and he hates him too the other day when he had no writing to do in the office i found him drawing pictures of him with horns and tail such awful pictures and i think reginald always looks like that to him then sometimes he wants to go out riding especially at night only last week they found him putting a bridle on to the grey mare the one that reginald sometimes rides you know when did you say that ernest was coming back she said after a pause why doll i told you next monday week her face fell a little o i thought you said saturday why do you want to know o only about getting his room ready why it is ready i looked in yesterday nonsense you know nothing about it she answered colouring come i wish you would go out i want to count the linen and you are in the way thus adjured jeremy removed his large form from the table on which he had been sitting and whistling to nails now a very ancient and preternaturally wise dog set off for a walk he had mooned along some little way with his hands in his pockets and his eyes on the ground reflecting on the unpleasant fate in store for him as an articled clerk continually under the glance of mr carduss roving eyes when suddenly he became aware that two ladies were standing on the edge of the cliff within a dozen yards of him he would have turned and fled for jeremy had a marked dislike to ladies society and a strong opinion which however he never expressed that women were the root of all evil but thinking that he had been seen he feared that retreat would appear rude in one of the young ladies for they were young he recognised miss florence ceswick who to all appearance had not changed in the least since some years ago she came with her aunt to call on dorothy there were the same brown hair curling as profusely as ever the same keen brown eyes and ripe lips the same small features and resolute expression of face her square figure had indeed developed a little in her tightfitting dress it looked almost handsome and somehow its very squareness that most women would have considered a defect contributed to the air of power and unchanging purpose that would have made florence ceswick remarkable among a hundred handsomer women how do you do said florence in her sharp manner you look as though you were walking in your sleep before jeremy could find a reply to this remark the other young lady who had been looking intently over the edge of the cliff turned round and struck him dumb in his limited experience he had never seen such a beautiful woman before she was a head and shoulders taller than her sister so tall indeed that only her own natural grace could save her from looking awkward like her sister she was a brunette only of a much more pronounced type her waving hair was black and so were her beautiful eyes and the long lashes that curled over them the complexion was a clear olive the lips were like coral and the teeth small and regular every advantage that nature can lavish on a woman she had endowed her with in abundance including radiant health and spirits to these charms must be added that sweet and kindly look which sometimes finds a home on the faces of good women a soft voice a quick intelligence and an utter absence of conceit or selfconsciousness and the reader will get some idea of what eva ceswick was like in the first flush of her beauty let me introduce my sister eva mr jones but mr jones was for the moment paralysed he could not even take off his hat well said florence presently she is not medusa there is no need for you to turn into stone this woke him up indeed occasionally florence had an ugly trick of waking people up and he took off his hat which was as usual a dirty one and muttered something inaudible as for eva she blushed and with ready wit said that mr jones was no doubt astonished at the filthy state of her dress as a matter of fact jeremy could not have sworn that she had one on at all much less to its condition the fact is she went on i have been lying flat on the grass and looking over the edge of the cliff what at why the bones the spot on which they were standing was part of the ancient graveyard of titheburgh abbey and as the sea encroached year by year multitudes of the bones of the longdead inhabitants of kesterwick were washed out of their quiet graves and strewed upon the beach and unequal surfaces of the cliff look she said kneeling down an example that he followed about six feet below them which was the depth at which the corpses had been originally laid could be seen fragments of lead and rotting wood projecting from the surface of the cliff and what was a more ghastly sight eight inches or more of the legbones of a man off which the feet had been washed away on a ledge in the sandy cliff about twentyfive feet from the top and sixty or so from the bottom there lay quite a collection of human remains of all sorts and sizes conspicuous among them being the bones which had composed the feet that belonged to the projecting shanks isnt it dreadful said eva gazing down with a species of fascination just fancy coming to that look at that little babys skull just by the big one perhaps that is the mothers and what is that buried in the sand as much of the object to which she pointed as was visible looked like an old cannonball but jeremy soon came to a different conclusion it is a bit of lead coffin he said oh i should like to get down there and find out what is in it cant you get down jeremy shook his head ive done it as a boy he said when i was very light but it is no good my trying now the sand would give with me and i should go to the bottom he was willing to do most things to oblige this lovely creature but jeremy was above all things practical and did not see the use of breaking his neck for nothing well she said you certainly are rather heavy fifteen stone he said mournfully but i am not ten i think i could get down youd better not try without a rope just then their conversation was interrupted by florences clear voice when you two people have quite finished staring at those disgusting bones perhaps eva you will come to lunch if you only knew how silly you look sprawling there like two turks going to be bastinadoed perhaps you would get up this was too much for eva she got up at once and jeremy followed suit why could you not let us examine our bones in peace florence said her sister jokingly because you are really too idiotic you see mr jones anything that is old and fusty and has to do with old fogies who are dead and gone centuries ago has the greatest charms for my sister she would like to go home and make stories about those bones whose they were and what they did and all the rest of it she calls it imagination i call it fudge eva flushed up but said nothing evidently she was not accustomed to answer her elder sister and presently they parted to go their separate ways what a great oaf that jeremy is said florence to her sister on their homeward way i did not think him an oaf at all she replied warmly i thought him very nice florence shrugged her square shoulders well of course if you like a giant with as much brain as an owl there is nothing more to be said you should see ernest he is nice if you like you seem very fond of ernest yes i am was the reply and i hope that when he comes you wont poach on my manor you need not be afraid answered eva smiling i promise to leave your ernest alone then that is a bargain said florence sharply mind that you keep to your word chapter vi jeremy falls in love jeremy for the first time for some years had no appetite for his dinner that day a phenomenon that filled dorothy with alarm my dear jeremy she said afterwards what can be the matter with you you had only one helping of beef and no pudding nothing at all he replied sulkily and the subject dropped doll said jeremy presently do you know miss eva ceswick yes i have seen her twice what do you think of her doll what do you think of her replied that cautious young person i think she is beautiful as as an angel quite poetical i declare what next have you seen her of course else how should i know she was beautiful ah no wonder you had only once of beef jeremy coloured i am going to call there this afternoon would you like to come went on his sister yes ill come better and better it will be the first call i ever remember your having paid you dont think she will mind doll why should she mind most people dont mind being called on even if they have a pretty face pretty face she is pretty all over well then a pretty all over i start at three dont be late thereupon jeremy went off to beautify himself for the occasion and his sister gazed at his departing form with the puzzled expression that had distinguished her as a child hes going to fall in love with her she said to herself and no wonder any man would she is pretty all over as he said and what more does a man look at i wish that she would fall in love with him before ernest comes home and she sighed at a quarter to three jeremy reappeared looking particularly huge in a black coat and his sunday trousers when they reached the cottage where miss ceswick lived with her nieces they were destined to meet with a disappointment for neither of the young ladies was at home miss ceswick however was there and received them very cordially i suppose that you have come to see my newly imported niece she said in fact i am sure that you have mr jeremy because you never came to call upon me in your life ah it is wonderful how young men will change their habits to please a pair of bright eyes jeremy blushed painfully at this sally but dorothy came to his rescue has miss eva come to live with you for good she asked yes i think so you see my dear between you and me her aunt in london with whom she was living has got a family of daughters who have recently come out eva has been kept back as long as possible but now that she is twenty it was impossible to keep her back any more but then on the other hand it was felt at least i think that it was felt that to continue to bring eva out with her cousins would be quite to ruin their chance of settling in life because when she was in the room no man could be got to look at them so you see eva has been sent down here as a penalty for being so handsome most of us would be glad to undergo heavier penalties than that if we could only be guilty of the crime said dorothy a little sadly ah my dear i daresay you think so answered the old lady every young woman longs to be beautiful and get the admiration of men but are they any the happier for it i doubt it very often that admiration brings endless troubles in its train and perhaps in the end wrecks the happiness of the woman herself and of others who are mixed up with her i was once a beautiful woman my dear i am old enough to say it now and i can tell you that i believe that providence cannot do a more unkind thing to a woman than to give her striking beauty unless it gives with it great strength of mind a weakminded beauty is the most unfortunate of her sex her very attractions which are sure to draw the secret enmity of other women on to her are a source of difficulty to herself because they bring her lovers with whom she cannot deal sometimes the end of such a woman is sad enough i have seen it happen several times my dear often in afterlife and in circumstances that had not then arisen did dorothy think of old miss ceswicks words and acknowledge their truth but at this time they did not convince her i would give anything to be like your niece she said bluntly and so would any other girl ask florence for instance ah my dear you think so now wait till another twenty years have passed over your heads and then if you are both alive see which of you is the happier as for florence of course she would wish to be like eva of course it is painful for her to have to go about with a girl beside whom she looks like a little dowdy i daresay that she would have been as glad if eva stopped in london as her cousins were that she left it dear dear i hope they wont quarrel florences temper is dreadful when she quarrels this was a remark that dorothy could not gainsay she knew very well what florences temper was like but mr jeremy went on the old lady all this must be stupid talk for you to listen to tell me have you been rowing any more races lately no said jeremy i strained a muscle in my arm in the varsity race and it is not quite well yet and where is my dear ernest like most women of whatever age they might be miss ceswick adored ernest he is coming back on monday week o then he will be in time for the smythes lawn tennis party i hear that they are going to give a dance after it do you dance mr jeremy jeremy had to confess that he did not indeed as a matter of fact no earthly power had ever been able to drag him inside a ballroom in his life that is a pity there are so few young men in these parts florence counted them up the other day and the proportion is one unmarried man between the ages of twenty and fortyfive to every nine women between eighteen and thirty then only one girl in every nine can get married put in dorothy whose mind had a trick of following things to their conclusion and what becomes of the other eight asked jeremy i suppose that they all grow into old maids like myself answered miss ceswick dorothy again following the matter to its conclusion reflected that in fifteen years or so there would at the present rate of progression be at least twentyfive old maids within a radius of three miles from kesterwick much oppressed by this thought she rose to take her leave i know who wont be left without a husband unless men are greater stupids than i take them for eh jeremy said the kindly old lady giving dorothy a kiss if you mean me answered dorothy bluntly with a slightly heightened colour i am not so vain as to think that anybody would care for an undersized creature whose only accomplishment is housekeeping and i am sure it is not for anybody that i should care either ah my dear there are still a few men of sense in the world who would rather get a good woman as companion than a pretty face goodbye my dear though jeremy was on this occasion disappointed of seeing eva on the following morning he was so fortunate as to meet her and her sister walking on the beach but when he got into her gracious presence he found somehow that he had very little to say and the walk would to tell the truth have been rather dull if it had not occasionally been enlivened by dashes of florences caustic wit on the next day however he returned to the charge with several hundredweight of the roots of a certain flower which eva had expressed a desire to possess and so it went on till at last his shyness wore off a little and they grew very good friends of course all this did not escape florences sharp eyes and one day just after jeremy had paid her sister a lumbering compliment and departed she summarised her observations thus that mooncalf is falling in love with you eva nonsense florence and why should you call him a mooncalf it is not nice to talk of people so well if you can find a better description i am willing to adopt it i think that he is an honest gentlemanlike boy and even if he were falling in love with me i do not think there would be anything to be ashamed of there dear me what a fuss we are in do you know i shall soon begin to think that you are falling in love with the honest gentlemanlike boy yes that is a better title than mooncalf though not so nervous here eva marched off in a huff well jeremy and how are you getting on with the beautiful eva asked dorothy that same day i say doll replied jeremy whose general appearance was that of a man plunged into the depths of misery dont laugh at a fellow if you only knew what i feel inside you know you wouldnt what are you not well have some brandy suggested his sister in genuine alarm dont be an idiot doll it isnt my stomach its here and he knocked his right lung under the impression that he was indicating the position of his heart and what do you feel jeremy feel he answered with a groan what dont i feel when i am away from her i feel a sort of sinking just like one does when one has to go without ones dinner only its always there when she looks at me i go hot and cold all over and when she smiles its just as though one had killed a couple of woodcocks right and left good gracious jeremy interposed his sister who was beginning to think he had gone off his head and what happens if she doesnt smile ah then he replied sadly its as though one had missed them both though his similes were peculiar it was clear to his sister that the feeling he meant to convey was genuine enough are you really fond of this girl jeremy dear she said gently well doll you know i suppose i am then why dont you ask her to marry you to marry me why i am not fit to clean her shoes an honest gentleman is fit for any woman jeremy and i havent got anything to support her on even if she said yes which she wouldnt you may get that in time remember jeremy she is a very lovely woman and soon she is sure to find other lovers jeremy groaned but if once you had secured her affection and she is a good woman as i think she is that would not matter though you might not be able to marry for some years then what am i to do i should tell her that you loved her and ask her if she would care for you to wait for you awhile jeremy whistled meditatively ill ask ernest about it when he comes back on monday if i were you i should act for myself in that matter she said quickly no good being in a hurry i havent known her for a fortnight ill ask ernest then you will regret it dorothy answered almost passionately and rising left the room now what did she mean by that reflected her brother aloud she always was so deuced queer where ernest is concerned but his inner consciousness returned no satisfactory answer so with a sigh the lovelorn jeremy took up his hat and walked on sunday that was the day following his talk with dorothy he saw eva again in church where she looked he thought more like an angel than ever and was quite as inaccessible in the churchyard he did it is true manage to get a word or two with her but nothing more for the sermon had been long and florence was hungry and hurried her sister home to lunch and then at last came monday the longexpected day of ernests arrival chapter vii ernest is indiscreet kesterwick is a primitive place and has no railway station nearer than raffham four miles off ernest was expected by the midday train and dorothy and her brother went to meet him when they reached the station the train was just in sight and dorothy got down to await its arrival presently it snorted up composedly trains do not hurry themselves on the single lines in the eastern counties and in due course deposited ernest and his portmanteau hullo doll so you have come to meet me how are you old girl and he embraced her on the platform you shouldnt ernest i am too big to be kissed like a little girl and in public too big hm miss fivefeetnothing and as for the public i dont see any the train had gone on and the solitary porter had vanished with the portmanteau well there is no need for you to laugh at me for being small it is not everybody who can be a maypole like you or as broad as he is long like jeremy an unearthly view halloo from this lastnamed personage who had caught sight of ernest through the door of the bookingoffice put a stop to further controversy and presently all three were driving back each talking at the top of his or her voice at the door of dums ness they found mr cardus apparently gazing abstractedly at the ocean but in reality waiting to greet ernest to whom of late years he had grown greatly attached though his reserve seldom allowed him to show it hullo uncle how are you you look pretty fresh sang out that young gentleman before the cart had fairly come to a standstill very well thank you ernest i need not ask how you are i am glad to see you back you have come at a lucky moment too for the batemania wallisii is in flower and the grammatophyllum speciosum too the last is splendid ah said ernest deeply interested for he had much of his uncles love for orchids lets go and see them better have some dinner first you must be hungry the orchids will keep but the dinner wont it was curious to see what a ray of light this lad brought with him into that rather gloomy household everybody began to laugh as soon as he was inside the doors even grice of the beady eyes laughed when he feigned to be thunderstruck at the newly developed beauty of her person and mad old atterleighs contorted features lit up with something like a smile of recognition when ernest seized his hand and worked it like a pumphandle roaring out his congratulations on the jollity of his looks he was a bonny lad the sight of whom was good for sore eyes after dinner he went with his uncle and spent half an hour in going round the orchidhouses with him and sampson the gardener the latter was not behind the rest of the household in his appreciation of meester ernest twasnt many lads he would say that knew an odontoglossum from a sobralia but ernest did and what was more knew whether it was well grown or not sampson appreciated a man who could discriminate orchids and set his preference for ernest down to that cause the dourvisaged old scotchman did not like to own that what really charmed him was the lads openhanded openhearted manner to say nothing of his ready sympathy and honest eyes while they were still engaged in admiring the lovely bloom of the grammatophyllum mr cardus saw mr de talor come into his office which it may be remembered was connected with the orchid bloominghouse by a glass door ernest was much interested in observing the curious change that this mans appearance produced in his uncle as a peaceful cat dozing on a warm stone in summer becomes suddenly changed into a thing of bristling wickedness and fury by the vision of the most inoffensive dog so did the placid baldheaded old gentleman glowing with innocent pleasure at his horticultural masterpiece commence to glow with very different emotions at the sight of the pompous de talor the ruling passion of his life asserted its sway in a moment and his whole face changed the upper lip began to quiver the roving eyes glittered with a dangerous light and then a mask seemed to gather over the features which grew hard and almost inscrutable it was an interesting transformation although they could see de talor he could not see them so for a minute they enjoyed an undisturbed period of observation the visitor walked round the room and casting a look of contempt at the flowers in the bloominghouse stopped at mr carduss desk and glanced at the papers lying on it finding apparently nothing to interest him he retired to the window and putting his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat amused himself by staring out of it there was something so intensely vulgar and insolent in his appearance as he stood thus that ernest could not help laughing ah said mr cardus with a look of suppressed malignity half to himself and half to ernest i have really got a hold of you at last and you may look out my friend then he went in and as he left the bloominghouse ernest heard him greet his visitor in that suave manner with just a touch of deference in it that he knew so well how to assume and de talors reply of ow do cardus ows the business getting on outside the glass houses ernest found jeremy waiting for him it had for years been an understood thing that the latter was not to enter them there was no particular reason why he should not it was merely one of those signs of mr carduss disfavour that caused jeremys pride such bitter injury what are you going to do old fellow he asked of ernest well i want to go down and see florence ceswick but i suppose you wont care to come o yes ill come the deuce you will well i never i say doll he sang out to that young lady as she appeared upon the scene what has happened to jeremy hes coming out calling i fancy hes got an attraction said miss dorothy i say old fellow you havent been cutting me out with florence have you i am sure it would be no great loss if he had put in dorothy with an impatient little stamp of the foot you be quiet doll im very fond of florence shes so clever and nicelooking too if being clever means being able to say spiteful things and having a temper like like a fiend she is certainly clever enough and as for her looks they are a matter of taste not that it is for me to talk about good looks o how humble we are doll dust on our head and sackcloth on our back and how our blue eyes flash be quiet ernest or i shall get angry o no dont do that leave that to people with a temper like like a fiend you know there there dont get cross dolly lets kiss and be friends i wont kiss you and i wont be friends and you may walk by yourselves and before anybody could stop her she was gone ernest whistled softly reflecting that dorothy was not good at standing chaff then after waiting awhile he and jeremy started to pay their call but they were destined to be unfortunate eva whom ernest had never seen and of whom he had heard nothing beyond that she was goodlooking for jeremy notwithstanding his expressed intention of consulting him could not make up his mind to broach the subject was in bed with a bad headache and florence had gone out to spend the afternoon with a friend the old lady was at home however and received them both warmly more especially her favourite ernest whom she kissed affectionately i am lucky she said in having two nieces or i should never see anything of young gentlemen like you i think said ernest audaciously that old ladies are much pleasanter to talk to than young ones indeed master ernest then why did you look so blank when i told you that my young ladies were not visible because i regretted replied that young gentleman who was not often at a loss having lost an opportunity of confirming my views i will put the question again when they are present to take their own part was the answer when their call was over ernest and jeremy separated jeremy to return home and ernest to go to see his old master mr halford with whom he stopped to tea it was past seven on one of the most beautiful evenings in july when he set out on his homeward path there were two ways of reaching dums ness either by the road that ran along the cliff or by walking on the shingle of the beach he chose the latter and had reached the spot where titheburgh abbey frowned at its enemy the advancing sea when he suddenly became aware of a young lady wearing a shady hat and swinging a walkingstick in whom he recognised florence ceswick how do you do ernest she said coolly but with a slight flush upon her olive skin which betrayed that she was not quite so cool as she looked what are you dreaming about i have seen you coming for the last two hundred yards but you never saw me i was dreaming of you of course florence o indeed she answered dryly i thought perhaps that eva had got over her headache her headaches do go in the most wonderful way and that you had seen her and were dreaming of her and why should i dream of her even if i had seen her for the reason that men do dream of women because she is handsome is she betterlooking than you then florence betterlooking indeed i am not goodlooking nonsense florence you are very goodlooking she stopped for he had turned and was walking with her and laid her hand lightly on his arm do you really think so she said gazing full into his dark eyes i am glad you think so they were quite alone in the summer twilight there was not a single soul to be seen on the beach or on the cliffs above it her touch and the earnestness of her manner thrilled him the beauty and the quiet of the evening the sweet freshness of the air the murmur of the falling waves the fading purples in the sky all these things thrilled him too her face looked very handsome in its own stern way as she gazed at him so earnestly and remember he was only twentyone he bent his dark head towards her very slowly to give her an opportunity of escaping if she wished but she made no sign and in another moment he had kissed her trembling lips it was a foolish act for he was not in love with florence and he had scarcely done it before his better sense told him that it was foolish but it was done and who can recall a kiss he saw the olive face grow pale and for a moment she raised her arm as though to fling it about his neck but next second she started back from him did you mean that she said wildly or are you playing with me ernest looked alarmed as well he might the young ladys aspect at the moment was not reassuring mean it he said o yes i meant it i mean ernest and again she laid her hand upon his arm and looked into his eyes did you mean that you loved me as for now i am not ashamed to tell you i love you ernest felt that this was getting awful to kiss a young woman was one thing he had done that before but such an outburst as this was more than he had bargained for gratifying as it was to him to learn that he possessed florences affection he would at that moment have given something to be without it he hesitated a little how serious you are he said at last yes she answered i am i have been serious for some time probably you know enough of me to be aware that i am not a woman to be played with i hope that you are serious too if you are not it may be the worse for us both and she flung his arm from her as though it had stung her ernest turned cold all over and realised that the position was positively gruesome what to say or do he did not know so he stood silent and as it happened silence served his turn better than speech there ernest i have startled you it is it is because i love you when you kissed me just now everything that is beautiful in the world seemed to pass before my eyes and for a moment i heard such music as they play in heaven you dont understand me yet ernest i am fierce i know but sometimes i think that my heart is deep as the sea and i can love with ten times the strength of the shallow women round me and as i can love so i can hate this was not reassuring intelligence to ernest you are a strange girl he said feebly yes she answered with a smile i know i am strange but while i am with you i feel so good and when you are away all my life is a void in which bitter thoughts flit about like bats but there goodnight i shall see you at the smythes dance tomorrow shall i not you will dance with me will you not and you must not dance with eva remember at least not too much or i shall get jealous and that will be bad for us both and now goodnight my dear goodnight and again she put up her face to be kissed he kissed it he had no alternative and she left him swiftly he watched her retreating form till it vanished in the shadows and then he sat down upon a stone wiped his forehead and whistled well might he whistle chapter viii a garden idyl ernest did not sleep well that night the scene of the evening haunted his dreams and he awoke with a sense of oppression that follows impartially on the heels of misfortune folly and lobstersalad nor did the broad light of the summer day disperse his sorrows indeed it only served to define them more clearly ernest was a very inexperienced youth but inexperienced as he was he could not but recognise that he had let himself in for an awkward business he was not in the smallest degree in love with florence ceswick indeed his predominant feeling towards her was one of fear she was as he had said so terribly in earnest in short though she was barely a year older than himself she was a woman possessed of a strength of purpose and a rigidity of will that few of her sex ever attain to at any period of their lives this he had guessed long ago but what he had not guessed was that all the tide of her life set so strongly towards himself that unlucky kiss as it were had shot the bolt of the sluicegates and now he was in a fair way to be overwhelmed by the rush of the waters what course of action he had best take with her now it was beyond his powers to decide he thought of taking dorothy into his confidence and asking her advice but instinctively he shrank from doing so then he thought of jeremy only however to reject the idea what would jeremy know of such things he little guessed that jeremy was swelling with a secret of his own of which he was too shy to deliver himself it seemed to ernest the more he considered the matter that there was only one safe course for him to follow and that was to run away it would be ignominious it is true but at any rate florence could not run after him he had made arrangements to meet a friend and go for a tour with him in france towards the end of the month of august or about five weeks from the present date these arrangements he now determined to modify he would go for his tour at once partially comforted by these reflections he dressed himself that evening for the dance at the smythes where he was to meet florence who however he reflected gratefully could not expect him to kiss her there the dance was to follow a lawntennis party to which dorothy accompanied by jeremy had gone already ernest having for reasons best known to himself declined to go to the lawntennis preferring to follow them to the dance when he entered the ballroom at the smythes the first quadrille was in progress making his way up the room ernest soon came upon florence ceswick who was sitting with dorothy while in the background loomed jeremys gigantic form both the girls appeared to be waiting for him for on his approach florence by a movement of her dress and an almost imperceptible motion of her hand at once made room for him on the bench beside her and invited him to sit down he did so you are late she said why did you not come to the lawntennis i thought that our party was sufficiently represented he answered lamely nodding towards jeremy and his sister why are you not dancing because nobody asked me she said sharply and besides i was waiting for you jeremy said ernest here is florence saying that you didnt ask her to dance dont talk humbug ernest you know i dont dance no indeed put in dorothy it is easy to see that i never saw anybody look so miserable as you do or so big said florence consolingly jeremy shrank back into his corner and tried to look smaller his sister was right a dance was untold misery to him the quadrille had ceased by now and presently the band struck up a waltz which ernest danced with florence they both waltzed well and ernest kept going as much as possible perhaps in order to give no opportunity for conversation at any rate no allusion was made to the events of the previous evening where are your aunt and sister florence he asked as he led her back to her seat they are coming presently she answered shortly the next dance was a galop and this he danced with dorothy whose slim figure looked in the white muslin dress she wore more like that of a child than a grown woman but child or woman her general appearance was singularly pleasing and attractive ernest thought that he had never seen the quaint puckered little face with the two steady blue eyes in it look so attractive not that it was pretty it was not but it was a face with a great deal of thought in it moreover it was a face through which the goodness of its owner seemed to shine like the light through a lamp you look so nice tonight doll said ernest she flushed with pleasure and answered simply i am glad you think so yes i do think so you are really pretty nonsense ernest cant you find some other butt to practise your compliments on what is the good of wasting them on me i am going to sit down really doll i dont know what has come to you lately you have grown so cross she sighed as she answered gently no more do i ernest i did not mean to speak crossly but you should not make fun of me ah here come miss ceswick and eva they had rejoined florence and jeremy the two ladies were seated while ernest and jeremy were standing the former in front of them the latter against the wall behind for they were gathered at the topmost end of the long room at dorothys announcement both the lads bent forward to look down the room and both the women fixed their eyes on ernests face anxiously expectantly something as a criminal fixes his eyes on the foreman of a jury who is about to pronounce words that will one way or another affect all his life i dont see them said ernest carelessly o here they come by george whatever these two women were looking for in his face they had found it and to all appearance it pleased them very little dorothy turned pale and leaned back with a faint smile of resignation she had expected it that smile seemed to say but the blood flamed like a dangerflag into florences haughty features there was no resignation there and meanwhile ernest was staring down the room quite unaware of the little comedy that was going on around him so was jeremy and so was every other man who was there to stare and this was what they were staring at up the centre of the long room walked or rather swept miss ceswick for even at her advanced age she moved like a queen and at any other time her appearance would in itself have been sufficient to excite remark but people were not looking at miss ceswick but rather at the radiant creature who accompanied her and whose stature dwarfed her tall as she was eva ceswick for it was she was dressed in white soie de chinй in the bosom of which was fixed a single rose the dress was cut low and her splendid neck and arms were entirely without ornament in the masses of dark hair which was coiled like a coronet round her head their glistened a diamond star simple as was her costume there was a grandeur about it that struck the whole room but in truth it sprang from the almost perfect beauty of the woman who wore it any dress would have looked beautiful upon that noble form that towered so high and yet seemed to float up the room with the grace of a swan and sway like a willow in the wind but her loveliness did not end there from those dark eyes there shone a light that few men could look upon and forget and yet there was nothing bold about it it was like the light of a star on she came her lips halfparted seemingly unconscious of the admiration she was attracting eclipsing all other women as she passed and making their beauty that before had seemed bright enough look poor and mean beside her own it took but a few seconds ten perhaps for her to walk up the room and yet to ernest it seemed long before her eyes met his own and something passed from them into his heart that remained there all his life his gaze made her blush a little it was so unmistakable she guessed who he was and passed him with a little inclination of her head well here we are at last she said addressing her sister in her pure musical voice what do you think something went wrong with the wheel of the fly and we had to stop to get it mended indeed answered florence i thought that perhaps you came late in order to make a more effective entry florence said her aunt reprovingly you should not say such things florence did not answer but put her lace handkerchief to her lip she had bitten it till the blood ran by this time ernest had recovered himself he saw several young fellows bearing down upon them and knew what they were seeking miss ceswick he said will you introduce me no sooner said than done and at that moment the band began to play a waltz in five seconds more eva was floating down the room upon his arm and the advancing young gentlemen were left lamenting and if the truth must be told anathematising that puppy kershaw beneath their breath there was a spirit in her feet she danced divinely lightly leaning on his arm they swept round the room the incarnation of youthful strength and beauty and as they passed even sour old lady astleigh lowered her ancient nose an inch or more and deigned to ask who was that handsome young man dancing with the tall girl presently they halted and ernest observed a more than usually intrepid man coming towards them with the design no doubt of obtaining an introduction and the promise of dances but again he was equal to the occasion have you a card he asked o yes will you allow me to put my name down for another dance i think that our steps suit yes we get on nicely here it is ernest took it the young man had arrived now and was hovering round and glowering ernest nodded to him cheerfully and put his name very much down indeed for no less than three dances and an extra eva opened her eyes a little but she said nothing their steps suited so very well may i ask you kershaw began his wouldbe rival o certainly answered ernest benignly i will be with you presently and they floated off again on the rising wave of the music when the dance ended they stopped just by the spot where miss ceswick was sitting florence and dorothy were both dancing but jeremy who did not dance was standing by her looking as sulky as a bear with a sore head eva stretched out her hand to him with a smile i hope that you are going to dance with me mr jones she said i dont dance he answered curtly and walked away she glanced after him wonderingly his manner was decidedly rude i do not think that mr jones is in a good temper she said to ernest with a smile o he is a queer fellow going out always makes him cross he answered carelessly then the gathering phalanx of wouldbe partners marched in and took possession and ernest had to retire the ball was drawing to its close the dancingroom notwithstanding its open windows was intensely hot and many of the dancers were strolling in the gardens among them ernest and eva they had just danced their third waltz in which they had discovered that their steps suited better than ever florence dorothy and her brother were also walking all three together it is curious how people in misfortune cling to one another they walked in silence they had nothing to say presently they caught sight of two tall figures standing by a bush on which was fixed a dying chinese lantern it is sometimes unfortunate to be tall it betrays ones identity there was no mistaking the two figures though it was so dark instinctively the three halted and just then the expiring chinese lantern did an unkind thing it caught fire and threw a lurid light upon a very pretty little scene ernest was bending forward towards eva with all his soul in his expressive eyes and begging for something she was blushing sweetly and looking down at the rose in her bosom one hand too was raised as though to unfasten it the light for a moment was so strong that dorothy afterwards remembered noticing how long evas curling black eyelashes looked against her cheek in another second it had flared out and the darkness hid the sequel but it may here be stated that when eva reappeared in the ballroom she had lost her rose charming and idyllic as undoubtedly was this tableau trиs vivant of youth and beauty obeying the primary laws of nature and making love in a garden of eden illumined with chinese lanterns it did not seem to please any of the three spectators jeremy actually forgot the presence of ladies and went so far as to swear aloud nor did they reprove him probably it gave their feelings some vicarious relief i think we had better be going home it is late said dorothy after a pause jeremy will you go and order the carriage jeremy went florence said nothing but she took her fan in both her hands and bent it slowly so that the ivory sticks snapped one by one with a succession of sharp reports then she threw it down and set her heel upon it and ground it into the path there was something inexpressibly cruel about the way in which she crushed the pretty toy the action seemed to be the appropriate and unconscious outcome of some mental process and it is an odd proof of the excitement under which they were both labouring that at the time the gentleminded dorothy saw in it nothing strange at that moment the two girls were nearer each other than they had ever been before or would ever be again the common stroke of misfortune for a moment welded their opposite natures into one at that moment too they knew that they both loved the same man before they had guessed it and had not liked each other the better for it but now that was forgotten i think florence said dorothy with a little tremor in her voice that we are out of the running as jeremy says your sister is too beautiful for any woman to stand against her he has fallen in love with her yes said florence with a bitter laugh and a flash of her brown eyes his highness has thrown a handkerchief to a new favourite and she has lost no time in picking it up we always used to call her the sultana and she laughed again perhaps suggested dorothy she only means to flirt with him a little i hoped that jeremy jeremy what chance has jeremy against him ernest would make more way with a woman in two hours than jeremy would in two years we all love to be taken by storm my dear do not deceive yourself flirt with him she will love him wildly in a week who could help loving him she added with a thrill of her rich voice dorothy said nothing she knew that it was true and they walked a few steps in silence dorothy do you know what generally happens to favourites and sultanas no they come to a bad end the other ladies of the harem murder them you know what do you mean dont be frightened i dont mean that we should murder my dear sister what i do mean is that i think we might manage to depose her will you help me if i find a plan dorothys better self had had time to assert itself by now the influence of the blow was over and their natures were wide apart again no certainly not she answered ernest has a right to choose for himself and if your sister gets the better of us it is the fortune of war that is all though certainly the fight is not quite fair she added as she thought of evas radiant loveliness florence glanced at her contemptuously you have no spirit she said what do you mean to do mean to do she answered swinging round and facing her i mean to have my revenge o florence it is wicked to talk so whom are you going to be revenged on ernest it is not his fault if if you are fond of him yes it is his fault but whether it is his fault or not i suffer remember what i say for it will come true he shall suffer why should i bear it all alone but he shall not suffer so much as she i told her that i was fond of him and she promised to leave him alone do you hear that and yet she is taking him away from me to gratify her vanity she who can have anybody she likes hush florence dont give way to your temper so or you will be overheard besides i daresay that we are making a great deal of nothing after all she only gave him a rose i dont care if we are overheard and it is nothing i guessed that it would be so i knew it would be so and i know what is coming now mark my words within a month ernest and my sweet sister will be sitting about on the cliff with their arms around each others necks i have only to shut my eyes and i can see it o here is jeremy is the carriage there jeremy thats right come on dorothy let us go and say goodnight and be off you will drop me at the cottage wont you half an hour later the fly that had brought miss ceswick and eva came round and with it ernests dogcart but as miss ceswick was rather anxious about the injured wheel ernest as in duty bound offered to see them safe home and ordering the cart to follow got into the fly without waiting for an answer of course miss ceswick went to sleep but it is not probable that either ernest or eva followed her example perhaps they were too tired to talk perhaps they were beginning to find out what a delightful companionship is to be found in silence perhaps his gentle pressure of the little whitegloved hand that lay unresisting in his own was more eloquent than any speech dont be shocked my reader you or i would have done the same and thought ourselves very lucky fellows at any rate that drive was over all too soon florence opened the door for them she had told the servant to go to bed when eva reached the door of her room she turned round to say goodnight to her sister but the latter instead of contenting herself with a nod as was her custom came and kissed her on the face i congratulate you on your dress and on your conquest and again she kissed her and was gone it is not like florence to be so kind reflected her younger sister i cant remember when she kissed me last eva did not know that as there are some kisses that declare peace and set the seal on love there are others that announce war and proclaim the hour of vengeance or treachery judas kissed his master when he betrayed him chapter ix eva finds something when ernest woke on the morning after the ball it was ten oclock and he had a severe headache this the headache was his first impression but presently his eye fell upon a withering red rose that lay upon the dressing table and he smiled then followed reflections those confounded reflections that always dog the heels of everything pleasant in life and he ceased to smile in the end he yawned and got up when he reached the sittingroom which looked cool and pleasant in contrast to the hot july sunshine that beat upon the little patch of bare turf in front of the house and the glittering sea beyond he found that the others had done their breakfast jeremy had gone out but his sister was there looking a little pale no doubt from the late hours of the previous night goodmorning doll goodmorning ernest she answered rather coldly i have been keeping your tea as warm as i can but im afraid it is getting cold you are a good samaritan doll ive got such a head perhaps the tea will make it better she smiled as she gave it to him had she spoke what was in her mind she would have answered that she had such a heart he drank the tea and apparently felt better for it for presently he asked her in comparatively cheerful tones how she liked the dance o very well thank you ernest how did you like it o awfully i say doll yes ernest isnt she lovely who ernest who why eva ceswick of course yes ernest she is very lovely there was something about her tone that was not encouraging at any rate he did not pursue his subject where is jeremy he asked next he has gone out presently ernest having finished his second cup of tea went out too and came across jeremy mooning about the yard hulloa my hearty and how are you after your dissipations all right thank you answered jeremy sulkily ernest glanced up quickly the voice was the voice of jeremy but the tones were not his tones what is up old chap he said slipping his arm through his friends nothing o yes there is though what is it out with it i am a splendid father confessor jeremy freed his arm and remained sulkier than ever ernest looked hurt and the look softened the other well of course if you wont tell me there is nothing more to be said and he prepared to move off as though you didnt know upon my honour i dont then if youll come in here i will tell you and jeremy opened the door of the little outhouse where he stuffed his birds and kept his gun and collection of eggs and butterflies and motioned ernest majestically in he entered and seated himself upon the stuffingtable gazing abstractedly at a bittern that jeremy had shot about the time that this story opened and which was now very motheaten and waved one melancholy leg in the air in a way meant to be imposing but only succeeded in being grotesque well what is it he interrogated of the glassy eye of the decaying bittern jeremy turned his broad back upon ernest he felt that he could speak better on such a subject with his back turned and addressing empty space before him said i think it was precious unkind of you what was precious unkind to go and cut me out of the only girl i ever loved suggested ernest for he was hesitating i ever loved chimed in jeremy for the phrase expressed his sentiments exactly well old chap if you would come to the point a little more and tell me who the deuce you are talking about why who should i be talking about there is only one girl you ever loved i ever loved well in the name of the holy roman empire who is she why eva ceswick ernest whistled i say old chap he said after a pause why didnt you tell me i didnt even know that you knew her are you engaged to her then engaged no well then have you an understanding with her no of course not look here old fellow if you would just slew round a bit and tell me how the matter stands we might get on a little it doesnt stand at all but i worship the ground she treads on there ah said ernest thats awkward for so do i at least i think i do jeremy groaned and ernest groaned too by way of company look here old chap said the latter what is to be done you should have told me but you didnt you see if you had i would have kept clear fact is she bowled me over altogether bowled me clean so she did me ill tell you what jeremy ill go away and leave you to make the running not that i see that there is much good in either of us making the running for we have nothing to marry on and no more has she and we are only twentyone we cant marry at twentyone put in jeremy or we should have a large family by the time were thirty fellows who marry at twentyone always do shes twentyone she told me so she told me too said jeremy determined to show that ernest was not the only person favoured with this exciting fact well shall i clear we cant jaw about it for ever no said jeremy slowly and in a way that showed that it cost him an effort to say it that would not be fair besides i expect that the mischief is done everybody gets fond of you old fellow men or women no you shant go and we wont get to loggerheads over it either ill tell you what we will do we will toss up this struck ernest as a brilliant suggestion right you are he said at once producing a shilling singles or threes singles of course its sooner over ernest poised the coin on his thumb you call but i say what are we tossing for we cant draw lots for the girl like the fellows in homer we havent captured her yet this was obviously a point that required consideration jeremy scratched his head how will this do he said the winner to have a month to make the running in the loser not to interfere if she wont have anything to say to him after a month then the loser to have his fling if she will loser to keep away that will do stand clear up you go the shilling spun in the air tails howled jeremy it lit on the beak of the astonished bittern and bounded off on to the floor finally rolling under a box full of choice specimens of petrified bones of antediluvian animals that had been washed out of the cliffs the box was lugged out of the way with difficulty and the shilling disclosed heads it is said ernest exultingly i expected as much just my luck well shake hands ernest we wont quarrel about the girl please god they shook hands heartily enough and parted but from that time for many a long day there was an invisible something between them that had not been there before strong indeed must be the friendship of which the bonds do not slacken when the shadow of a womans love falls upon it that afternoon dorothy said that she wanted to go into kesterwick to make some purchases and ernest offered to accompany her they walked in silence as far as titheburgh abbey indeed they both suffered from a curious constraint that seemed effectually to check their usual brotherandsisterlike relations ernest was just beginning to feel the silence awkward when dorothy stopped what was that she said i thought i heard somebody cry out they listened and presently both heard a womans voice calling for help the sound seemed to come from the cliff on their left they stepped to the edge and looked over as may be remembered some twenty feet from the top of the cliff and fifty or more from the bottom there was at this spot a sandy ledge on which were deposited many of the remains washed out of the churchyard by the sea now this particular spot was almost inaccessible without ladders because although it was easy enough to get down to its level the cliff bulged out on either side of it and gave for the space of some yards little or no hold for the hands or feet of the climber the first thing that caught ernests eyes when he looked over was a ladys foot and ankle which appeared to be resting on a tiny piece of rock that projected from the surface of the cliff the next was the imploring face of eva ceswick who was sprawling in a most undignified position on the bulge of sandstone with nothing more between her and eternity than the very unsatisfactory and insufficient knob of rock it was evident that she could move neither one way or the other without being precipitated to the bottom of the cliff to which she was apparently clinging by suction like a fly great god exclaimed ernest hold on i will come to you i cant hold much longer it was one thing to say that he would come and another to do it the sand gave scarcely any foothold how was he to get enough purchase to pull eva round the bulge he looked at dorothy in despair her quick mind had taken in the situation at a glance you must get down there above her ernest and lie flat and stretch out your hand to her but there is nothing to hold to when she puts her weight on to my hand we shall both go together no i will hold your legs be quick she is getting exhausted it took ernest but two seconds to reach the spot that dorothy had pointed to and to lay himself flat or rather slanting for his heels were a great deal higher than his head fortunately he discovered a hard knob of sandstone against which he could rest his left hand meanwhile dorothy seating herself as securely as she could above seized him by the ankles then ernest stretched his hand downwards and gripping eva by the wrist began to put out his strength had the three found any time to indulge their sense of humour they might have found the appearance they presented intensely ludicrous but they did not for the very good reason that for thirty seconds or so their lives were not worth a farthings purchase ernest strained and strained but eva was a large woman although she danced so lightly and the bulge over which he had to pull her was almost perpendicular presently he felt that dorothy was beginning to slip above him she must make an effort or we shall all go she said in a quiet voice drive your knees into the sand and throw yourself forward it is your only chance gasped ernest to the exhausted girl beneath him she realised the meaning of his words and gave a desperate struggle pull doll for gods sake pull shes coming then followed a second of despairing effort and she was beside him on the spot where he lay another struggle and the three sank exhausted on the top of the cliff rescued from a most imminent death by jove ejaculated ernest that was a near thing dorothy nodded she was too exhausted to speak eva smiled and fainted he turned to her with a little cry and began to chafe her cold hands oh shes dead doll he said no she has fainted give me your hat before he could do so she had seized it and was running as quickly as her exhaustion would allow towards a spring that bubbled up a hundred yards away and which once had been the water supply of the old abbey ernest went on rubbing for a minute or more but without producing the slightest effect he was in despair the beautiful face beneath him looked so wan and deathlike all the red had left her lips in his distress and scarcely knowing what he did he bent over them and kissed them once twice thrice that mode of restoration is not recommended in the medicine chest guide but in this instance it was not without its effect presently a faint and tremulous glow diffused itself over the pale cheek in another moment it deepened to a most unmistakable blush was it a halfconsciousness of ernests new method of treatment or merely the returning blood that produced the blush let us not inquire next eva sighed opened her eyes and sat up oh you are not dead no i dont think so but i cant quite remember what was it ah i know and she shut her eyes as though to keep out some horrid sight presently she opened them again you have saved my life she said if it had not been for you i should have now been lying crushed at the foot of that dreadful cliff i am so grateful at that moment dorothy came back with a little water in ernests black hat for in her hurry she had spilled most of it here drink some of this she said eva tried to do so but a billycock hat is not a very convenient drinking vessel till you get used to it and she upset more than she swallowed but what she drank did her good she put down the hat and they all three laughed a little it was so funny drinking out of an old hat were you long down there before we came asked dorothy no not long only about half a minute on that dreadful bulge what on earth did you go there for said ernest putting his dripping hat on to his head for the sun was hot i wanted to see the bones i am very active and thought that i could get up quite safely but sand is so slippery oh i forgot look here and she pointed to a thin cord that was tied to her wrist what is that why it is tied to such an odd lead box that i found in the sand mr jones said the other day that he thought it was a bit of an old coffin but it is not it is a lead box with a rusty iron handle i could not move it much but i had this bit of cord with me i thought i might want it getting down you know so i tied one end of it to the handle let us pull it up said ernest unfastening the cord from evas wrist and beginning to tug but the case was too heavy for him to lift alone indeed it proved as much as they could all three manage to drag it to the top however up it came at last ernest examined it carefully and came to the conclusion that it was very ancient the massive iron handle at the top of the oblong case was almost eaten through with rust and the lead itself was much corroded although from fragments that still clung to it it was evident that it had once been protected by an outer case of oak evidently the case had been washed out of the churchyard where it had lain for centuries this is quite exciting said eva who was now sufficiently interested to forget all about her escape what can be in it treasure or papers i should think i dont know answered ernest i should hardly think that they would bury such things in a churchyard perhaps it is a small baby ernest broke in dorothy in an agitated way i dont like that thing i cant tell you why but i am sure it is unlucky i wish that you would throw it back to where it came from or into the sea it is a horrid thing and we have nearly lost our lives over it already nonsense doll whoever thought that you were so superstitious why perhaps it is full of money or jewels lets take it home and open it i am not superstitious and you can take it home if you like i will not touch it i tell you it is a horrid thing all right doll then you shant have a share of the spoil miss ceswick and i will divide it will you help me to carry it to the house miss ceswick that is unless you are afraid of it like doll oh no she answered i am not afraid i am dying of curiosity to see what is inside chapter x what eva found you are sure you are not too tired said ernest after a moments consideration no indeed i have quite recovered she answered with a blush ernest blushed too from sympathy probably and went to pick up a bough that lay beneath a stunted oaktree which grew in the ruins of the abbey on the spot where once the altar had stood this he ran through the iron handle and directing eva to take hold of one end he took the other himself dorothy marching solemnly in front as it happened jeremy and mr cardus were strolling along together smoking when suddenly they caught sight of the cavalcade advancing and hurried to meet it what is all this asked mr cardus of dorothy who was now nearly fifty yards ahead of the other two well reginald it is a long story first we found eva ceswick slipping down the cliff and dragged her up just in time my luck again thought jeremy groaning in spirit i might have sat on the edge of that cliff for ten years and never got a chance of dragging her up then we pulled up that horrid box which she found down in the sand and tied a cord to yes exclaimed ernest who was now arriving and would you believe it dorothy wanted us to throw it back again i know i did i said that it was unlucky and it is unlucky nonsense dorothy it is very interesting i expect that it will be found to contain deeds buried in the churchyard for safety and never dug up again broke in mr cardus much interested let me catch hold of that stick miss ceswick and i daresay that jeremy will go on and get a hammer and a cold chisel and we will soon solve the mystery oh very well reginald you will see said dorothy mr cardus glanced at her it was curious her taking such an idea then they walked to the house on reaching the sittingroom they found jeremy already there with his hammer and chisel he was an admirable amateur blacksmith indeed there were few manual trades of which he did not know a little and placing the case on the table he set about the task of opening it in a most workmanlike manner the lead though it was in places eaten quite away was still thick and sound near the edges and it took him a good quarter of an hours hard chopping to remove what appeared to be the front of the case excitement was at its height as it fell forward with a bang on the table but it was then found that what had been removed was merely a portion of an outer case there being beneath it an inner chest also of lead well said jeremy they fastened it up pretty well and then he set to work again this inner skin of lead was thinner and easier to cut than the first had been and he got through the job more quickly though not nearly quickly enough for the impatience of the bystanders at last the front fell out and disclosed a small cabinet made of solid pieces of black oak and having a hinged door which was fastened by a tiny latch and hasp of the common pattern that is probably as old as doors are from this cabinet there came a strong odour of spices the excitement was now intense and seemed to be shared by everybody in the house grice had come in through the swingdoor and stationed herself in the background sampson and the groom were peering through the window and even old atterleigh attracted by the sound of the hammering had strolled aimlessly in what can it be said eva with a gasp slowly jeremy extracted the cabinet from its leaden coverings and set it on the table shall i open it he said suiting the action to the word he lifted the latch and placing the chisel between the edge of the little door and its frame prised the cabinet open the smell of spices became even more pronounced than ever and for a moment the cloud of dust that came from them as their fragments rolled out of the cabinet on to the table prevented the spectators who all but dorothy were crowding up to the case from seeing what it contained presently however a large whitish bundle became visible jeremy put in his hand pulled it out and laid it on the top of the box it was heavy but when he had done this he did not seem inclined to go any further in the matter the bundle had he considered an uncanny look at that moment an interruption took place for florence ceswick entered through the open door she had come up to see dorothy and was astonished to find such a gathering why what is it all about she asked somebody told her in as few words as possible for everybodys attention was concentrated on the bundle which nobody seemed inclined to touch well why dont you open it asked florence i think that they are all afraid said mr cardus with a laugh he was watching the various expressions on the faces with an amused air well i am not afraid at any rate said florence now ladies and gentlemen the gorgons head is about to be unveiled look the other way or you will all be turned to stone this is getting delightfully ghastly said eva to ernest i know that it will be something horrid added dorothy meanwhile florence had drawn out a heavy pin of ancient make with which the wrapping of the bundle was fastened and began to unwind a long piece of discoloured linen at the first turn another shower of spices fell out as soon as these had been swept aside florence proceeded slowly with her task and as she removed fold after fold of the linen the bundle began to take shape and form and the shape it took was that of a human head eva saw it and drew closer to ernest jeremy saw it and felt inclined to bolt dorothy saw it and knew that her presentiments as to the disagreeable nature of the contents of that unlucky case were coming true mr cardus saw it and was more interested than ever only florence and hardriding atterleigh saw nothing another turn or two of the long windingsheet and it slipped suddenly away from whatever it enclosed there was a moments dead silence as the company regarded the object thus left open to their gaze then one of the women gave a low cry of fear and actuated by some common impulse they all turned and broke from the room in terror and calling it is alive no not all florence turned pale but she stood there by the object the windingsheet in her hands and old atterleigh also remained staring at it either paralysed or fascinated it too seemed to stare at him from its point of vantage on the oak chest in which it had rested for so many centuries and this was what he saw there upon the box let the reader imagine the face and head of a lovely woman of some thirty years of age the latter covered with rippling brown locks of great length above which was set a roughly fashioned coronet studded with uncut gems let him imagine this face all but the lips which were coloured red pale with the bloodless pallor of death and the flesh so firm and freshlooking that it might have been that of a corpse not a day old so firm indeed that the head and all its pendant weight of beautiful hair could stand on the unshrunken base of the neck which in some farpast age cold steel had made so smooth then let him imagine the crowning horror of this weird sight the eyes of a corpse are shut but the eyes in this head were wide open and the long black lashes as perfect now as on the day of death hung over what when the light struck them appeared to be two balls of trembling fire that glittered and rolled and fixed themselves upon the face of the observer like living human eyes it was these awful eyes that carried such terror to the hearts of the onlookers when they cast their first glance around and made them not unnaturally cry out that the head was alive it was not until he had made a very careful examination of these fiery orbs that mr cardus was afterwards able to discover what they were and as the reader may as well understand at once that this head had nothing about it different from any other skilfully preserved head he shall be taken into confidence without delay they were balls of crystal fitted probably by the aid of slender springs into the eyesockets with such infernal art that they shook and trembled to the slightest sound and even on occasion rolled about the head itself he also discovered had not been embalmed in the ordinary way by extracting the brain and filling the cavity with spices of bitumen but had been preserved by means of the injection of silica or some kindred substance into the brain veins and arteries which after permeating all the flesh had solidified and made it like marble some brilliant pigment had been used to give the lips their natural colour and the hair had been preserved by means of the spices but perhaps the most dreadful thing about this relic of forgotten ages was the mocking smile that the artist who set it up had managed to preserve upon the face a smile that just drew the lips up enough to show the white teeth beneath and gave the idea that its wearer had died in the full enjoyment of some malicious jest or triumph it was a terrible thing to look on that longdead beautiful face with its abundant hair its crowning coronet its moving crystal eyes and its smile yet there was something awfully fascinating about it those who had seen it once would always long to see it again mr cardus had fled with the rest but as soon as he got outside the swingdoor his common sense reasserted itself and he stopped come come he called to the others dont be so silly you are not going to run away from a dead womans head are you you ran too said dorothy pulling up and gasping yes i know i did those eyes startled me but of course they are glass i am going back it is a great curiosity it is an accursed thing muttered dorothy mr cardus turned and reentered the room and the others comforting themselves with the reflection that it was broad daylight and drawn by their devouring curiosity followed him that is they all followed him except grice who was ill for two days afterwards as for sampson and the groom who had seen the sight through the window they ran for a mile or more along the cliff before they stopped when they got back into the room they found old atterleigh still standing and staring at the crystal eyes that seemed to be returning his gaze with compound interest while florence was there with the long linen wrapper in her hand gazing down at the beautiful hair that flowed from the head on to the oak box from the box to the table and from the table nearly to the ground it was oddly enough of the same colour and texture as her own she had taken off her hat when she began to undo the wrappings and they all noticed the fact nor did the resemblance stop there the sharp fine features of the mummied head were very like florences so were the beautiful teeth and the fixed hard smile the dead face was more lovely indeed but otherwise the woman of the saxon era for to judge from the rude tiara on her brow it is probable that she was saxon and the living girl of the nineteenth century might have been sisters or mother and daughter the resemblance startled them all as they entered the room but they said nothing they drew near and gazed again without a word dorothy was the first to break the silence i think she must have been a witch she said i hope that you will have it thrown away reginald for she will bring us bad luck the place where she has been buried has been unlucky it was a great abbey once now it is a deserted ruin when we tried to get the case up we were all very nearly killed she will bring us bad luck i am sure of it throw it away reginald throw her into the sea look she is just like florence there florence had smiled at dorothys words and the resemblance became more striking than ever eva shuddered as she noticed it nonsense dorothy said mr cardus who was a bit of an antiquarian and had now forgotten his start in his collectors zeal it is a splendid find but i forgot he added in a tone of disappointment it does not belong to me it belongs to miss ceswick o i am sure you are welcome to it so far as i am concerned said eva hastily i would not have it near me on any account o very well i am much obliged to you i shall value the relic very much florence had meanwhile moved round the table and was gazing earnestly into the crystal eyes what are you doing florence asked ernest sharply for the scene was uncanny and jarred upon him i she answered with a little laugh i am seeking an inspiration that face looks wise it may teach me something besides it is so like my own i think she must be some fardistant ancestress so she had noticed it too thought ernest put her back in the box jeremy said mr cardus i must have an airtight case made i can do that said jeremy by lining the old one with lead and putting a glass front to it jeremy set about putting the head away touching it very gingerly when he got it back into the oak case he dusted it and placed it upon a bracket that jutted from the oakpanelling at the end of the room well said florence now that you have put your guardian angel on her pedestal i think that we must be going home will any of you walk a little way with us dorothy said that they would all come that is all except mr cardus who had gone back to his office accordingly they started and as they did so florence intimated to ernest that she wished to speak to him he was alarmed and disappointed for he was afraid of florence and wished to walk with eva and presumably his face betrayed what was in his mind to her do not be frightened she said with a slight smile i am not going to say anything disagreeable of course he replied that he knew that she never could say anything disagreeable at any time at which she smiled again the same faint smile and they dropped behind ernest she said presently i want to speak to you you remember what happened between us two evenings ago on this very beach for they were walking home by the beach yes florence i remember answered ernest well ernest the words i have to say are hard for a womans lips but i must say them i made a mistake ernest in telling you that i loved you as i did and in talking all the wild nonsense that i talked i dont know what made me do it some foolish impulse no doubt women are very curious you know ernest and i think that i am more curious than most i suppose i thought that i loved you ernest i know i thought it when you kissed me but last night when i saw you at the smythes dance i knew that it was all a mistake and that i cared for you no more than you cared for me ernest do you understand me he did not understand her in the least but he nodded his head feeling vaguely that things were turning out very well for him she looked at him and went on so here in the same place where i said them i renounce them we will forget all that foolish scene ernest i was in error when i told you that my heart was as deep as the sea i find that it is shallow as a brook but will you answer me one question ernest before we close this conversation yes florence if i can well when you you kissed me the other night you did not really mean it did you i mean you only did so for a freak or from the impulse of the moment not because you loved me dont be afraid to tell me because if it was so i shall not be angry you see you have so much to forgive me for i am breaking faith am i not and she looked at him straight in the face with her piercing eyes ernests glance fell under that searching gaze and the lie that men are apt to think it no shame to use where women are concerned rose to his lips but he could not get it out he could not bring himself to say that he did not love her so he compromised matters i think that perhaps you were more in earnest than i was florence she laughed a cold little laugh that somehow made his flesh creep thank you for being candid it makes matters so much easier does it not but do you know i suspected as much when i was standing there by that head today just at the time when you took evas hand ernest started visibly why your back was turned he said yes but i saw what you did reflected in the crystal eyes well do you know as i stood there it seemed to me as though i could consider the whole matter as dispassionately and with as clear a brain as though i had been that dead woman all of a sudden i grew wise but there are the others waiting for us we shall part friends i hope florence said ernest anxiously o yes ernest a woman always follows the career of her old admirer with the deepest interest and for about five seconds you were my admirer when you kissed me you know i shall watch all your life and my thoughts shall follow your footsteps like a shadow goodnight ernest goodnight and again she smiled the mocking smile which was so like that on the features of the dead woman and fixed her piercing eyes upon his face he bade her goodnight and made his way homewards with the others feeling an undefinable dread heavy on his heart chapter xi deep waters in due course jeremy duly fitted up the witch as the mysterious head came to be called at dums ness in her airtight cabinet which he lengthened till it looked like a clockcase in order to allow the beautiful hair to hang down at full length retaining however the original door and ancient latch and hasp his next step was to fit the plateglass front and exhaust the air as well as was feasible from the interior of the case then he screwed on the outside door and stood it back on its bracket in the oakpanelled sittingroom where as has been said it looked for all the world like an eightday clockcase just as he had finished the job a visitor it was mr de talor came in and remarked that he had made a precious ugly clock jeremy who disliked the de talor as he called him excessively said that he would not say so when he had seen the works and at the same time unhasped the oak door of the cabinet and turned the full glare of the dreadful crystal eyes on to his face the results were startling for a moment de talor stared and gasped then all the rich hues faded from his features and he sank back in a sort of fit jeremy shut up the door in a hurry and his visitor soon recovered but for years nothing would induce him to enter that room again as for jeremy himself at first he was dreadfully afraid of the witch but as time went on for his job took him several days he seemed to lose his awe of her and even to find a fearful joy in her society he spent whole hours as he sat in his workshop in the yard tinkering at the airtight case in weaving histories in which this beautiful creature whose head had been thus marvellously recovered played the leadingpart it was so strange to look at her lovely scornful face and think that long ages since men had loved it and kissed it and played with the waving hair there it was this relic of the dead preserved by the consummate skill of some old monk or chemist so that it retained all its ancient beauty long after the echoes of the tragedy with which it must have been connected had died out of the world for as he wrought at the case jeremy grew certain that here was the ghastly memento of some enormous crime indeed by degrees as he tacked and hammered at the lead lining he made up a history that was quite satisfactory to his mind appealing on doubtful points to the witch herself who was on the table near him and ascertaining whether she meant yes or no by the simple process of observing whether or not her eyes trembled when he spoke it was slow work getting the story together in this fashion but then the manufacture of the case was slow also and it was not without its charm for he felt it an honour to be taken into the confidence of so lovely a lady but if the head had a fascination for jeremy it had a still greater charm for his grandfather the old man would continually slip out of the office and cross the yard to the little room where jeremy worked in order to stare at this wonderful relic one night indeed when the case was nearly finished jeremy remembered that he had not locked the door of his workshop he was already half undressed but slipping on his coat again he went out by the back door and crossed the yard carrying the key with him it was bright moonlight and jeremy having slippers on walked without noise when he reached the workshop and was about to lock the door he thought he heard a sound in the room this startled him and for a moment he meditated retreat leaving the head to look after itself those eyes were interesting in the daytime but he scarcely cared to face them alone at night it was foolish but they did look so very much alive after a moments hesitation during which the sound whatever it was again made itself audible he determined to compromise matters by going round to the other side of the room and looking in at the little window with a beating heart he stole round and quietly peered in the moonlight was shining bright into the room and struck full upon the long case he had manufactured he had left it shut and the head inside it now it was open he could clearly see the white outlines of the trembling eyes the sound too a muttering sound was still going on jeremy drew back and wiped the perspiration from his forehead and for the second time thought of flight but his curiosity overcame him and he looked again this time he discovered the cause of the muttering seated upon his carpenters bench was his grandfather old atterleigh who appeared to be staring with all his might at the head and talking incoherently to himself this was the noise he had heard through the door it was an uncanny sight and made jeremy feel cold down the back while he was still contemplating it and wondering what to do old atterleigh rose closed the case and left the room jeremy slipped round locked up the door and made his way back to bed much astonished he did not however say anything of what he had seen only in future he was careful never to leave the door of his workshop open at last the case was finished and for an amateur a very good job it looked when it was done he placed it as already narrated back on the bracket and showed it to mr de talor but from the day when eva ceswick nearly fell to the bottom of the cliff in the course of her antiquarian researches things began to go wrong at dums ness everybody felt it except ernest and he was thinking too much of other things dorothy was very unhappy in those days and began to look thin and miserable though she sturdily alleged when asked that she never felt better in her life jeremy himself was also unhappy and for a good reason he had caught the fever that women like eva ceswick have it in their power to give to the sons of men his was a deep selfcontained nature very gentle and tender not admitting many things into its affections but loving such as were admitted with all the heart and soul and strength and it was in the deepest depths of this loyal nature that eva ceswick had printed her image before he knew it before he had time to think it was photographed there upon his heart and he felt that there it must stay for good or evil that plate could never be used again she had been so kind to him her eyes had grown so bright and friendly when she saw him coming he was sure that she liked him which indeed she did and once he had ventured to press her little hand and he had thought that she had returned the pressure and had not slept all night in consequence but perhaps this was a mistake and then just as he was getting on so nicely came ernest and scattered his hopes like mists before the morning sun from the moment that those two met he knew that it was all over with his chance next to make assurance doubly sure providence itself in the shape of a shilling had declared against him and he was left lamenting well it was all fair but still it was very hard and for the first time in his life he felt inclined to be angry with ernest indeed he was angry and the fact made him more unhappy than ever because he knew that his anger was unjust and because his brotherly love condemned it but for all that the shadow between them grew darker mr cardus too had his troubles connected needless to say for nothing else ever really troubled him with his monomania of revenge mr de talor of whose discomfiture he had at last made sure had unexpectedly slipped out of his power nor could he at present see any way in which to draw him back again consequently he was distressed as for hardriding atterleigh ever since he had found himself fixed by the witchs crystal eyes he had been madder than ever and more perfectly convinced that mr cardus was the devil in person indeed dorothy who watched over the old man the grandfather who never knew her thought that she observed a marked change in him he worked away at his writing as usual but it appeared to her with more vigour as though it were a thing to encounter and get rid of he would cut the notches out of his stick calendar too more eagerly than heretofore and altogether it seemed as though his life had become dominated by some new purpose she called mr carduss attention to this change but he laughed and said that it was nothing and would probably soon pass with the moon but if nobody else was happy ernest was that is except when he was sunk in the depths of woe which was on an average about three days a week on the occasion of these seizures dorothy noting his miserable aspect and entire want of appetite felt much alarmed and took an occasion after supper to ask him what was the matter before many minutes were over she had cause to regret it for ernest burst forth with a history of his love and his wrongs that lasted for an hour it appeared that another young gentleman one of those who danced with the lovely eva at the smythes ball had been making the most unmistakable advances he had called three times he had sent flowers twice ernest sent them every morning beguiling sampson into cutting the best orchidblooms for that purpose he had been out walking once dorothy listened quietly till he ceased of his own accord then she spoke so you really love her ernest love her i but we will not enter into a description of this young mans raptures when he had done dorothy did a curious thing she rose from her chair and coming to where ernest was sitting bent over him and kissed him on the forehead as she did so he noticed vaguely that she had great black rings round her eyes i hope that you will be happy my dear brother you will have a lovely wife and i think that she is as good as she is beautiful she spoke quietly but somehow her voice sounded like a sob he kissed her in acknowledgment and she glided away ernest did not think much of the incident however indeed in five minutes his thoughts were back with eva with whom he was seriously and earnestly in love in sober truth the antics that he played were enough to make the angels weep to see a human being possessing the normal weight of brain making such a donkey of himself for instance he would promenade for hours at night in the neighbourhood of the cottage once he ventured into the garden to enjoy the perfect bliss of staring at six panes of glass got severely bitten by the housedog for his pains and was finally chased for a mile or more by both the dog and the policeman who having heard of the mysterious figure that was to be seen mooning in every sense of the word round the cottage had laid up to watch for him next day he had the satisfaction of hearing from his adoreds own lips the story of the attempted burglary but as she told it there was a smile playing about the corners of her mouth which almost seemed to indicate that she had her suspicions as to who the burglar was but then ernest walked so very lame which considering that the teeth of a brute called towzer had made a big hole in his calf was not to be wondered at after this he was obliged to give up his midnight sighing but he took it out in other ways once indeed without warning he flopped down on to the floor and kissed evas hand and then aghast at his own boldness fled from the room at first all this amused eva greatly she was pleased at her conquest and took a malicious pleasure in leading ernest on when she knew that he was coming she would make herself as lovely as possible and put on all her charming little ways and graces in order more thoroughly to enslave him somehow whenever ernest thought of her in after years as she was at that period of her life his memory would call up a vision of her in a pretty little drawingroom at the cottage leaning back in a low chair in such a way as to contrive to show off her splendid figure to the best advantage also the tiny foot and slender ankle that peeped from beneath her soft white dress there she sat a little skyeterrier called tails on her lap with which his rival had presented her but a fortnight before and yes actually kissing the brute at intervals her eyes shining all the time with innocent coquetry what would not ernest have given to occupy for a single minute the position of that unappreciative skyeterrier it was agony to see so many kisses wasted on a dog and eva aware that he thought so kissed the animal more vigorously than ever at last he could stand it no longer put that dog down he said peremptorily she obeyed him then remembering that he had no right to dictate to her what she should do made an effort to pick it up again but tails who be it added was not used to being kissed in private life and thought the whole operation rather a bore promptly bolted why should i put the dog down she asked with a quick look of defiance because i hate seeing you kiss it it is so effeminate he spoke in a masterful way it was a touch of the curb and there are few things a proud woman resents so much as the first touch of the curb what right have you to dictate what i shall or shall not do she asked tapping her foot upon the floor ernest was very humble in those days and he collapsed none at all dont be angry eva it was the first time he had called her so till now she had always been miss ceswick but the fact was i could not bear to see you kissing that dog i was jealous of the brute whereupon she blushed furiously and changed the subject still after a while evas coquettishness began to be less and less marked when they met she no longer greeted him with a smile of mischief but with serious eyes that once or twice he thought bore traces of tears at the same time she threw him into despair by her coldness did he venture a tender remark she would pretend not to hear it alas that the mounting blood should so obstinately proclaim that she did did he touch her hand it was cold and unresponsive she was quieter too and her reserve frightened him once he tried to break it and began some passionate appeal but she rose without answering and turned her face to the window he followed her and saw that her dark eyes were full of tears this he felt was even more awful than her coldness and fearing that he had offended her he obeyed her whispered entreaty and went poor boy he was very young had he had a little more experience he might have found means to brush away her tears and his own doubts it is a melancholy thing that such opportunities should as a rule present themselves before people are old or experienced enough to take advantage of them the secret of all this change of conduct was not far to seek eva had toyed with edged tools till she cut her fingers to the bone the darkeyed boy who danced so well and had such a handsome happy face had become very dear to her she had begun by playing with him and now alas she loved him better than anybody in the world that was the sting of the thing she had fallen in love with a boy as young as herself a boy too who so far as she was aware had no particular prospects in life it was humiliating to her pride to think that she who in the few months that she had been out in london before her cousins rose up and cast her forth had already found the satisfaction of seeing one or two men of middle age and established position at her feet and the further satisfaction of requesting them to kneel there no more should in the upshot have to strike her colours to a boy of twentyone even though he did stand six feet high and had more wits in his young head and more love in his young heart than all her middleaged admirers put together perhaps though she was a woman grown she was not herself quite old enough to appreciate the great advantage it is to any girl to stamp her image upon the heart of the man she loves while the wax is yet soft and undefaced by the half wornout marks of many shallow dies perhaps she did not know what a blessing it is to be able really to love a man at all young middleaged or old many women wait till they cannot love without shame to make that discovery perhaps she forgot that ernests youth was a fault which would mend day by day and that he had abilities which if she would consent to inspire them might lead him to great things at any rate two facts remained in her mind after much thinking she loved him with all her heart and of it she was ashamed but as yet she could not make up her mind to any fixed course it would have been easy to crush poor ernest to tell him that his pretensions were ridiculous to send him away or to go away herself and so to make an end of a position that she felt was growing absurd and which we may be sure her elder sister florence did nothing to make more pleasant but she could not do it that was the long and the short of the matter the idea of living without ernest made her feel cold all over it seemed to her that the only hours that she really did live were the hours which they spent together and that when he went away he took her heart with him no she could not make up her mind to that the thought was too cruel then there was the other alternative to encourage him a little and become engaged to him to brave everything for his sake but as yet she could not make up her mind to that either eva ceswick was very loving very sweet and very good but she did not possess a determined mind chapter xii deeper yet while ernest was wooing and eva doubting time whose interest in earthly affairs is that of the sickle in the growing crop went on his way as usual the end of august came as it has come so many thousand times since this globe gave its first turn in space as it will come for many thousand times more till at last its appointed course run out the world darkens quivers and grows still and behold ernest was still wooing eva still doubting one evening it was a very beautiful evening this pair were walking together on the seashore whether they met by appointment or by accident does not matter they did meet and there they were strolling along together as fully charged with intense feeling as a thundercloud with electricity and almost as quiet the storm had not yet burst to listen to the talk of these two they might have met for the first time yesterday it was chiefly about the weather presently in the course of their wanderings they came to a little sailingboat drawn up upon the beach not far up however just out of the reach of the waves by this boat in an attitude of intense contemplation there stood an ancient mariner his hands were in his pockets his pipe was in his mouth his eyes were fixed upon the deep apparently he did not notice their approach till they were within two yards of him then he turned dashed himself and asked the lady with a pull of his grizzled forelock if she would not take a sail ernest looked surprised hows the wind he asked straight on shore sir will turn with the turn of the tide sir and bring you back will you come for a bit of a sail eva o no thank you i must be getting home it is seven oclock there is no hurry for you to get home your aunt and florence have gone to tea with the smythes indeed i cannot come i could not think of such a thing her words were unequivocal but the ancient mariner put a strange interpretation upon them first he hauled up the little sail and then placing his brown hands against the stern of the boat he rested his weight upon them and caused her to travel far enough into the waves to float her bow now miss i am not coming indeed now miss i will not come ernest come said ernest quietly holding out his hand to help her in she took it and got in ernest and the mariner gave a strong shove and as the light boat took the water the former leaped in and at the same second a puff of wind caught the sail and took them ten yards out or more why the sailor is left behind said eva ernest gave a twist to the tiller to get the boats head straight off shore and then leisurely looked round the mariner was standing as they had found him his hands in his pockets his pipe in his mouth his eyes fixed upon the deep he doesnt seem to mind it he said meditatively yes but i do you must go back and fetch him thus appealed to ernest went through some violent manoeuvres with the tiller without producing any marked effect on the course of the boat which by this time had got out of the shelter of the cliff and was bowling along merrily wait till we get clear of the draught from the cliff and i will bring her round but when at last they were clear from the draught of the cliff and he slowly got her head round lo and behold the mariner had vanished how unfortunate said ernest getting her head towards the open sea again he has probably gone to his tea eva tried hard to get angry but somehow she could not she only succeeded in laughing if i thought that you had done this on purpose i would never come out with you again ernest looked horrified on purpose he said and the subject dropped they were sitting side by side in the sternsheets of the boat and the sun was just dipping all redhot into the ocean under the lee of the cliff there were cool shadows before them was a path of glory that led to a golden gate the air was very sweet and for those two all the world was lovely there was no sorrow on the earth there were no storms upon the sea eva took off her hat and let the sweet breeze play upon her brow then she leaned over the side and dipping her hand into the cool water watched the little track it made eva yes ernest do you know i am going away the hand was withdrawn with a start going away when the day after tomorrow to guernsey first then to france and when are you coming back again i think that depends upon you eva the hand went back into the water they were a mile or more from the shore now ernest manipulated the sail and tiller so as to sail slowly parallel with the coastline then he spoke again eva no answer eva for gods sake look at me there was something in his voice that forced her to obey she took her hand out of the water and turned her eyes on to his face it was pale and the lips were quivering i love you he said in a low choked voice she grew angry why did you bring me here i will go home this is nonsense you are nothing but a boy there are moments in life when the human face is capable of conveying a more intense and vivid impression than any words when it seems to speak to the very soul in a language of its own and so it was with ernest now he made no answer to her reproaches but if that were possible his features grew paler yet and his eyes shining like stars fixed themselves upon her and drew her to him what they said she and he knew alone nor could any words convey it for the tongue in which they talked is not spoken in this world a moment still she wavered fighting against the sweet mastery of his will with all her womans strength and then o heaven it was done and his arms were round about her her head upon his breast and her voice was lost in sobs and broken words of love o radiantwinged hour of more than mortal joy the hearts which you have touched will know when their time comes that they have not been quite in vain and so they sat those two quite silent for there seemed to be no need for speech words could not convey half they had to say indeed to tell the honest truth their lips were for the most part otherwise employed meanwhile the sun went down and the sweet moon arose over the quiet sea and turned their little ship to silver eva gently disengaged herself from his arms and half rose to look at it she had never thought it half so beautiful before ernest looked at it too it is a way that lovers have do you know the lines he said i think i can say them with a swifter motion out upon the ocean heaven above and round us and you along with me heaven around and oer us floating on for ever upon the flowing sea go on she said softly what time is it dear now we are in the year now of the new creation one million two or three but where are we now love we are as i trow love in the heaven of heavens upon the crystal sea that is how i hope it may be with us dear she said taking his hand as the last words passed his lips are you happy now he asked her yes ernest i am happy indeed i do not think that i shall ever be so happy again certainly i never was so happy before do you know dear i wish to tell you so that you may see how mean i have been i have fought so hard against my love for you he looked pained why he asked i will tell you quite truly ernest because you are so young i was ashamed to fall in love with a boy and yet you see dear you have been too strong for me why there is no difference in our ages ah ernest but i am a woman and ever so much older than you we age so much quicker you know i feel about old enough to be your mother she said with a pretty assumption of dignity and i feel quite old enough to be your lover he replied impertinently so it seems but ernest if three months ago anybody had told me that i should be in love today with a boy of twentyone i would not have believed them dear i have given you all my heart you will not betray me will you you know very young men are apt to change their minds he flushed a little as he answered feeling that it was tiresome to have the unlucky fact that he was only twentyone so persistently thrust before him then they are young men who have not had the honour of winning your affections a man who has once loved you could never forget you indeed it is more likely that you will forget me you will have plenty of temptation to do so she saw that she had vexed him dont be angry dear but you see the position is a very difficult one and if i could not be quite sure of you it would be intolerable my darling you may be as sure of me as woman can be of man but dont begin your doubts over again they are settled now let us be quite happy just this one evening no doubt there are plenty coming when we shall not be able so they kissed each other and sailed on homeward alas for it was getting late and were perfectly happy presently they drew near the shore and there at the identical spot where they had left him stood the ancient mariner his hands were in his pockets his pipe was in his mouth his eyes were fixed upon the deep ernest grounded the little boat skilfully enough and jumping over the bow he and the mariner pulled it up then eva got out and as she did so she thought in the moonlight that she noticed something resembling a twinkle in the latters ancient eye she felt confused there is nothing so confusing as a guilty conscience and to cover her confusion plunged into conversation while ernest was finding some money to pay for the boat do you often let boats she asked no miss only to mr ernest in a general way so that wicked ernest had set a trap to catch her o then i suppose you go out fishing no miss only for rikkration like then what do you do she was getting curious on the point times i does nothing times i stands on the beach and sees things times i runs cheeses miss run cheeses yes miss dutch ones he means that he brings cargoes of dutch cheeses to harwich oh said eva ernest paid the man and they turned to go she had not gone many yards when she felt a heavy hand laid upon her shoulder turning round in astonishment she perceived the mariner i say miss he said in a hoarse whisper well what niver you eat the rind of a dutch cheese i says it as knows eva did not forget his advice chapter xiii mr cardus unfolds his plans ernest said mr cardus on the morning following the events described in the previous chapter i want to speak to you in my office and to you too jeremy they both followed him into his room wondering what was the matter he sat down and so did they and then as was his habit letting his eyes stray over every part of their persons except their faces he began it is time that you two fellows took to doing something for yourselves you must not learn to be idle men not that most young men require much teaching in that way what do you propose to do jeremy and ernest stared at one another rather blankly but apparently mr cardus did not expect an answer at any rate he went on before either of them could frame one you dont seem to know never gave the matter any consideration probably quite content to obey the bible literally and take no thought for the morrow well it is lucky that you have somebody to think for you now i will tell you what i propose for you both i want you ernest to go to the bar it is a foolish profession for most of young men to take to but it will not be so in your case because as it happens if you show yourself capable i shall by degrees be able to put a good deal of business in your hands chancery business for i have little to do with any other i dare say that you will wonder where the business is to come from i dont seem to do very much here do i with a mad old huntingman as a clerk and dorothy to copy my private letters but i do for all that i may as well tell you both in confidence that this place is only the head centre of my business i have another office in london another at ipswich and another at norwich though they all work under different names besides which i have other agencies of a different nature but all this is neither here nor there i have communicated with aster the rising chancery man and he will have a vacancy in his chambers next turn let me see term begins on november nd i propose ernest to write today to enter you at lincolns inn i shall make you an allowance of three hundred a year which you must clearly understand you must not exceed i think that is all i have to say about the matter i am sure i am very much obliged to you uncle began ernest fervently for since the previous evening he had clearly realised that it was necessary for him to make a beginning of doing something but his uncle cut him short all right ernest we will understand all that now jeremy for you i propose that you shall be articled to me and if you work well and prove useful it is my intention in time to admit you to a share of the business in order that you may not feel entirely dependent it is my further intention to make you an allowance also on the amount of which i have not yet settled jeremy groaned in spirit at the thought of becoming a lawyer even with a share of the business but he remembered his conversation with dorothy and thanked mr cardus with the best grace that he could muster all right then i will have the articles prepared at once and you can take to your stool in the office next week i think that is all i have to say acting on this hint the pair were departing jeremy in the deepest state of depression induced by the near prospect of that stool when mr cardus called ernest back i want to talk to you about something else he said thoughtfully shut the door ernest turned cold down his back and wondered if his uncle could have heard anything about eva he had the full intention of speaking to him about the matter but it would be awkward to be boarded himself before he had made up his mind what to say he shut the door and then walking to the glass entrance to the orchid bloominghouse stood looking at the flowers and waiting for mr cardus to begin but he did not begin he seemed to be lost in thought well uncle he said at last it is a delicate business ernest but i may as well get it over i am going to make a request to you a request to which i beg you will give me no immediate answer for from its nature it will require the most anxious and careful consideration i want you to listen and say nothing you can give me your answer when you come back from abroad at the same time i must tell you that it is a matter which i trust you will not disappoint me in indeed i do not think that you could be so cruel as to do so i must also tell you that if you do you must prepare to be a great loser financially speaking i have not the faintest idea what you are driving at uncle said ernest turning from the glass door to speak i know you have not i will tell you listen i will tell you a little story many years ago a great misfortune overtook me a misfortune so great that it struck me as lightning sometimes does a tree it left the bark sound but turned the heart to ashes never mind what the details were they were nothing out of the common such things sometimes happen to men and women the blow was so severe that it almost turned my brain so from that day i gave myself to revenge it sounds melodramatic but there was nothing of the sort about it i had been cruelly wronged and i determined that those who had wronged me should taste of their own medicine with the exception of one man they have done so he has escaped me for a time but he is doomed to pass on the woman who caused the trouble for wherever there is trouble there is generally a woman who causes it had children those children were dorothy and her brother i adopted them as time went on i grew to love the girl for her likeness to her mother the boy i never loved to this hour i cannot like him though he is a gentleman which his father never was i can however honestly say that i have done my duty by him i have told you all this in order that you may understand the request which i am going to make i trust to you never to speak of it and if you can to forget it and now for my request itself ernest looked up wonderingly it is my most earnest desire that you should marry dorothy his listener started violently turned quite pale and opened his lips to speak mr cardus lifted his hand and went on remember what i asked you pray say nothing only listen of course i cannot force you into this or any other marriage i can only beg you to give heed to my wishes knowing that they will in every way prove to your advantage that girl has a heart of gold and if you marry her you shall inherit nearly all my fortune which is now very large i have observed that you have lately been about a great deal with eva ceswick she is a handsome woman and very likely has taken some hold upon your fancy i warn you that any entanglement in that direction would be most disagreeable to me and would to a great extent destroy your prospects so far as i am concerned again ernest was about to speak and again his uncle stopped him i want no confidences ernest and had much rather that no words passed between us which we might afterwards regret and now i understand that you are going abroad with your friend batty for a couple of months when you return you shall give me your answer about dorothy in the meanwhile here is cheque for your expenses what is over you can spend as you like perhaps you have some bills to pay he gave him a folded cheque and then went on now leave me as i am busy ernest walked out of the room in a perfect maze in the yard he mechanically unfolded the cheque it was for a large sum two hundred and fifty pounds he put it in his pocket and began to reflect upon his position which was about as painful a position as can well be truly he was on the horns of a dilemma probably before he was much older one of them would have pierced him for a moment he was about to return to his uncle and tell him all the truth but on reflection he could not see what was to be gained by such a course at any rate it seemed to him that he must first consult eva whom he had arranged to meet on the beach at three oclock there was nobody else whom he could consult for he was shy of talking about eva to jeremy or dolly the rest of that morning went very ill for ernest but three oclock came at last and found him at the trystingplace about a mile on the farther side of kesterwick that is two miles or so from titheburgh abbey the cliff jutted out into the sea in a way that corresponded very curiously with the little promontory known as dums ness the reason of its resistance to the action of the waves being that it was at this spot composed of an upcrop of rock of a more durable nature than the sandstone and pebbles of the remainder of the line of cliff just at the point of this promontory the waves had worn a hollow in the rock that was locally dignified by the name of the cave for two hours or more at high tide this hollow was under water and it was therefore impossible to pass the headland except by boat but during the rest of the day it formed a convenient grotto or trystingplace the more so as anybody sitting in it was quite invisible either from the beach the cliff or indeed unless the boat was quite close in shore the sea in front here it was that ernest had arranged to meet eva and on turning the rocky corner of the cave he found her sitting on a mass of fallen rock waiting for him at the sight of her beautiful form he forgot all his troubles and when rising to greet him blushing like the dawn she lifted her pure face for him to kiss there was not a happier lad in england then she made room for him beside her the rock was just wide enough for two and he placed his arm round her waist and for a minute or two she laid her head upon his shoulder and they were very happy you are early he said at last yes i wanted to get away from florence and have a good think you have no idea how unpleasant she is she seems to know everything for instance she knew that we went out sailing together last evening for this morning at breakfast she said in the most cheerful way that she hoped that i enjoyed my moonlight sail last night the deuce she did and what did you say i said that i enjoyed it very much and luckily my aunt did not take any notice why did you not say at once that we were engaged we are engaged you know yes that is i suppose so suppose so there is no supposition about it at least if we are not engaged what are we well you see ernest it sounds so absurd to say that one is engaged to a boy i love you ernest love you dearly but how can i say that i am engaged to you ernest rose in great wrath i tell you what it is eva if i am not good enough to acknowledge i am not good enough to have anything to do with a boy indeed i am oneandtwenty that is my full age confound it all you are always talking about my being so young just as though i should not get old fast enough cant you wait for me for a year or two he asked with tears of mortification in his eyes o ernest ernest do be reasonable theres a dear what is the good of getting angry and making me wretched come and sit down here dear and tell me am i not worth a little patience there is not the slightest possibility so far as i can see of our getting married at present so the question is if it is of any use to trumpet out an engagement that will only make us the object of a great deal of gossip and which perhaps your uncle would not like o by jove he said that reminds me and sitting down beside her again he told her the story of the interview with his uncle she listened in silence this is all very bad she said when he had finished yes it is bad enough but what is to be done there is nothing to be done at present shall i make a clean breast of it to him no no not now it will only make matters worse we must wait dear you must go abroad for a couple of months as you had arranged and then when you come back we will see what can be arranged but my dearest i cannot bear to leave you it makes my heart ache to think of it dear i know that it is hard but it must be done you could not stop here now very well without speaking about our engagement and to do that would only be to bring your uncles anger on you no you had better go away ernest and meanwhile i will try to get into mr carduss good graces and if i fail then when you come back we can agree upon some plan perhaps by that time you will take your uncles view of the matter and want to marry dorothy she would make you a better wife than i shall ernest my dear eva how can you say such things it is not kind of you o why not it is true o yes i know that i am betterlooking and that is what you men always think of but she has more brains more fixity of mind and perhaps for all i know more heart than i have though for the matter of that i feel as if i was all heart just now really ernest you had better transfer your allegiance give me up and forget me dear it will save you much trouble i know that there is trouble coming it is in the air better marry dorothy and leave me to fight my sorrow out alone i will release you ernest and she began to cry at the bare idea i shall wait to give you up until you have given me up said ernest when he had found means to stop her tears and as for forgetting you i can never do that please dear dont talk so any more it pains me very well ernest then let us vow eternal fidelity instead but my dear i know that i shall bring you trouble it is the price that men have always paid for the smiles of women like you he answered trouble may come so be it let it come at any rate i have the consciousness of your love when i have lost that then and then only will i think that i have bought you too dear in the course of his after life these words often came back to ernests mind chapter xiv goodbye there are some scenes trivial enough perhaps in themselves that yet retain a peculiar power of standing out in sharp relief as we cast our minds eye down the long vista of our past the group of events with which these particular scenes were connected may have long ago vanished from our mental sight or faded into a dim and misty uniformity and be as difficult to distinguish one from the other as the trees of a forest viewed from a height but here and there an event a sensation or a face will stand out as perfectly clear as if it had been that moment experienced felt or seen perhaps it is only some scene of our childhood such as a fish darting beneath a rustic bridge and the ripple which its motion left upon the water we have seen many larger fish dart in many fine rivers since then and have forgotten them but somehow that one little fish has kept awake in the storehouse of our brain where most things sleep though none are really obliterated it was in this clear and brilliant fashion that every little detail of the scene was indelibly photographed on ernests mind when on the morning following their meeting in the cave he said goodbye to eva before he went abroad it was a public goodbye for as it happened there was no opportunity for the lovers to meet alone they were all gathered in the little drawingroom at the cottage miss ceswick seated on a straightbacked chair in the bowwindow ernest on one side of the round table looking intensely uncomfortable eva on the other a scrapbook in her hand which she studiously kept before her and in the background leaning carelessly over the back of a chair in such a way that her own face could not be seen though she could survey everybody elses was florence ernest from where he sat could just make out the outline of her olive face and the quick glance of her brown eyes so they sat for a long time but what was said he could not remember it was only the scene that imprinted itself upon his memory then at last the fatal moment came he knew that it was time to go and said goodbye to miss ceswick who made some remark about his good fortune in going to france and italy and warned him to be careful not to lose his heart to a foreign girl he crossed the room and shook hands with florence who smiled coolly in his face and read him through with her piercing eyes and last of all came to eva who dropped her album and a pockethandkerchief in her confusion as she rose to give him her hand he stooped and picked them up the album he placed on the table the little laceedged handkerchief he crumpled up in the palm of his left hand and kept it was almost the only souvenir he had of her then he took her hand and for a moment looked into her face it wore a smile but beneath it the features were wan and troubled it was so hard to part well ernest said miss ceswick you two are taking leave of each other as solemnly as though you were never going to meet again perhaps they never will said florence in her clear voice and at that moment ernest felt as though he hated her you should not croak florence it is unlucky said miss ceswick florence smiled then ernest dropped the cold hand and turning left the room florence followed him and snatching a hat from the pegs passed into the garden before him when he was halfway down the gardenwalk he found her ostensibly picking some carnations i want to speak to you for a minute ernest she said turn this way with me and she led him past the bowwindow down a small shrubberywalk about twenty paces long i must offer you my congratulations she went on i hope that you two will be happy such a handsome pair ought to be happy you know why florence who told you told me nobody told me i have seen it all along let me see you first took a fancy to one another on the night of the smythes dance when she gave you a rose and the next day you saved her life quite in the romantic and orthodox way well and then events took their natural course till one evening you went out sailing together in a boat shall i go on i dont think it is necessary florence i am sure i dont know how you know all these things she had stopped and was standing slowly picking a carnation to pieces leaf by leaf dont you she answered with a laugh lovers are blind but it does not follow that other people are i have been thinking ernest that it is very fortunate that i found out my little mistake before you discovered yours supposing i really had cared for you the position would have been awkward now would it not ernest was forced to admit that it would but luckily you see i do not i am only your true friend now ernest and it is as a friend that i wish to say a word to you about eva a word of warning go on you love eva and eva loves you ernest but remember this she is weak as water she always was so from a child those beautiful women often are nature does not give them everything you see what do you mean what i say nothing more she is very weak and you must not be surprised if she throws you over good heavens florence why she loves me with all her heart yes still women often think of other things besides their hearts but there i dont want to frighten you only i would not pin all my faith to evas constancy however dearly you may think she loves you dont look so distressed ernest i did not wish to pain you and remember that if any difficulty should arise between eva and you you will always have me on your side you will always think of me as your true friend wont you ernest and she held out her hand he took it indeed i will he said they had turned now and again reached the bowwindow one of the divisions of which stood open florence touched his arm and pointed into the room he looked in through the open window miss ceswick had gone but eva was still at her old place by the table her head was down upon the table resting on the album he had picked up and he could see from the motion of her shoulders that she was sobbing bitterly presently she lifted her face it was all stained with tears only however to drop it again ernest made a motion as though he would enter the house but florence stopped him best leave her alone she whispered and then when they were well past the window added aloud i am sorry that you saw her like that if you should never meet again or be separated for a very long time it will leave a painful recollection in your mind well goodbye i hope that you will enjoy yourself ernest shook hands in silence there was a lump in his throat that prevented him from speaking and then went on his way feeling utterly miserable as for florence she put up her hand to shade her keen eyes from the sun and watched him till he turned the corner with a look of intense love and longing which slowly changed into one of bitter hate when he was out of sight she turned and making her way to her bedroom flung herself upon the bed and burying her face in the pillow to stifle the sound of her sobbing gave way to an outburst of jealous rage that was almost awful in its intensity ernest had only just time to get back to dums ness and go through the form of eating some luncheon before he was obliged to start to catch his train dorothy had packed his things and made all those little preparations for his journey that women think of so after going to the office to bid goodbye to his uncle who shook him heartily by the hand and bade him not forget the subject of their conversation he had nothing to do but jump into the cart and start in the sittingroom he found dorothy waiting for him with his coat and gloves also jeremy who was going to drive to the station with him he put on his coat in silence they were all quite silent indeed he might have been going for a long sojourn in a deadly climate instead of two months pleasuretour so depressed was everybody goodbye doll dear he said stooping to kiss her but she shrank away from him in another minute he was gone at the station a word or two about eva passed between jeremy and himself well ernest asked the former nervously have you pulled it off with her of course who else yes i have but jeremy well i dont want you to say anything about it to anybody at present very good i say old fellow ernest went on after a pause i hope you dont mind very much if i said i did not mind ernest he answered slowly turning his honest eyes full on to his friends face i should be telling a lie but i do say this as i could not win her myself i am glad that you have because next to her i think i love you better than anybody in the world you always had the luck and i wish you joy theres the train ernest wrung his hand thanks old chap he said you are a downright good fellow and a good friend too i know i have had the luck but perhaps it is going to turn goodbye ernests plans were to sleep in london and to leave on the following morning a wednesday for guernsey there he was to meet his friend on thursday when they were to start upon their tour first to normandy and thence wherever their fancy led them this programme he carried out to the letter at least the first part of it on his way from liverpool street station to the rooms where he had always slept on the few occasions that he had been in london his hansom passed down fleet street and got blocked opposite no his eye caught the number and he wondered what there was about it familiar to him then he remembered that fleet street was the address of messrs gosling and sharpe the bankers on whom his uncle had given him the cheque for ј bethinking himself that he might as well cash it he stopped the cab and entered the bank as he did so the cashier was just leaving his desk for it was past closing hour but he courteously took ernests cheque and though it was for a large sum cashed it without hesitation mr carduss name was evidently well known in the establishment ernest proceeded on his journey with a crisp little bundle of bank of england notes in his breastpocket a circumstance that in certain events of which at that moment he little dreamed proved of the utmost service to him it will not be necessary for us to follow him in his journey to st peters port which very much resembled other peoples journeys he arrived there safely enough on wednesday afternoon and proceeded to the best hotel took a room and inquired the hour of the table dhфte in the course of the voyage from southampton ernest had fallen into conversation with a quiet foreignlooking man who spoke english with a curious little accent this gentleman for there was no doubt about his being a gentleman was accompanied by a boy about nine years of age remarkable for his singularly prepossessing face and manners whom ernest rightly judged to be his son mr alston for such he discovered his companions name to be was a middleaged man not possessed of any remarkable looks or advantages of person nor in any way brilliantminded but nobody could know mr alston for long without discovering that his neutral tints notwithstanding he was the possessor of an almost striking individuality from his open way of talking ernest guessed that he was a colonial for he had often noticed at college that colonials are much less reserved than englishmen proper are bred up to be he soon learned that mr alston was a natal colonist now for the first time paying a visit to the old country he had until lately held a high position in the natal government service but having unexpectedly come into a moderate fortune through the death of an aged lady a sister of his father in england he had resigned his position in the service and after his short visit home as colonists always call the mother country even when they have never seen it intended to start on a big gameshooting expedition in the country between secocoenis country and delagoa bay all this ernest learned before the boat reached the harbour at st peters port and they separated he was however pleased when having seen his luggage put into his room he went into the little courtyard of the hotel and found mr alston standing there with his son and looking rather puzzled hullo said ernest i am glad that you have come to this hotel do you want anything well yes i do the fact of the matter is i dont understand a word of french and i want to find my way to a place that my boy and i have come over here to see if they talked zulu or sisutu you see i should be equal to the occasion but to me french is a barbarous tongue and the people about here all seem to talk nothing else here is the address i can talk french said ernest and if you like i will go with you the table dhфte is not till seven and it is not six yet it is very kind of you not at all i have no doubt that you would show me the way about zululand if ever i wandered there ay that i would with pleasure and they started it was with considerable difficulty that ernest discovered the place mr alston was in search of finally however he found it it was a quaint outoftheway little street very narrow and crooked an odd mixture of old private houses and shops most of which seemed to deal in soap and candles at last they came to no a grey old house standing in its own grounds mr alston scanned it eagerly that is the place he said she often told me of the coatofarms over the doorway a mullet impaled with three squirrels there they are i wonder if it is still a school it turned out that it was still a school and in due course they were admitted and allowed to wander round the ancient walled garden with every nook of which mr alston seemed to be perfectly acquainted there is the tree under which she used to sit he said sadly to his boy pointing to an old yewtree under which there stood a rotting bench who asked ernest much interested my dead wife that boys mother she was educated here he said with a sigh there i have seen it let us go chapter xv ernest gets into trouble when mr alston and ernest reached the hotel there was still a quarter of an hour to elapse before the table dhфte so after washing his hands and putting on a black coat ernest went down into the coffeeroom there was only one other person in it a tall fair frenchwoman apparently about thirty years of age she was standing by the empty fireplace her arm upon the mantelpiece and a lace pockethandkerchief in her hand and ernests first impression of her was that she was handsome and much overdressed there was a newspaper upon the mantelpiece which he desired to get possession of as he advanced for this purpose the lady dropped her handkerchief stooping down he picked it out of the grate and handed it to her mille remerciments monsieur she said with a little curtsey du tout madame ah monsieur parle franзais mais oui madame and then they drifted into a conversation in the course of which ernest learned that madame thought st peters port very dull that she had been there three days with her friends and was nearly dead de tristesse that she was going however to the public dance at the hall that night of course monsieur would be there and many other things for madame had a considerable command of language in the middle of all this the door opened and another lady of much the same cut as madame entered followed by two young men the first of these had a face of the commonplace english type rather a goodhumoured face but when he saw the second ernest started it was so like his own as his would become if he were to spend half a dozen years in drinking dicing late hours and their concomitants the man to whom this face belonged was evidently a gentleman but he looked an illtempered one and very puny and out of health at least so thought ernest it is time for dinner camille said the gentleman to madame at the same time favouring ernest with a most comprehensive scowl madame appeared not to understand and made some remark to ernest it is time for dinner camille said the gentleman again in a savage voice this time she lifted her head and looked at him dinnare dinnare questque cest que dinnare table dhфte said the gentleman o pardon and with a little bow and most fascinating smile to ernest she took the gentlemans extended arm and sailed away why did you pretend not to understand me ernest heard him ask and she saw her shrug her shoulders in reply the other gentleman followed with his companion and after him came ernest when he reached the salleаmanger he found that the only chair vacant at the table was one next to his friend of the salon indeed had he thought of it it might have struck him that madame had contrived to keep that chair vacant for on his approach she gathered together the folds of her silk dress which had almost hidden it and welcomed him with a little nod ernest took the chair and forthwith madame entered into a most lively conversation with him a course of proceeding that appeared to be extremely distasteful to the gentleman on her right who pished and pshawed and pushed away his plate in a manner that soon became quite noticeable but madame talked serenely on quite careless of his antics till at last he whispered something to her that caused the blood to mount to her fair cheek mais taistoi donc ernest heard her answer and next moment the subsequent history of our hero demands that the truth should be told it was his turn to colour for alas there was no doubt about it he distinctly felt madames little foot pressed upon his own he took up his wine and drank a little to hide his confusion but whether he had or had not the moral courage to withdraw from the situation by placing his toes under the more chilly but safe guardianship of the chairlegs history saith not let us hope and presume that he had but if this was so or not he did not get on very well with his dinner for the situation was novel and not conducive to appetite presently mr alston who was sitting opposite addressed him across the table are you going to the dance here tonight mr kershaw to ernests surprise the gentleman on the other side of madame answered with an astonished look yes i am going i beg your pardon said mr alston i was speaking to the gentleman on your left oh indeed i thought you said kershaw yes i did the gentlemans name is kershaw i think yes put in ernest my name is kershaw that is odd said the other gentleman so is mine i did not know that there were any other kershaws nor did i answered ernest except sir hugh kershaw and his face darkened as he pronounced the name i am sir hugh kershaws son my name is hugh kershaw was the reply indeed then we are cousins i suppose for i am his nephew the son of his brother ernest hugh kershaw the elder did not receive this intelligence with even the moderate amount of enthusiasm that might have been expected he simply lifted his scanty eyebrows and said oh i remember my uncle left a son then he turned and made some remark to the gentleman who sat next him that made the latter laugh ernest felt the blood rise to his cheeks there was something very insolent about his cousins tone shortly afterwards the dinner came to an end and madame with another fascinating smile retired as for ernest he smoked a pipe with mr alston and about nine oclock strolled over with him to the hall or assembly rooms a building largely composed of glass where thrice a week during the season the visitors at st peters port adjoined to dance flirt and make merry one of the first sights that caught his eye was a fair creature in evening dress and with conspicuously white shoulders in whom he recognised madame she was sitting near the door and appeared to be watching it ernest bowed to her and was about to pass on but pursuing her former tactics she dropped the bouquet she was carrying he stooped picked it up returned it and again made as though he would pass on when she addressed him just as the band struck up ah que cest belle la musique monsieur valse nestce pas in another minute they were floating down the room together as they passed along ernest saw his cousin standing in the corner looking at him with no amiable air madame saw his glance ah she said monsieur hugh ne valse pas il se grise il a lair jaloux nestce pas ernest danced three times with this fair enslaver and with their last waltz the ball came to an end just then his cousin came up and they all including mr alston walked together along the steep streets which were now quite deserted to the door of the hotel here ernest said goodnight to madame who extended her hand he took it and as he did so he felt a note slipped into it which not being accustomed to such transactions he clumsily dropped it was the ball programme and there was something written across it in pencil unfortunately he was not the only one who saw this his cousin hugh who had evidently been drinking saw it too and tried to pick up the programme but ernest was too quick for him give me that said his cousin hoarsely ernest answered by putting it into his pocket what is written on that programme i dont know what have you written on that programme camille mon dieu mais vous mennuyez was the answer i insist upon your giving me that with an oath monsieur est gentleman monsieur ne la rendra pas said madame with a meaning glance and then turning she entered the hotel i am not going to give it to you said ernest you shall give it to me is this lady your wife asked ernest that is my affair give me that note i shall not give it to you said ernest whose temper was rapidly rising i dont know what is on it and i dont wish to know but whatever it is the lady gave it to me and not to you she is not your wife and you have no right to ask for it his cousin hugh turned livid with fury at the best of times he was an eviltempered man and now inflamed as he was by drink and jealousy he looked a perfect fiend damn you he hissed you halfbred cur i suppose that you get yourmanners from yourof a mother he did not get any further for at this point ernest knocked him into the gutter and then stood over him very quiet and pale and told him that if ever he dared to let a disrespectful word about his mother pass his lips again he ernest would halfkill him hugh then he let him get up hugh kershaw rose and turning whispered something to his friend who had sat next him at dinner a man about thirty years of age and with a military air about him his friend listened and pulled his large moustache thoughtfully then he addressed ernest with the utmost politeness i am captain justice of the hussars of course mr kershaw you are aware that you cannot indulge yourself in the luxury of knocking people down without hearing more about it have you any friend with you ernest shook his head as he answered this indicating mr alston who had been an attentive observer of everything that had passed is the only gentleman i know in the town and i cannot ask him to mix himself up in my quarrels ernest was beginning to understand that this quarrel was a very serious business all right my lad said mr alston quietly i will stand by you really i have no right began ernest nonsense it is one of our colonial customs to stick by one another mr justice captain justice put in that gentleman with a bow captain justice my name is alston i am very much at your service captain justice turned to hugh kershaw whose clothes were dripping from the water in the gutter and after whispering with him for a moment said aloud if i were you kershaw i should go and change those clothes you will catch cold and then addressing mr alston i think the smokingroom is empty shall we go and have a chat mr alston assented and they went in together ernest followed but having lit his pipe sat down in a far corner of the room presently mr alston called him look here kershaw this is a serious business and as you are principally concerned i think you had better give your own answer to be brief your cousin mr hugh kershaw demands that you should apologise in writing for having struck him i am willing to do that if he will apologise for the terms he used in connection with my mother ah said the gallant captain the young gentleman is coming to reason he also demands that you should hand over the note you received from the lady that i certainly shall not do he answered and drawing the card from his pocket he tore it into fragments unread captain justice bowed and left the room in a few minutes he returned and addressing mr alston and ernest said mr kershaw is not satisfied with what you offer to do he declines to apologise for any expression that he may have used with reference to your mother and he now wishes you to choose between signing an apology which i shall dictate or meeting him tomorrow morning you must remember that we are in guernsey where you cannot insult a man on the payment of forty shillings of course this view was an entirely incorrect one although guernsey has a political constitution of its own many of its laws being based upon the old normanfrench customs and judicial proceedings being carried on in french c it is quite as criminal an act to fight a duel there as in england as captain justice himself afterwards found out to his cost but they none of them knew that ernest felt the blood run to his heart he understood now what captain justice meant he answered simply i shall be very happy to meet my cousin in whatever place and way you and mr alston may agree upon and then he returned to his chair and gave himself up to the enjoyment of his pipe and an entirely new set of sensations captain justice gazed after him pityingly i am sorry for him he said to mr alston kershaw is i believe a good shot with pistols i suppose you will choose pistols it would be difficult to get swords in such a hurry he is a fine young fellow took it coolly by george well i dont think that he will trouble the world much longer this is a silly business and likely to land us all in a nasty mess is there no way out of it none that i know of unless your young friend will eat dirt he is a nastytempered fellow kershaw and wild about that woman over whom he has spent thousands nor is he likely to forgive being rolled in the gutter you had better get your man to give in for if you dont kershaw will kill him it is no good talking of it i have lived a rough life and know what men are made of he is not of that sort besides your man is in the wrong not that boy if anybody spoke of my mother like that i would shoot him very good mr alston and now about the pistols i have none i have a pair of smith wesson revolvers that i bought yesterday to take out to africa with me they throw a very heavy bullet captain justice too heavy if one of them is hit anywhere in the body he did not finish the sentence mr alston nodded we must put them twenty paces apart to give them a chance of missing and now about the place and the time i know a place on the beach about a mile and a half from here that will do very well you go down that street till you strike the beach then turn to your right and follow the line of the sea till you come to a deserted hut or cottage there we will meet you at what time let me see shall we say a quarter to five it will be light enough for us then very good the weymouth boat leaves at halfpast six i am going to see about getting my things ready to go to meet it i should advise you to do the same captain justice we had better not return here after it is over no then they parted luckily the manager of the hotel had not gone to bed so the various parties concerned were able to pay their bills and make arrangements about their luggage being sent to meet the early boat without exciting the slightest suspicion ernest wrote a note and left it to be given to his friend when he should arrive on the morrow in which he stated mysteriously that business had called him away he could not help smiling to himself sadly when he thought that his business might be of a sort that it would take all eternity to settle then he went to his room and wrote two letters one to eva and one to dorothy mr alston was to post them if anything happened to him the first was of a passionate nature and breathed hopes of reunion in another place ah how fondly the poor human heart clings to that idea the second collected and sensible enough the letters finished following mr alstons advice he undressed and took a bath then he said his prayers the prayers his mother had taught him put on a quiet dark suit of clothes and went and sat by the open window the night was very still and fragrant with the sweet strong breath of the sea not a sound came from the quaint old town beneath all was at peace ernest sitting there wondered whether he would live to see another night and if not what the nights were like in the land whither he was journeying as he thought of it the grey damps that hide that unrisen world from our gaze struck into his soul and made him feel afraid not afraid of death but afraid of the empty loneliness beyond it of the cold air of an infinite space in which nothing human can live would his mother meet him there he wondered or would she put him from her coming with blood upon his hands next he thought of eva and in his solitude a tear gathered in his dark eyes it seemed so hard to go to that other place without her chapter xvi madames work presently the eastern sky began to be barred with rays of light and ernest knew that the dawn was near rising with a sigh he made his last preparations inwardly determining that if he was to die he would die in a way befitting all english gentlemen there should be no sign of his fears on his face when he looked at his adversarys pistol presently there came a soft knock at the door and mr alston entered with his shoes off in his hand he held the case containing the two smith wessons we must be off presently he said i just heard captain justice go down look here kershaw do you understand anything about these and he tapped the smith wessons yes i have often practised with a pair of old duelling pistols at home i used to be a very fair shot with them that is lucky now take one of these revolvers i want to give you a lesson and accustom you to handle it no i will not it would not be fair to the other man if i did and killed him i should feel like a murderer as you like but i am going to tell you something and give you a bit of advice these revolvers are hairtriggered i had the scears filed when the word is given bring the barrel of your pistol down till you get the sight well on to your antagonist somewhere about his chest then press the trigger do not pull it remember that if you do as i tell you he will never hear the report above all do not lose your nerve and dont be sentimental and fire in the air or any such nonsense for that is a most futile proceeding morally and in every other way mark my words if you do not kill him he will kill you he intends to kill you and you are in the right now we must be going your luggage is in the hall is it not all except this bag very good bring it down with you my boy will bring it to the boat with my own if you are not hit you will do well to get out of this as soon as possible i mean to make for southampton as straight as i can there is a vessel sailing for south africa on friday morning i shall embark in her we will settle what you are to do afterwards yes said ernest with a smile there is no need to talk of that at present five minutes afterwards they met in the hall and slipped quietly out through the door that always stood open all night for the accommodation of visitors addicted to late hours following the street that captain justice had pointed out they descended to the beach and turning to the right walked along it leisurely the early morning air was very sweet and all nature smiled dimly upon them as they went for the sun was not yet up but at that moment ernest did not think much of the beauty of the morning it all seemed like a frightful dream at last they came to the deserted hut looming large in the grey mist by it stood two figures they are there already said mr alston as they approached the two figures lifted their hats a compliment which they returned then mr alston went to captain justice and fell into conversation with him and together they paced off a certain distance on the sand marking its limits with their walking sticks ernest noticed that it was about the length of a short cricket pitch shall we place them he heard captain justice say not just yet was the reply there is barely light enough now gentlemen said mr alston presently i have prepared in duplicate a paper setting forth as fairly as i can the circumstances under which this unhappy affair has come about i propose to read it to you and to ask you all to sign it as a protection to to us all i have brought a pen and a pocket inkpot with me for that purpose nobody objected so he read the paper it was short concise and just and they all signed it as it stood ernests hand shook a good deal as he did so come that wont do said mr alston encouragingly as he pocketed one copy of the document after handing the other to captain justice shake yourself together man but for all his brave words he looked the more nervous of the two i wish to say began ernest addressing himself to all the other three that this quarrel is none of my seeking i could not in honour give up the note the lady wrote to me but i feel that this is a dreadful business and if you addressing his cousin are ready to apologise for what you said about my mother i am ready to do the same for attacking you mr hugh kershaw smiled bitterly and turning said something to his second ernest caught the words white feather mr hugh kershaw refuses to offer any apology he expects one was captain justices ready answer then if any blood is shed on his head be it said mr alston solemnly come let us get it over each took his man and placed him by one of the sticks and then handed him a revolver stand sideways and remember what i told you whispered mr alston are you ready gentlemen asked captain justice presently there was no answer but ernest felt his heart stand still and a mist gathered before his eyes at that moment he heard a lark rise into the air near him and begin to sing unless he could get his sight back he felt that he was lost one the mist cleared away from his eyes he saw his adversarys pistolbarrel pointing steadily at him two a ray broke from the rising sun and caught a crystal pin hugh kershaw incautiously wore instinctively ernest remembered mr alstons advice and lowered the sight of his long barrel till it was dead on the crystal pin curiously enough it reminded him at that moment of the eyes in the witchs head at dums ness his vital forces rose to the emergency and his arm grew as steady as a rock then came a pause that seemed hours long three there was a double report and ernest became aware of a commotion in his hair hugh kershaw flung up his arms wildly sprang a few inches off the ground and fell backwards great god it was over ernest staggered a moment from the reaction and then ran with the others towards his cousin nay towards what had been his cousin he was lying on his back upon the sand his wideopened eyes staring up at the blue sky as though to trace the flight of the spirit his arms extended the heavy revolverball had struck near the crystal pin and then passed upwards through the throat and out at the base of the head shattering the spinal column he is dead said captain justice solemnly ernest wrung his hands i have killed him he said i have killed my own cousin young man said mr alston do not stand there wringing your hands but thank providence for your own escape he was very near killing you let me tell you is your head cut instinctively ernest took off his hat and as he did so some fragments of his curly hair fell to the ground there was a neat hole through the felt and a neat groove along his thick hair his cousin had meant to kill him and he was a good shot so good that he thought that he could put a ball through ernests head but he forgot that a heavy american revolver with forty grains of powder behind the ball is apt to throw a trifle high they all stood silent and looked at the body and the lark that had been frightened by the noise began to sing again this will not do said mr alston presently we had better move the body in there and he pointed to the deserted hut captain justice what do you intend to do give myself up to the authorities i suppose was the gallant captains scared answer very well i dont advise you to do that but it you are determined to there is no need for you to be in a hurry about it you must give us time to get clear first they lifted the corpse reverently bore it into the deserted hut and laid it on the floor ernest remained standing looking at the red stain where it had been presently they came out again and mr alston kicked some sand over the stain and hid it now he said we had better make an addition to those documents to say how this came about they all went back to the hut and the addition was made standing there by the body when it came to ernests turn to sign he almost wished that his signature was the one missing from the foot of that ghastly postscriptum mr alston guessed his thoughts the fortune of war he said coolly now captain justice we are going to catch the early boat and we hope that you will not give yourself up before midday if you can help it the inquiry into the affair will not then be held before tomorrow and by eleven tomorrow morning i hope to have seen the last of england for some years to come the captain was a good fellow at bottom and had no wish to see others dragged into trouble i shall certainly give myself up he said but i dont see any reason to hurry about it i dont think that they can do much to me here poor hugh he can well afford to wait he added with a sigh glancing down at the figure that lay so still with a coat thrown over the face i suppose that they will lock me up for six months pleasant prospect but i say mr kershaw you had better keep clear it will be more awkward for you you see he was your cousin and by his death you become unless i am mistaken next heir to the title yes i suppose so said ernest vaguely here it may be stated that captain justice found himself sadly mistaken instead of the six months he expected he was arraigned for murder and finally sentenced to a term of penal servitude he received a pardon however after serving about a year of his time come we must be off said mr alston or we shall be late for the boat and bowing to captain justice he left the hut ernest followed his example and when he had gone a few yards glanced round at the hateful spot there stood captain justice in the doorway of the hut looking much depressed and there a few yards to the left was the impress in the sand that marked where his cousin had fallen he never saw either the man or the place again kershaw said mr alston what do you propose doing i dont know but you must think remember you are in an awkward fix you know by english law duelling is murder and now i come to think of it i expect that this place is subject to the english law in criminal matters or at least that the law is identical i think i had better give myself up like captain justice nonsense you must hide away somewhere for a year or two till the row blows over where am i to hide have you any money or can you get any yes i have nearly two hundred and fifty pounds on me now my word that is fortunate well now what i have to suggest is that you should assume a false name and sail for south africa with me i am going up country on a shooting expedition outside british territory so there will be little fear of your being caught and extradited then in a year or so when the affair is forgotten you can come back to england what do you say to that i suppose i may as well go there as anywhere else i shall be a marked man all my life anyhow what does it matter where i go ah you are down on your luck now byandby you will cheer up again just then they met a fisherman who gazed at them wondering what the two gentlemen were doing out walking at that hour but concluding that after the mad fashion of englishmen they had been to bathe he passed them with a civil bonjour ernest coloured to the eyes under the scrutiny he was beginning to feel the dreadful burden of his secret presently they reached the steamer and found mr alstons little boy roger who though he was only nine years old was as quick and selfreliant as many english lads of fourteen waiting for them by the bridge oh here you are father you have been walking so long that i thought you would miss the boat i have brought the luggage down all right and this gentlemans too thats right my lad kershaw do you go and take the tickets i want to get rid of this and he tapped the revolvercase that was concealed beneath his coat ernest did so and presently met mr alston on the boat a few minutes more and to his intense relief she cast off and stood out to sea there were not very many passengers on board and those there were were too much taken up in making preparations to be seasick to take any notice of ernest yet he could not shake himself free from the idea that everybody knew that he had just killed a man his own selfconsciousness was so intense that he saw his guilt on the faces of all he met he gazed around him in awe expecting every moment to be greeted as a murderer most people who have ever done anything they should not are acquainted with this sensation overcome with this idea he took refuge in his berth nor did he emerge therefrom till the boat reached weymouth there both he and mr alston bought some rough clothes and to a great extent succeeded in disguising themselves then made their way across country to southampton in the same train but in separate compartments reaching southampton without let or hindrance they agreed to take passages in the union companys rms moor sailing on the following morning mr alston obtained a list of the passengers fortunately there was no one among them whom he knew for greater security however they took steerage passages and booked themselves under assumed names ernest took his second christian name and figured on the passenger list as e beyton while mr alston and his boy assumed the name of james they took their passages at different times and feigned to be unknown to each other these precautions they found to be doubly necessary inasmuch as at southampton mr alston managed to get hold of a book on english criminal law from which it appeared that the fact of the duel having been fought in guernsey did not in the least clear them from the legal consequences of the act as they had vaguely supposed would be the case on the insufficient authority of captain justices statement at last the vessel sailed and it was with a sigh of relief that ernest saw his native shores fade from view as they disappeared a fellowpassenger valet to a gentleman going to the cape for his health politely offered him a paper to read it was the standard of that days date he took it and glanced at the foreign intelligence the first thing that caught his eye was the following paragraph headed a fatal duel the town of st peters in guernsey has been thrown into a state of consternation by the discovery of an english gentleman who was this morning shot dead in a duel captain justice of the hussars who was the unfortunate gentlemans second has surrendered himself to the authorities the other parties who are at present unknown have absconded it is said that they have been traced to weymouth but there all trace of them has been lost the cause of the duel is unknown and in the present state of excitement it is difficult to obtain authentic information by the pilot who left the vessel ernest despatched two letters one to eva ceswick and the other which contained a copy of the memoranda drawn up before and after the duel and attested by mr alston to his uncle to both he told the story of his misfortune fully and fairly imploring the former not to forget him and to wait for happier times and asking the forgiveness of the latter for the trouble that he had brought upon himself and all belonging to him should they wish to write to him he gave his address as ernest beyton postoffice maritzburg the pilotboat hoisted her brown sail with a huge white p upon it and vanished into the night and ernest feeling that he was a ruined man and with the stain of blood upon his hands crept to his bunk and wept like a child yesterday he had been loved prosperous happy with a bright career before him today he was a nameless outcast departing into exile and his young life shadowed by a cloud in which he could see no break well might he weep it was a hard lesson book ii chapter i my poor eva two days after the pilotboat flitting away from the vessels side like some silentflighted bird had vanished into the night florence ceswick happened to be walking past the village postoffice on her way to pay a visit to dorothy when it struck her that the afternoon post must be in and that she might as well ask if there were any letters for dums ness there was no second delivery at kesterwick and she knew that it was not always convenient to mr cardus to send in the civil old postmaster gave her a little bundle of letters remarking at the same time that he thought that there was one for the cottage is it for me mr brown asked florence no miss it is for miss eva o then i will leave it i am going up to dums ness no doubt miss eva will call she knew that eva watched the arrival of the posts very carefully when she got outside the office she glanced at the bundle of letters in her hand and noticed with a start that one of them addressed to mr cardus was in ernests handwriting it bore a southampton postmark what she wondered could he be doing at southampton he should have been in guernsey she walked on briskly to dums ness and on her arrival found dorothy sitting working in the sittingroom after she had greeted her she handed over the letters there is one from ernest she said o i am so glad answered dorothy who is it for for mr cardus o here he comes mr cardus shook hands with her and thanked her for bringing the letters which he turned over casually after the fashion of a man accustomed to receive large quantities of correspondence of an uninteresting nature presently his manner quickened and he opened ernests letter florence fixed her keen eyes upon him he read the letter she read his face mr cardus was accustomed to conceal his emotions but on this occasion it was clear that they were too strong for him astonishment and grief pursued each other across his features as he proceeded finally he put the letter down and glanced at an enclosure what is it reginald what is it asked dorothy it is answered mr cardus solemnly that ernest is a murderer and a fugitive dorothy sank into a chair with a groan and covered her face with her hands florence turned ashy pale what do you mean she said read the letter for yourself and see stop read it aloud and the enclosure too i may have misunderstood florence did so in a quiet voice it was wonderful how her power came out in contrast to the intense disturbance of the other two the old man of the world shook like a leaf the young girl stood firm as a rock yet in all probability her interest in ernest was more intense than his when she had finished mr cardus spoke again you see he said i was right he is a murderer and an outcast and i loved the boy i loved him well let him go o ernest ernest sobbed dorothy florence glanced from one to the other with contempt what are you talking about she said at last what is there to make all this fuss about murderer indeed then our grandfathers were often murderers what would you have had him do would you have had him give up the womans letter to save himself would you have had him put up with this other mans insults about his mother if he had i would never have spoken to him again stop that groaning dorothy you should be proud of him he behaved as a gentleman should if i had the right i should be proud of him and her breast heaved and the proud lips curled as she said it mr cardus listened attentively and it was evident that her enthusiasm moved him there is something in what florence says he broke in i should not have liked the boy to show the white feather but it is an awful business to kill ones own first cousin especially when one is next in the entail old kershaw will be furious at losing his only son and ernest will never be able to come back to this country while he lives or he will set the law on him it is dreadful said dorothy just as he was beginning life and going into a profession and now to have to go and wander in that faroff country under a false name o yes it is sad enough said mr cardus but what is done cannot be undone he is young and will live it down and if the worst comes to the worst must make himself a home out there but it is hard upon me hard upon me and he went to his office muttering hard upon me when florence started upon her homeward way the afternoon had set in wet and chilly and the sea was hidden in wreaths of grey mist altogether the scene was depressing on arrival at the cottage she found eva standing the picture of melancholy by the window and staring out at the misty sea o florence i am glad that you have come home i really began to feel inclined to commit suicide indeed and may i ask why i dont know the rain is so depressing i suppose it does not depress me no nothing ever does you live in the land of perpetual calm i take exercise and keep my liver in good order have you been out this afternoon no ah i thought not no wonder you feel depressed staying indoors all day why dont you go for a walk there is nowhere to go really eva i dont know what has come to you lately why dont you go along the cliff or stop have you been to the postoffice i called for the dums ness letters and mr brown said that there was one for you eva jumped up with remarkable animation and passed out of the room with her peculiarly light tread the mention of that word letter had sufficed to change the aspect of things considerably florence watched her go with a dark little smile ah she said aloud as the door closed your feet will soon fall heavily enough presently eva went out and florence having thrown off her cloak took her sisters place at the window and waited it was seven minutes walk to the postoffice she would be back in about a quarter of an hour watch in hand florence waited patiently seventeen minutes had elapsed when the gardengate was opened and eva reentered her face quite grey with pain and furtively applying a handkerchief to her eyes florence smiled again i thought so she said from all of which it will be seen that florence was a very remarkable woman she had scarcely exaggerated when she said that her heart was as deep as the sea the love that she bore ernest was the strongest thing in all her strong and vigorous life when every other characteristic and influence crumbled away and was forgotten it would still remain overmastering as ever and when she discovered that her high love the greatest and best part of her had been made a plaything of by a thoughtless boy who kissed girls on the same principle that a duck takes to water because it came natural to him the love in its mortal agonies gave birth to a hate destined to grow as great as itself but with all a womans injustice it was not directed towards the same object on ernest indeed she would wreak vengeance if she could but she still loved him as dearly as at first the revenge would be a mere episode in the history of her passion but to her sister the innocent woman who she chose to consider had robbed her she gave all that bountiful hate herself the more powerful character of the two she determined upon the utter destruction of the weaker strong as fate and unrelenting as time she dedicated her life to that end everything she said comes to those who can wait she forgot that the providence above us can wait the longest of us all in the end it is providence that wins eva came in and florence heard her make her way up the stairs to her room again she spoke to herself the poor fool will weep over him and renounce him if she had the courage she would follow him and comfort him in his trouble and so tie him to her for ever oh that i had her chance but the chances always come to fools then she went upstairs and listened outside evas door she was sobbing audibly turning the handle she walked casually in well eva did you why my dear girl what is the matter with you eva who was lying sobbing on her bed turned her head to the wall and went on sobbing what is the matter eva if you only knew how absurd you look nononothing nonsense people do not make such a scene as this for nothing no answer come my dear as your affectionate sister i really must ask what has happened to you the tone was commanding and half unconsciously eva obeyed it ernest she ejaculated well what about ernest he is nothing to you is he no that is yes o it is so dreadful it was the letter and she touched a sheet of closely written paper that lay on the bed beside her well as you do not seem to be in a condition to explain yourself perhaps you had better let me read the letter o no nonsense give it me perhaps i may be able to help you and she took the paper from her unresisting grasp and turning her face from the light read it deliberately through it was very passionate in its terms and rather incoherent such a letter in short as a lad almost wild with love and grief would write under the circumstances so said florence as she coolly folded it up it appears that you are engaged to him no answer unless sobs can be said to constitute one and it seems that you are engaged to a man who has just committed a frightful murder and run away from the consequences eva sat up on the bed it was not a murder it was a duel precisely a duel about another woman but the law calls it murder if he is caught he will be hanged o florence how can you say such dreadful things i only say what is true poor eva i do not wonder that you are distressed it is all so dreadful you love him i suppose o yes dearly then you must get over it you must never think of him any more never think of him i shall think of him all my life that is as it may be you must never have anything more to do with him he has blood upon his hands blood shed for some bad woman i cannot desert him florence because he has got into trouble over another woman a peculiar expression of pain passed over evas face how cruel you are florence he is only a boy and boys will go wrong sometimes anybody can make a fool of a boy and it seems that boys can make fools of some people who should know better o florence what is to be done you have such a clear head tell me what i must do i cannot give him up i cannot indeed florence seated herself on the bed beside her sister and put an arm round her neck and kissed her eva was much touched at her kindness my poor eva she said i am so sorry for you but tell me when did you get engaged to him that evening you went out sailing together yes he kissed you i suppose and all that yes oh i was so happy my poor eva i tell you i cannot give him up well perhaps there will be no need for you to do so but you must not answer that letter why not because it will not do look at it which way you will ernest has just killed his own cousin in a quarrel about another woman it is necessary that you should mark your disapproval of that in some way or other do not answer his letter if in time he can wash himself clear of the reproach and remains faithful to you then it will be soon enough to show that you still care for him but if i leave him like that he will fall into the hands of other women though he loves me all the time i know him well his is not a nature that can stand alone well let him but florence you forget that i love him too i cannot bear to think of it o i love him i love him and she dropped her head upon her sisters shoulder and began to sob again my dear it is just because you do love him so that you should prove him and besides my dear you have your own selfrespect to think of be guided by me eva do not answer that letter i am sure that you will regret it if you do let matters stand for a few months then we can arrange a plan of action above all do not let your engagement transpire to anybody there will be a dreadful scandal about this business and it will be most unpleasant for you and indeed for us all to have our name mixed up in the matter hark there is aunt coming in i will go and talk to her you can stop here and recover yourself a little you will follow my advice will you not dearest i suppose so answered eva with a heavy sigh as she buried her face in the pillow then florence left her chapter ii the locum tenens and so it came to pass that ernests letter remained unanswered but mr cardus dorothy and jeremy all wrote mr carduss letter was very kind and considerate it expressed his deep grief at what had happened and told him of the excitement that the duel had caused and of the threatening letters which he had received from sir hugh kershaw who was halfwild with grief and fury at the loss of his son finally it commended his wisdom in putting the seas between himself and the avengers of blood and told him that he should not want for money as his drafts would be honoured to the extent of a thousand a year should he require so much mr cardus was very openhanded where ernest was concerned also if he required any particular sum of money for any purpose such as to buy land or start a business he was to let him know dorothys letter was like herself sweet and gentle and overflowing with womanly sympathy she bade him not to be downhearted but to hope for a time when all this dreadful business would be forgotten and he would be able to return in peace to england she bade him also shyly enough to remember that there was only one power that could really wash away the stain of blood upon his hands every month she said she would write him a letter whether he answered it or not this promise she faithfully kept jeremys letter was characteristic it is worth transcribing my dear old fellow your news has knocked us all into the middle of next week to think of your fighting a duel and my not being there to hold the sponge and i will tell you what it is old chap some of these people round here like that old de talor call it murder but that is gammon and dont you trouble your head about it it was he who got up the row not you and he tried to shoot you into the bargain i am awfully glad that you kept your nerve and plugged him it would have been better if you could have nailed him through the right shoulder which would not have killed him but at the best of times you were never good enough with a pistol for that dont you remember when we used to shoot with the old pistols at the man i cut out on the cliff you were always just as likely to hit him on the head or in the stomach as through the heart it is a sad pity that you did not practise a little more but it is no use crying over spilt milk and after all the shot seems to have been a very creditable one so you are going on a shooting expedition up in secocoenis country that is what i call glorious to think of a rhinoceros makes my mouth water i would give one of my fingers to shoot one life here is simply wretched now that you have gone mr cardus as glum as titheburgh abbey on a cloudy day and doll always looking as though she had been crying or were going to cry old grandfather atterleigh is quite lively compared to those two as for the office i hate it everlastingly copying deeds which i dont in the slightest understand and adding up figures in which i make mistakes your respected uncle told me the other day in his politest way that he considered i sailed as near being a complete fool as any man he ever knew i answered that i quite agreed with him i met that young fellow smithers the other day the one who gave eva that little brute of a dog he said something disagreeable about wondering if they would hang you i told him that i didnt know if they would or not but unless he dropped his infernal sneer i was very sure that i would break his neck he concluded to move on by the way i met eva ceswick herself yesterday she looked pale and asked if we had heard anything of you she said that she had got a letter from you florence came up here and spoke up well for you she said that she was proud of you or would be if she had a right to i never liked her before but now i think that she is a brick goodbye old chap i never wrote such a long letter before you dont know how i miss you life doesnt seem worth having yesterday was the first i went out and killed twenty brace to my own gun fired fortysix cartridges not bad eh and yet somehow i didnt seem to care a twopenny curse about the whole thing though if you had been there you would have duffed them awfully i feel sure you would have set my teeth on edge with letting them off the birds i mean mind you write to me often goodbye old fellow god bless you your affectionate friend jeremy jones ps in shooting big game a fellow told me that the top of the flank raking forward is a very deadly shot as it either breaks the back or passes through the kidneys to the lungs and heart i should have thought that the shot was very apt to waste itself in the flesh of the flank please try it and take notes of the results about a fortnight after these letters addressed ernest beyton esq post office maritzburg natal had been despatched kesterwick and its neighbourhood was thrown into a state of mild excitement by the announcement that mr halford the clergyman whose health had of late been none of the best purposed to take a years rest and that the bishop had consented to the duties of his parish being carried on by a locum tenens named the reverend james plowden mr halford was much liked and respected and the intelligence was received with general regret which was however tempered with curiosity as to the newcomer thus when it became known that mr plowden was to preach in the parish church at the evening service on the third sunday in september all kesterwick was seized with profound religious fervour and went to hear him the parish church at kesterwick was unusually large and beautiful being a relic of an age when whatever mens lives may have been they spared neither their money nor their thought in rearing up fitting habitations to the deity whom they regarded perhaps with more of superstitious awe than true religious feeling standing as it did somewhat back from the sea it alone had escaped the shock of the devouring waves and remained till this day a monument of architectural triumph its tall tower pointing like a great finger up to heaven looked very solemn on that quiet september evening as the crowd of churchgoers passed beneath its shadow into the old doorway through which most of them had been carried to their christening and would in due time be carried to their burial at least so thought eva and dorothy as they stood for a moment by the monument to five unknown sailors washed ashore after a great gale and buried in a common grave how many suffering erring human beings had stood upon the same spot and thought the same thoughts how many more now sleeping in the womb of time would stand there and think them when these two had suffered and erred their full and been long forgotten they formed a strange contrast those two sweet women as they passed together into the sacred stillness of the church the one stately dark and splendid with an unrestful trouble in her eyes the other almost insignificant in figure but pure and patient of face and with steady blue eyes which never wavered did they guess those two as they walked thus together how closely their destines were linked did they know that each at heart was striving for the same prize a poor one indeed but still all the world to them perhaps they did very vaguely and it was the pressure of their common trouble that drew them closer together in those days but if they did they never spoke of it and as for little dorothy she never dreamed of winning she was content to be allowed to toil along in the painful race when they reached the pew that the ceswicks habitually occupied they found miss ceswick and florence already there jeremy had refused to come he had a most unreasonable antipathy to parsons mr halford he liked but of this new man he would have none the general curiosity to see him was to jeremy inexplicable his opinion being that he should soon see a great deal more of him than he liked just like a pack of girls running after a new doll he growled well there is one thing you will soon be tired of hearing him squeak as the service went on the aisles of the great church grew dim except where the setting sun shot a crimson shaft through the west window which wandered from spot to spot and face to face and made them glorious when it came to the hymn before the sermon eva could scarcely see to read and with the exception of the crimson pencil of sunlight that came through the head of the virgin mary and wavered restlessly about and the strong glow of the lights upon the pulpit the church was almost dark when the new clergyman mr plowden ascended the steps of the ancient pulpit and gave out his text eva looked at him in common with the rest of the congregation mr plowden was a large man of a somewhat lumbering make his head too was large and covered with masses of rather coarsetextured black hair the forehead was prominent and gave signs of intellectual power the eyebrows thick and stronglymarked and in curious contrast to the cold lightgrey eyes that played unceasingly beneath them all the lower part of the face which to judge from the purple hue of the skin nature had intended should be plentifully clothed with hair was clean shaven and revealed a large jaw square chin and pair of thick lips altogether mr plowden was considered a fine man and his face was generally spoken of as striking perhaps the most curious thing about it however was a species of varicose vein on the forehead which was generally quite unnoticeable but whenever he was excited or nervous stood out above the level of the skin in the form of a perfect cross it was thus visible when eva looked at him and it struck her as being an unpleasant mark to have on ones forehead she turned her eyes away the man did not please her fastidious taste and listened for his voice presently it came it was powerful and even musical but coarse he is not a gentleman thought eva to herself and then dismissing him and his sermon too from her mind she leaned back against the poppyhead at the end of the pew halfclosed her eyes and let her thoughts wander in the way that thoughts have the power to do in church far cross the sea they flew to where a great vessel labouring in a heavy gale was ploughing her steady way along to where a young man stood clinging to the iron stanchions and gazed out into the darkness with sorrow in his eyes wonderfully soft and tender grew her beautiful face as the vision passed before her soul the ripe lips quivered and there was a world of love in the halfopened eyes and just then the wandering patch of glory perceived her settled on her like a butterfly upon a flower and for a while wandered no longer suddenly she became aware of a momentary pause in the even flow of the clergymans eloquence and waking from her reverie glanced up at that spot of light surrounding him and as she did so it struck her that she herself was illuminated with a more beautiful light that he and she alone were distinguishable out of all the people beneath that roof the same thought had evidently struck mr plowden for he was gazing intently at her instinctively she drew back into the shadow and mr plowden went on with his sermon but he had driven away poor evas vision there only remained of it the sad reproachful look of those dark eyes outside the church dorothy found jeremy waiting to escort her home they all went together as far as the cottage when they got clear of the crowd florence spoke what a goodlooking man mr plowden is and how well he preached i did not like him much said dorothy what do you think of him eva asked florence i oh i do not know i do not think he is a gentleman i am sure that he is not put in jeremy i saw him by the postoffice this morning he is a cad rather a sweeping remark that is it not mr jones said florence i dont know if it is sweeping or not answered jeremy sententiously but i am sure that it is true then they said goodnight and went their separate ways chapter iii eva takes a district the reverend james plowden was born of rich but honest parents in the sugarbroking way he was one of a large family who were objects of anxious thought to mr and mrs plowden these worthy people aware of the disadvantages under which they laboured in the matter of education determined that neither trouble nor money should be spared to make their children genteel and so it came to pass that the mansion near bloomsbury was overrun with the most expensive nurses milliners governesses and tutors all straining every nerve to secure the perfect gentility of the young plowdens the result was highly ornamental but scarcely equivalent to the vast expense incurred the plowden youth of both sexes may be said to have been painted and varnished and gilded into an admirable imitation of gentlefolks but if the lacquerwork would stand the buffetings of the worlds weather was another question and one which does not concern us except in so far as it has to do with a single member of the family master james plowden came about halfway down the family list but he might just as well have stood at the head of it for he ruled his brothers and sisters old and young with a heavy rod he was the strong one of the family strong both in mind and body and he had a hand of iron for his misdeeds were his brothers thrashed preferring to take those ills they knew of from the hands of the thrasher rather than endure the unimagined horrors brother james would make ready for them should they venture to protest thus it was that he became to be considered par excellence the good boy of the family as he was certainly the clever one and bore every sort of blushing honour thick upon him it was to an occurrence in his boyhood that mr plowden owed his parents determination to send him into the church his future career had always been a matter of much speculation to them for they belonged to that class of people who love to arrange their infants destines when the infants themselves are still in the cradle and argue their fitness for certain lines of life from remarks which they make at three years old now jamess mamma had a very favourite parrot with a red tail and out of this tail it was jamess delight to pull the feathers having discovered that so doing gave a parrot a lively twinge of pain the onus of the featherpulling if discovered was shouldered on to a chosen brother who was promptly thrashed but on one occasion things went wrong with master james the parrot was climbing up the outside of his cage presenting the remainder of his tail to the hand of the spoiler in a way that was irresistibly seductive but aware of the fact that his enemy was in the neighbourhood he kept a careful lookout from the corner of his eye and the moment that he saw jamess stealthy hand draw near his tail made a sudden dart at it and actually succeeded in making his powerful beak meet through its forefinger james shrieked with pain and fury and shaking the bird on to the floor stunned it with a book but he was not satisfied with this revenge for as soon as he saw that it could no longer bite he seized it and twisted its neck there you devil he said throwing the creature into the cage hullo something has burst in my forehead o james what have you done said his little brother montague well knowing that he had a lively personal interest in jamess misdoings nonsense what have you done now remember montague you killed the parrot just then mr and mrs plowden came in from a drive and a very lively scene ensued into which we need not enter suffice it to say that all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding james was acquitted on the ground of general good character and montague howling and protesting his innocence was led off to execution justly fearful lest something further should transpire james was hurriedly leaving the room when his mother called him back why what is that on your forehead dont know answered james something went snap there just now well i never just look at the boy john he has got a cross upon his forehead mr plowden papa examined the phenomenon very carefully and then solemnly removing his spectacles remarked with much deliberation elizabeth that settles the point what point john what point why the point of the boys profession it is as you remark a cross upon his forehead good he shall go into the church now i must decline to be argued with elizabeth the matter is settled and so in due course james plowden esq went to cambridge and became the reverend james plowden shortly after the reverend james had started in life as a curate having first beguiled his parents into settling on himself a portion just twice as large as that to which he was entitled he found it convenient to cut off his connection with a family he considered vulgar and a drag upon his professional success but somehow with all his gifts and undoubtedly he was by nature wellendowed especially as regards his mind that was remarkable for a species of hard cleverness and persuasive power and with all the advantages which he derived from being in receipt of an independent income the reverend james had not hitherto proved a conspicuous success he had held some important curacies and of late had acted as the locum tenens of several gentlemen who like mr halford through loss of health or other reasons had been called away from their livings for a length of time but from all these places the reverend james had departed without regret nor had there been any very universal lamentations over his going the fact of the matter was that the reverend james was not a popular man he had ability in plenty and money in plenty and would expend both without stint if he had an end to gain he was more or less of a good companion too in the ordinary sense of the word that is he could make himself agreeable in a rough exaggerated kind of way to both men and women indeed by the former he was often spoken of carelessly as a good fellow but women or rather ladies following their finer instincts disliked him intensely he jarred upon them of course it is impossible to lay down any fixed rule about men but there are two tokens by which they may be known the first is by their friends the second by the degree of friendship and affection to which they are admitted by women the man to whom members of the other sex attach themselves is in ninetynine cases out of a hundred a good fellow and womens instinct tells them so or they would not love him it may be urged that women often love blackguards to this the answer is that there must be a good deal of good mixed up with the blackguardism show me the man whom two or three women of his own rank love or have loved with all their honest hearts and i will trust all i have into his hands and not be a penny the poorer but women did not love the reverend james plowden although he had for several years come to the conclusion that it was desirable that they should or rather that one of them should in plain language he had for some years past thought that he would improve his position by getting married he was a shrewd man and he could not disguise from himself the fact that so far he was not altogether a success he had tried his best but with all his considerable advantages he had failed there was only one avenue to success which he had not tried and that was marriage marriage with a woman of high caste quick intellect and beauty might give him the tone that his social position so badly needed he was a man in a good position he had money he had intelligence of a robust if of a coarse order he had fairly good looks and he was only thirtyfive why should he not marry blood brains and beauty and shine with a reflected splendour such were the thoughts which were simmering in the astute brain of the reverend james plowden when he first set eyes upon eva ceswick in the old church at kesterwick within a week or so of his arrival mr plowden in his character of spiritual adviser to the motley kesterwick flock paid a ceremonious call on the misses ceswick they were all at home miss ceswick and florence welcomed him graciously eva politely but with an air that said plainly that he interested her not at all yet it was to eva that he chiefly directed himself he took this opportunity to inform them all especially eva that he felt the responsibilities of his position as locum tenens to weigh heavily upon him he appealed to them all especially eva to help him bear his load he was going to institute a new system of district visiting would they all especially eva assist him if they would the good work was already half done there was so much for young ladies to do he could assure them from his personal experience that one visit from a young lady however useless she might be in a general way which his instinct assured him these particular young ladies before him were not had more influence with a distressed and godless family than six from wellmeaning but unsympathetic clergymen like himself might he rely on their help i am afraid that i am too old for that sort of thing mr plowden answered miss ceswick you might see what you can do with my nieces i am sure that i shall be delighted to help said florence if eva will bear me company i always feel a shyness about intruding myself into cottages unsupported your shyness is not surprising miss ceswick i suffered from it myself for many years but at last i have i am thankful to say got the better of it but i am sure that we shall not appeal to your sister in vain i shall be glad to help if you think that i can do any good put in eva thus directly appealed to but i must tell you i have no great faith in myself do the work miss ceswick and the faith will come sow the seed and the tree will spring up and bear fruit too in due season there was no reply so he continued then i have your permission to put you down for a district o yes mr plowden answered florence will you take some more tea mr plowden would take no more tea but went on his way to finish the days work he had mapped out for himself for he worked hard and according to a strict rule reflecting that eva ceswick was the loveliest woman he had ever seen i think that we must congratulate you on a conquest eva said miss ceswick cheerfully as the front door closed mr plowden never took his eyes off you and really my dear i do not wonder at it you look charming eva flushed up angrily nonsense aunt she said and left the room really said miss ceswick i dont know what has come to eva lately she is so very strange i expect that you have touched her on a sore point i rather fancy that she has taken a liking to mr plowden said florence dryly o indeed answered the old lady nodding her head wisely in due course a district was assigned to the two miss ceswicks and for her part eva was glad of the occupation it brought her a good deal into contact with mr plowden which was not altogether pleasant to her for she cherished a vague dislike of the clergyman and did not admire his shifty eyes but as she got to know him better she could find nothing to justify her dislike he was not it is true quite a gentleman but that was his misfortune his manner to herself was subdued and almost deferential he never obtruded himself upon her society though somehow he was in it almost daily indeed he even succeeded in raising her to some enthusiasm about her work a quality in which poor eva had of late been sadly lacking she thought him a very good clergyman with his heart in his duty but she disliked him all the same eva never answered ernests letter once she began an answer but bethought her of florences sage advice and changed her mind he will write again she said to herself she did not know ernest his was not a nature to humble itself before a woman could she have seen her lover hanging about the steps of the maritzburg postoffice when the english mail was being delivered in order to go back to the window when the people had dispersed and ask the tired clerk if he was sure that there were no more letters for ernest beyton and get severely snubbed for his pains perhaps her heart would have relented and yet it was a performance which poor ernest went through once a week out there in natal one mailday mr alston went with him well ernest has it come he asked as he came down the steps a letter from dorothy in his hand no alston and never will she has thrown me over mr alston took his arm and walked away with him across the marketsquare look here my lad he said the woman who deserts a man in trouble or as soon as his back is turned is worthless it is a sharp lesson to learn but as most men have cause to know the world is full of sharp lessons and worthless women you know that she got your letter yes she told my friend so then i tell you that your eva or whatever her name is is more worthless than most of them she has been tried and found wanting look he went on pointing to a shapely kafir girl passing with a pot of native beer on her head you had better take that intombi to wife than such a woman as this eva she at any rate would stand by you in trouble and if you fell would stop to be killed over your dead body come be a man and have done with her ay by heaven i will answered ernest thats right and now look here the waggons will be at lydenburg in a week let us take the postcart tomorrow and go up then we can have a months vilderbeeste and koodoo shooting until it is safe to go into the fever country once you get among the big game you wont think any more about that woman women are all very well in their way but if it comes to choosing between them and big game shooting give me the big game chapter iv jeremys idea of a shaking two months or so after ernests flight there came a letter from him to mr cardus in answer to the one sent by his uncle he thanked his uncle warmly for his kindness and more especially for not joining in the hue and cry against him as regarded money he hoped to be able to make a living for himself but if he wanted any he would draw the letter which was short ended thus thank doll and jeremy for their letters i would answer them but i am too down on my luck to write much writing stirs up so many painful memories and makes me think of all the dear folks at home more than is good for me the fact is my dear uncle what between one thing and another i never was so miserable in my life and as for loneliness i never knew what it meant before sometimes i wish that my cousin had hit me instead of my hitting him and that i was dead and buried clean out of the way alston who was my second in that unhappy affair and with whom i am going upcountry shooting has been most kind to me and has introduced me to a good many people here they are very hospitable everybody is hospitable in a colony but somehow a hundred new faces cannot make up for one old one and i should think old atterleigh a cheerful companion beside the best of them what is more i feel myself an impostor intruding myself on them under an assumed name goodbye my dear uncle it would be difficult for me to explain how grateful i am for your goodness to me love to dear doll and jeremy ever your affectionate nephew e k all the party at dums ness were much touched by this letter more especially dorothy who could not bear to think of ernest all alone out there in that strange faroff land her tender little heart grew alive with love and sorrow as she lay awake at night and thought of him travelling over the great african plains she got all the books that were to be had about south africa and read them so that she might be the better able to follow his life in her thoughts one day when florence came to see her she read her part of ernests letter and when she had finished she was astonished to see a tear in her visitors keen eyes she liked florence the better for that tear could she have seen the conflict that was raging in the fierce heart of the woman before her she would have started from her as though she had been a poisonous snake the letter touched florence touched her to the quick the tale of ernests loneliness almost overcame her resolution for she alone knew why he was so utterly lonely and what it was that crushed him had ernest alone been concerned it is probable that she would then and there have thrown up her cruel game but he was not alone concerned there was her sister who had robbed her of her lover her sister whose loveliness was a standing affront to her as her sweetness was a standing reproach she was sorry for ernest and would have been glad to make him happier but as that could only be done by foregoing revenge upon her sister ernest must continue to suffer and after all why should he not suffer she argued did not she suffer when florence got home she told eva about the letter from her love but she said nothing of his evident distress he was making friends he expected great pleasure from his shooting altogether he was getting on well eva listened hardened her heart and went out district visiting with mr plowden time went on and no letters came from ernest one month two months six months passed and there was no intelligence of him dorothy grew very anxious and so did mr cardus but they did not speak of the matter much except to remark that the reason no doubt was that he was away on his shooting excursion jeremy also in his slow way grew intensely preoccupied with the fact that they never heard from ernest now and that life was consequently a blank he sat upon the stool in his uncles outer office and made pretence to copy deeds and drafts but in reality he occupied his time in assiduously polishing his nails and thinking as for the deeds and drafts he gave them to his grandfather to copy it kept the old gentleman employed he would explain to dorothy and from indulging in bad thoughts about the devil but it was one night out duckshooting that his great inspiration came it was a bitter night a night on which no sane creature except jeremy would ever have dreamed of going to shoot ducks or anything else the marshes were partially frozen and a fierce east wind was blowing across them but utterly regardless of the cold there sat jeremy under the ice of a dike bank listening for the sound of the ducks wings as they passed to their feedinggrounds and occasionally getting a shot at them as they crossed the moon above him there were not many ducks and the solitude and silence were inductive to contemplation ernest did not write was he dead not probable or they would have heard of it where was he then impossible to say impossible to discover was it impossible swish swish bang and down came a mallard at his feet a quick shot that yes it was impossible they had no means of inquiry here the inquiry if any must be made on the other side of the water but who was to make it ah an idea struck him why should not he jeremy make that inquiry why should he not go to south africa and look for ernest a flight of duck passed over his head unheeded what did he care for duck he had solved the problem which had been troubling him all these months he would go to south africa and look for ernest if mr cardus would not give him the money he would work his way out anyhow he would go he could bear the suspense no longer jeremy rose in the newfound strength of his purpose and gathering up the slain there were only three whistled to his retriever and made his way back to dums ness he found mr cardus and dorothy by the fire in the sittingroom hardriding atterleigh was there too in his place in the inglenook a ridingwhip in his inkstained hand with which he was tapping his topboot they turned as he entered except his grandfather who did not hear him what sport have you had jeremy asked his sister with a sad little smile her face had grown very sad of late three ducks he answered shortly advancing his powerful form out of the shadows into the firelight i came home just as they were beginning to fly you found it cold i suppose said mr cardus absently they had been talking of ernest and he was still thinking of him no i did not think of the cold i came home because i had an idea both his hearers looked up surprised ideas were not very common to jeremy or if they were he kept them to himself well jeremy said dorothy inquiringly well it is this i cannot stand it about ernest any longer and i am going to look for him if you wont give me the money he went on addressing mr cardus almost fiercely i will work my way out it is no credit to me he added i lead a dogs life while i dont know where he is dorothy flushed a pale pink with pleasure rising she went up to her great strong brother and standing on tiptoe managed to kiss him on the chin that is like you jeremy dear she said softly mr cardus looked up too and after his fashion let his eyes wander round jeremy before he spoke you shall have as much money as you like jeremy he said presently and if you bring ernest back safe i will leave you twenty thousand pounds and he struck his hand down upon his knee an evidence of excitement which it was unusual for him to display i dont want your twenty thousand pounds i want ernest answered the young man gruffly no i know you dont my lad i know you dont but find him and keep him safe and you shall have it money is not to be sneezed at let me tell you i say keep him for i forgot you cannot bring him back till this accursed business has blown over when will you go by the next mail of course they leave every friday i will not waste a day today is saturday i will sail next friday that is right you shall go at once i will give you a cheque for five hundred pounds tomorrow and mind jeremy you are not to spare money if he has gone to the zambesi you must follow him never think of the money i will think of that jeremy soon made his preparations they consisted chiefly of trifles he was to leave dums ness early on the thursday on the wednesday afternoon it occurred to him that he might as well tell eva ceswick that he was going in search of ernest and ask if she had any message jeremy was the only person or thought that he was the only person in the secret of ernests affection for eva ernest had asked him to keep it secret and he had kept it secret as the dead never breathing a word of it even to his sister it was about five oclock on a windy march afternoon when he set out for the cottage on the edge of the hamlet of kesterwick some three hundred yards from the cliff stood two or three little hovels turning their naked faces to the full fury of the seablast he was drawing near to these when he came to a stile which gave passage over a sod wall that ran to the edge of the cliff marking the limits of the village common as he approached the stile the wind brought him the sound of voices a mans and a womans engaged apparently in angry dispute on the farther side of the wall instead of getting over the stile he stepped to the right and looked over the wall and saw the new clergyman mr plowden standing with his back towards him and apparently very much against her will holding eva ceswick by the hand jeremy was too far off to overhear his words but from his voice it was clear that plowden was talking in an excited masterful tone just then eva turned her head a little and he did hear what she said her voice being so much clearer no mr plowden no let go my hand ah why will you not take an answer just at that moment she succeeded in wrenching her imprisoned hand from his strong grasp and without waiting for any more words set off towards kesterwick almost at a run jeremy was a man of slow mind though when once his mind was made up it was of a singularly determined nature at first he did not quite take in the full significance of the scene but when he did a great red flush spread over his honest face and the big grey eyes sparkled dangerously presently mr plowden turned and saw him jeremy noticed that the sign of the cross was remarkably visible on his forehead and that his face wore an expression by no means pleasant to behold anything but a christian in short hullo he said to jeremy what are you doing there before answering jeremy put his hand on the top of the sod wall and vaulting over walked straight up to the clergyman i was watching you he said looking him straight in the eyes indeed an honourable employment eavesdropping i think it is generally called whatever had passed between mr plowden and eva ceswick it had clearly not improved the formers temper what do you mean i mean what i say well mr plowden i may as well tell you what i mean i am not good at talking but i know that i shall be able to make you understand i saw you just now assaulting miss ceswick it is a lie that is not a gentlemanlike word mr plowden but as you are not a gentleman i will overlook it jeremy after the dangerous fashion of the anglosaxon race always got wonderfully cool as a row thickened i repeat that i saw you holding her notwithstanding her struggles to get away and what is that to you confound you said mr plowden shaking with fury and raising a thick stick he held in his hand in a suggestive manner dont lose your temper and you shall hear miss eva ceswick is engaged to my friend ernest kershaw or something very like it and as he is not here to look after his own interests i must look after them for him ah yes answered mr plowden with a ghastly smile i have heard of that the murderer you mean i recommend you mr plowden in your own interest to be a little more careful in your terms and supposing that there has been something between your your friend much better term mr plowden and miss eva ceswick what i should like to know is there to prevent her having changed her mind jeremy laughed aloud it must be admitted rather insolently and in a way calculated to irritate people of meeker mind than mr plowden to any one mr plowden who has the privilege of your acquaintance and who also knows ernest kershaw your question would seem absurd you see there are some people between whom there can be no comparison it is not possible that after caring for ernest any woman could care for you and jeremy laughed again mr plowdens thick lips turned quite pale the veinous cross upon his forehead throbbed until jeremy thought that it would burst and his eyes shone with the concentrated light of hate his vanity was his weakest point he controlled himself with an effort however though if there had been any deadly weapon at hand it might have gone hard with jeremy perhaps you will explain the meaning of your interference and your insolence and let me go on oh with pleasure answered jeremy with refreshing cheerfulness it is just this if i catch you at any such tricks again you shall suffer for it one cant thrash a clergyman and one cant fight him because he wont fight but look here one can shake him for that leaves no marks and if you go on with these games so sure as my name is jeremy jones i will shake your teeth down your throat goodnight and jeremy turned to go it is not wise to turn ones back upon an infuriated animal and at that moment mr plowden was nothing more even as he turned jeremy remembered this and gave himself a slew to one side it was fortunate for him that he did so for at that moment mr plowdens heavy blackthorn stick directed downwards with all the strength of mr plowdens powerful arm passed within a few inches of his head out of which had he not turned it would have probably knocked the brains as it was it struck the ground with such force that the jar sent it flying out of its owners hands ah you would was jeremys reflection as he sprang at his assailant now mr plowden was a very powerful man but he was no match for jeremy who in after days came to be known as the strongest man in the east of england and so was destined to find him out once jeremy got a grip of him for his respect for the church prevented him from trying to knock him down he seemed to crumple up like a piece of paper in his iron grasp jeremy could easily have thrown him but he would not he had his own ends in view so he just held the reverend james tight enough to prevent him from doing him any serious injury and let him struggle frantically till he thought he was sufficiently exhausted for his purpose then jeremy suddenly gave him a violent twist got behind him and set to work with a will to fulfil his promise of a shaking o what a shake that was first of all he shook him backwards and forwards for ernests sake then he alternated the motion and shook him from side to side for his own sake and finally he shook him every possible way for the sake of eva ceswick it was a wonderful sight to see the great burly clergyman his hat off his white tie undone and his coattails waving like streamers bounding and gambolling on the breezy cliffs his head legs and arms jerking in every possible direction like those of a galvanised frog while behind him his legs slightly apart to get a better grip of the ground and his teeth firmly clinched jeremy shook away with the fixity of fate at last getting exhausted he stopped and holding mr plowden still gave him a dropkick only one but jeremys leg was very strong and he always wore thick boots and the result was startling mr plowden rose some inches off the ground and went on his face into a furzebush he will hardly like to show that honourable wound reflected jeremy as he wiped the perspiration from his brow with every sign of satisfaction he went and picked his fallen enemy out of the bush where he had nearly fainted smoothed his clothes tied the white tie as nearly as he could and put the wide hat on the dishevelled hair then he sat him down on the furze to recover himself goodnight mr plowden goodnight next time you wish to hit a man with a big stick do not wait till his back is turned ah i daresay your head aches i should advise you to go home and have a nice sleep and jeremy departed on his way filled with a fearful joy when he reached the cottage he found everything in a state of confusion miss ceswick it appeared had been suddenly taken very seriously ill indeed it was feared that she had got a stroke of apoplexy he managed however to send up a message to eva to say that he wished to speak to her for a minute presently she came down crying o my poor aunt is so dreadfully ill she said we think that she is dying jeremy offered some awkward condolences and indeed was much distressed he liked old miss ceswick i am going to south africa tomorrow miss eva he said she started violently and blushed up to her hair going to south africa what for i am going to look for ernest we are afraid that something must have happened to him o dont say that she said perhaps he has amusements which prevent his writing i may as well tell you that i saw something of what passed between you and mr plowden again eva blushed mr plowden was very rude she said so i thought but i think that he is sorry for it now what do you mean i mean that i nearly shook his ugly head off for him o how could you eva asked severely but there was no severity on her face just then florences voice was heard calling imperatively i must go said eva have you any message for ernest if i find him eva hesitated i know all about it said jeremy considerately turning his head o no i have no message that is o tell him that i love him dearly and she turned and fled upstairs chapter v florence on marriage miss ceswicks seizure turned out to be even worse than was anticipated once she appeared to regain consciousness and began to mutter something then she sank back into a torpor out of which she never woke again it was fortunate that her condition was not such as to require the services of the clergyman because for some time after the events described in the last chapter mr plowden was not in any condition to give them whether it was the shaking or the wellplanted kick or the shock to his system it is impossible to say but in the upshot he was constrained to keep his bed for several days indeed the first service that he took was on the occasion of the opening of the ancient ceswick vault to receive the remains of the recently deceased lady the only territorial possession which remained to the ceswicks was their vault indeed as florence afterwards remarked to her sister there was a certain irony in the reflection that of all their wide acres there remained only the few square feet of soil which for centuries had covered the bones of the race when their aunt was dead and buried the two girls went back to the cottage and were very desolate they had both of them loved the old lady in their separate ways more especially florence both because she possessed the deeper nature of the two and because she had lived the longest with her but the grief of youth at the departure of age is not inconsolable and after a month or so they had conquered the worst of their sorrow then it was that the question what they were to do came prominently to the fore such little property as their aunt had possessed was equally divided between them and the cottage left to their joint use this gave them enough to live on in their quiet way but it undoubtedly left them in a very lonely and unprotected position such as it was however they or rather florence for she managed all the business decided to make the best of it at kesterwick at any rate they were known and it was they felt better to stay there than to float away and become waifs and strays on the great sea of english life so they settled to stay florence moreover had her own reasons for staying she had come to the conclusion that it would be desirable that her sister eva should marry mr plowden not that she liked mr plowden her ladys instincts rose up in rebellion against the man but if eva did not marry him it as probable that she would in the longrun marry ernest and ernest florence swore she should not marry to prevent such a marriage was the main purpose of her life her jealousy and hatred of her sister had become a part of herself the gratification of her revenge was the evil star by which she shaped her course it may seem a terrible thing that so young a woman could give the best energies of her life to such a purpose but it was none the less the truth hers was a wild strange nature a nature capable of violent love and violent hate the same pendulum could swing with equal ease to each extreme eva had robbed her of her lover she would rob eva and put the prize out of her reach too little she recked of the wickedness of her design for where in the long record of human suffering is there a wickedness to surpass the deliberate separation for no good reason of two people who love each other with all their hearts surely there is none she knew this but she did not hesitate on that account she was not hypocritical she made no excuses to herself she knew well that on every ground it was best that eva should marry ernest and pursue her natural destiny happy in his love and in her own but she would have none of it if once they should meet again the game would pass out of her hands for the weakest woman grows strong of purpose when she has her lovers arm to lean on florence realised this and determined that they should never set eyes on each other until an impassable barrier in the shape of mr plowden had been raised between the two having thus finally determined on the sacrifice she set about whetting the knife one day a month or so after miss ceswick was buried mr plowden called at the cottage on some of the endless details of which districtvisiting was the parent he had hardly seen eva since that nevertobeforgotten day when he had learned what jeremys ideas of a shaking were for the very good reason that she had carefully kept out of his way so it came to pass that when looking out of the window on the afternoon in question she saw the crown of a clerical hat coming along the road eva promptly gathered up her work and commenced a hasty retreat to her bedroom where are you going to eva asked her sister upstairs here he comes he who is he mr plowden of course and why should you run away because mr plowden is coming i do not like mr plowden really eva you are too bad you know what a friendless position we are in right now and you go and get up a dislike to one of the few men we know it is very selfish of you and most unreasonable at that moment the frontdoor bell rang and eva fled mr plowden on entering looked round the room with a somewhat disappointed air if you are looking for my sister said florence she is not very well indeed i am afraid that her health is not good she is so often indisposed florence smiled and they dropped into the districtvisiting presently however florence dropped out again by the way mr plowden i want to tell you of something i heard the other day and which concerns you indeed i think that it is only right that i should do so i heard that you were seen talking to my sister not very far from the titheburgh abbey cottages and that she she ran away from you then mr jones jumped over the wall and also began to talk with you presently he also turned and so said my informant you struck at him with a heavy stick but missed him thereupon a tussle ensued and you got the worst of it he irritated me beyond all endurance broke in mr plowden excitedly o then the story is true mr plowden saw that he had made a fatal mistake but it was too late to deny it to a certain extent he said sulkily that young ruffian told me that i was not a gentleman really of course that was unpleasant but how glad you must feel that you missed him especially as his back was turned it would have looked so bad for a clergyman to be had up for assault or worse wouldnt it mr plowden turned pale and bit his lip he began to feel that he was in the power of this quiet dignified young woman and the feeling was not pleasant and it would not look well if the story got round here would it i mean even if it was not known that you hit at him with the stick when he was not looking because you see it would seem so absurd mr plowden winced beneath her mockery and rising seized his hat but she motioned him back to his chair dont go yet she said i wanted to tell you that you ought to be much obliged to me for thinking of all this for you i thought that it would be painful for you to have the story all over the countryside so i nipped it in the bud mr plowden groaned in spirit if these were the results of a story nipped in the bud what would its uninjured bloom be like who told you he asked brusquely jones went away yes how glad you must be by the way that he is gone but it was not mr jones it was a person who oversaw the difference of opinion no never mind who it was i have found means to silence that person little did mr plowden guess that during the whole course of his lovescene and the subsequent affair with jeremy there had leaned gracefully in an angle of the sod wall not twenty yards away a figure uncommonly resembling that of an ancient mariner in an attitude of the most intense and solemn contemplation but so it was i am grateful to you miss ceswick thank you mr plowden it is refreshing to meet with true gratitude it is a scarce flower in this world but really i dont deserve any the observer who oversaw the painful scene between you and mr jones also oversaw a scene preceding it that so far as i can gather seems to have been hardly less painful in its way mr plowden coloured but said nothing now you see mr plowden i am left in a rather peculiar position as regards my sister she is younger than i am and has always been accustomed to look up to me so as you will easily understand i feel my responsibilities to weigh upon me consequently i feel bound to ask you what i am to understand from the report of my informant simply this miss ceswick i proposed to your sister and she refused me indeed you were unfortunate that afternoon miss ceswick went on mr plowden after a pause if i could find means to induce your sister to change her verdict would my suit have your support florence raised her piercing eyes from her work and for a second fixed them on the clergymans face that depends mr plowden i am well off he went on eagerly and i will tell you a secret i have bought the advowson of this living i happened to hear that it was going and got it at a bargain i dont think that halfords life is worth five years purchase why do you want to marry eva mr plowden asked florence ignoring this piece of information you are not in love with her in love no miss ceswick i dont think that sensible men fall in love they leave that to boys and women oh then why do you want to marry eva it will be best to tell me frankly mr plowden he hesitated and then came to the conclusion that with a person of florences penetration frankness was the best game well as you must know your sister is an extraordinarily beautiful woman and would therefore form a desirable addition to your establishment precisely said mr plowden also he went on she is a distinguishedlooking woman and quite the lady florence shuddered at the phrase and would therefore give you social status mr plowden yes she is also sprung from an ancient family florence smiled and looked at mr plowden with an air that said more plainly than any words which you clearly are not in short i am anxious to get married and i admire your sister eva more than anybody i ever saw all of which are very satisfactory reasons mr plowden all you have to do is convince my sister of the many advantages you have to offer her and to win her affections ah miss ceswick that is just the point she told me that her affections were already irredeemably engaged and that she had none to give if only i have the opportunity however i shall hope to be able to outdistance my rival florence looked at him scrutinisingly as she answered you do not know ernest kershaw or you would not be so confident why am i not as good as this ernest he asked for florences remark identical as it was with that of jeremy wounded his vanity intensely well mr plowden i do not want to be rude but it is impossible for me to conceive a womans affections being won away from ernest kershaw by you you are so very different if mr plowden wanted a straightforward answer he had certainly got it for some moments he sat in sulky silence and then he said i suppose if that is the case there is nothing to be done i never said that women are frequently married whose affections are very much engaged elsewhere you know how they win their wives in savage countries mr plowden they catch them marriage by capture is one of the oldest institutions in the world well well the same institution still obtains in england only we dont call it by that name do you suppose that no women are hunted down nowadays ah very many are the wouldbe husband heads the pack and all the loving relatives swell its cry you mean that your sister can be hunted down he said bluntly i i mean nothing except that the persistent suitor on the spot often has a better chance than the lover at a distance however dear he may be then mr plowden took his leave florence watched him walking down the gardenpath i am glad jeremy shook you soundly she said aloud poor eva chapter vi mr plowden goes awooing mr plowden was not a suitor to let the grass grow under his feet as he once took the trouble to explain to florence he considered that there was nothing like boldness in wooing and he acted up to his convictions possessing no more delicacy of feeling than a bullelephant and as much consideration for the lady as the elephant has for a lily it tramples underfoot figuratively speaking he charged at eva every time he saw her he laid wait for her round corners and asked her to marry him he dropped in on her at odd hours and insisted upon her marrying him it was quite useless for her to say no no no or to appeal to his better feelings or compassion for he had none he simply would not listen to her but encouraged thereto by the moral support which he had received from florence he crushed the poor girl with his amorous eloquence it was a merry chase that florence sat and watched with a dark smile on her scornful lip in vain did the poor white doe dash along at her best speed the great black hound was ever at her flank and each time she turned came bounding at her throat this idea of a chase and a hound and a doe took such a strong possession of florences saturnine imagination that she actually made a drawing of it for she was a clever artist and not without training throwing by a few strokes of her pencil a perfect likeness of mr plowden into the fierce features of the hound the doe she drew with evas dark eyes and when she had done them there was such agony in her tortured gaze that she could not bear to look at them and tore the picture up one day florence came in and found her sister weeping well eva what is it now she asked contemptuously mr plowden sobbed eva oh mr plowden again well my dear if you will be so beautiful and encourage men you must take the consequences i never encouraged mr plowden nonsense eva you will not get me to believe that if you did not encourage him he would not go on making love to you gentlemen are not fond of being snubbed mr plowden is not a gentleman exclaimed eva what makes you say that because a gentleman would not persecute one as he does he will not take no for an answer and today he kissed my hand i tried to get it away from him but i could not oh i hate him i tell you what it is eva i have no patience with you and your fancies mr plowden is a very respectable man he is a clergyman and well off altogether quite the sort of man to marry ah ernest i am sick of ernest if he wanted to marry you he should not go shooting people and then running off to south africa he was all very well to flirt with while he was here now he has made a fool of himself and gone and there is an end of him but florence i love ernest i think i love him more dearly every day and i detest mr plowden very likely i dont ask you to love mr plowden i ask you to marry him what have love and marriage got to do with each other i should like to know if people were always to marry the people they loved things would soon get into a pretty mess look here eva as you know i do not often obtrude myself or my interests but i think that i have a right to be considered a little in this matter you have now got an opportunity of making a home for both of us there is nothing against mr plowden why should you not marry him as well as anybody else of course if you choose to sacrifice your own ultimate happiness and the comfort of us both to a silly whim i cannot prevent you you are your own mistress only i beg you to disabuse your mind of the idea that you could not be happy with mr plowden because you happen to fancy yourself in love with ernest why in six months you will have forgotten all about him but i dont want to forget about him i daresay not that is your abominable egotism again but whether you want to or not you will in a year or two when you have your own interests and your children florence you may talk to midnight if you like but once and for all i will not marry mr plowden and she swept out of the room in her stately way florence laughed softly to herself as she said after her oh yes you will eva i shall be pinning a brides veil on to that pretty head of yours before you are six months older my dear florence was quite right it was only a question of time and cunningly applied pressure eva yielded at last but there is no need for us to follow the hateful story through its various stages if by chance any of the readers of this history are curious about them let them go and study from the life such cases exist around them and so far as the victims are concerned there is a painful monotony in the development of their details and their conclusion and so it came to pass that one afternoon in the early summer florence coming in from walking found mr plowden and her sister together in the little drawingroom the latter was very pale and shrinking with scared eyes and trembling limbs up against the mantelpiece near which she was standing the former looking big and vulgar was standing over her and trying to take her hand congratulate me miss florence he said eva has promised to be mine has she said florence coldly how glad you must be that mr jones is out of the way it was not a kind speech but the fact was that there were few people in the world for whom florence had such a complete contempt or whom she regarded with such intense dislike as she did mr plowden the mere presence of the man irritated her beyond all bearing he was an instrument suited to her purposes so she used him but she could find it in her heart to regret that the instrument was not more pleasant to handle mr plowden turned pale at her taunt and even in the midst of her fear and misery eva smiled and thought to herself that it was lucky for her hateful lover that somebody else was out of the way poor eva poor eva you think to yourself my reader there was nothing poor about her she was weak she was wicked and contemptible oh pause awhile before you say so remember that circumstances were against her remember that the ideas of duty and of gain drilled into her breast and the breasts of her ancestresses from generation to generation and fated as often as not to prove more of a bane than a blessing were against her remember that her sisters everpresent influence overshadowed her and that her suitors vulgar vitality crushed her to the ground yet with it all she was weak you say well she was weak as weak as you must expect some women to be after centuries of custom have bred weakness into their very nature why are women weak because men have made them so because the law that was framed by men and the public opinion which it has been their privilege to direct have from age to age drilled into women the belief in which it must be admitted they for the most part readily acquiesce that they are chattels to be owned and played with existing for mans pleasure and the gratification of his passion because men have systematically stunted their mental grown and denied them their natural rights and that equality which is theirs weak women have become weak because weakness is the passport to the favour of our sex they have become foolish because education has been withheld from them and ability discouraged they have become frivolous because frivolity has been declared to be the natural mission of women there is no male simpleton who does not like to find a bigger simpleton than he is to lord it over truly the triumph of the stronger sex has been complete for it has even succeeded in enlisting its victims to its service the great instruments in the suppression of women and in their retention at their present level are women themselves and yet let us be for a minute just which is the superior of the two the woman or the man in strength we have the advantage but in intellect she is almost our equal if only we will give her fairplay and in purity in tenderness in longsuffering in fidelity in all the christian virtues which is the superior in these things oh man whoever you are think of your mother and your sisters think of her who nursed you in sickness of her who stood by you in trouble when all others would have none of you and then answer poor eva yes give her all your pity but if you can purge it of your contempt it requires that a woman should possess a mind of unusual robustness to stand out against circumstances such as hemmed her in and this she did not possess nature which had showered physical gifts upon her with such a lavish hand had not given her that most useful of all gifts the power of selfdefence she was made to yield but this was her only if an absolutely fatal fault for the rest she was pure as the mountain snow and with a heart of gold herself incapable of deceit it never occurred to her to imagine it in others she never suspected that florence could have a motive in her advocacy of mr plowdens cause on the contrary she was possessed to the full with that idea of duty and selfsacrifice which in some women amounts almost to madness the notion so cleverly started by florence that she was bound to take this opportunity of giving her sister a home and the permanent protection of a brotherinlaw had taken a firm hold of her mind as for the cruel wrong and injustice which her marriage with mr plowden would work to ernest strange though it may seem as is usual in such cases it never occurred to her to consider the matter in that light she knew what her own sufferings were and always must be she thought that she would rather die than be false to ernest but somehow she never looked at the other side of the picture never considered the matter from ernests point of view after the true womanly fashion she was prepared to throw herself under her juggernaut called duty and let her inner life the life of her heart be crushed out of her but she never thought of the other life which was welded with her own and which must be crushed too how curious it is that when women talk so much of their duties they often think so little of the higher duty which they owe to the unlucky man whose love they have won and whom they cherish in their misguided hearts the only feasible explanation of the mystery outside of that of innate selfishness is that one of the ideas which has been persistently drilled into the female breast is that men have not any real feelings it is vaguely supposed that they will get over it however this may be when a woman decides to do violence to her natural feelings and because of pressure or profit contracts herself into an unholy marriage the lover whom she deserts is generally the last person to be considered poor wretch he will no doubt get over it fortunately many do chapter vii over the water mr alston and ernest carried out their plans as regarded sport they went up to lydenburg and had a months vilderbeeste and blesbok shooting within three days trek with an oxwaggon from that curious little town the style of life was quite new to ernest and he enjoyed it much they owned an oxwaggon and a span of sixteen salted oxen that is oxen which will not die of lungsickness and in this lumbering vehicle they travelled about wherever fancy or the presence of buck took them mr alston and his boy roger slept in the waggon and ernest in a little tent which was pitched every night alongside and never did he sleep sounder there was a freshness and freedom about the life which charmed him it is pleasant after the days shooting or travelling to partake of a hearty meal of which the piиce de rйsistance generally consists of a stew compounded indiscriminately of vilderbeeste beef bustard partridges snipe rice and compressed vegetables a dish by the way which is if properly cooked fit to set before a king then comes the pipe or rather a succession of pipes and the talk over the days sport and the effect of that long shot and the huntingyarn of which it reminds me and after the yarn the wellknown square bottle is produced and the tin pannikins out of which you have been drinking tea are sent to the spring down in the hollow to be washed by the zulu voorlooper who objects to going because of the spooks ghosts which he is credibly informed inhabit that hollow and you indulge in your evening tot and smoke your pipes and talk or ruminate as the fancy takes you at last comes the splendid african moon like a radiant queen rising from a throne of inky cloud flooding the whole wide veld with mysterious light and reveals the long lines of game slowly travelling to their feedinggrounds along the ridges of the rolling plain well one more drop and so to bed having come to the admirable decision so easy to make overnight so hard to adhere to when the time comes to trek from the yoke at dawn having undressed yourself outside the tent all except the flannel shirt in which you are going to sleep for there is no room to do so inside you stow your clothes and boots away under your mackintosh sheet for clothes wet through with dew are unpleasant to wear before the sun is up creep on your hands and knees into your little tenement and wriggle between the blankets for awhile perhaps you lie so your pipe still between your lips gazing up through the opening of the little tent at two bright particular stars shining in the blue depths above or watching the waving of the tall tamboukigrass as the nightwind goes sighing through it behold the cold far stars draw near grow warm with life and change to evas eyes if unluckily you have an eva and the yellow tamboukigrass is her waving hair and the sad whispering of the wind her voice which speaks and tells you that she has come from far across the great seas to tell you that she loves you to lull you to your rest what was it that frightened her so soon the rattling of chains and the deep lowing of the oxen rising to be ready for the dawn it has not come yet but it is not far off see the grey light begins to gleam upon the oxens horns and far away there in the east the grey is streaked with primrose away with dreams and up to pull the shivering kafirs from their snug lair beneath the waggon and to give the good nags which must gallop vilderbeeste all today a double handful of mealies before you start ah neuyaktrek the great waggon strains and starts and presently the glorious sun comes up and you eat a crust of bread as you sit on the waggonbox and wash it down with a mouthful of spirit and feel that it is a splendid thing to get up early then about halfpast eight comes the halt for breakfast and the welcome tub in the clear spring that you have been making for and after breakfast saddle up the nags take your bearings by the kopjй and off after that great herd of vilderbeeste so my reader day adds itself to day and each day will find you healthier happier and stronger than the last no letters no newspapers no duns no women and no babies think of the joy of it effete caucasian then go buy an oxwaggon and do likewise after a month of this life mr alston came to the conclusion that there would now be no danger in descending into the low country towards delagoa bay in search of large game accordingly having added to their party another wouldbe nimrod a gentleman just arrived from england in search of sport they started for the first month or so things went very well with them they killed a good quantity of buffalo koodoo eland and waterbuck also two giraffes but to ernests great disappointment did not come across any rhinoceros and only got a shot at one lion which he missed though there were plenty round them but soon the luck turned first their horses died of the terrible scourge of all this part of south africa the horsesickness they had given large prices for them about seventy pounds each as salted animals that is animals that having already had the sickness and recovered from it were supposed to be proof against its attacks still they died one after another this was only the beginning of evils the day after the last horse died the companion who had joined them at lydenburg was taken ill of the fever mr jeffries for that was his name was a very reserved english gentleman of good fortune something over thirty years of age like most people who came into close relationship with ernest he had taken a considerable fancy to him and the two were comparatively speaking intimate during the first stages of his fever ernest nursed him like a brother and was at length rewarded by seeing him in a fair way to recovery on one unlucky day however mr alston and ernest went out to try and shoot a buck as they were short of meat leaving the camp in charge of the boy roger for a long while they could find no game but at last ernest came across a fine bulleland standing rubbing himself against a mimosa thorntree a shot from his express planted well behind the shoulder brought the noble beast down quite dead and having laden the two kafirs with them with the tongue liver and as much of the best meat as they could carry they started back for camp meanwhile one of the sudden and tremendous thunderstorms peculiar to south africa came swiftly up against the wind heralding its arrival by a blast of icecold air and presently they were staggering along in the teeth of a fearful tempest the whole sky was lurid with lightning the hills echoed with the continuous roll of thunder and the rain came down in sheets in the thick of it all exhausted bewildered and wet to the skin they reached the camp there a sad sight awaited them in front of the tent which served as a hospital for jeffries was a large antheap and on this antheap clad in nothing but a flannel shirt sat jeffries himself the rain was beating on his bare head and emaciated face and the icecold breeze was tossing his dripping hair one hand he kept raising to the sky to let the cold water fall upon it the other the boy roger held and by it vainly attempted to drag him back to the tent but jeffries was a man of large build and the little lad might as well have tried to drag an ox isnt it glorious shouted the delirious man as they came up ive got cool at last yes and you will soon be cold poor fellow muttered mr alston as they hurried up they got him back into the tent and in half an hour he was beyond all hope he did not rave much but kept repeating a single word in every possible tone that word was alice at dawn on the following morning he died with it on his lips ernest often wondered afterwards who alice could be next day they dug a deep grave under an ancient thorntree and reverently laid him to his rest on his breast they piled great stones to keep away the jackals filling in the cracks with earth then they left him to his sleep it is a sad task that burying a comrade in the lonely wilderness as they were approaching the waggon again little roger sobbing bitterly for mr jeffries had been very kind to him and a first experience of death is dreadful to the young they met the zulu voorlooper a lad called jim who had been out all day watching the cattle as they grazed he saluted mr alston after the zulu fashion by lifting the right arm and saying the word inkoos then stood still well what is it boy asked mr alston have you lost the oxen no inkoos the oxen are safe at the yoke it is this when i was sitting on the kopjй yonder watching that the oxen of the inkoos should not stray an intombi young girl from the kraal under the mountain yonder came to me she is the daughter of a zulu mother who fell into the hands of a basuto dog and my halfcousin well inkoos i have met this girl before i have met her when i have been sent to buy maas buttermilk at the kraal good inkoos the girl came to bring heavy news such as will press upon your heart secocoeni chief of the bapedi who lives over yonder under the blue mountains has declared war against the boers i hear sikukuni wants rifles for his men such as the boers use he has heard of the inkosis hunting here tonight he will send an impi to kill the inkosis and take their guns these are the words of the intombi yes inkoos these are her very words she was sitting outside the hut grinding imphi kafir corn for beer when she heard secocoenis messenger order her father to call the men together to kill us tonight i hear at what time of the night was the killing to be at the first break of dawn so that they may have light to take the waggon away by good we shall escape them the moon will be up in an hour and we can trek away the lads face fell alas he said it is impossible there is a spy watching the camp now he is up there among the rocks i saw him as i brought the oxen home if we move he will report it and we shall be overtaken in an hour mr alston thought for a moment and then made up his mind with the rapidity that characterises men who spend their lives in dealing with savage races mazooku he called to a zulu who was sitting smoking by the camp fire a man whom ernest had hired as his particular servant the man rose and came to him and saluted he was not a very tall man but standing there nude except for the moocha round his centre his proportions especially those of the chest and the lower limbs looked gigantic he had been a soldier in one of cetywayos regiments but having been so indiscreet as to break through some of the zulu marriage laws had been forced to fly for refuge to natal where he had become a groom and picked up a peculiar language which he called english even among a people where all the men are fearless he bore a reputation for bravery leaving him standing awhile mr alston rapidly explained the state of the case to ernest and what he proposed to do then turning he addressed the zulu mazooku the inkoos here your master whom you black people have named mazimba tells me that he thinks you a brave man the zulus handsome face expanded into a smile that was positively alarming in its extent he says that you told him that when you were cetywayos man in the undi regiment you once killed four basutos who set upon you together mazooku lifted his right arm and saluted by way of answer and then glanced slightly at the assegaiwounds on his chest well i tell your master that i do not believe you it is a lie you speak to him you ran away from cetywayo because you did not like to fight and be killed as the kings ox as a brave man should the zulu coloured up under his dusky skin and again glanced at his wounds oww he said bah there is no need for you to look at those scratches they were left by womens nails you are nothing but a woman silence who told you to speak if you are not a woman show it there is an armed basuto among those rocks he watches us your master cannot eat and sleep in peace when he is watched take that big stabbing assegai you are so fond of showing and kill him or die a coward he must make no sound remember mazooku turned towards ernest for confirmation of the order a zulu always likes to take his orders straight from his own chief mr alston noticed it and added i am the inkoosis mouth and speak his words mazooku saluted again and turning went to the waggon to fetch his assegai tread softly or you will wake him and he will run from so great a man mr alston called after him sarcastically i go among the rocks to seek mouti medicine the zulu answered with a smile we are in a serious mess my boy said mr alston to ernest and it is a tossup if we get out of it i taunted that fellow so that there may be no mistake about the spy he must be killed and mazooku would rather die himself than not kill him now would it not have been safer to send another man with him yes but i was afraid that if the scout saw two men coming towards him he would make off however innocent they might look our horses are dead and if that fellow escapes we shall never get out of this place alive it would be folly to expect basutos to distinguish between boers and englishmen when their blood is up and besides secocoeni has sent orders that we are to be killed and they would not dare to disobey look there goes mr mazooku with an assegai as big as a fireshovel the kopjй or stony hill where the spy was hid was about three hundred yards from the little hollow in which the camp was formed and across the stretch of bushy plain between the two mazooku was quietly strolling his assegai in one hand and two long sticks in the other presently he vanished into the shadow for the sun was setting rapidly after what seemed a long pause to ernest who was watching his movements through a pair of fieldglasses he reappeared walking along the shoulder of the hill right against the skyline his eyes fixed upon the ground as though he were searching among the crevices of the rocks for the medical herbs which zulus prize all of a sudden ernest saw the stalwart form straighten itself and spring down into a dip which hid it from sight with the assegai in its hand raised to the level of its head then came a pause lasting perhaps for twenty seconds on the farther side of the dip was a large flat rock which was straight in a line with the fiery ball of the setting sun suddenly a tall figure sprang up out of the hollow on to this rock followed by another figure in whom ernest recognised mazooku for a moment the two men looking from their position like people afire struggled together on the top of the flat stone and ernest could clearly distinguish the quick flash of their spears as they struck at each other then they vanished together over the edge of the stone by jove said ernest who was trembling with excitement i wonder how it has ended we shall know presently answered mr alston coolly at any rate the die is cast one way or another and we may as well make a bolt for it now you zulus down with those tents and get the oxen inspanned and look quick about it if you dont want a basuto assegai to send you to join the spirit of chaka the voorlooper had by this time communicated his alarming intelligence to the driver and other kafirs and mr alstons exhortation to look sharp was quite unnecessary ernest never saw camp struck or oxen inspanned with such rapidity before but before the first tent was fairly down they were all enormously relieved to see mazooku coming trotting cheerfully across the plain droning a little zulu song as he ran his appearance however was by no means cheerful for he was perfectly drenched with blood some of it flowing from a wound in his left shoulder and the rest till recently the personal property of somebody else arrived in front of where mr alston and ernest were standing he raised his broad assegai which was still dripping blood and saluted i hear said mr alston i have done the inkoosi mazimbas bidding there were two of them the first i killed easily in the hollow but the other a very big man fought well for a basuto they are dead and i threw them into a hole that their brothers might not find them easily good go wash yourself and get your masters things into the waggon stop let me sew up that cut how came you to be so awkward as to get touched by a basuto inkoos he was very quick with his spear and he fought like a cat mr alston did not reply but taking a stout needle and some silk from a little housewife he carried in his pocket he quickly stitched up the assegaigash which fortunately was not deep mazooku stood without flinching till the job was finished and then retired to wash himself at the spring the short twilight faded rapidly into darkness or rather into what would have been darkness had it not been for the halfgrown moon which was to serve to light them on their path then a large fire having been lit on the site of the camp to make it appear as though it were still pitched there the order was given to start the oxen obedient to the voice of the driver strained at the trektow the waggon creaked and jolted and they began their long flight for life the order of march was as follows two hundred yards ahead of the waggon walked a kafir with strict orders to keep his eyes very wide open indeed and report in the best way possible under the circumstances if he detected any signs of an ambush at the head of the long line of cattle leading the two front oxen by a reim or strip of buffalohide was the zulu boy jim to whose timely discovery they owed their lives and by the side of the waggon the driver a cape hottentot plodded along in fear and trembling on the waggonbox itself each with a winchester repeating rifle on his knees and keeping a sharp lookout into the shadows sat mr alston and ernest in the hinder part of the waggon also armed with a rifle and keeping a keen lookout sat mazooku the other servants marched alongside and the boy roger was asleep inside on the cartle or hide bed so they travelled on hour after hour now they bumped down terrific hills strewn with boulders which would have smashed anything less solid than an african oxwaggon to splinters now they crept along a dark valley that looked spiritual and solemn in the moonlight expecting to see secocoenis impi emerge from every clump of bush and now again they waded through mountainsteams at last about midnight they reached a plain dividing two stretches of mountainous country and here they halted for a while to give the oxen which were fortunately in good condition and fat after their long rest a short breathingtime then on again through the long quiet night on still on till the dawn found them the other side of the wide plain at the foot of the mountainrange here they rested for two hours and let the oxen fill themselves with the lush grass they had travelled thirty miles since the yokes were put upon their necks not far according to our way of journeying but very far for cumbersome oxen over an almost impassable country as soon as the sun was well up they inspanned again and hurried forwards bethinking them of the basuto horde who would now be pressing on their spoor on with brief halt through all that day and the greater part of the following night till the cattle began to fall down in the yokes till at last they crossed the boundary and were in transvaal territory when dawn broke mr alston took the glasses and examined the track over which they had fled there was nothing to be seen except a great herd of hartebeest i think that we are safe now he said at last and thank god for it do you know what those basuto devils would have done if they had caught us what they would have skinned us and made our hearts and livers into mouti medicine and eaten them to give them the courage of the white man by jove said ernest chapter viii a homeric combat when mr alston and ernest found themselves safe upon transvaal soil they determined to give up the idea of following any more big game for the present and to content themselves with the comparatively humble vilderbeeste blesbok springbok and other small antelopes the plan they pursued was to slowly journey from one point of the country to another stopping wherever they found the buck particularly plentiful in this way they got excellent sport and spent several months very agreeably with the further advantage that ernest obtained considerable knowledge of the country and its inhabitants the boers it was a wild rough life that they led but by no means a lowering one the continual contact with nature in all her moods and in her wildest shapes to a man of impressionable mind like ernest was an education in itself his mind absorbed something of the greatness round him and seemed to grow wider and deeper during those months of lonely travel the long struggle too with the hundred difficulties which arise in waggonjourneys and the quickness of decision necessary to avoid danger or discomfort in such a mode of life were of great service to him in shaping his character nor was he left without suitable society for in his companion he found a friend for whose talents and intelligence he had the highest respect mr alston was a very quiet individual he never said a thing unless he had first considered it in all its bearings but when he did say it it was always well worth hearing he was a man who had spent his life in the closest observation of human nature in the rough now you my reader may think that there is a considerable difference between human nature in the rough as exemplified by a zulu warrior stalking out of his kraal in a kaross and brandishing an assegai and yourself say strolling up the steps of your club in a frockcoat and twirling one of briggs umbrellas but as a matter of fact the difference is of a most superficial character bearing the same proportion to the common substance that the furniture polish does to the table scratch the polish and there you have best raw zulu human nature indeed to anybody who has taken the trouble to study the question it is simply absurd to observe how powerless high civilisation has been to do anything more than veneer that raw material which remains identical in each case to return the result of mr alstons observations had been to make him an extremely shrewd companion and an excellent judge of men and their affairs there were few subjects which he had not quietly considered during all the years that he had been trading or shooting or serving the government in one capacity or another and ernest was astonished to find although he had only spent some four months of his life in england how intimate was his knowledge of the state of political parties of the great social questions of the day and even of matters connected with literature and art it is not too much to say that it was from mr alston that ernest imbibed principles on all these subjects which he never deserted in afterlife and that subsequent experience proved to be for the most part sound thus between shooting and philosophical discussion the time passed on pleasantly enough till at length they drew near to pretoria the capital of the transvaal where they had decided to rest the oxen for a month or two before making arrangements for a real biggame excursion up towards central africa they struck into the pretoria road just above a town called heidelberg about sixty miles from the former place and proceeded by easy stages towards their destination as they went on they generally found it convenient to outspan at spots which it was evident had been used for the same purpose by some waggon that was travelling one stage ahead of them so frequently did this happen that during their first five or six outspans they were able on no less than three occasions to avail themselves of the dying fires of their predecessors camp this was a matter of lively interest to ernest who always did cook and a very good cook he became one of the great bothers of south african travelling is the fire question indeed how to make sufficient fire to boil a kettle when you have no fuel to make it of is the great question of south african travel a readymade fire is therefore peculiarly acceptable and for the last halfhour of the trek was ernest always in a great state of expectation as to whether the waggon before them had or had not been considerate enough to leave theirs burning thus it came to pass that one morning when they were about fifteen miles from pretoria which they expected to reach the same evening and the waggon was slowly drawing up to the outspanplace ernest accompanied by mazooku who lounged after him like a black shadow ran forward to see if their predecessors had or had not been considerate in this instance energy was rewarded for the fire was still burning hoorah said ernest get the sticks mazooku and go and fill the kettle by jove theres a knife there was a knife a manybladed knife with a buckhorn handle and a corkscrew in it left by the dying fire ernest took it up and looked at it somehow it seemed familiar to him he turned it round examined the silver plate upon it and suddenly started what is the matter ernest said mr alston who had joined them look here he answered pointing to two initials on the knife well i see some fellow has left his knife so much the better for the finder you have heard me speak of my friend jeremy that is his knife i gave it to him years ago look j j nonsense it is some knife like it i have seen hundreds of that make i believe that it is the same he must be here mr alston shrugged his shoulders not probable he said ernest made no answer he stood staring at the knife have you written to your people lately ernest no the last letter i wrote was down there in secocoenis country you remember i sent it by the basuto who was going to lydenburg just before jeffries died like enough he never got to lydenburg he would not have dared to go to lydenburg after the war broke out you should write i mean to from pretoria but somehow i have had no heart for writing nothing more was said about the matter and ernest put the knife into his pocket that evening they trekked down through the poort that commands the most charming view of the south african towns and on the plain below pretoria bathed in the bright glow of the evening sunshine smiled its welcome to them mr alston who knew the town determined to trek straight through it and outspan the waggon on the farther side where he thought there would be better grazing for the cattle accordingly they rumbled on past the gaol past the pleasant white building which was at that moment occupied by the english special commissioner and his staff about whose doings all sorts of rumours had reached them during their journey and on to the marketsquare this area was at the moment crowded with boer waggons whose owners had trekked in to celebrate their nachtmaal communion of which it is their habit in company with their wives and children to partake four times a year the volksraad or local parliament was also in special session to consider the proposals made to it on behalf of the imperial government so that the little town was positively choked with visitors the road down which they were passing ran past the buildings used as government offices and between this and the dutch church a considerable crowd was gathered which to judge from the shouts and volleys of oaths dutch and english that proceeded from it was working itself up into a state of excitement hold on shouted ernest to the voorlooper and then turning to mr alston there is a jolly row going on there let us go and see what it is all right my boy where the fighting is there will the englishmen be gathered together and they climbed down off the waggon and made for the crowd the row was this among the boers assembled for the nachtmaal festival was a wellknown giant of the name of van zyl this mans strength was a matter of public notoriety all over the country and many were the feats which were told of him among others it was said that he could bear the weight of the afterpart of an african buck waggon on his shoulders with a load of three thousand pounds of corn upon it while the wheels were greased he stood about six feet seven high weighed eighteen stone and a half and had a double row of teeth on the evening in question this remarkable specimen of humanity was sitting on his waggonbox with a pipe of which the size was proportionate to his own clinched firmly between his double row of teeth about ten paces of him stood a young englishman also of large size though he looked quite small beside the giant who was contemplating the phenomenon on the waggonbox and wondering how many inches he measured round the chest that young englishman had just descended from a newlyarrived waggon and his name was jeremy jones to these advances a cringing hottentot boy of small size the hottentot is evidently the servant or slave of the giant and a man standing by jeremy who understands dutch informs him that he is telling his master than an ox has strayed slowly the giant rouses himself and descending from the waggonbox seizes the trembling tottie with one hand and taking a reim of buffalohide lashes him to the waggonwheel now remarked jeremys acquaintance you will see how a boer deals with a nigger you dont mean to say that great brute is going to beat that poor little devil just then a small fat woman put her head out of a tent pitched by the waggon and inquired what the matter was she was the giants wife on being informed of the straying of the ox her wrath knew no bounds slaat em slaat de swartsel thrash him thrash the black creature she cried out in a shrill voice running to the waggon and with her own fair hands drawing out a huge sjambock that is a strip of prepared hippopotamushide used to drive the afteroxen with and giving it to her spouse cut the liver out of the black devil she went on but mind you dont hit his head or he wont be able to go to work afterwards never mind about making the blood come i have got lots of salt to rub in her harangue and the sight of the hottentot tied to the wheel had by this time attracted quite a crowd of boers and englishmen who were idling about the marketsquare softly vrouw softly i will thrash enough to satisfy even you and we all know that must be very hard where a black creature is in question a roar of laughter from the dutch people round greeted this sally of wit and the giant taking the sjambock with a goodhumoured smile for like most giants he was easytempered by nature lifted it whirled his great arm as thick as the leg of an average man round his head and brought the whip down on the back of the miserable hottentot the poor wretch yelled with pain and no wonder for the greasy old shirt he wore was divided clean in two together with the skin beneath it and the blood was pouring from the gash allamachter dat is een lecker slaat almighty that was a nice one said the old woman at which the crowd laughed again but there was one man who did not laugh and that man was jeremy on the contrary his clear eyes flashed and his brown cheek burned with indignation nor did he stop at that stepping forward he placed himself between the giant and the howling hottentot and said to the former in the most nervous english you are a damned coward the boer stared at him and smiled and then turning asked what the english fellow was saying somebody translated jeremys remark whereupon the boer who was not a badnatured fellow smiled again and remarked that jeremy must be madder than the majority of accursed englishmen then he turned to continue thrashing the hottentot but lo the mad englishman was still there this put the dutchman out footsack carl ik is van zyl get out fellow i am van zyl this was interpreted to jeremy by the bystanders all right and tell him that i am jones a name he may have heard before was the reply what does this brainsick fellow want shouted the giant jeremy explained that he wanted him to stop his brutality and what will the little man do if i refuse i shall try to make you was the answer this remark was received with a shout of laughter from the crowd which had now collected in which the giant joined very heartily when it was interpreted to him giving jeremy a shove to one side he again lifted the great sjambock with the purpose of bringing it down on the hottentot another second and jeremy had snatched the whip from his hand and sent it flying fifty yards away then realising that his antagonist was really in earnest the great dutchman solemnly set himself to crush him doubling a fist which was the size of a welsh leg of mutton he struck with all his strength straight at the englishmans head had the blow caught jeremy it would in all probability have killed him but he was a practised boxer and without moving his body he swung his head to one side the boers fist passed him harmlessly and striking the panel of the waggon went clean through it next instant several of the giants double row of teeth were rolling loose in his mouth jeremy had returned the stroke by a righthander into which he put all his power and which would have knocked any other man backwards a great shout from the assembled englishmen followed this blow and a countershout from the crowd of dutchmen who pointed triumphantly to the hole in the stout yellowwood panel made by their champions fist and asked who the madman was who dared to stand against him the boer turned and spat out some of his superfluous teeth and at the same instant a young englishman came and caught hold of jeremy by the arm for heavens sake my dear fellow be careful that man will kill you he is the strongest fellow in the transvaal you are a fellow to be proud of though he may try said jeremy laconically stripping off his coat and waistcoat will you hold these for me hold them answered the young fellow who was a good sort ay that i will and i would give half i have to see you lick him i saw him stun an ox once with a blow of his fist jeremy smiled stop he said ask that miserable coward if i best him if he will let off that miserable beggar and he pointed to the trembling hottentot the question was put and the great man answered yah yah i will make you a present of him ironically and then expressed his intention of knocking jeremy into small pieces in the course of the next two minutes then they faced one another the giant was a trifle over six feet seven high jeremy was a trifle under six feet two and a half and looked short beside him but one or two critical observers looking at the latter now that he was stripped for the encounter shrewdly guessed that the dutchman would have his work cut out jeremy did not it is true scale more than fourteen stone six but his proportions were perfect the great deep chest the brawny arms not very large but a mass of muscle the short strong neck the quick eye and massive leg all bespoke the strength of a young hercules it was evident too that though he was so young and not yet come to his full power he was in the most perfect training the boer on the other hand was enormous but his flesh was somewhat soft still knowing his feats the englishmen present sighed for their champion feeling that he had no chance for a moment they stood facing each other then jeremy made a feint and getting in planted a heavy blow with his left hand on his adversarys chest but he was to pay for it for the next second the dutchman got in his right hand and jeremy was lifted clean off his feet and sent flying backwards among the crowd the boers cheered the giant smiled and the englishmen looked sad they knew how it would be but jeremy picked himself up little the worse the stroke had struck the muscles of his chest and had not hurt him greatly as he advanced the gradually increasing crowd of englishmen cheered him warmly and he swore in his heart that he would justify those cheers or die for it it was at this juncture that ernest and mr alston came up good heavens exclaimed the former it is jeremy mr alston took in the situation at a glance dont let him see you you will put him off he said get behind me ernest obeyed overwhelmed mr alston shook his head he recognised that jeremy had a poor chance but he did not say so to ernest meanwhile jeremy came up and faced the dutchman encouraged by his late success presently his adversary struck a tremendous blow at him jeremy dodged and next instant succeeded in landing such a fearful right and left full on the giants face that the latter went reeling backwards a yell of frantic excitement arose from the english portion of the crowd this was indeed a david the dutchman soon recovered however and rendered more cautious in his turn kept out of jeremys reach trying to strike him down from a distance for a round or two no important blow was struck till at last a brilliant idea took possession of the young fellow who had charge of jeremys coat hit him about the body he whispered hes soft jeremy took the advice and next round succeeded in getting in two or three blows straight from the shoulder every one of which bruised the boers huge body sadly and made him rather short of wind next round he repeated the same tactics receiving himself a stroke on the shoulder from van zyls right hand that for a moment rendered his left arm helpless before another second was over however jeremy had his revenge and the blood was pouring from his adversarys lips now the popular excitement on both sides grew intense for to the interest attaching to the encounter was added that of national feeling which was then at a high state of tension englishmen dutchmen and a mob of kafirs yelled and shouted and each of the former two felt that the honour of his people was on the issue and yet it was an unequal fight i believe that your friend will be a match for van zyl said mr alston coolly but the flash of his eye belied his coolness and i tell you what hes a devilish fine fellow too at that moment however an untoward thing happened the giant struck out his strongest and jeremy could not succeed in entirely warding off the blow though he broke its force crashing through his guard it struck him on the forehead and for a moment he dropped senseless his second rushed up and dashed some water over him and in another instant he was on his legs again but for the rest of that round he contented himself with dodging his adversarys attack at which the dutchmen cheered thinking that his iron strength was broken but presently when for the sixth time jeremy came up with the same quiet look of determination in his eyes and except for the gaping of the nostrils and the twitching of the lip showed a certain measure of distress looking but little the worse they turned with anxiety to examine the condition of the giant it was not very promising he was perspiring profusely and his enormous chest rose and fell in jerks wherever jeremys strokes had fallen also a great blue bruise had risen on his flesh it was evident that his condition was the worse of the two but still the boers had little doubt of the issue it could not be that the man would be worsted by an english lad who for a bet with one hand had once quelled the struggles of a wild ox holding it for the space of five minutes by the horn so they called on him to stop playing with the english boy and crush him thus encouraged the giant man came on striking out with fearful force but wildly for he could not box for thirty seconds or more jeremy contented himself with avoiding the blows then seeing an opportunity he planted a heavy one on his adversarys chest this staggered van zyl and threw him off his guard and taking the offensive jeremy dodged in right under the huge fists that beat the air above him and hit upwards with all his power thud thud the sound of the blows could be heard fifty yards off nor were they without their effect the giant staggered threw up his arms and amidst fearful shouts and groans fell like an ox struck with a poleaxe but it was not over yet in another moment he was on his legs again and spitting out blood and teeth whirling his hands like the sails of a windmill reeled straight at jeremy a fearful and alarming spectacle as he came again jeremy hit him in the face but it did not stop him and in another second the huge arms had closed round him and held him like a vice not fair no holding shouted the englishmen but the boer held on indeed he did more putting all his vast strength into the effort he strained and tugged meaning to lift jeremy up and dash him on the ground but lo amid frantic shouts from the crowd jeremy stood firm moving not an inch whereupon the boers called out saying that he was not a mortal but a man possessed with a devil again the dutchman gripped him and this time succeeded in lifting him a few inches from the ground by george he will throw him next time said mr alston to ernest who was shaking like a leaf with the excitement look he is turning white the grip is choking him and indeed jeremy was in evil case his senses were fast being crushed out of him in that fearful embrace and he was thinking with bitter sorrow that he must fail after all for an englishman does not like to be beaten even when he has fought his best just then it was when things were beginning to swim around him that a voice he loved and which he had been listening for these many months rang in his ears whether it was fancy or whether he really heard it he knew not remember marsh joe jeremy and lift him dont be beat for gods sake lift him said the voice now there was a trick which i will not tell you that a famous eastern counties wrestler known as marsh joe had taught to jeremy so well had he taught him indeed that at the age of seventeen jeremy had hoisted his teacher with his own trick just at the moment that jeremy heard the voice the giant shifted his hold a little preparatory to making a fresh effort and thus enabled his antagonist to fill his lungs with air ernest saw the broad white chest heave with relief for by this time most of the upper clothing of the combatants had been wrenched away and the darkening eye grow bright again and he knew that jeremy had heard him and that he would conquer or die where he was and then lo and behold just as the boer feeling that at last he was master of the situation leisurely enough prepared himself for the final struggle suddenly the englishman advanced his right leg a few inches and with the rapidity of lightning entirely shifted his grip then he gathered himself for the effort what secret reserve of strength he drew on who can say but ernests voice had excited it and it came at his call and he did a thing that few living men could have done the fame of which will go down in south africa from generation to generation for the englishmans lithe arms had found their hold they tightened and gripped till they sunk in almost level with the flesh of his mighty foe then slowly jeremy began to gather purchase swaying backwards and forwards and the dutchman swayed with him make an end of him make an end of him shouted the boers but behold their champions eyes are starting from his blackened face his head sinks lower and lower his buttocks rise he cannot stir to and fro sways jeremy and now the giants feet are lifted from the ground then one slow and mighty effort oh gallant jeremy up still up above the gasping of the wonderstricken crowd up to his shoulder by heaven over it crash van zyl fell to be carried away by six strong men a cripple for life chapter ix ernests loveletter cheer after cheer rose from the englishmen around and angry curses from the dutchmen as jeremy turned to look at the senseless carcase of the giant but even as he turned exhausted nature gave out and he fell fainting into ernests arms then did selected individuals of his fellowcountrymen come forward and bear him reverently to a restaurant called the european where the proprietor himself an old eton fellow met him and washed and clothed and restored him and vowed with tears in his eyes that he jeremy should live at his expense for as long as he liked ay even if he chose to drink nothing meaner than champagne all day long for thus it is that englishmen greet one who ministers to that deepest rooted of all their feelings national pride when at length he had been brought to and refreshed with a tumblerful of dry monopole and wonderingly shaken ernest by the hand the enthusiasm of the crowd outside burst its bounds they poured into the restaurant and seizing jeremy and the chair whereon he sat they bore him in triumph round the marketsquare to the tune of god save the queen this was a proceeding that would have ended in provoking a riot had not an aidedecamp from his excellency the special commissioner who sent in a message begging that they would desist succeeded in persuading them to return to the restaurant here they all dined and forced jeremy to drink a good deal more dry monopole than was good for him with the result that for the first and last time in his life he was persuaded into making an afterdinner speech as far as it was reported it ran something like this dear friends cheers and englishmen renewed cheers pause all making great fuss about nothing cheers and shouts of no no fight the dutchman again tomorrow very big but soft as putty anybody fight him frantic cheering glad i wasnt thrashed as you all seem so pleased spose you dont like the dutchman fraid he hurt himself over my shoulder wonder what he did it for sit down now dear friends dear old ernest been looking for you for long while and he turned his glassy eye on to ernest who cheered frantically under the impression that jeremy had just said something very much to the point sit down now no no go on cant go on quite pumped very thirsty too give him some more champagne open a fresh case wish eva and doll were here dont you loud cheers gemman cheers no not gemman friends louder cheers no not gemman friends english brothers yet louder cheers i give you a toast eva and doll you all know em and love em or if you dont you would you see if you did you know frantic outburst of cheering during which jeremy tries to resume his seat but gracefully drops on to the floor and begins singing auld lang syne under the table whereupon the whole company rise and with the exception of ernest and a jovial member of the special commissioners staff who get upon the table to lead the chorus join hands and sing that beautiful old song with all the solemnity of intoxication after which they drink more champagne and jointly and severally swear eternal friendship especially ernest and the member of his excellencys staff who shake hands and bless each other till the warmth of their emotions proves too much for them and they weep in chorus there upon the table for the rest ernest had some vague recollection of helping to drive his newlyfound friend home in a wheelbarrow that would persist in upsetting in every sluit or ditch especially if it had running water in it and that was about all he did remember in the morning he woke up or rather first became conscious of pain in his head in a little doublebedded room attached to the hotel on the pillow of the bed opposite to him lay jeremys battered face for a while ernest could make nothing of all this why was jeremy there where were they everything turned round and seemed phantasmagorial the only real substantial thing was that awful pain in the head but presently things began to come back to him and the sight of jeremys bruised face recalled the fight and the fight recalled the dinner and the dinner brought back a vague recollection of jeremys speech and of something he had said about eva what could it have been ah eva perhaps jeremy knew something about her perhaps he had brought the letter that had been so long in coming o how his heart went out towards her but how came jeremy there in bed before him how came he to be in south africa at all at that moment his reflections were interrupted by the entry of mazooku bearing the coffee which it is the national habit in south africa to drink early in the morning the martiallooking zulu who seemed curiously out of place carrying cups of coffee seeing that his master was awake saluted him with the customary koos lifting one of the cups of coffee to give emphasis to the word and nearly upsetting it in the effort mazooku said ernest severely how did we get here the substance of the retainers explanation was as follows when the moon was getting low vanishing indeed behind the horned house yonder the dutch church with pinnacles on it it occurred to him waiting on the verandah that his master must be weary and as most had departed from the dance in the tin house restaurant evidently made happy by the twala drink he entered into the tin house to look for him and found him overcome by sleep under the table lying next to the lionwhothrewoxenoverhisshoulder ie jeremy so overcome by sleep indeed that it was quite impossible to conduct him to the waggon this being so he mazooku considered what was his duty under the circumstances and he came to the accurate conclusion that the best thing to do was to put them in the white mans bed since he knew that his master did not love the floor to lie on accordingly having discovered that this was a room of beds he and another zulu entered but were perplexed to find the beds already occupied by two white men who had lain down to rest with their clothes on but under all these circumstances he and the other zulu considering that their first thought should be towards their own master had taken the liberty of lifting up the two white men who were slumbering profoundly after the dance by the head and by the heels and putting them out in the sweet cool air of the night having thus made a place they then conveyed first ernest and next in consideration of his undoubted greatness they ventured to take the lionwho c himself and put him in the other he was a very great man the lion and his art of throwing greater men over his shoulder could only be attributed to witchcraft he himself mazooku had tried it on that morning with a basuto with whom he had a slight difference of opinion but the result had not been all that could be desired inasmuch as the basuto had kicked him in the stomach and forced him to drop him ernest laughed as heartily as his headache would allow at this story and in doing so woke up jeremy who at once clapped his hands to his head and looked round whereupon mazooku having saluted the awakened lionwho c with much fervour and spilled a considerable quantity of hot coffee over him in doing so took his departure abashed and at length the two friends were left alone thereupon rising from their respective pallets they took a step in all the glory of their undress uniform into the middle of the little room and after the manner of englishmen shook hands and called each other old fellow then they went back to bed and began to converse i say old fellow what on earth brought you out here well you see i came out to look you up you did not write any letters and they began to get anxious about you at home so i packed up my duds and started your uncle stands unlimited tin so i am travelling like a prince in a waggon of my own i heard of you down in maritzburg and guessed that i had best make for pretoria and here i am and there you are and i am devilish glad to see you again old chap by jove what a head i have but i say why didnt you write doll half broke her heart about it so did your uncle only he would not say so i did write i wrote from secocoenis country but i suppose the letter did not fetch answered ernest feeling very guilty the fact is old fellow i had not the heart to write much i have been so confoundedly down on my luck ever since that duel business ah interposed jeremy that shot was a credit to you i didnt think you could have done it a credit ill tell you what it is an awful thing to kill a man like that i often see his face as he fell at night in my sleep i was merely looking at it as a shot replied jeremy innocently i dont trouble myself with moral considerations which are topsyturvy things and considered as a shot at twenty paces and under trying circumstances it was a credit to you then you see jeremy there was another thing you know about about eva well i wrote to her and she has never answered my letter unless with a gleam of hope you have brought an answer jeremy shook his aching head ah no such luck well it put me off and thats the fact since she has chucked me up i dont care twopence about anything i dont say but what she is right i daresay that i am not worth sticking to she can do much better elsewhere and ernest groaned and thought that his head was very bad indeed but there it is i hadnt the heart to write any more letters and i was too proud to write again to her confound her let her go i am not going to grovel to any woman under heaven no not even to her and he kicked the bedclothes viciously i havent learned much zulu yet replied jeremy sententiously but i know two words hamba gachlй well what of them said ernest testily they mean i am told take it easy or look before you leap or never jump to conclusions or dont be in a confounded hurry very fine mottoes i think of course they are but what have they got to do with eva well just this i said i had got no letter i never said what shouted ernest hamba gachlй replied jeremy the imperturbable gazing at ernest out of his blackened eyes i never said that i had not got a message ernest sprang clean out of the little trucklebed shaking with excitement what is it man just this she told me to tell you that she loved you dearly slowly ernest sat down on the bed again and throwing a blanket over his head and shoulders remarked in a tone befitting a sheeted ghost the devil she did why couldnt you say so before then he got up again and commenced walking blanket and all up and down the room with long strides and knocking over the waterjug in his excitement hamba gachlй again remarked jeremy rising and picking up the waterjug how are we going to get any more water ill tell you all about it and he did including the story of mr plowdens shaking at which ernest chuckled fiercely i wish i had been there to kick him he remarked parenthetically i did that too i kicked him hard put in jeremy at which ernest chuckled again i cant make it all out said ernest at length but i will go home at once you cant do that old fellow your respected uncle sir hugh will have you run in ah i forgot well i will write to her today thats better now lets dress my head is rather clearer by george though i am stiff it is no joke fighting a giant but ernest answered not a word he was already after his quickbrained fashion employed in concocting his letter to eva in the course of the morning he drafted it it or rather part of it with which we need concern ourselves ran thus such then my dearest eva was the state of my mind towards you i thought god forgive me for the treason that perhaps you were as so many women are a fairweather lover and that now that i am in trouble you wished to slip the cable if that was so i felt that it was not for me to remonstrate i wrote to you and i knew that the letter came safely to your hands you did not answer it and i could only come to one conclusion hence my own silence and to be plain i do not at this moment quite understand why you have never written but jeremy has brought me your message and with that i must be content for no doubt you have reasons which are satisfactory to yourself and if that is so no doubt too they would be equally satisfactory to me if i only knew them you see my dearest love the fact is that i trust and believe in you utterly and entirely what is right and true what is loyal and sincere to me and to yourself those are the things that you will do jeremy tells me a rather amusing story about the new clergyman who has come to kesterwick and who is it appears an aspirant for your hand well eva i am sufficiently conceited not to be jealous although i am in the unlucky position of an absent man and worse still an absent man under a cloud i do not believe that he will cut me out but on the day that you can put your hand on your heart and look me straight in the eyes and tell me on your honour as a lady that you love this or any other man better than you do me on that day i shall be ready to resign you to him but till that day comes and there is something which tells me that it is as impossible for it to come as for the mountainrange i look on as i write to move towards the town and bury it i am free from jealousy for i know that it is impossible that you should be faithless to your love oh my sweet the troth we plighted was not for days or years or times it was for ever i believe that nothing can dissolve it and that death himself will be powerless against it i believe that with each new and progressive existence it will rearise as surely as the flowers in spring only unlike them more fragrant and beautiful than before sometimes i think that it has already existed through countless ages strange thoughts come into a mans mind out there on the great veld riding alone hour after hour and day after day through sunlight and through moonlight till the spirit of nature broods upon him and he begins to learn the rudiments of truth some day i shall tell them all to you not that i have ever been quite alone for i can say honestly that you have always been at my side since i left you there has been no hour of the day or night when you have not been in my thoughts and i believe that till death blots out my senses no such hour will ever come day by day too my love has grown stronger even in its despair day by day it has taken shape and form and colour and become more and more a living thing more and more an entity as distinct as soul and body and yet as inextricably blended and woven into the substance of each if ever a woman was beloved you are that woman eva ceswick if ever a mans life present and to come lay in a womans hands my life lies in yours it is a germ which you can cast away or destroy or which you can nourish till it bursts into bloom and bears fruit beautiful beyond imagining you are my fate my other part with you my destiny is intertwined and you can mould it as you will there is no height to which i cannot rise by your side there is no depth to which i may not sink without you and now what does all this lead up to will you make a sacrifice for me who am ready to give up all my life to you no who have already given it that sacrifice is this i want you to come out here and marry me for as you know circumstances prevent me from returning to you if you will come i will meet you at the cape and marry you there ah surely you will come as for money i have plenty from home and can make as much more as we shall want here so that need be no obstacle it is long to wait for your answer three months but i hope that the faith that will as the bible tells us enable people to move mountains and my faith in you is as great as that will also enable me to bear the suspense and in the end prove its own reward ernest read selected portions of this exalted composition to mr alston and jeremy both listened in solemn silence and at the conclusion jeremy scratched his head and remarked that it was deep enough to fetch any girl though for his part he did not quite understand it mr alston relit his pipe and for a while said nothing but to himself he thought that it was a remarkable letter for so young a man to have written and revealed a curious turn of mind one remark he did make however and that was rather a rude one the girl wont understand what you are driving at master ernest she will think that you have gone off your head in these savage parts all you say may or may not be true on that point i express no opinion but to write such things to a woman is to throw your pearls before swine you should ask her about her bonnets my boy and tell her what sort of dresses she should bring out and that the air is good for the complexion she would come then here ernest fired up you are beastly cynical alston and you should not speak of miss ceswick like that to me bonnets indeed all right my lad all right time will show ah you boys you go building up your ideals of ivory and gold and fine linen only to find them one day turned into the commonest of clay draped in the dirtiest of rags well well it is the way of the world but you take my advice ernest burn that letter and go in for an intombi it is not too late yet and there is no mistake about the sort of clay of which a kafir girl is made here ernest stamped out of the room in a passion too cocksure wanted cooling down a little remarked mr alston to jeremy should never be cocksure where a woman is concerned women are fond of playing dirty tricks and saying they could not help it i know them for though you mightnt think it i was once young myself come on let us find him and go for a walk they found ernest sitting on the box of the waggon which was outspanned together with jeremys just outside the town and looking rather sulky come on ernest said mr alston apologetically i will throw no more mud at your ideal in the course of the last thirty years i have seen so many fall to pieces of their own accord that i could not help warning you but perhaps they make them of better stuff in england than we do in these parts ernest descended and soon forgot his pique it was but rarely that he bore malice for more than half an hour as they walked along one of the bystreets they met the young fellow who had acted as second to jeremy in the big fight of the previous day he informed them that he had just been to inquire how the giant was it appeared that he had received an injury to the spine the effect of jeremys lift from which there was little hope of his recovery he was not however in much pain this intelligence distressed jeremy not a little he had earnestly desired to thrash the giant but he had felt no wish to injure him with his usual promptitude he announced his intention of going to see his fallen enemy you are likely to meet with a warm reception if you do said mr alston ill risk it i should like to tell him that i am sorry very good come along that is the house the injured man had been carried to the house of a relative just outside the town a white thatched building that had been built fiveandthirty years before when the site of pretoria was a plain inhabited only by quaggas eland and vilderbeeste in front of the door was a grove of orangetrees which smelled sweet and looked golden with hanging fruit the house itself was a small white building with a doubleswinging door like those used in stables in this country the top half of the door was open and over the lower portion of it leaned a boer a roughlooking customer smoking a huge pipe dagh oom goodday uncle said mr alston stretching out his hand the other looked at him suspiciously and then held out a damp paw to each in turn at the same time opening the door as ernest passed the threshold he noticed that the clay flooring was studded with peachstones well trodden into its substance to prevent wear and tear from passing feet the door opened into a fairsized room with whitewashed walls called the sitkamй or sittingroom and furnished with a settee a table and several chairs seated with rimpi or strips of hide on the biggest of these chairs sat a woman of large size the mother of the family she did not rise on their entry but without speaking held out a limp hand which mr alston and the others took addressing her affectionately as tanta or aunt then they shook hands with six or seven girls and young men the latter sitting about in an aimless sort of way the former clearing off the remains of the family meal which had consisted of huge bones of boiled fresh beef so fresh was it indeed that on the floor by the side of the table lay the gory head and skin of a newlykilled ox from which the beef had been cut ernest noticing this wondered at the superhuman strength of stomach that could take its food under such circumstances the preliminary ceremony of handshaking having been got through mr alston who spoke dutch perfectly explained the object of their visit the faces of the dutchmen darkened as he did so and the men scowled at jeremy with hatred not unmingled with terror when he had done the oldest man said that he would ask his cousin if he would see them adding however that he was so ill that he did not think it likely raising a curtain which served as a door he passed from the sittingroom into the bedroom or slaapkamй presently he returned and beckoned to the englishmen to enter they passed into a small chamber about ten feet square which was hermetically sealed from air after the fashion of these people in cases of any illness on a large bed that blocked up most of the room and on which it was the usual habit of the master of the house and his wife to sleep in their clothes lay the fallen giant so much as could be seen of his face was a mass of hideous bruises and one of his hands which lay on the bed was in splints the chief injury however was to his back and from this he could never expect to recover by his side sat his little wife who had on the previous day urged the thrashing of the hottentot she glared fiercely at jeremy but said nothing on catching sight of his victor the giant turned his face to the wall and asked what he wanted i have come said jeremy mr alston interpreting for him to say that i am sorry that you are injured so much that i wanted to beat you but had no idea that i should hurt you so i know that the trick of throwing a man as i threw you is dangerous and i only used it as a last resource and because you would have killed me if i had not the boer muttered something in reply about its being very bitter to be beaten by such a little man it was evident to ernest that the mans pride was utterly broken he had believed himself the strongest man white or black in africa and now an english lad had thrown him over his shoulder like a plaything jeremy next said that he hoped that he bore no malice and would shake hands the giant hesitated a little then stretched out his uninjured hand which jeremy shook englishman he said you are a wonderful man and you will grow stronger yet you have made a baby of me for life and turned my heart to a babys too perhaps one day some man will do the same for you till then you can never know what i feel they will give you the hottentot outside no you must take him you won him in fair fight he is a good driver though he is so small now go the sight was a painful one and they were not sorry to get away from it outside they found one of the young boers waiting with the hottentot boy whom he insisted in handing over to jeremy any scruples the latter had about accepting him were overcome by the look of intense satisfaction on the features of the poor wretch himself when he learnt that he was to be handed over his name was aasvцgel vulture and he made jeremy an excellent and most faithful servant chapter x a way of escape when mr alston jeremy and ernest emerged from the back street in which was the house they had visited into one of the principal thoroughfares of pretoria they came upon a curious sight in the middle of the street stood or rather danced a wiry zulu dressed in an old military greatcoat and the ordinary native moocha or scanty kilt and having a red worsted comforter tied round one arm he was shouting out something at the top of his voice and surrounded by a crowd of other natives who at intervals expressed their approval of what he was saying in deep guttural exclamations what is that lunatic after asked jeremy mr alston listened for a minute and answered i know the man well his name is goza he is the fleetest runner in natal and can go as fast as a horse indeed there are few horses that he cannot tire out by profession he is a praiser he is now singing the praises of the special commissioner bongering they call it this is what he is saying listen to the foot of the great elephant somptseu sir t shepstone feel how the earth shakes beneath the tread of the white tchaka father of the zulus foremost among the great white people ou he is coming ou he is here see how the faces of the amaboona the boers turn pale before him he will eat them up he will swallow them the huge vulture who sits still till the ox is dead who fights the fight of sit down oh he is great the lion where he turns his eye the people melt away their hearts turn to fat where is there one like somptseu the man who is not afraid of death who looks at death and it runs from him who has the tongue of honey who reigns like the first star at night who is beloved and honoured of the great white mother the queen who loves his children the amazulu and shelters them under his wide wing who lifted cetywayo out of the dirt and can put him back in the dirt again abase yourselves you low people doctor yourself with medicine lest his fierce eyes should burn you up o hark he comes the father of kings the chaka o be still o be silent o shake in your knees he is here the elephant the lion the fierce one the patient one the strong one see he deigns to talk to little children he teaches them wisdom he gives light like the sun he is the sun he is tsomptseu the zulu napoleon greatuncle to the last king of zululand cetywayo at this juncture a quietlooking oldish gentleman entirely unlike either an elephant a lion or a vulture of medium height with grey whiskers a black coat and a neat black tie fastened in a bow came round the corner leading a little girl by the hand as he came the praiser lifted up his right hand and in the most stentorian tones gave the royal salute bayиte which was reechoed by all the other natives the oldish gentleman who was none other than the special commissioner himself turned upon his extoller with a look of intense annoyance and addressed him very sharply in zulu be still he said why do you always annoy me with your noise be still i say you loudtongued dog or i will send you back to natal my head aches with your empty words o elephant i am silent as the dead bayиte o somptseu i am quiet bayиte go begone with a final shout of bayиte the zulu turned and fled down the street with the swiftness of the wind shouting praises as he went how do you do sir said mr alston advancing i was just coming up to call upon you ah alston i am delighted to see you i heard that you were gone on a hunting trip given up work and taken to hunting eh well i should like to do the same if i could have found you when i came up here i should have been tempted to ask you to come with us at this point mr alston introduced ernest and jeremy the special commissioner shook hands with them i have heard of you he said to jeremy but i must ask you not to fight any more giants here just at present the tension between boer and englishman is too great to allow of its being stretched any more do you know you nearly provoked an outbreak last night with your fighting i trust that you will not do it again he spoke rather severely and jeremy coloured presently however he made amends by asking them all to dinner on the following morning ernest sent off his letter to eva he also wrote to his uncle and to dorothy explaining his long silence as best he could the latter too he for the first time took into his confidence about eva at a distance he no longer felt the same shyness in speaking to her about another woman that had overpowered him when he was by her side now that he had been away from england for a year or so many things connected with his home life had grown rather faint amid the daily change and activity of his new life the rush of fresh impressions had to a great extent overlaid the old ones and dorothy and mr cardus and all the old kesterwick existence and surroundings seemed faint and far away they were indeed rapidly assuming that unreality which in time the wanderer finds will gather round his old associations he feels that they know him no more very likely he imagines that they have forgotten him and so they become like the shades of the dead it is almost a shock to such an one to come back and find after an absence of many years that though he has been living his rapid vigorous life and storing his time with many acts good bad and indifferent though he thinks that he has changed so completely and developed greatly in one direction or another yet the old spots the old familiar surroundings and the old dear faces have changed hardly one whit they have been living their quiet english life in which sensation incident and excitement are things unfamiliar and have varied not at all most people as a matter of fact change very little except in so far as they are influenced by the cyclic variations of their life the passage from youth to maturity and from maturity to age and the attendant modes of thought and action befitting each period but even then the change is superficial rather than real what the child is that the middleaged person and the old man will be also the reason of this appears to be sufficiently obvious the unchanging personality that grows not old the animating spiritual ego is there and practically identical at all periods of life the body the brain and the subtler intellect may all vary according to the circumstances mostly physical of personal existence but the effect that the passage of a few years more or less active or stormy can produce upon a principle so indestructible so immeasurably ancient and the inheritor of so farreaching a destiny as some of us believe the individual human soul to be surely must be small already ernest began to find it something of a labour to indite epistles to people in england and yet he had the pen of a ready writer the links that bound them together were fast breaking loose eva and eva alone remained clear and real to the vision of his mind she was always with him and to her at any period of his life he never found difficulty in writing for in truth their very natures were interwoven and the rapport between them was not produced merely by the pressure of external circumstances or by the fact of continual contact and mutual attraction arising from physical causes such as the natural leaning of youth to youth and beauty to beauty these causes according to ernests creed no doubt had to do with its production and perhaps were necessary to its mundane birth as the battery is necessary to the creation of the electric spark thus had eva been old instead of a young and lovely girl the rapport would perhaps never have come into being here in short they formed the cable along which the occult communication could pass but there their function ended having once established that communication and provided a means by which the fusion of spirit could be effected youth and beauty and the natural attraction of sex to sex had done their part the great dividing river that rolls so fast and wide between our souls in their human shape had been safely passed and the two fortunate travellers had been allowed before their time to reap advantages the measureless advantage of real love so rare on earth and at its best so stained by passion which will only come to most of us and then perhaps imperfectly in a different world from this yes the bridge might now be broken down it had served its purpose come age or loss of physical attraction or separation and icy silence or the change called death itself and the souls thus subtly blended can and will and do defy them for the real life is not here here only is the blind beginning of things maybe the premature beginning and so ernest posted his letters and then partly to employ his thoughts and partly because it was his nature to throw himself into whatever stream of life was flowing past him he set himself to master the state of political affairs in the country in which he found himself this need not be entered into here further than to say that it was such as might with advantage have employed wiser heads than his and indeed did employ them suffice it to say that he contrived to make himself of considerable use to the english party both before and after the annexation of the transvaal to the dominions of the crown among other things he went on several missions in conjunction with mr alston with a view of ascertaining the real state of feeling among the boers also together with jeremy he joined a volunteer corps which was organised for the defence of pretoria when it was still a matter of doubt whether or not the contemplated annexation would or would not result in an attack being made upon the town by the boers it was a most exciting time and once or twice ernest and jeremy had narrow escapes of being murdered however nothing worthy of note happened to them and at last the longexpected annexation came off successfully to the intense joy of all the englishmen in the country and to the great relief of the vast majority of the boers now together with the proclamation by which the transvaal was annexed to her majestys dominions was issued another that was to have a considerable bearing upon ernests fortunes this was none other than a promise of her majestys gracious pardon to all such as had been resident in the transvaal for a period of six months previous to the date of annexation being former british subjects and offenders against the english criminal law who would register their name and offence within a given time the object of this proclamation was to give immunity from prosecution to many individuals former deserters from the english army and other people who had in some way transgressed the laws but were now occupying respectable positions in their adopted country mr alston read this proclamation attentively when it came out in a special number of the gazette then after thinking for a while he handed it to ernest you have read this amnesty proclamation he said yes answered ernest what of it what of it ah the stupidity of youth go down go down on your knees young man and render thanks to the power that inspired lord carnarvon with the idea of annexing the transvaal cant you very well see that it takes your neck out of the halter off with you and register your name and offence with the secretary to government and you will be clear for ever from any consequences that might ensue from the slight indiscretion of having shot your own first cousin in a duel on british soil by jove alston you dont mean that mean it of course i do the proclamation does not specify any particular offence to which the pardon is to be denied and you have lived more than six months on transvaal territory off you go ernest went like an arrow chapter xi found wanting ernest reached the government office and registered his name and in due course received her majestys gracious pardon and indemnity from and against all actions proceedings and prosecutions at law having arisen arising or to arise by whomsoever undertaken c conveyed through his excellency the administrator of our said territory of the transvaal when this precious document was in his pocket ernest thought that he now for the first time fully realised what must be the feelings of a slave unexpectedly manumitted had it not been for this fortunate accident the consequences of that fatal duel must have continually overshadowed him had he returned to england he would have been liable at any period of his life to a prosecution for murder indeed the arm of the law is long and he lived in continual apprehension of an application for his extradition being made to the authorities of whatever country he was in but now all this was gone from him and he felt that he would not be afraid to have words with an attorneygeneral or shudder any more at the sight of a policeman his first idea on getting his pardon was to return straightway to england but that silent fate which directs mens lives driving them whither they would not and forcing their bare and bleeding feet to stumble along the stony paths of its hidden purpose came into his mind and made him see that it would be better to delay a while in a few weeks evas answer would surely reach him if he were to go now it was even possible that he might pass her in midocean for in his heart he never doubted but that she would come and indeed the very next mail there came a letter from dorothy written in answer to that which he had posted on the same day that he had written to eva it was only a short letter the last post that could catch the mail was just going out and his welcome letter had only just arrived but she had twenty minutes and she would send one line she told him how grateful they were to hear that he was well and safe and reproached him gently for not writing then she thanked him for making her his confidante about eva ceswick she had guessed it long before she said and she thought they were both lucky in each other and hoped and prayed that when the time came they would be as completely happy as it was possible for people to be she had never spoken to eva about him but she should no longer feel any diffidence in doing so now she should go and see her very soon and plead his cause not that it wanted any pleading however she was sure of that eva looked sad now that he was gone there had been some talk a while back of mr plowden the new clergyman but she supposed that eva had given him his quietus as she heard no more of it now and so on till the postman is at the door waiting for this letter little did ernest guess what it cost poor dorothy to write her congratulations and wishes of happiness a man the nobler animal remember could hardly have done it only the inferior woman would show such unselfishness this letter filled ernest with a sure and certain hope eva he clearly saw had not had time to write by that mail by the next her answer would come it can be imagined that he waited for its advent with some anxiety mr alston ernest and jeremy had taken a house in pretoria and for the past month or two had been living in it very comfortably it was a pleasant onestoried house with a verandah and a patch of flowergarden in front of it in which grew a large gardeniabush covered with hundreds of sweetscented blooms and many rosetrees that in the divine climate of pretoria flourish like thistles in our own beyond the flowers was a patch of vines covered at this season of the year with enormous bunches of grapes extending down to the line of waving willowtrees interspersed with clumps of bamboo that grew along the edge of the sluit and kept the house private from the road on the other side of the narrow path which led to the gate was a bed of melons now rapidly coming to perfection this garden was ernests especial pride and occupation and just then he was much troubled in his mind about the melons which were getting scorched by the bright rays of the sun to obviate this he had designed cunning frameworks of little willow twigs which he stuck over the melons and covered with dry grass parasols he called them one morning it was a particularly lovely morning ernest was standing after breakfast on this path smoking and directing mazooku as to the erection of the parasols over his favourite melons it was not a job at all suited to the capacity of the great zulu whose assegai stuck in the ground behind him in the middle of a small bundle of knobsticks seemed a tool ominously unlike those used by gardeners of other lands however needs must when the devil drives and there was the brawny fellow on his knees puffing and blowing and trying to fix the tuft of grass to ernests satisfaction mazooku you lazy hound said the latter at last if you dont put that tuft right in two shakes by the heaven you will never reach ill break your head with your own kerrie ow inkoos replied the zulu sulkily again trying to prop up the tuft and muttering to himself meanwhile do you catch what that fellow of yours is saying asked mr alston he is saying that all englishmen are mad and that you are the maddest of the mad he considers that nobody who was not a lunatic would bother his head with those weeds that stink flowers or those fruits which even if you succeed in growing them and surely the things are bewitched or they would grow without hats ernests parasols must lie very cold on the stomach at that moment the particular hat which mazooku was trying to arrange fell down again whereupon the zulus patience gave out and cursing it for a witch in the most vigorous language he emphasised his words by bringing his fist straight down on the melon smashing it to pieces whereupon ernest made for him and he vanished swiftly mr alston stood by laughing at the scene and awaited ernests return presently he came strolling back not having caught mazooku indeed it would not have greatly mattered if he had for as that swarthy gentleman very well knew great indeed must be the provocation that could induce ernest to touch a native it was a thing to which he had an almost unconquerable aversion in the same way that he objected to the word nigger as applied to a people who whatever their faults may be are as a rule gentlemen in the truest sense of the word as he came strolling down the path towards him his face a little flushed with the exertion mr alston thought to himself that ernest was growing into a very handsome fellow the tall frame narrow at the waist and broad at the shoulders the eloquent dark eyes which so far surpass the loveliest grey or blue the silken hair which curled over his head like that on a grecian statue the curved lips the quick intelligence and kindly smile that lit the whole face all these things helped to make his appearance not so much handsome as charming and to women captivating to a dangerous extent his dress too which consisted of ridingbreeches boots and spurs a white waistcoat and linen coat with a very broad soft felt hat looped up at one side so as to throw the face into alternate light and shadow helped the general effect considerably altogether ernest was a pretty fellow in those days jeremy was lounging on an easychair in the verandah in company with the boy roger alston and intensely interested in watching a furious battle between two lines of ants black and red who had their homes somewhere in the stonework for a long while the issue of the battle remained doubtful victory inclining if anything to the side of the thin red line when suddenly from the entrance to the nest of the black ants there emerged a battalion of giants great fellows at least six times the size of the others who fell upon the red ants and routed them taking many prisoners then followed the most curious spectacle namely the deliberate execution of the captive red ants by having their heads bitten off by the great black soldiers jeremy and roger knew what was coming very well for these battles were of frequent occurrence and the casualties among the red ants simply frightful on this occasion they determined to save the prisoners which was effected by dipping a match in some of the nicotine at the bottom of a pipe and placing it in front of the black giants the ferocious insects would thereupon abandon their captives and rushing at the strange intruder hang on like bulldogs till the poison did its work and they dropped off senseless to recover presently and stagger off home holding their legs to their antennж and exhibiting every other symptom of a frightful headache jeremy was sitting on a chair oiling the matches and roger kneeling on the pavement was employed in beguiling the giants into biting them when suddenly they heard the sound of galloping horses and the rattle of wheels the lad lowering his head still more looked out towards the marketsquare through a gap between the willowstems hurrah mr jones he said here comes the mail next minute amid loud blasts from the bugle and enveloped in a cloud of dust the heavy cart to the sides and seats of which the begrimed and wornout passengers were clinging like drowning men to straws came rattling along as fast as the six greys reserved for the last stage could gallop and vanished towards the postoffice theres the mail ernest hallooed jeremy she will bring the english letters ernest nodded turned a little pale and nervously knocked out his pipe no wonder that mailcart carried his destiny and he knew it presently he walked across the square to the postoffice the letters were not sorted and he was the first person there very soon one of his excellencys staff came riding down to get the government house bag it was the same gentleman with whom he had sung auld lang syne so enthusiastically on the day of jeremys encounter with the giant and had afterwards been carted home in the wheelbarrow hullo kershaw here we are primos inter omnes primos primi primores which is it come kershaw you are the last from school which is it i dont believe you know ha ha ha what are you doing down here so soon does the expectant swain await the postmens knock why my dear fellow you look pale you must be in love or thirsty so am i the latter not the former love i do abjure thee quis separabit who will have a split i think that the sun cant be far from the line shall we my dear kershaw shall we take an observation ha ha ha no thank you i never drink anything between meals ah my boy a bad habit give it up before it is too late break it off my dear kershaw and always wet your whistle in the strictest moderation or you will die young what says the poet he who drinks strong beer and goes to bed mellow lives as he ought to live lives as he ought to live lives as he ought to live and dies a jolly good fellow byron i think is it not ha ha ha just then some others came up and somewhat to ernests relief his friend turned the light of his kindly countenance to shine elsewhere and left him to his thoughts at last the little shutter of the postoffice was thrown up and ernest got his own letters together with those belonging to mr alston and jeremy he turned into the shade of a neighbouring verandah and rapidly sorted the pile there was no letter in evas handwriting but there was one in that of her sister florence ernest knew the writing well there was no mistaking its peculiar upright powerfullooking characters this he opened hurriedly enclosed in the letter was a note which was in the writing he had expected to see he rapidly unfolded it and as he did so a flash of fear passed through his brain why did she write in this way the note could not have been a long one for in another minute it was lying on the ground and ernest palefaced and with catching breath was clinging to the verandahpost with both hands to save himself from falling in a few seconds he recovered and picking up the note walked quickly across the square towards the house halfway across he was overtaken by his friend on the staff cantering gaily along on a particularly woodenlooking pony from the sides of which his legs projected widely and waving in one hand the colonial office bag addressed to the administrator of the government hallo my abstemious friend he hallooed as he pulled up the wooden pony with a jerk that sent each of its stiff legs sprawling in a different direction was patience rewarded is chloe over the water kind if not take my advice and dont trouble your head about her quant on na pas ce quon aime the wise man aimes ce quil a kershaw i have conceived a great affection for you and i will let you into a secret come with me this afternoon and i will introduce you to two charming specimens of indigenous beauty like roses they bloom upon the veld and waste their sweetness on the desert air mater pulchra puella pulcherrima as virgil says i as befits my years will attach myself to the mater for your sweet youth shall be reserved the puella ha ha ha and he brought the despatchbag down with a sounding whack between the ears of the wooden pony with the result that he was nearly sent flying into the sluit being landed by a sudden plunge well on the animals crupper woho bucephaluas woho or your mealies shall be cut off just then he for the first time caught sight of the face of his companion who was plodding along in silence by his side hullo whats up kershaw he said in an altered tone you dont look well nothing wrong i hope nothing nothing answered ernest quietly that is i have got some bad news that is all nothing to speak of nothing my dear fellow i am so sorry and i have been troubling you with my nonsense forgive me there you wish to be alone goodbye a few seconds later mr alston and jeremy from their point of vantage on the verandah saw ernest coming with swift strides up the garden path his face was drawn with pain and there was a fleck of blood upon his lip he passed them without a word and entering the house slammed the door of his own room mr alston and jeremy looked at one another whats up said the laconic jeremy mr alston thought a while before he answered as was his fashion something gone wrong with the ideal i should say he said at length that is the way of ideals shall we go and see said jeremy uneasily no give him a minute or two to pull himself together lots of time for consultation afterwards meanwhile ernest having got into his room sat down upon the bed and again read the note which was enclosed in florences letter then he folded it up and put it down slowly and methodically next he opened the other letter which he had not yet looked at and read that too after he had done it he threw himself face downwards on the pillow and thought a while presently he arose and going to the other side of the room took down a revolvercase which hung to a nail and drew out a revolver which was loaded returning he again sat down upon the bed and cocked it so he remained for a minute or two and then slowly lifted the pistol towards his head at that moment he heard footsteps approaching and with a quick movement threw the weapon under the bed as he did so mr alston and jeremy entered any letters ernest asked the former letters o yes i beg your pardon here they are and he took a packet from the pocket of his white coat and handed them to him mr alston took them looking all the while fixedly at ernest who avoided his glance what is the matter my boy he said kindly at last nothing wrong i hope ernest looked at him blankly what is it old chap said jeremy seating himself on the bed beside him and laying his hand on his arm then ernest broke out into a paroxysm of grief painful to behold fortunately for all concerned it was brief had it lasted much longer something must have given way suddenly his mood changed and he grew hard and bitter nothing my dear fellow nothing he said that is only the sequel to a pretty little idyl you may remember a letter i wrote to a woman some months back there you both of you know the story now you shall hear the answer or to be more correct the answers that woman has a sister both she and her sister have written to me my her sisters letter is the longest we will take it first i think that we may skip the first page there is nothing particular in it and i do not wish to waste your time now listen by the way i have a piece of news for you which will interest you and which you will i am sure be glad to hear for of course you will have by this time got over any little tendresse you may have had in that direction eva that is the woman to whom i wrote and to whom i thought i was engaged is going to be married to a mr plowden a gentleman who has been acting as locum tenens for mr halford here jeremy sprang up and swore a great oath ernest motioned him down and went on i say i am certain that you will be glad to hear this because the match is in every respect a satisfactory one and will i am sure bring dear eva happiness mr plowden is well off and of course a clergyman two great guarantees for the success of their matrimonial venture eva tells me that she had a letter from you last mail the letter i read you gentlemen and asks me to thank you for it if she can find time she will send you a line shortly but as you will understand she has her hands very full just at present the wedding is to take place at kesterwick church on the th of may that is tomorrow gentlemen and if this letter reaches you in time i am sure you will think of us all on that day it will be very quiet owing to our dear aunts death being still so comparatively recent indeed the engagement has in obedience to mr plowdens wishes for he is very retiring been kept quite secret and you are absolutely the first person to whom it has been announced i hope that you will feel duly flattered sir we are very busy about the trousseau and just now the burning question is of what colour the dress in which eva is to go away in after the wedding shall be eva and i are all for grey mr plowden is for olivegreen and as is natural under the circumstances i expect that he will carry the day they are together in the drawingroom setting it now you always admired eva rather warmly once do you remember how cut up you both were when you went away alas for the fickleness of human nature you should see her now her happiness makes her look lovely but i hear her calling me no doubt they have settled the momentous question goodbye i am not clever at writing but i hope that my news will make up for my want of skill always yours florence ceswick now for the enclosure said ernest dear ernest i got your letter florence will tell you what there is to tell i am going to be married think what you will of me i cannot help myself believe me this has cost me great suffering but my duty seems clear i hope that you will forget me ernest as henceforth it will be my duty to forget you goodbye my dear ernest oh goodbye e humph murmured alston beneath his breath as i thought clay and damned bad clay too slowly ernest tore the letter into small fragments threw them down and stamped upon them with his foot as though they were a living thing i wish i had shaken the life out of that devil of a parson groaned jeremy who was in his way as much affected by the news as his friend curse you said ernest turning on him fiercely why didnt you stop where you were and look after her instead of coming humbugging after me jeremy only groaned humbly by way of answer mr alston as was his way when perplexed filled his pipe and lit it ernest paced swiftly up and down the little room the white walls of which he had decorated with pictures cut from illustrated papers christmas cards and photographs over the head of the bed was a photograph of eva herself which he had framed in some beautiful native wood he reached it down look he said that is the lady herself handsome isnt she and pleasant to look on who would have thought that she was such a devil tells me to forget her and talks about her duty women love a little joke he hurled the photograph on to the floor and treated it as he had treated the letter grinding it to pieces with his heel they say he went on that a mans curses are sometimes heard wherever it is they arrange these pleasant surprises for us now you fellows bear witness to what i say and watch that womans life i curse her before god and man may she lay down her head in sorrow night by night and year by year may her stop ernest said mr alston with a shrug you might be taken at your word and you wouldnt like that you know besides it is cowardly to go on cursing at a woman ernest paused standing for a moment with his clenched fist still raised above his head his pale lips quivering with intense excitement and his dark eyes flashing and blazing like stars you are right he said dropping his fist on to the table it is with the man that i have to deal what man this plowden i fear that i shall disturb his honeymoon what do you mean i mean that i am going to kill him or he is going to kill me it does not matter which why what quarrel have you with the man of course he looked after himself you could not expect him to consider your interests could you if he had cut me out fairly i should not have a word to say every man for himself in this pleasant world but mark my words this parson and florence have forced eva into this unholy business and i will have his life in payment if you dont believe me ask jeremy he saw something of the game before he left look here kershaw the mans a parson he will take shelter behind his cloth he wont fight what shall you do then i shall shoot him was the cool reply ernest you are mad it wont do you shall not go and that is all about it you shall not ruin yourself over this woman who is not fit to black an honest mans shoes shall not shall not alston you use strong language who will prevent me i will prevent you he answered sternly i am your superior officer and the corps you belong to is not disbanded if you try to leave this place you shall be arrested as a deserter now dont be a fool lad you have killed one man and got out of the mess if you kill another you will not get out of it besides what will the satisfaction be if you want revenge be patient it will come i have seen something of life at least i am old enough to be your father and i know that you think me a cynic because i laugh at your highfalutin about women how justly i warned you you see now but cynic or not i believe in the god above us and i believe too that there is a rough justice in this world it is in the world principally that people expiate the sins of the world and if this marriage is such a wicked thing as you think it will bring its own trouble with it without any help from you time will avenge you everything comes to him who can wait ernests eyes glittered coldly as he answered i cannot wait i am a ruined man already all my life is laid waste i wish to die but i wish to kill him before i die so sure as my name is alston you shall not go so sure as my name is kershaw i will go for a moment the two men faced one another it would have been hard to say which looked the most determined then mr alston turned and left the room and the house on the verandah he paused and considered for a moment the boy means business he thought to himself he will try and bolt how can i stop him ah i have it and he set off briskly towards government house saying aloud as he went i love that lad too well to let him destroy himself over a jilt chapter xii ernest runs away when alston left the room ernest sat down on the bed again i am not going to be domineered over by alston he said excitedly he presumes upon his friendship jeremy came in and sat beside him and took hold of his arm my dear fellow dont talk like that you know he means kindly by you you are not yourself just yet byandby you will see things in a different light not myself indeed would you be yourself i wonder if you knew that the woman who had pinned all your soul to her bosom as though it were a ribbon was going to marry another man tomorrow old fellow you forget though i cant talk of it in as pretty words as you can i loved her too i could bear to give her up to you especially as she didnt care a brass farthing about me but when i think about this other fellow with his cold grey eye and that mark on his confounded forehead ah ernest it makes me sick and they sat on the bed together and groaned in chorus looking to tell the truth rather absurd i tell you what it is jeremy said ernest when he had finished groaning at the vision of his successful rival as painted by jeremy you are a good fellow and i am a selfish beast here have i been kicking up all this devils delight and you havent said a word you are a more decent chap than i am jeremy by a long chalk and i daresay you are as fond of her as i am no i dont think you can be that though my dear fellow there is no parallel between our cases i never expected to marry her you did and had every right to do so besides we are differently made you feel things three times as much as i do ernest laughed bitterly i dont think that i shall ever feel anything again he said my capacities for suffering will be pretty nearly used up o what a sublime fool is the man who gives all his life and heart to one woman no man would have done it but what could you expect of a couple of boys like we were that is why women like boys it is so easy to take them in like puppies going to be drowned in love and faith they lick the hand that will destroy them it must be amusing to the destroyers by jove alston was right about his ideals do you know i am beginning to see all these things in quite a different light i used to believe in women jeremy actually i used to believe in them i thought they were better than we are and he laughed hysterically well we buy our experience i shant make the mistake again come come ernest dont go on talking like that you have got a blow as bad as death and the only thing to do is to meet it as you would death in silence you will not go after that fellow will you it will only make things worse you see you wont have time to kill him before he marries her and it really would not be worth while getting hanged about it when the mischief is done there is literally nothing to be done except grin and bear it we wont go back to england at all but right up to the zambesi and hunt elephants and as things have turned out if you should get knocked on the head why you wont so much mind it you know ernest made no answer to this consolatory address and jeremy left him alone thinking that he had convinced him but the ernest of midday was a very different man from the ernest of the morning directing the erection of parasols over melons the cruel news that the mail had brought him and which from force of association caused him for years afterwards to hate the sight of a letter had figuratively speaking destroyed him he could never recover from it though he would certainly survive it sharp indeed must be the grief which kills but all the bloom and beauty had gone from his life the gentle faith which he had placed in women was gone for so narrowminded are we all that we cannot help judging a class by our salient experience of individuals and from that day forward for many years he was handed over to a longdrawnout pain which never quite ceased though it frequently culminated in paroxysms and to which death itself would have been almost preferable but as yet he did not realise all these things what he did realise was an intense and savage thirst for revenge so intense indeed that he felt as though he must put himself in a way to gratify it or his brain would go tomorrow he thought was to see the final act of his betrayal today was the eve of her marriage and he as powerless to avert it as a child o great god and yet through it all he knew she loved him ernest like many other pleasant kindlytempered men if once stung into action by the sense of overpowering wrong was extremely dangerous ill indeed would it have fared with mr plowden if he could have come across him at that moment and he honestly meant that it should fare ill with that reverend gentleman so much did he mean it that before he left his room he wrote his resignation of membership of the volunteer corps to which he belonged and took it up to the government office then remembering that the potchefstroom postcart left pretoria at dawn on the following morning he made his way to the office and ascertained that there were no passengers booked to leave by it but he did not take a place he was too clever to do that leaving the office he went to the bank and drew one hundred and fifty pounds in gold then he went home again here he found a kafir messenger dressed in the government white uniform waiting for him with an official letter the letter acknowledged receipt of his resignation but regretted that in the present unsettled state of affairs his excellency was in the interest of the public service unable to dispense with his services ernest dismissed the messenger and tore the letter across if the government could not dispense with him he would dispense with the government his aim was to go to potchefstroom and thence to the diamond fields once there he could take the postcart to cape town where he would meet the english mail steamer and in one month from the present date be once more in england that evening he dined with mr alston jeremy and roger as usual and no allusion was made to the events of the morning about eleven oclock he went to bed but not to sleep the postcart left at four at three he rose very quietly and put a few things into a leather saddlebag extracted his revolver from under the bed where he had thrown it when in the first burst of his agony he had been interrupted in this contemplated act of selfdestruction and buckled it round his waist then he slipped out through the window of his room crept stealthily down the gardenpath and struck out for the potchefstroom road but silently and secretly as he went there went behind him one more silent and secret than he one to whose race through long generations of tracking foes and wild beasts silence and secrecy had become an instinct it was the hottentot boy aasvцgel the hottentot followed him in the dim light never more than fifty paces behind him sometimes not more than ten and yet totally invisible now he was behind a bush or a tuft of rank grass now he was running down a ditch and now again creeping over the open on his belly like a twolegged snake as soon as ernest got out of the town and began to loiter along the potchefstroom road the hottentot halted uttering to himself a guttural expression of satisfaction then watching his opportunity he turned and ran swiftly back to pretoria in ten minutes he was at ernests house in front of the door were five horses three with white riders two being held by kafirs on the verandah as usual smoking was mr alston and with him jeremy the latter armed and spurred the hottentot made his report and vanished mr alston turned and addressed jeremy in the tone of one giving an order now go he said at last handing him a paper and jeremy went and mounting one of the led horses a powerful creamcoloured animal with a snowwhite mane and tail galloped off in the twilight followed by the three white men meanwhile ernest walked quietly along the road once he paused thinking that he heard the sound of galloping horses half a mile or so to the left it passed and he went on again presently the mist began to lift and the glorious sun came up then came a rumble of wheels running along the silent road and the postcart with six fresh horses was upon him he halted and held up his hand to the native driver the man knew him and stopped the team at once i am going with you to potchefstroom apollo he said all right sar plenty of room inside sar no passenger this trip sar and damn good job too ernest got up and off they went he was safe now there was no telegraph to potchefstroom and nothing could catch the postcart if it had an hours start a mile further on there was a hill up which the unlovely apollo walked his horses at the top of the hill was a clump of mimosabush out of which to the intense astonishment of both ernest and apollo there emerged four mounted men with a led horse one of these men was jeremy it was impossible to mistake his powerful form sitting on his horse with the grip of a centaur they rode up to the postcart in silence jeremy motioned to apollo to pull up he obeyed and one of the men dismounted and seized the horses head tricked by heaven said ernest you must come back with me ernest said jeremy quietly i have a warrant for your arrest as a deserter signed by the governor and if i refuse then my orders are to take you back ernest drew his revolver this is a trick he said and i shall not go back then i must take you was the reply and jeremy coolly dismounted ernests eyes flashed dangerously and he lifted the pistol o yes you can shoot me if you like but if you do the others will take you and he continued to walk towards him ernest cocked his revolver and pointed it at your peril he said so be it said jeremy and he walked up to the cart ernest dropped his weapon it is mean of you jeremy he said you know i cant fire at you of course you cant old fellow come skip out of that you are keeping the mail i have a horse ready for you a slow one you wont be able to run away on him ernest obeyed feeling rather small and in half an hour was back at his own house mr alston was waiting for him goodmorning ernest he said cheerfully went out driving and came back riding eh ernest looked at him and his brown cheek flushed you have played me a dirty trick he said look here my boy answered mr alston sternly i am slow at making a friend but when once i take his hand i hold it till one of the two grows cold i should have been no true friend to you if i had let you go on this fools errand this wicked errand will you give me your word that you will not attempt to escape or must i put you under arrest i give you my word answered ernest humbled and i ask your forgiveness thus it was that for the first time in his life ernest tried to run away that morning jeremy missing ernest went into his room to see what he was doing the room was shuttered to keep out the glare of the sun but when he got used to the light he discovered ernest sitting at the table and staring straight before him with a wild look in his eyes come in old fellow come in he called out with bitter jocularity and assist in this happy ceremony rather dark isnt it but lovers like the dark look he went on pointing to his watch which lay upon the table before him by english time it is now about twenty minutes past eleven they are being married now jeremy my boy i can feel it by heaven i have only to shut my eyes and i can see it come come ernest said jeremy dont go on like that you are not yourself man he laughed and answered i am sure i wish i wasnt i tell you i can see it all i can see kesterwick church full of people and before the altar in her white dress is eva but her face is whiter than her dress jeremy and her eyes are very much afraid and there is florence with her dark smile and your friend mr plowden too with his cold eyes and the cross upon his forehead oh i assure you i can see them all it is a pretty wedding very there it is over now and i think i will go away before the kissing o hang it all ernest wake up said jeremy shaking him by the shoulder you will drive yourself mad if you give your imagination too much rein wake up my boy i feel more inclined to sleep have some grog wont you well i will he rose and went to the mantelpiece on which stood a square bottle of hollands and a tumbler rapidly filling the tumbler with raw spirit he drank it as fast as the contractions of his throat would allow he filled it again and drank that too then he fell insensible upon the bed it was a strange scene and in some ways a coarse one yet not without a pathos of its own ernest said mr alston three weeks later you are strong enough to travel now what do you say to six months or a year among the elephants the oxen are in firstrate condition and we ought to get to our ground in six or seven weeks ernest who was lying back in a low canechair looking very thin and pale thought for a moment before he answered all right im your man only lets get off soon i am tired of this place and want something to think about you have given up any idea of returning to england yes quite and what do you say jeremy where ernest goes there will i go also besides to shoot an elephant is the one ambition of my life good then we will consider that settled we shall want to pick up another eightbore but i know of one a fellow wants to sell a beauty by riley i will begin to make arrangements at once chapter xiii mr plowden asserts his rights when last we saw eva she had just become privately engaged to the reverend james plowden but the marriage was not to take place till the following spring and the following spring was a long way off vaguely she hoped something might occur to prevent it forgetting that as a rule in real life it is only happy things which accidents occur to prevent rare indeed is it that the plowdens of this world are prevented from marrying the evas fate has sufficient to do in thwarting the ernests and meanwhile her position was not altogether unendurable for she had made a bargain with her lover that the usual amenities of courtship were to be dispensed with there were to be no embracings or other tender passages she was not even to be forced to call him james james how she detested the name thus did the wretched girl try to put off the evil day much as the ostrich is supposed to hide her head in a bush and indulge in dreams of fancied security mr plowden did not object he was too wary a hunter to do so while his stately prey was there with her head in the thickest of the bush he was sure of her she would never wake from her foolish dream till the ripe moment came to deliver the fatal blow and all would be over but if on the contrary he startled her now she might take flight more swiftly than he could follow and leave him alone in the desert so when eva made her little stipulations he acquiesced in them after only just so much hesitation as he thought would seem loverlike life eva he said sententiously is a compromise i yield to your wishes but in his heart he thought that a time would come when she would have to yield to him and his cold eye gleamed eva saw the gleam and shuddered prophetically the reverend mr plowden did not suffer much distress at the coldness with which he was treated he knew that his day would come and was content to wait for it like a wise man he was not in love with eva a nature like his is scarcely capable of any such feeling as that for instance which eva and ernest bore to each other true love crowned with immortality veils his shining face from such men as mr plowden he was fascinated by her beauty that was all but his cunning was of a superior order and he was quite content to wait so he contrived to extract a letter from eva in which she talked of our engagement and alluded to our forthcoming marriage and waited and thus the time went on all too quickly for eva she was quietly miserable but she was not acutely unhappy that was yet to come with other evil things christmas came and went the spring came too and with the daffodils and violets came ernests letter eva was down the first one morning and was engaged in making the tea in the cottage diningroom when that modern minister to the decrees of fate the postman brought the letter she recognised the writing in a moment and the teacaddy fell with a crash on to the floor seizing the sealed letter she tore it open and read it swiftly o what a wave of love surged up in her heart as she read pressing the senseless paper to her lips she kissed it again and again o ernest she murmured o my love my darling just then florence came down looking cool and composed and giving that idea of quiet strength which is the natural attribute of some women eva pushed the letter into her bosom what is the matter eva said florence quietly noting her flushed face and why have you upset the tea matter she answered laughing happily she had not laughed so for months o nothing i have heard from ernest that is all indeed answered her sister with a troubled smile on her dark face and what has our runaway to say for himself say o he has a great deal to say and i have something to say too i am going to marry him indeed and mr plowden eva turned pale mr plowden i have done with mr plowden indeed said florence again really this is quite romantic but please pick up that tea whoever you marry let us have some breakfast in the meanwhile excuse me for one moment i have forgotten my handkerchief eva did as she was bid and made the tea after a fashion meanwhile florence went to her room and scribbled a note enclosed it in an envelope and rang the bell the servant answered tell john to take this to mr plowdens lodgings at once and if he should be out to follow him till he finds him and deliver it yes miss ten minutes later mr plowden got the following note come here at once eva has heard from ernest kershaw and announces her intention of throwing you over and marrying him be prepared for a struggle but do not show that you have heard from me you must find means to hold your own burn this mr plowden whistled as he laid the paper down going to his desk he unlocked it and extracted the letter he had received from eva in which she acknowledged her engagement to him and then seizing his hat walked swiftly towards the cottage meanwhile florence made her way downstairs again saying to herself as she went an unlucky chance if i had seen the letter first i would have burned it but we shall win yet she has not the stamina to stand out against that brute as soon as she reached the diningroom eva began to say something more about her letter but her sister stopped her quickly let me have my breakfast in peace eva we will talk of the letter afterwards he does not interest me your ernest and it takes away my appetite to talk business at meals eva ceased and sat silent breakfast had no charms for her that morning presently there was a knock at the door and mr plowden entered with a smile of forced gaiety on his face how do you do florence he said how do you do dear eva you see i have come to see you early this morning i want a little refreshment to enable me to get though my days duty the early suitor has come to pick up the worm of his affections and he laughed at his joke florence shuddered at the simile and thought to herself that there was a fair chance of the affectionate worm disagreeing with the early suitor eva said nothing she sat quite still and pale why what is the matter with you both have you seen a ghost not exactly but i think that eva has received a message from the dead said florence with a nervous laugh eva rose i think mr plowden she said that i had better be frank with you at once i ask you to listen to me for a few moments am i not always at your service dear eva i wish began eva and broke down i wish she went on again to appeal to your generosity and to your feelings as a gentleman florence smiled mr plowden bowed with mock humility and smiled too a very ugly smile you are aware that before i became engaged to you i had had a previous affair with the boy who committed a murder put in mr plowden with a gentleman who had the misfortune to kill a man in a duel explained eva the church and the law call it murder excuse me mr plowden we are dealing neither with the church nor the law we are dealing with the thing as it is called among gentlemen and ladies go on said mr plowden well misunderstandings which i need not now enter into arose with reference to that affair though as i told you i loved the man today i have heard from him and his letter puts everything straight in my mind and i see how wrong and unjust has been my behaviour to him and i know that i love him more than ever curse the fellows impudence said the clergyman furiously if he were here i would give him a bit of my mind evas spirit rose and she turned on him with flashing eyes looking like a queen in her imperial beauty if he were here mr plowden you would not dare to look him in the face men like you only take advantage of the absent the clergyman ground his teeth he felt his furious temper rising and did not dare to answer though he was a bold man in face of a woman he feared lest it should get beyond him but beneath his breath he muttered you shall pay for that my lady under these circumstances went on eva i appeal to you as a gentleman to release me from an engagement into which as you know i have been drawn more by force of circumstances than by my own wish surely it is not necessary for me to say any more mr plowden rose and came and stood quite close to her so that his face was within a few inches of her eyes eva he said i am not going to be trifled with like this you have promised to marry me and i shall keep you to your promise you laid yourself out to win my affection the affection of an honest man again florence smiled and eva made a faint motion of dissent yes but you did you encouraged me it is very well for you to deny it now when it suits your purpose but you did and you know it and your sister there knows it florence bowed her head in assent and now you wish in order to gratify an unlawful passion for a shedder of blood you wish to throw me over to trample upon my holiest feelings and to rob me of the prize which i have won no eva i will not release you surely surely mr plowden said eva faintly for she was a gentle creature and the mans violence overwhelmed her you will not force me into a marriage which i tell you is repugnant to me i appeal to your generosity to release me you can never oblige me to marry you when i tell you that i do not love you and that my whole heart is given to another man mr plowden saw that his violence was doing its work and determined to follow it up he raised his voice till it was almost a shout yes he said i will i will not submit to such wickedness love that will come i am quite willing to take my chance of it no i tell you fairly that i will not let you off and if you try to avoid fulfilling your engagement to me i will do more i will proclaim you all over the country as a jilt i will bring an action for breach of promise of marriage against you perhaps you did not know that men can do that as well as women and cover your name with disgrace look i have your written promise of marriage and he produced her letter eva turned to her sister florence she said cannot you say a word to help me i am overwhelmed i wish i could eva dear answered her sister kindly but how can i what mr plowden says is just and right you are engaged to him and are in honour bound to marry him o eva do not bring trouble and disgrace upon us all by your obstinacy you owe something to your name as well as to yourself and something to me too i am sure that mr plowden will be willing to forget all about this if you will undertake never to allude to it again o yes certainly miss florence i am not revengeful i only want my rights eva looked faintly from one to the other her head sank and great black rings painted themselves beneath her eyes the lily was broken at last you are very cruel she said slowly but i suppose it must be as you wish pray god i may die first that is all and she put her hands to her head and stumbled from the room leaving the two conspirators facing each other come we got over that capitally said mr plowden rubbing his hands there is nothing like taking the high hand with a woman ladies must sometimes be taught that gentlemen have rights as well as themselves florence turned on him with bitter scorn gentlemen mr plowden why is the word so often on your lips surely after the part you have just played you do not presume to rank yourself among gentlemen listen it suits my purposes that you should marry eva and you shall marry her but i will not stoop to play the hypocrite with a man like you you talk of yourself as a gentleman and do not scruple to force an innocent girl into a wicked marriage and to crush her spirit with your cunning cruelty a gentleman forsooth a satyr a devil in disguise i am only asserting my rights he said furiously and whatever i have done you have done more do not try your violence on me mr plowden it will not do i am not made of the same stuff as your victim lower your voice or leave the house and do not enter it again mr plowdens heavy underjaw fell a little he was terribly afraid of florence now she said listen i do not choose that you should labour under any mistake i hold your hand in this business though to have to do with you in any way is in itself a defilement and she wiped her delicate fingers on a pockethandkerchief as she said the word because i have an end of my own to gain not a vulgar end like yours but a revenge which shall be almost divine or diabolical call it which you will in its completeness perhaps it is a madness perhaps it is an inspiration perhaps it is a fate whatever it is it animates me body and soul and i will gratify it though to do so i have to use a tool like you i wished to explain this to you i wished too to make it clear to you that i consider you contemptible i have done both and i have now the pleasure to wish you goodmorning mr plowden left the house white with fury and cursing in a manner remarkable in a clergyman if she wasnt so handsome hang me if i would not throw the whole thing up he said needless to say he did nothing of the sort he only kept out of florences way chapter xiv the virgin martyr dorothy in her note to ernest that he received by the mail previous to the one that brought the letters which at a single blow laid the hope and promise of his life in the dust it may be remembered had stated her intention of going to see eva in order to plead ernests cause but what with one thing and another her visit was considerably delayed twice she was on the point of going and twice something occurred to prevent her the fact of the matter was the errand was distasteful and she was in no hurry to execute it she loved ernest herself and however deep that love might be trampled down however fast it might be chained in the dungeons of her secret thoughts it was still there a living thing an immortal thing she could tread it down and chain it she could not kill it its shade would rise and walk in the upper chambers of her heart and wring its hands and cry to her telling what it suffered in those subterranean places whispering how bitterly it envied the bright and happy life which moved in the free air and had usurped the love it claimed it was hard to have to ignore those pleadings to disregard those cries for pity and to say that there was no hope that it must always be chained till time ate away the chains it was harder still to have to be one of the actual ministers to the suffering still she meant to go her duty to ernest was not to be forsaken because it was a painful duty on two or three occasions she met eva but got no opportunity of speaking to her either her sister florence was with her or she was obliged to return immediately the truth was that after the scene described in the last chapter eva was subjected to the closest espionage at home florence watched her as a cat watches a mouse abroad mr plowden seemed to be constantly hovering on her flank or if he was not there then she became aware of the presence of the ancient and contemplative mariner who traded in dutch cheeses mr plowden feared lest she should run away and so cheat him of his prize florence lest she should confide in dorothy or possibly mr cardus and supported by them find the courage to assert herself and defraud her of her revenge so they watched her every movement at last dorothy made up her mind to wait no longer for opportunities but to go and see eva at her own home she knew nothing of the plowden imbroglio but it did strike her as curious that no one had said anything about ernest he had written it was scarcely likely the letter had miscarried how was it that eva had not said anything on the subject little did dorothy guess that even as these thoughts were passing through her mind a great vessel was steaming out of southampton docks bearing those epistles of final renunciation which ernest very little to his satisfaction received in due course full of these reflections dorothy found herself one lovely spring afternoon knocking at the door of the cottage eva was at home and she was at once ushered into her presence she was sitting in a low chair the same on which ernest always pictured her with that confounded skye terrier she was so fond of kissing an open book upon her knee and looking out at the little garden and the sea beyond she looked pale and thin dorothy thought on her visitors entrance eva rose and kissed her i am so glad to see you she said i was feeling lonely lonely answered dorothy in her straightforward way why i have been trying to find you alone for the last fortnight and have never succeeded eva coloured one may be lonely with ever so many people round one then for a minute or so they talked about the weather so persistently did they discuss it indeed that the womanly instinct of each told her that the other was fencing after all it was eva who broke the ice first have you heard from ernest lately she said nervously yes i got a note by last mail oh said eva clasping her hands involuntarily what did he say nothing much but i got a letter by the mail before that in which he said a good deal among other things he said he had written to you did you get the letter eva coloured to her eyes yes she whispered dorothy rose and seated herself again on a footstool by evas feet and wondered at the trouble in her eyes how could she be troubled when she had heard from ernest like that what did you answer him dear eva covered her face with her hands do not talk about it she said it is too dreadful to me what can you mean he tells me you are engaged to him yes that is no i was half engaged now i am engaged to mr plowden dorothy gave a gasp of horrified astonishment engaged to that man when you were engaged to ernest you must be joking o dorothy i am not joking i wish to heaven i were i am engaged to him i am to marry him in less than a month o pity me i am wretched you mean to tell me said dorothy rising that you are engaged to mr plowden when you love ernest yes oh yes i cannot help at that moment the door opened and florence entered attended by mr plowden her keen eyes saw at once that something was wrong and her intelligence told her what it was after her bold fashion she determined to take the bull by the horns unless something were done with dorothy at her back eva might prove obdurate after all advancing she shook dorothy cordially by the hand i see from your face she said that you have just heard the good news mr plowden is so shy that he would not consent to announce it before but here he is to receive your congratulations mr plowden took the cue and advanced effusively on dorothy with outstretched hand yes miss jones i am sure you will congratulate me and i ought to be congratulated i am the luckiest here he broke off it really was very awkward his hand remained limply hanging in the air before dorothy but not the slightest sign did that dignified little lady show of taking it on the contrary she drew herself up to her full height which was not very tall and fixing her steady blue eyes on the clergymans shifty orbs deliberately placed her right hand behind her back i do not shake hands with people who play such tricks she said quietly mr plowdens hand fell to his side and he stepped back he did not expect such courage in anything so small florence however sailed in to the rescue really dorothy we do not quite understand o yes i think you do florence or if you do not then i will explain eva here was engaged to marry ernest kershaw eva here has just with her own lips told me that she still loves ernest but that she is obliged to marry that man and she pointed with her little forefinger at mr plowden who recoiled another step is not that true eva eva bowed her head by way of answer she still sat in the low chair with her hands over her face really dorothy i fail to see what right you have to interfere in this matter said florence i have the right of common justice florence the right a friend has to protect the absent are you not ashamed of such a wicked plot to wrong an absent man is there no way addressing mr plowden in which i can appeal to your feelings to induce you to free this wretched girl you have entrapped i only ask my own said mr plowden sulkily for shame for shame and you a minister of gods word and you too florence oh now i can read your heart and see the bad thoughts looking from your eyes florence for a moment was abashed and turned her face aside and you eva how can you become a party to such a shameful thing you a good girl to sell yourself away from dear ernest to such a man as that and again she pointed contemptuously at mr plowden oh dont dorothy dont it is my duty you dont understand yes eva i do understand i understand that it is your duty to drown yourself before you do such a thing i am a woman as well as you and though i am not beautiful i have a heart and a conscience and i understand only too well you will be lost if you drown yourself i mean it is very wicked said mr plowden to eva suddenly assuming his clerical character as most likely to be effective the suggestion alarmed him he had bargained for a live eva yes mr plowden went on dorothy you are right it would be wicked but not so wicked as to marry you god gave us women our lives but he put a spirit in our hearts which tells us that we should rather throw them away than suffer ourselves to be degraded oh eva tell me that you will not do this shameful thing no do not whisper to her florence dorothy dorothy said eva rising and wringing her hands it is all useless do not break my heart with your cruel words i must marry him i have fallen into the power of people who do not know what mercy is thank you said florence mr plowden scowled darkly then i have done and dorothy walked towards the door before she reached it she paused and turned one word and i will trouble you no more what do you all expect will come of this wicked marriage there was no answer then dorothy went but her efforts did not stop there she made her way straight to mr carduss office o reginald she said i have such dreadful news for you there let me cry a little first and i will tell you and she did telling him the whole story from beginning to end it was entirely new to him and he listened with some astonishment and with a feeling of something like indignation against ernest he had intended that young gentleman to fall in love with dorothy and behold he had fallen in love with eva alas for the perversity of youth well he said when she had done and what do you wish me to do it seems that you have to do with a heartless scheming woman a clerical cad and a beautiful fool one might deal with the schemer and the fool but no power on earth can soften the cad at least that is my experience besides i think the whole thing is much better left alone i should be very sorry to see ernest married to a woman so worthless as this eva must be she is handsome it is true and that is about all she is as far as i can see dont distress yourself my dear he will get over it and after he has had his fling out there and lived down that duel business he will come home and if he is wise i know where he will look for consolation dorothy tossed her head and coloured it is not a question of consolation she said it is a question of ernests happiness in life dont alarm yourself dorothy peoples happiness is not so easily affected he will forget all about her in a year i think that men always talk of each other like that reginald said dorothy resting her head upon her hands and looking straight at the old gentleman each of you likes to think that he has a monopoly of feeling and that the rest of his kind are as shallow as a milkpan and yet it was only last night that you were talking to me about my mother you told me you remember that life had been a worthless thing to you since she was torn from you which no success had been able to render pleasant you said more you said that you hoped that the end was not far off that you had suffered enough and waited enough and that though you had not seen her face for fiveandtwenty years you loved her as wildly as you did the day when she first promised to become your wife mr cardus had risen and was looking through the glass door at the blooming orchids dorothy got up and following him laid her hand upon his shoulder reginald she said think ernest is about to be robbed of his wife under circumstances curiously like those by which you were robbed of yours unless it is prevented what you have suffered all your life he will suffer also remember you are of the same blood and allowing for the difference between your ages of very much the same temperament too think how different life would have been to you if any one had staved off your disaster and then i am sure you will do all you can to stave off his life would have been nonexistent for you he answered for you would never have been born ah well she said with a little sigh i am sure i should have got on every well without i could have spared myself mr cardus was a keen man and could see as far into the human heart as most girl he said contracting his white eyebrows and suddenly turning round upon her you love ernest yourself i have often suspected it now i am sure you do dorothy flinched yes she answered i do love him what then and yet you are advocating my interference to secure his marriage with another woman a worthless creature who does not know her own mind you cannot really care about him care about him and she turned her sweet blue eyes upwards i love him with all my heart and soul and strength i have always loved him i always shall love him i love him so well that i can do my duty to him reginald it is my duty to strain every nerve to prevent this marriage i had rather that my heart should ache than ernests i implore of you to help me dorothy it has always been my dearest wish that you should marry ernest i told him so just before that unhappy duel i love you both all the fibres of my heart that are left alive have wound themselves around you jeremy i could never care for indeed i fear that i used sometimes to treat the boy harshly he reminds me so of his father and do you know my dear i sometimes think that on that point i am not quite sane but because you have asked me to do it and because you have quoted your dear mother may peace be with her i will do what i can this girl eva is of age and i will write and offer her a home she need fear no persecution here you are kind and good reginald and i thank you the letter shall go by tonights post but run away now i see my friend de talor coming to speak to me and the white eyebrows drew near together in a way that it would have been unpleasant for the great de talor to behold that business is drawing towards its end o reginald answered dorothy shaking her forefinger at him in her old childish way havent you given up those ideas yet they are very wrong never mind dorothy i shall give them up soon when i have squared accounts with de talor a year or two more a stern chase is a long chase you know and the thing will be done and then i shall become a good christian again the letter was written it offered eva a home and protection in due course an answer signed by eva herself came back it thanked him for his kindness and regretted that circumstances and her sense of duty prevented her from accepting the offer then dorothy felt that she had done all that in her lay and gave the matter up it was about this time that florence drew another picture it represented eva as andromeda gazing hopelessly in the dim light of a ghastly dawn out across a glassy sea and far away in the oily depths there was a ripple and beneath the ripple a form travelling towards the chained maiden the form had a human head and cold grey eyes and its features were those of mr plowden and so day by day destiny throned in space shot her flaming shuttle from darkness into darkness and the time passed on as time must pass till the inevitable end of all things is attained eva existed and suffered and that was all she did she scarcely ate or drank or slept but still she lived she was not brave enough to die and the chains were riveted too tight round her tender wrists to let her flee away poor nineteenthcentury andromeda no perseus shall come to save you the sun rose and set in his appointed course the flowers bloomed and died children were born and the allotted portion of mankind passed onwards to its rest but no godlike perseus came flying out of the golden east once more the sun rose the dragon heaved his head above the quiet waters and she was lost by her own act of her own folly and weakness she was undone behold her the wedding is over the echoes of the loud mockery of the bells have scarcely died upon the noonday air and in her chamber the chamber of her free and happy maidenhood the virgin martyr stands alone it is done there lie the sickly scented flowers there too the brides white robe it is done oh that life were done too that she might once more press her lips to his and die the door opens and florence stands before her pale triumphant aweinspiring i must congratulate you my dear eva you really went through the ceremony very well only you looked like a statue florence why do you come to mock me mock you eva mock you i come to wish you joy as mr plowdens wife i hope that you will be happy happy i shall never be happy i detest him you detest him and you marry him there must be some mistake there is no mistake o ernest my darling florence smiled if ernest is your darling why did you not marry ernest how could i marry him when you forced me into this forced you a free woman of full age cannot be forced you married mr plowden of your own will you might have married ernest kershaw if you chose he is in many ways a more desirable match than mr plowden but you did not choose florence what do you mean you always said it was impossible is this all some cruel plot of yours impossible there is nothing impossible to those who have courage yes and she turned upon her sister fiercely it was a plot and you shall know it you poor weak fool i loved ernest kershaw and you robbed me of him although you promised to leave him alone and so i have revenged myself upon you i despise you i tell you you are quite contemptible and yet he could prefer you to me well he has got his reward you have deserted him when he was absent and in trouble and you have outraged his love and your own you have fallen very low indeed eva and presently you will fall lower yet i know you well you will sink till at last you even lose the sense of your own humiliation dont you wonder what ernest must think of you now there is mr plowden calling you come it is time for you to be going eva listened aghast and then sank against the wall sobbing despairingly chapter xv hanss city of rest mr alston ernest and jeremy had very good sport among the elephants killing in all nineteen bulls it was during this expedition that an incident occurred which in its effect endeared ernest to mr alston more than ever the boy roger who always went wherever mr alston went was the object of his fathers most tender solicitude he believed in the boy as he believed in little else in the world for at heart mr alston was a sad cynic and to a certain extent the boy justified his belief he was quick intelligent and plucky much such a boy as you may pick up by the dozen out of any english public school except that his knowledge of men and manners was more developed as is usual among young colonists at the age of twelve master roger alston knew many things denied to most children of his age on the subject of education mr alston had queer ideas the best education for a boy he would say is to mix with grownup gentlemen if you send him to school he learns little except mischief if you let him live with gentlemen he learns at any rate to be a gentleman but whatever master roger knew he did not know much about elephants and on this point he was destined to gain some experience one day it was just after they had got into the elephant country they were all engaged in following the fresh spoor of a solitary bull but though an elephant is a big beast it is hard work catching him up because he never seems to get tired and this was exactly what our party of hunters found they followed that energetic elephant for hours but they could not catch him though the spoorers told them that he was certainly not more than a mile or so ahead at last the sun began to get low and their legs had already grown weary so they gave it up for that day determining to camp where they were this being so after a rest ernest and the boy roger started out of camp to see if they could not shoot a buck or some birds for supper roger had a repeating winchester carbine ernest a doublebarrelled shotgun hardly had they left the camp when aasvцgel jeremys hottentot came running in and reported that he had seen the elephant an enormous bull with a white spot upon his trunk feeding in a clump of mimosa not a quarter of a mile away up jumped mr alston and jeremy as fresh as though they had not walked a mile and seizing their doubleeight elephant rifles started off with aasvцgel meanwhile ernest and roger had been strolling towards this identical clump of mimosa as they neared it the former saw some guineafowl run into the shelter of the trees capital he said guineafowl are firstclass eating now roger just you go into the bush and drive the flock over me ill stand here and make believe they are pheasants the lad did as he was bid but in order to get well behind the covey of guineafowl which are dreadful things to run he made a little circuit through the thickest part of the clump as he did so his quick eye was arrested by a most unusual performance on the part of one of the flatcrowned mimosatrees suddenly and without the slightest apparent reason it rose into the air and then behold where its crown had been a moment before appeared its roots such an alice in wonderland sort of performance on the part of a tree could not but excite the curiosity of an intelligent youth accordingly roger pushed forwards and slipped round an intervening tree this was what he saw in a little glade about ten paces from him flapping its ears stood an enormous elephant with great white tusks looking as large as a house and as cool as a cucumber nobody to look at the brute would have believed that he had given them a twenty miles trot under a burning sun he was now refreshing himself by pulling up mimosatrees as easily as though they were radishes and eating the sweet fibrous roots roger saw this and his heart burned with ambition to kill that elephant the mighty great beast about a hundred times as big as himself who could pull up a large tree and make his dinner off the roots roger was a plucky boy and in his sportsmanlike zeal he quite forgot that a repeating carbine is not exactly the weapon one would choose to shoot elephants with indeed without giving the matter another thought he lifted the little rifle aimed it at the great beasts head and fired he hit it somewhere that was very clear for next moment the air resounded with the most terrific scream of fury that it had ever been his lot to hear that scream was too much for him he turned and fled swiftly elephants were evidently difficult things to kill fortunately for roger the elephant could not for some seconds make out where his tiny assailant was presently however he winded him and came crashing after him screaming shrilly with his trunk and tail well up on hearing the shot and the scream of the elephant ernest who was standing some way out in the open in anticipation of a driving shot of the guineafowl had run towards the spot where roger had entered the bush and just as he got opposite to it out he came scuttling along for his life with the elephant not more than twenty paces behind him then ernest did a brave thing make for the bush he yelled to the boy who at once swerved to the right on thundered the elephant straight towards ernest but with ernest it was evident that he considered he had no quarrel for presently he tried to swing himself round after roger then ernest lifted his shotgun and sent a charge of no into the brutes face stinging him sadly it was humanly speaking certain death which he courted but at the moment his main idea was to save the boy screaming afresh the elephant abandoned the pursuit of roger and made straight for ernest who fired the other barrel of smallshot in the vain hope of blinding him by now the boy had pulled up being some forty yards off and seeing ernest just about to be crumpled up wildly fired the repeating rifle in their direction some good angel must have guided the little bullet for as it happened it struck the elephant in the region of the knee and forcing its way in slightly injured a tendon and brought the great beast thundering to the ground ernest had only just time to dodge to one side as the huge mass came to the earth indeed as it was he got a tap from the tip of the elephants trunk which knocked him down and though he did not feel it at the time made him sore for days afterwards in a moment however he was up again and away at his best speed legging it as he had never legged it before in his life and so was the elephant people have no idea at what a pace an elephant can go when he is out of temper until they put it to the proof had it not been the slight injury to the knee and the twentyyards start he got ernest would have been represented by little pieces before he was ten seconds older as it was when a hundred and fifty yards farther on elephant and ernest broke upon the astonished view of mr alston and jeremy who were hurrying up to the scene of action they were almost one flesh that is the tip of the elephants trunk was now up in the air and now about six inches off the seat of ernests trousers at which it snapped convulsively up went jeremys rifle which luckily he had in his hand behind the shoulder halfway down the ear said mr alston beckoning to a kafir to bring his rifle which he was carrying the probability of jeremys stopping the beast at that distance they were quite sixty yards off was infinitesimal there was a seconds pause the snapping tip touched the retreating trousers but did not get hold of them and the contact sent a magnetic thrill up ernests back boom thud crash and the elephant was down dead as a doornail jeremy had made no mistake the bullet went straight through the great brutes heart and broke the shoulder on the other side he was one of those men who not only rarely miss but always seem to hit their game in the right place ernest sank exhausted on the ground and mr alston and jeremy rushed up rejoicing near go that ernest said the former ernest nodded in reply he could not speak by jove where is roger he went on turning pale as he missed his son for the first time but at this moment that young gentleman hove in sight and recovering from his fright when he saw that the great animal was stonedead rushed up with yells of exultation and climbing on to the upper tusk began to point out where he had hit him meanwhile mr alston had extracted the story of the adventure from ernest you young rascal he said to his son come off that tusk do you know that if it had not been for mr kershaw here who courted almost certain death to save you from the results of your own folly you would be as dead as that elephant and as flat as a biscuit come down sir and offer up your thanks to providence and mr kershaw that you have a sound square inch of skin left on your worthless young body roger descended accordingly considerably crestfallen never you mind roger that was a most rattling good shot of yours at his knee said ernest who had now got his breath back again you would not do it again if you fired at elephants for a week and so the matter passed off but afterwards mr alston thanked ernest with tears in his eyes for saving his sons life this was the first elephant they killed and also the largest it measured ten feet eleven inches at the shoulder and the tusks weighed when dried out about sixty pounds each they remained in the elephant country for nearly four months when the approach of the unhealthy season forced them to leave it not however before they had killed a great quantity of large game of all sorts it was a most successful hunt so successful indeed that the ivory they brought down paid all the expenses of the trip and left a handsome surplus over it was on the occasion of their return to pretoria that ernest made the acquaintance of a curious character in a curious way as soon as they reached the boundaries of the transvaal ernest bought a horse from a boer on which he used to ride after the herds of buck which swarmed upon the high veld they had none with them because in the country where they had been shooting no horse would live one day as they were travelling slowly along a little before midday a couple of bullvilderbeeste galloped across the waggontrack about two hundred yards in front of the oxen the voorlooper stopped the oxen in order to give ernest who was sitting on the waggonbox with a rifle by his side a steady shot ernest fired at the last of the two galloping bulls the line was good but he did not make sufficient allowance for the pace at which the bull was travelling with the result that instead of striking it forwards and killing it the bullet shattered its flank and did not stop its career dash it said ernest when he saw what he had done i cant leave the poor beast like that bring me my horse i will go after him and finish him the horse which was tied already saddled behind the waggon was quickly brought and ernest mounting told them not to keep the waggons for him as he would strike across country and meet them at the outspan place about a mile or so on then he started after his wounded bull which could be plainly discerned standing with one leg up on the crest of a rise about a thousand yards away but if ever a vilderbeeste was possessed by a fixed determination not to be finished off it was that particular vilderbeeste the pace at which a vilderbeeste can travel on three legs when he is not too fat is perfectly astonishing and ernest had traversed a couple of miles of great rolling plain before he even got within fair galloping distance of him he had a good horse however and at last he got within fifty yards and then away they went at a merry pace ernests object being to ride alongside and put a bullet through him their gallop lasted a good two miles or more on the level ernest gained on the vilderbeeste but whenever they came to a patch of antbear holes or a ridge of stones the vilderbeeste had the pull and drew away again at last they came to a dry pan or lake about half a mile broad crowded with hundreds of buck of all sorts which scampered away as they came tearing along here ernest at length drew up level with his quarry and grasping the rifle with his right hand tried to get it so that he could put a bullet through the beast and drop him but it was no easy matter as any one who has ever tried it will know and while he was still making up his mind the vilderbeeste slewed round and came at him bravely had his horse been unused to the work he must have had his inside ripped out by the crooked horns but he was an old hunter and equal to the occasion to turn was impossible the speed was too great but he managed to slew with the result that the charging animal brushed his head instead of landing himself in his belly at the same moment ernest stretched out his rifle and pulled the trigger and as it chanced put the bullet right through the vilderbeeste and dropped him dead then he pulled up and dismounting cut off some of the best of beef with his huntingknife stowed it away in a saddlebag and set off on his horse now pretty well fagged to find the waggons but to find a waggontrack on the great veld unless you have in the first instance taken the most careful bearings is almost as difficult as it would be to return from a distance to any given spot on the ocean without a compass there are no trees or hills to guide the travellers nothing but a vast wilderness of land resembling a sea petrified in a heavy swell ernest rode on for three or four miles as he thought retracing his steps over the line of country he had traversed and at last to his joy struck the path there were waggontracks on it but he thought they did not look quite fresh however he followed them faute de mieux for some five miles then he became convinced that they could not have been made by his waggons he had overshot the mark and must hark back so he turned his weary horses head and made his way along the road to the spot where his spoor struck into it the waggons must be outspanned waiting for him a little farther back he went on one mile two three no waggons a little to the left of the road was an eminence he rode to it and up and scanned the horizon o joy there far away five or six miles off was the white cap of a waggon he rode to it straight across country once he got bogged in a vlei or swamp and had to throw himself off and drag his horse out by the bridle he struggled on and at last came to the dip in which he had seen the waggontent it was a great white stone perched on a mound of brown ones by this time he had utterly lost his reckoning just then to make matters worse a thundershower came up with a bitter wind and drenched him to the skin the rain passed but the wind did not it blew like ice and chilled his frame enervated with the tropical heat in which he had been living through and through he wandered on aimlessly till suddenly his tired horse put his foot in a hole and fell heavily throwing him on to his head and shoulder for a few minutes his senses left him but he recovered and mounting his wornout horse wandered on again luckily he had broken no bones had he done so he would probably have perished miserably in that lonely place the sun was sinking now and he was faint for want of food for he had eaten nothing that day but a biscuit he had not even a pipe of tobacco with him just as the sun vanished he hit a little path or what might once have been a path he followed it till the pitchy darkness set in then he got off his horse and took off the saddle which he put down on the bare black veld for a fire had recently swept off the dry grass and wrapping the saddlecloth round his feet laid his aching head upon the saddle the reins he hitched round his arm lest the horse should stray away from him to look for food the wind was bitterly cold and he was wet through the hyenas came and howled at him he cut off a piece of the raw vilderbeestebeef and chewed it but it turned his stomach and he spat it out then he shivered and sank into a torpor from which there was a poor chance of his awakening how long he lay so he did not know it seemed a few minutes it was really an hour when suddenly he was awakened by feeling something shaking him by the shoulder what is it he said wearily wat is it ach himmel wat is it dat is just wat i wants to know wat do you here you shall die so the voice was the voice of a german and ernest knew german well i have lost my way he said in that language i cannot find the waggons ah you can speak the tongue of the vaterland said his visitor still addressing him in english i will embrace you and he did so ernest sighed it is a bore to be embraced in the dark by an unknown male german when you feel that you are not far off dissolution you are hungered said the german ernest signified that he was and athirsted again he signified assent and perhaps you have no gui tobacco no none good my little wife my wilhelmina shall find you all these things what the devil thought ernest to himself can a german be doing with his little wife in this place by this time the stars had come out and gave some light come rouse yourself and come and see my little wife o the pferd horse we will tie him to my wife ah she is beautiful though her leg shakes o yes you will love her the deuce i shall ejaculated ernest and then mindful of the good things the lady in question was to provide him with he added solemnly lead on macduff macduffer my name is not so my name is hans all ze great south africa know me very well and all south africa love my wife really said ernest although he was so miserable he began to feel that the situation was interesting a lady to whom his horse was to be tied and whom all south africa was enamoured of could hardly fail to be interesting rising he advanced a step or two with his friend who he could now see was a large burly man with white hair apparently about sixty years of age presently they came to something that in the dim light reminded him of the handhearse in kesterwick church only it had two wheels instead of four and no springs behold my beautiful wife said the german soon i will show you how her leg shakes it shakes o horrid is is the lady inside asked ernest it occurred to him that his friend might be carting about a corpse inside no she is outside she is all over and stepping back the german put his head on one side in a most comical fashion and regarding the unofficial hearse with the deepest affection said in a low voice ah liebe vrouw ah wilhelmina is you tired my dear and how is your poor leg and he caught hold of a groggy wheel and shook it had ernest been a little less wretched and one degree further off starvation it is probable that he would have exploded with laughter for he had a keen sense of the ludicrous but he had not got a laugh left in him and besides he was afraid of offending the german so he merely murmured poor poor leg sympathetically and then alluded to the question of eatables ah yes of course let us see what wilhelmina shall give us and he trotted round to the back end of the cart which in keeping with its hearselike character opened by means of two little foldingdoors and pulled out first two blankets one of which he gave to ernest to put round his shoulders second a large piece of biltong or sundried game flesh and some biscuits and third a bottle of peachbrandy on these viands they fell to and though they were not in themselves of an appetising nature ernest never enjoyed anything more in his life their meal did not take very long and after it his friend hans produced some excellent boer tobacco and over their pipes ernest told him how he had lost his way hans asked him what road he had been travelling on the rustenburg road then my friend you are not more than one thousand paces off it my wife and i we travel along him all day till just now wilhelmina she think she would like to come up here and so i come and now you see the reason why she know you lie here and die in the cold and she turn up to save your life ah the good woman ernest was greatly relieved to hear that he was so near the road as once upon it he would have no difficulty in falling in with the waggons clearly during the latter part of his wanderings he must have unknowingly approached it his mind relieved upon this point was at liberty to satisfy its curiosity about his friend he soon discovered that he was a harmless lunatic whose craze it was to wander all over south africa dragging his handcart after him he made no fixed point nor had he any settled round the beginning of the year might find him near the zambesi and the end near cape town or anywhere else by the natives he was looked upon as inspired and invariably treated with respect and he lived upon what was given to him or what he shot as he walked along this mode of life he had pursued for years and though he had many adventures he never came to harm you see my friend said the simple man in answer to ernests inquiries i make my wife down there in scatterdorp in the old colony the houses are a long way off each other there and the church it is in the middle and the good volk there they die very fast and did get tired of carrying each other to be buried and so they come to me and say hans you are a carpenter you must make a beautiful black cart to put us in when we die and so i set to and i work and work and work at my cart till i gets quite what do you call him stoopid and then one night just as my cart was finished i dreams that she and i are travelling along a wide straight road like the road on the high veld and i knows that she is my wife and that we must travel always together till we reach the city of rest and far far away above the top of a high mountain like the drakensberg i see a great wide tree rooted on a cloud and covered all over with beautiful snow that shined in the sunlight like the diamonds at kimberley and i know that under that tree is the gate of the real rustenburg the city of rest and my wife and i we must journey on on on till we find it where do you come from now from utrecht from out of the east where the sun rises so red every morning over zululand the land of bloodshed o the land will run with blood there i know it wilhelmina told me as we came along but i dont know when but you are tired good you shall sleep with wilhelmina i will sleep beneath her no you shall or she will be what you call him offended ernest crept into the cavity and at once fell asleep and dreamed that he had been buried alive suddenly in the middle of the night there was a most fearful jolt caused by his horse which was tied to the pole of wilhelmina having pulled the prop aside and let the pole down with a run this ernest mistook for the resurrection and was extremely relieved to find himself in error at dawn he emerged bade his friend farewell and gaining the road rejoined the waggons in safety chapter xvi ernest accepts a commission a young man of that ardent impetuous intelligent mind which makes him charming and a thing to love as contrasted with the young man of the sober cautious moneymaking mind infinitely the more useful article which makes him a comfort to his relatives and a thing to respect avoid and marry your daughter to has two great safeguards standing between him and the ruin which dogs the heels of the ardent the impetuous and the intelligent these are his religion and his belief in women it is probable that he will start on his erratic career with a full store of both he has never questioned the former the latter so far as his own class in life is concerned are to him all sweet and good and perhaps there is one particular star who only shines for him and is the sweetest and best of them all but one day the sweetest and best of all throws him over being a younger son and marries his eldest brother or a paralytic cottonspinner of enormous wealth and uncertain temper and then a sudden change comes over the spirit of the ardent intelligent and impetuous one not being of a wellbalanced mind he rushes to the other extreme and believes in his sore heart that all women would throw over such as he and marry eldest brothers or superannuated cottonspinners he may be right or he may be wrong the materials for ascertaining the fact are wanting for all women engaged to impecunious young gentlemen to not get the chance but right or wrong the result upon the sufferer is the same his faith in women is shaken if not destroyed nor does the mischief stop there his religion often follows his belief in the other sex for in some mysterious way the two things are interwoven a young man of the nobler class of mind in love is generally for the time being a religious man his affection lifts him more or less above the things of earth and floats him on its radiant wings a days journey nearer heaven the same thing applies conversely if a mans religious belief is emasculated he becomes suspicious of the sweetest and best he grows cynical and no longer puts faith in superlatives from atheism there is but a small step to misogyny or rather to that disbelief in humanity which embraces a profounder constituent disbelief in its feminine section and in turn as already said the misogynist walks daily along the edge of atheism of course there is a way out of these discouraging results if the mind that suffers and falls through its suffering be of the truly noble order it may in time come to see that this world is a world not of superlatives but of the most arid positives with here and there a little comparative oasis to break the monotony of its general outline its owner may learn that the fault lay with him for believing too much for trusting too far for setting up as an idol a creature exactly like himself only several degrees lower beneath proof and at last he may come to see that though sweetest and bests are chimerical there are women in the world who may fairly be called sweet and good or to return to the converse side of the picture it may occur to our young gentleman that although providence starts us in the world with a full inherited or indoctrinated belief in a given religion that is not what providence understands by faith faith perfect faith is only to be won by struggle and in most cultivated minds by the passage through the dim mirageclad land of disbelief the true believer is he who has trodden down disbelief not he who has run away from it when we have descended from the height of our childhood when we have entertained apollyon and having considered what he has to say given him battle and routed him in the plain then and not till then can we say with guileless hearts lord i believe and feel no need to add the sadly qualifying words help thou mine unbelief now these are more or less principles of human nature they may not be universally true probably nothing is that is as we define and understand truth but they apply to the majority of those cases which fall strictly within their limits among others they applied rather strikingly to ernest kershaw evas desertion struck his belief in womanhood to the ground and soon his religion lay in the dust beside it of this his life for some years after that event gave considerable evidence he took to evil ways he forgot his better self he raced horses he devoted himself with great success to loveaffairs that he would have done better to leave alone sometimes to his shame be it said he drank for the excitement of drinking not for the love of it in short he gave himself and all his fund of energy up to any and every excitement and dissipation he could command and he managed to command a good many travelling rapidly from place to place in south africa he was well known and well liked in all now he was at kimberley now at king williams town now at durban in each of these places he kept racehorses in each there was some fair womans face that grew the brighter for his coming but ernests face did not grow brighter on the contrary his eyes acquired a peculiar sadness which was almost pathetic in one so young he could not forget for a few days or a few months he might stifle thought but it always rerose eva pale queen of women was ever there to haunt his sleep and though in his waking hours he might curse her memory when night drew the veil from truth the words he murmured were words of love eternal he no longer prayed he no longer reverenced woman but he was not the happier for having freed his soul from these burdens he despised himself occasionally he would take stock of his mental condition and at each stocktaking he would notice that he had receded not progressed he was growing coarse his finer sense was being blunted he was no longer the same ernest who had written that queer letter to his betrothed before disaster overwhelmed him slowly and surely he was sinking he knew it but he did not try to save himself why should he he had no object in life but at times a great depression and weariness of existence would take possession of him it has been said that he never prayed that is not strictly true once or twice he did throw himself upon his knees and pray with all his strength that he might die he did more he persistently courted death and as is usual in such cases it persistently avoided him about taking his own life he had scruples or perhaps he would have taken it in those dark days he hated life and in his calmer and more reflective moments he loathed the pleasures and excitements by means of which he strove to make it palatable his was a fine strung mind and in spite of himself he shuddered when it was set to play such coarse music during those years ernest seemed to bear a charmed existence there was a wellknown thoroughbred horse in the transvaal which had killed two men in rapid succession ernest bought it and rode it and it never hurt him disturbances broke out in secocoenis country and one of the chief strongholds was ordered to be stormed ernest rode down from pretoria with jeremy to see the fun and reaching the fort the day before the attack got leave to join the storming party accordingly next day at dawn they attacked in the teeth of a furious fusillade and in time took the place though with very heavy loss to themselves jeremys hat was shot off with one bullet and his hand cut by another ernest as usual came off scathless the man next to him was killed but he was not touched after that he insisted upon going buffaloshooting towards delagoa bay in the height of the feverseason having got rid of jeremy by persuading him to go to new scotland to see about a tract of land they had bought he started with a dozen bearers and mazooku six weeks later he mazooku and three bearers returned all the rest were dead of fever on another occasion alston jeremy and himself were sent on a political mission to a hostile chief whose stronghold lay in the heart of almost inaccessible mountains the indaba palaver took all day and was purposely prolonged in order to enable the intelligent native to set an ambush in the pass through which the white chiefs must go back with strict instructions to murder all three of them when they left the stronghold the moon was rising and as they neared the pass up she came behind the mountains in all her splendour flooding the wide valley behind them with her mysterious light and throwing a pale sad lustre on every stone and tree on they rode steadily through the moonlight and the silence little guessing how near death was to them the faint beauty of the scene sank deep into ernests heart and presently when they came to a spot where a track ran out loopwise from the main pass returning to it a couple of miles farther on he half insisted on their taking it because it passed over yet higher ground and would give them a better view of the moonbathed valley mr alston grumbled at his nonsense and complied and meanwhile a party of murderers half a mile farther on played with their assegais and wondered why they did not hear the sound of the white mens feet but the white men had already passed along the higher path threequarters of a mile to their right ernests love of moonlight effects had saved them all from a certain and perhaps from a lingering death it was shortly after this incident that ernest and jeremy were seated together on the verandah of the same house at pretoria where they had been living before they went on the elephant hunt and which they had now purchased ernest had been in the garden watering a cucumberplant he was trying to develop from a very sickly seedling even if he only stopped a month in a place he would start a little garden it was a habit of his presently he came back to the verandah where jeremy was as usual watching the battle of the red and black ants which after several years encounter was not yet finally decided curse that cucumberplant said ernest emphatically it wont grow i tell you what it is jeremy i am sick of this place i vote we go away for goodness sake ernest let us have a little rest you do rattle one about so in those confounded postcarts replied jeremy yawning i mean go away from south africa altogether oh said jeremy dragging his great frame into an upright position the deuce you do and where do you want to go to england england no i have had enough of england south america i think but perhaps you want to go home it is not fair to keep dragging you all over the world my dear fellow i like it i assure you i have no wish to return to mr carduss stool for goodness sake dont suggest such a thing i should be wretched yes but you ought to be doing something with your life it is all very well for me who am a poor devil of a waif and stray to go on with this sort of existence but i dont see why you should you should be making your way in the world wait a bit my hearty said jeremy with his slow smile i am going to read you a statement of our financial affairs which i drew up last night considering that we have been doing nothing all this time except enjoy ourselves and that all our investments have been made out of income which no doubt your respected uncle fancies we have dissipated i do not think that the total is so bad and jeremy read landed property in natal and the transvaal estimated value ј this house stocks waggons etc say racehorses i have left that blank put them at ј said ernest after thinking you know i won ј with lady mary on the cape town plate last week jeremy went on racehorses and winnings ј sundries cash balance c total ј now of this we have actually saved and invested about twentyfive hundred the rest we have made or it has accumulated now i ask you where could we have done better than that as things go so dont talk to me about wasting my time bravo jeremy my uncle was right after all you ought to have been a lawyer you are firstclass at figures i congratulate you on your management of the estates my system is simple answered jeremy whenever there is any money to spare i buy something with it then you are not likely to spend it then when i have things enough waggons oxen horses what not i sell them and buy some land that cant run away if you only do that sort of thing long enough you will grow rich at last sweetly simple certainly well five thousand will go a long way towards stocking a farm or something in south america or wherever we make up our minds to go and then i dont think that we need draw on my uncle any more it is hardly fair to drain him so old alston will come with us i think and will put in another five thousand he told me some time ago that he was getting tired of south africa with its boers and blacks in his old age and had a fancy to make a start in some other place i will write to him tonight what hotel is he staying at in maritzburg the royal isnt it and then i vote we clear in the spring right you are my hearty but i say jeremy i really should advise you to think twice before you come a fine upstanding young man like you should not waste his sweetness on the desert air of mexico or any such place you should go home and be admired of the young women they appreciate a great big chap like you and make a good marriage and rear up a large family in a virtuous respectable and joneslike fashion i am a sort of wandering comet without the shine but i repeat i see no reason why you should play tail to a secondclass comet married get married i no thank you my boy look you ernest in the words of the prophet when a wise man openeth his eye and seeth a thing verily he shutteth it not up again now i opened my eye and saw one or two things in the course of our joint little affair eva you know ernest winced at the name i beg your pardon said jeremy noticing it i dont want to allude to painful subjects but i must to make my meaning clear i was very hard hit you know over that lady but i stopped in time and not having any imagination to speak of did not give it rein what is the consequence i have got over it sleep well at night have a capital appetite and dont think about her twice a week but with you it is different hard hit too large amount of imagination galloping about loose so to speak rapturous joy dreams of true love and perfect union of souls which no doubt would be well enough if the woman could put in her whack of soul which she cant not having it to spare but in a general way is gammon results when the burstup comes want of sleep want of appetite a desire to go buffaloshooting in the feverseason and to be potted by basutos from behind rocks in short a general weariness and disgust of life o yes you neednt deny it i have watched you most unwholesome state of mind further results horseracing a disposition to stop away from church and nip cape sherry and worse sign of all a leaning to ladies society being a reasoning creature i notice this and draw my own deductions which amount to the conclusion that you are in a fair way to go to the deuce owing to trusting your life to a woman and the moral of all this which i lay to heart for my own guidance is never speak to a woman if you can avoid it and when you cant let your speech be yea yea and nay nay more especially nay then you stand a good chance of keeping your appetite and peace of mind and of making your way in the world marriage indeed never talk to me of marriage again and jeremy shivered at the thought ernest laughed out loud at this lengthy disquisition and ill tell you what old fellow he went on drawing himself up to his full height and standing right over ernest so that the latters six feet looked very insignificant beside him never you speak to me about leaving you again unless you want to put me clean out of temper because look here i dont like it we have lived together since we were twelve or thereabouts and so far as i am concerned i mean to go on living together to the end of the chapter or till i see i am not wanted you can go to mexico or the north pole or acapulto or wherever you like but i shall go too and so that is all about it thank you old fellow said ernest simply and at that moment their conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a kafir messenger with a telegram addressed to ernest he opened it and read it hullo he said here is something better than mexico listen alston pieter maritzburg to kershaw pretoria high commissioner has declared war against cetywayo local cavalry urgently required for service in zululand have offered to raise a small corps of about seventy mounted men offer has been accepted will you accept post of second in command you would hold the queens commission if so set about picking suitable recruits terms ten shillings a day all found am coming up pretoria by this postcart ask jones if he will accept sergeantmajorship hurrah sang out ernest with flashing eyes here is some real service at last of course you will accept of course said jeremy quietly but dont indulge in rejoicings yet this is going to be a big business unless i am mistaken chapter xvii hans prophesies evil ernest and jeremy did not let the grass grow under their feet they guessed that there would soon be a good deal of recruiting for various corps and so set to work at once to secure the best men the stamp of man they aimed at getting was the colonialborn englishman both because such men have more selfrespect independence of character and gumption than the ordinary drifting sediment from the diamond fields and seaports and also because they were practically readymade soldiers they could ride as well as they could walk they were splendid rifleshots and they had too from childhood been trained in the art of travelling without baggage and very rapidly ernest did not find much difficulty in the task mr alston was well known and had seen a great deal of service as a young man in the basuto wars and stories were still told of his nerve and pluck he was known too to be a wary man not rash or overconfident but of a determined mind and what is more to possess a perfect knowledge of zulu warfare and tactics this went a long way with intending recruits for the first thing a wouldbe colonial volunteer inquires into is the character of his officers he will not trust his life to men in whom he puts no reliance he is willing to lose it in the way of duty but he has a great objection to having it blundered away indeed in many south african volunteer corps it is a fundamental principle that the officers should be elected by the men themselves once elected however they cannot be deposed except by competent authority ernest too was by this time well known in the transvaal and universally believed in mr alston could not have chosen a better lieutenant he was known to have pluck and dash and to be readywitted in emergency but it was not those qualities only which made him acceptable to the individuals whose continued existence would very possibly depend upon his courage and discretion indeed it would be difficult to say what it was but there are some men who are by nature born leaders of their fellows and who inspire confidence magnetically ernest had this great gift at first sight he was much like any other young man rather carelesslooking than otherwise in appearance and giving the observer the impression that he was thinking of something else but old hands at native warfare looking into his dark eyes saw something there which told them that this young fellow boy as he was comparatively speaking would not show himself wanting in the moment of emergency either in courage or discretion jeremys nomination too as sergeantmajor a very important post in such a corps was popular enough people had not forgotten his victory over the boer giant and besides a sergeantmajor with such a physique would have been a credit to any corps all these things helped to make recruiting an easy task and when alston and his son roger weary and bruised stepped out of the natal postcart four days later it was to be met by ernest and jeremy with the intelligence that his telegram had been received the appointments accepted and thirtyfive men provisionally enrolled subject to his approval my word young gentlemen he said highly pleased you are lieutenants worth having the next fortnight was a busy one for all concerned the organisation of a colonial volunteer corps is no joke as anybody who has ever tried it can testify there were rough uniforms to be provided arms to be obtained and a hundred and one other wants to be satisfied then came some delay about the horses which were to be served out by government at last these were handed over a goodlooking lot but apparently very wild matters were at this point when one day ernest was seated in the room he used as an office in his house enrolling a new recruit previous to his being sworn interviewing a tradesman about flannel shirts making arrangements for a supply of forage filling up the endless forms which the imperial authorities required for transmission to the war office and a hundred other matters suddenly his orderly announced that two privates of the corps wished to see him what is it he asked of the orderly testily for he was nearly worked to death a complaint sir well send them in the door opened and a curious couple entered one was a great burly sailorman who had been a quartermaster on board one of her majestys ships at cape town got drunk overstayed his leave and deserted rather than face the punishment the other a quick active little fellow with a face like a ferret he was a zululand trader who had ruined himself by drink and a peculiarly valuable member of the corps on account of his knowledge of the country in which they were going to serve both men saluted and stood at ease well my men what is it asked ernest going on filling up his forms nothing so far as i am concerned sir said the little man ernest looked up sharply at the quondam tar now adam your complaint i have no time to waste adam hitched up his breeches and began you see sir i brought he here by the scruff of the neck thats true sir said the little man rubbing that portion of his body because he and i sir as is messmates sir ad a difference of opinion it was his day you see sir to cook for our mess and instead of putting on the pot sir he comes to me he does and he says adam you blooming father of a race of fools thats what he says sir acomparing of me to the gent who lived in a garden why dont you come and take the skins off the taters instead of asquatting of yourself down on that there bed slightly in error sir broke in the little man suavely our big friends memory is not as substantial as his form what i said was my dear adam as i see you have nothing to occupy your time except sit and play a jewsharp upon your couch would you be so kind as to come and assist me to remove the outer integument of these potatoes ernest began to explode but checked himself and said sternly dont talk nonsense adam tell me your complaint or go well sir answered the big sailor scratching his head if i git it a name it is this this here man sir be too infarnal sargustic be off with you both said ernest sternly and dont trouble me with any such nonsense again or i will put you both under arrest and stop your pay come march and he pointed to the door as he did so he observed a boer gallop swiftly past the house and take the turn to government house what is up now he wondered half an hour afterwards another man passed the window also at full gallop and also turned up towards government house another halfhour passed and mr alston came hurrying in look here ernest he said here is a pretty business three men have come in to report that cetywayo has sent an impi army round by the back of secocoenis country to burn pretoria and return to zululand across the high veld they say that the impi is now resting in the saltpan bush about twenty miles off and will attack the town tonight or tomorrow night all these three who have by the way had no communication with each other state that they have actually seen the captains of the impi who came to tell them to bid the other dutchmen to stand aside as they are now fighting the queen and the boers would not be hurt it seems incredible said ernest do you believe it i dont know it is possible and the evidence is strong it is possible i have known the zulus make longer marches than that the governor has ordered me to gallop to the spot and report if i can see anything of this impi am i to go too no you will remain in the corps i take roger with me he is a light weight and two spare horses if there should be an attack and i should not be back or if anything should happen you will do your duty yes goodbye i am off you had better muster the men to be ready for an emergency and he was gone ten minutes afterwards down came an orderly from the officer commanding with a peremptory order that the officer commanding alstons horse was to mount and parade his men in readiness for immediate service here is a pretty go thought ernest and the horses not served out yet just then jeremy came in saluted and informed him that the men were mustered serve out the saddlery let every man shoulder his saddle tell mazooku to bring out the devil ernests favourite horse and march the men up to the government stables i will be with you presently jeremy saluted again with much ceremony and vanished he was the most punctilious sergeantmajor who ever breathed twenty minutes later a long file of men each with a carbine slung to his back and a saddle on his head which at a distance gave them the appearance of a string of gigantic mushrooms were to be seen proceeding towards the government stables a mile away ernest mounted on his great black stallion and looking in his military uniform and the revolver slung across his shoulders a typical volunteer officer was there before them now my men he said as soon as they were paraded go in and each man choose the horse which he likes best bridle him bring him out and saddle him sharp the men broke their ranks and rushed to the stables each anxious to secure a better horse than his neighbours presently from the stables there arose a sound of kicking plunging and wohoing impossible to describe there will be a pretty scene soon with these unbroken brutes thought ernest he was not destined to be disappointed the horses were dragged out most of them lying back upon their haunches kicking bucking and going through every other equine antic saddle up shouted ernest as soon as they were all out it was done with great difficulty now mount sixty men lifted their legs and swung themselves into the saddle not without sad misgivings a few seconds passed and at least twenty of them were on the broad of their backs one or two were being dragged by the stirrupleather a few were clinging to their bucking and plunging steeds and the remainder of alstons horse was scouring the plain in every possible direction never was there such a scene in time however most of the men got back again and some sort of order was restored several men were hurt one or two badly these were sent to the hospital and ernest formed the rest into halfsections to be marched to the place of rendezvous just then to make matters better down came the rain in sheets soaking them to the skin and making confusion worse confounded so they rode to the town which was by this time in an extraordinary state of panic all business was suspended women were standing about on verandahs hugging their babies and crying or making preparations to go into laager men were hiding deeds and valuables or hurrying to defence meetings on the marketsquare where the government were serving out rifles and ammunition to all ablebodied citizens frightened mobs of basutos and christian kafirs were jabbering in the streets and telling tales of the completeness of zulu slaughter or else running from the city to pass the night among the hills altogether the scene was most curious till dense darkness came down over it like an extinguisher and put it out ernest took his men to a building which the government had placed at their disposal and had the horses stabled but not unsaddled presently orders came down to him to keep the corps under arms all night to send out four patrols to be relieved at midnight to watch the approaches to the town and at dawn to saddle up and reconnoitre the neighbouring country ernest obeyed these orders as well as he could that is he sent the patrols out but so dense was the darkness that they never got back again till the following morning when they were collected and in one instance dug out of the various ditches quarryholes etc into which they had fallen about eleven oclock ernest was seated in a little room that opened out of the main building where they were quartered consulting with jeremy about matters connected with the corps and wondering if alston had found a zulu impi or if it was all gammon when suddenly they heard the sharp challenge of the sentry outside who goes there whoever it is had better answer sharp said ernest i gave the sentry orders to be quick with his rifle tonight bang crash followed by loud howls of wilhelmina my wife ah the cruel man has killed my wilhelmina heavens it is that lunatic german here orderly run up to the defence committee and the government offices and tell them that it is nothing they will think the zulus are here tell two men to bring the man in here and to stop his howls presently ernests old friend of the high veld looking very wild and uncouth in the lamplight with his long beard and matted hair from which the rain was dripping was bundled rather unceremoniously into the room ah there you are dear sir it is two three years since we met i look for you everywhere and they tell me you are here and i come on quick all through the dark and the rain and then before i know if i am on my head or my heel the cruel man he ups a rifle and do shoot my wilhelmina and make a great hole through her poor stomach o sir what shall i do and the great child began to shed tears you too will weep you too love my wilhelmina and sleep with her one night bohoo for goodness sake stop that nonsense this is no time or place for such fooling he spoke sharply and the monomaniac pulled up only giving vent to an occasional sob now what is your business with me the germans face changed from its expression of idiotic grief to one of refined intelligence he glanced towards jeremy who was exploding in the corner you can speak before this gentleman hans said ernest sir i am going to say a strange thing to you this night he was speaking quite quietly and composedly now and might have been mistaken for a sane man sir i hear that you go down to zululand to help to fight the fierce zulus when i hear it i was far away but something come into my head to travel as quick as wilhelmina can and come and tell you not to go what do you mean how can i say what i do mean this i know many shall go down to zululand who rest in this house tonight few shall come back you mean that i shall be killed i know not there are things as bad as death and yet not death he covered his eyes with his hand and continued i cannot see you dead but do not go i pray you do not go my good hans what is the use of coming to me with such an old wives tale even if it were true and i knew that i must be killed twenty times i should go i cannot run away from my duty that is spoken as a brave man should answered his visitor in his native tongue i have done my duty and told you what wilhelmina said now go and when the black men are leaping up at you like the seawaves round a rock may the god of rest guide your hand and bring you safe from the slaughter ernest gazed at the old mans pale face it wore a curious rapt expression and the eyes were looking upwards perhaps old friend he said addressing him in german i as well as you have a city of rest which i would reach and care not if i pass thither on an assegai i know it replied hans in the same tongue but useless is it to seek rest till god gives it you have sought and passed through the jaws of many deaths but you have not found if it be not gods will you will not find it now i know you too seek rest my brother and had i known that you would find that only down there and he pointed towards zululand i had not come down to warn you for blessed is rest and happy is he who gains it but no it is not that i am sure now that you will not die your evil whatever it is will fall from heaven so be it said ernest you are a strange man i thought you a common monomaniac and now you speak like a prophet the old man smiled you are right i am both mostly i am mad i know it but sometimes my madness has its moments of inspiration when the clouds lift from my mind and i see things none others can see and hear voices to which your ears are deaf such a moment is on me now soon i shall be mad again but before the cloud settles i would speak to you why i know not save that i loved you when first i saw your eyes open there upon the cold veld presently i must go and we shall meet no more for i draw near to the snowclad tree that marks the gate of the city of rest i can look into your heart now and see the trouble in it and the sad beautiful face that is printed on your mind ah she is not happy she too must work out her rest but the time is short the cloud settles and i would tell you what is in my mind even though trouble great trouble close you in do not be cast down for trouble is the key of heaven be good turn to the god you have neglected struggle against the snares of the senses oh i can see now for you and for all you love there is joy and there is peace suddenly he broke off the look of inspiration faded from his face which grew stupid and wildlooking ah the cruel man he made a great hole in the stomach of my wilhelmina ernest had been bending forwards listening with parted lips to the old mans talk when he saw that the inspiration had left him he raised his head and said gather yourself together i beg you for a moment i wish to ask one question shall i ever how shall i stop de bleeding from the witals of my dear wife who will plug up the hole in her ernest gazed at the man was he putting all this on or was he really mad for the life of him he could not tell taking out a sovereign he gave it to him there is money to doctor wilhelmina with he said would you like to sleep here i can give you a blanket the old man took the money without hesitation and thanked ernest for it but said he must go on at once where are you going to asked jeremy who had been watching him with great curiosity but had not understood that part of the conversation which had been carried on in german hans turned upon him with a quick look of suspicion rustenburg anglicи the town of rest he answered indeed the road is bad and it is far to travel yes he replied the road is rough and long farewell and he was gone well he is a curious old buster and no mistake with his cheerful anticipations and his wilhelmina reflected jeremy aloud just fancy starting for rustenburg at this hour of the night too why it is a hundred miles off ernest only smiled he knew that it was no earthly rustenburg that the old man sought some while afterwards he heard that hans had attained the rest which he desired wilhelmina got fixed in a snowdrift in a pass of the drakensberg he was unable to drag her out so he crept underneath and fell asleep and the snow came down and covered them chapter xviii mr alstons views the zulu attack on pretoria ultimately turned out only to have existed in the minds of two mad kafirs who dressed themselves up after the fashion of chiefs and personating two zulu nobles of repute who were known to be in the command of regiments rode from house to house telling the dutch inhabitants that they had an impi of thirty thousand men lying in the bush and bidding them stand aside while they destroyed the englishmen hence the scare the next month was a busy one for alstons horse it was drill drill drill morning noon and night but the results soon became apparent in three weeks from the day they got their horses there was not a smarter quicker corps in south africa and mr alston and ernest were highly complimented on the soldierlike appearance of the men and the rapidity and exactitude with which they executed all the ordinary cavalry manoeuvres they were to march from pretoria on the th of january and expected to overtake colonel glynns column with which was the general about the th by which time mr alston calculated the real advance upon zululand would begin on the th the good people of pretoria gave the corps a farewell banquet for most of its members were pretoria men and colonists are never behindhand when there is an excuse for conviviality and goodfellowship of course after the banquet mr or as he was now called captain alstons health was drunk but alston was a man of few words and had a horror of speechmaking he contented himself with a few brief sentences of acknowledgment and sat down then somebody proposed the health of the other commissioned and noncommissioned officers and to this ernest rose to respond making a very good speech in reply he rapidly sketched the state of political affairs of which the zulu war was the outcome and without any opinion on the justice or wisdom of that war of which to speak the truth he had grave doubts he went on to show in a few wellchosen weighty words how vital were the interests involved in its successful conclusion now that it once had been undertaken finally he concluded thus i am well aware gentlemen that with many of those who are your guests here tonight and my own comrades this state of affairs and the conviction of the extreme urgency of the occasion has been the cause of their enlistment it is impossible for me to look down these tables and see so many in our roughandready uniform whom i have known in other walks of life as farmers storekeepers government clerks and what not without realising most clearly the extreme necessity that can have brought these peaceable citizens together on such an errand as we are bent on certainly it is not the ten shillings a day or the mere excitement of savage warfare that has done this cries of no no because most of them can well afford to despise the money and many more have seen enough of native war and know well that few rewards and plenty of hard work fall to the lot of colonial volunteers then what is it i will venture to reply it is that sense of patriotism which is a part and parcel of the english mind cheers and which from generation to generation has been the root of englands greatness and so long as the british blood remains untainted will from unborn generation to generation be the mainspring of the greatness that is yet to be of those wider englands of which i hope this continent will become not the least loud cheers that gentlemen and men of alstons horse is the bond which unites us together it is the sense of a common duty to perform of a common danger to combat of a common patriotism to vindicate and for that reason because of the patriotism and the duty i feel sure that when the end of this campaign comes whatever that end may be no one be he imperial officer or newspaper correspondent or zulu foe will be able to say that alstons horse shirked its work or was mutinous or proved a broken reed piercing the side of those who leaned on it cheers i feel sure too that though there may be a record of brave deeds such as become brave men there will be none of a comrade deserted in the time of need or of a failure in the moment of emergency my brethren in arms and here ernests eyes flashed and his strong clear voice went ringing down the great hall whom england has called and who have not failed to answer the call i repeat however terrible may be that emergency even if it should involve the certainty of death i speak thus because i feel i am addressing brave men who do not fear to die when death means duty and life means dishonour i know well that you will rise to it and falling shoulder to shoulder will pass as heroes should on to the land of shades on to that valhalla of which no true heart should fear to set foot upon the threshold ernest sat down amid ringing cheers nor did these noble words coming as they did straight from the loyal heart of an english gentleman fail of their effect on the contrary when a fortnight later alstons horse formed that fatal ring on isandhlwanas bloody field they flashed through the brain of more than one despairing man so that he set his teeth and died the harder for them bravo my young viking said mr alston to ernest while the roof was still echoing to the cheers evoked by his speech the old berserker spirit is cropping up eh he knew that ernests mothers family like so many of the old eastern county stocks were of danish extraction it was a great night for ernest two days later alstons horse sixtyfour strong marched out of pretoria with a military band playing before alas they never marched back again at the neck of the poort or pass the band and the crowd of ladies and gentlemen who had accompanied them halted and having given them three cheers turned and left them ernest too turned and gazed at the pretty town with its white houses and rosehedges red with bloom nestling on the plain beneath and wondered if he would ever see it again he never did the troop was then ordered to march at ease in halfsections and ernest rode up to the side of alston on his other side was the boy roger now about fourteen years of age who acted as alstons aidedecamp and was in high spirits at the prospect of the coming campaign presently alston sent his son back to the other end of the line on some errand ernest watched him as he galloped off and a thought struck him alston he said do you think that it is wise to bring that boy into this business his friend slewed himself round sharply in the saddle why not he asked in his deliberate way well you know there is a risk and why should not the boy run risks as well as the rest of us look here ernest when i first met you there in guernsey i was going to see the place where my wife was brought up do you know how she died i have heard she died a violent death i do not know how then i will tell you though it costs me something to speak of it she died by a zulu assegai a week after the boy was born she saved his life by hiding him under a heap of straw dont ask me particulars i cant bear to talk of it perhaps now you will understand why i am commanding a corps enrolled to serve against the zulus perhaps too you will understand why the lad is with me we go to avenge my wife and his mother or to fall in the attempt i have waited long for the opportunity it has come ernest relapsed into silence and presently fell back to his troop on the th of january alstons horse having moved down by easy marches from pretoria camped at rorkes drift on the buffalo river not far from a store and a thatched building being used as a hospital which were destined to become historical here orders reached them to march on the following day and join no column with which was lord chelmsford himself and which was camped about nine miles from the buffalo river at a spot called isandhlwana or the place of the little hand next day the st of january the corps moved on accordingly and following the waggontrack that runs past the inhlazatye mountain by midday came up to the camp where about twentyfive hundred men of all arms were assembled under the immediate command of colonel glynn their camp which was about eight hundred yards square was pitched facing a wide plain with its back towards a precipitous slabsided hill of the curious formation sometimes to be seen in south africa this was isandhlwana hullo said alston as on reaching the summit of the neck over which the waggonroad runs they came in sight of the camp they are not entrenched by jove he added after scanning the camp carefully they havent even got a waggonlaager and he whistled expressively what do you mean asked ernest mr alston so rarely showed surprise that he knew there must be something very wrong i mean ernest that there is nothing to prevent the camp from being destroyed and every soul in it by a couple of zulu regiments if they choose to make a night attack how they are to be kept out i should like to know in the dark when you cant see to shoot them unless there is some barrier these officers fresh from home dont know what a zulu charge is that is very clear i only hope they wont have occasion to find out look there and he pointed to a waggon lumbering along before them on the top of which among a lot of other miscellaneous articles lay a bundle of cricketing bats and wickets they think that they are going on a picnic what is the use too i should like to know of sending four feeble columns sprawling over zululand to run the risk of being crushed in detail by a foe that can move from point to point at the rate of fifty miles a day and which can at any moment slip past them and turn natal into a howling wilderness there it is no use grumbling i only hope i may be wrong get back to your troop ernest and let us come into camp smartly form fours trot on arrival in the camp mr alston learned on reporting himself to the officer commanding that two strong parties of mounted men under the command of major dartnell were out on a reconnaissance towards the inhlazatye mountain in which direction the zulus were supposed to be in force the orders he received were to rest his horses as he might be required to join the mounted force with major dartnell on the morrow that night as alston and ernest stood together at the door of their tent smoking a pipe before turning in they had some conversation it was a beautiful night and the stars shone brightly ernest looked at them and thought on how many of mans wars those stars had looked stargazing asked mr alston i was contemplating our future homes said ernest laughing ah you believe that do you think you are immortal and that sort of thing yes i believe that we shall live many lives and that some of them will be there and he pointed to the stars dont you i dont know i think it rather presumptuous why should you propose that for you is reserved a bright destiny among the stars more than for these and he put out his hand and clasped several of a swarm of flyingants which were passing at the time just think how small must be the difference between these ants and us in the eyes of a power who can produce both these have their homes their government their colonies their drones and workers they enslave and annex lay up riches and to bring the argument to an appropriate conclusion make peace and war what then is the difference we are bigger walk on two legs have a larger capacity for suffering and we believe a soul is it so great that we should suppose that for us is reserved a heaven or all the glorious worlds which people space for these annihilation perhaps we are at the top of the tree of development and for them may be the future for us the annihilation who knows there fly away and make the most of the present for nothing else is certain you overlook religion entirely religion which religion there are so many our christian god buddha mohammed brahma all number their countless millions of worshippers each promises a different thing each commands the equally intense belief of his worshippers for with them all blind faith is a condition precedent and each appears to satisfy their spiritual aspirations can all of these be true religions each holds the other false and outside the pale each tries to convert the other and fails there are many lesser ones of which the same thing may be said but the same spirit underlies them all perhaps there is much that is noble in all religions but there is also much that is terrible to the actual horrors and wearing anxieties of physical existence religion bids us add on the vaguer horrors of a spiritual existence which are to be absolutely endless the average christian would be uncomfortable if you deprived him of his hell and his personal devil for myself i decline to believe in such things if there is a hell it is this world this world is a place of expiation for the sins of the world and the only real devil is the devil of mans evil passions it is possible to be religious and be a good man without believing in hell said ernest yes i think so otherwise my chance is a poor one besides i do not deny the almighty power i only deny the cruelty that is attributed to him it may be that from the accumulated mass of the wrong and bloodshed and agony of this hard world that power is building up some high purpose out of the bodies of millions of living creatures nature worked out her purpose and made the rocks but the process must have been unpleasant to the living creatures by whose humble means the great strata were reared up they lived to die in billions that tens of thousands of years afterwards there might be a rock it may be so with us our tears and blood and agony may produce some solid end that now we cannot guess their volume which cannot be wasted for nothing is wasted may be building up one of the rocks of gods faroff purpose but that we shall be tortured here for a time in order that we may be indefinitely tortured there and he pointed to the stars that i will never believe look at the mist rising from that hollow so does the reek of the worlds misery rise as an offering to the worlds gods the mist will cease to rise and fall again in rain and bring a blessing but the incense of human suffering rises night and day for so long as the earth shall endure nor does it fall again in dews of mercy and yet christians who declare that god is love declare too that for the vast majority of their fellowcreatures this process is to continue from millennium to millennium it depends on our life they say look here ernest a man can do no more than he can when i got to the age of discretion which i put at eightandtwenty you have hardly reached it yet my boy you are nothing but a babe i made three resolutions always to try and do my duty never to turn my back on a poor man or a friend in trouble and if possible not to make love to my neighbours wife those resolutions i have often broken more or less either in the spirit or the letter but in the main i have stuck to them and i can put my hand upon my heart tonight and say i have done my best and so i go my path turning neither to the right nor to the left and when fate finds me i shall meet him fearing nothing for i know he has wreaked his worst upon me and can only at the utmost bring me eternal sleep and hoping nothing because my experience here has not been such as to justify the hope of any happiness for man and my vanity is not sufficiently strong to allow me to believe in the intervention of a superior power to save so miserable a creature from the common lot of life goodnight on the following day his fate found him chapter xix isandhlwana midnight came and the camp was sunk in sleep up to the sky whither it was decreed their spirits should pass before the dark closed in again and hit their mangled corpses floated the faint breath of some fourteen hundred men there they lay sleeping the healthy sleep of vigorous manhood their brains busy with the fantastic madness of a hundred dreams and little recking of the inevitable morrow there in his sleep the white man saw his native village with its tall windswayed elms and the grey old church that for centuries had watched the last slumber of his race the kafir the sunny slope of fair natal with its bright light dancing on his cattles horns and the green of the gardens where for his wellbeing his wives and children toiled to some that night came dreams of high ambition of brave adventure crowned with the perfect triumph we never reach to some visions of beloved faces long since passed away to some the reflected light of a faroff home and echoes of the happy laughter of little children and so their lamps wavered hither and thither in the spiritual breath of sleep flickering wildly ere they went out for ever the nightwind swept in sad gusts across isandhlwanas plain tossing the green grass which tomorrow would be red it moaned against inhlazatyes mountain and died upon upindo fanning the dark faces of a host of warriors who rested there upon their spears sharpened for the coming slaughter and as it breathed upon them they turned those brave soldiers of ucetywayo born to be killed as their saying runs at cetywayos bidding and grasping their assegais raised themselves to listen it was nothing death was not yet death for the morrow sleep for the night a little after one oclock on the morning of the nd of january ernest was roused by the sound of a horses hoofs and the hard challenge of the sentries despatch from major dartnell was the answer and the messenger passed on half an hour more and the reveille was sounded and the camp hummed in the darkness like a hive of bees making ready for the dawn soon it was known that the general and colonel glynn were about to move out to the support of major dartnell who reported a large force of the enemy in front of him with six companies of the second battalion of the th regiment four guns and the mounted infantry at dawn they left at eight oclock a report arrived from a picket stationed about a mile away on a hill to the north of the camp that a body of zulus was approaching from the northeast at nine oclock the enemy showed over the crest of the hills for a few minutes and then disappeared at ten oclock colonel durnford arrived from rorkes drift with a rocket battery and two hundred and fifty mounted native soldiers and took over the command of the camp from colonel pulleine as he came up he stopped for a minute to speak to alston whom he knew and ernest noticed him he was a handsome soldierlike man with his arm in a sling a long fair moustache and a restless anxious expression of face at colonel durnfords force divided into two portions was with the rocket battery pushed some miles forwards to ascertain the enemys movements and a company of the th was directed to take up a position on the hill about a mile to the north of the camp meanwhile the enemy which they afterwards heard consisted of the undi corps the nokenke and umcitu regiments and the nkobamakosi and imbonambi regiments in all about twenty thousand men were resting about two miles from isandhlwana with no intention of attacking that day they had not yet been moutied doctored and the condition of the moon was not propitious unfortunately however colonel durnfords mounted basutos in pushing forwards came upon a portion of the umcitu regiment and fired on it whereupon the umcitu came into action driving durnfords horse before them and then engaged the company of the th which had been stationed on the hill to the north of the camp and after a stubborn resistance annihilating it it was followed by the nokenke imbonambi and nkobamakosi regiments who executed a flanking movement and threatened the front of the camp for a while the undi corps which formed the chest of the army held its ground then it marched off to the right and directed its course to the north of isandhlwana mountain with the object of turning the position meanwhile the remaining companies of the th were advanced to various positions in front of the camp and engaged the enemy for a while holding them in check the two guns under major smith shelling the nokenke regiment which formed the zulu left centre with great effect the shells could be seen bursting amid the dense masses of zulus who were coming on slowly and in perfect silence making large gaps in their ranks which instantly closed up over the dead at this point the advance of the undi regiment to the zulu right and the english left was reported and alstons horse were ordered to proceed and if possible to check it accordingly they left and riding behind the company of the th on the hill to the north of the camp which was now hotly engaged with the umcitu and durnfords basutos who fighting splendidly were slowly being pushed back made for the north side of isandhlwana as soon as they got on to the high ground they caught sight of the undi who something over three thousand strong were running swiftly in a formation of companies about half a mile to the northward by heaven they mean to turn the mountain and seize the waggonroad said mr alston gallop the troop dashed down the slope towards a pass in a stony ridge which would command the path of the undi as they did so breaking through and killing two or three of a thin line of zulus that formed the extreme point of one of the horns or nippers by means of which the enemy intended to enclose the camp and crush it after this alstons horse saw nothing more of the general fight but it may be as well to briefly relate what happened the zulus of the various regiments pushed slowly on towards the camp notwithstanding their heavy losses their object was to give time to the horns or nippers to close round it meanwhile those in command realised too late the extreme seriousness of the position and began to concentrate the various companies too late the enemy saw that the nippers had closed he knew too that the undi could not be far off the waggonroad the only way of retreat and so abandoning his silence and his slow advance he raised the zulu warshout and charged it from a distance of from six to eight hundred yards up to this time the english loss had been small for the shooting of the zulus was vile the enemy on the contrary had especially during the last halfhour before they charged lost heavily but now the tables were turned first the natal contingent seeing that they were surrounded bolted and laid open the right and rear flank of the troops in poured the zulus so that most of the soldiers had not even time to fix bayonets in another minute our men were being assegaied right and left and the retreat on the camp had become a fearful rout but even then there was nowhere to run to the undi corps which afterwards passed on and attacked the post at rorkes drift already held the waggonroad and the only practical way of retreat was down a gully to the south of the road into this the broken fragments of the force plunged wildly and after them and mixed up with them went their zulu foes massacring every living thing they came across so the camp was cleared when a couple of hours afterwards commandant lonsdale of londsdales horse was sent back by general chelmsford to ascertain what the firing was about he could see nothing wrong the tents were sanding the waggons were there there were even soldiers moving about it did not occur to him that it was the soldiers coats which were moving on the backs of kafirs and that the soldiers themselves would never move again so he rode quickly up to the headquarters tents out of which to his surprise there suddenly stalked a huge naked zulu smeared all over with blood and waving in his hand a bloody assegai having seen enough he then rode back again to tell the general that his camp was taken to gods good providence and cetywayos clemency rather than to our own wisdom do we owe it that all the outlying homesteads in natal were not laid in ashes and men women and children put to the assegai chapter xx the end of alstons horse alstons horse soon reached the ridge past which the undi were commencing to run at a distance of about three hundred and fifty yards and the order was given to dismount and line it this they did one man in every four keeping a few paces back to hold the horses of his section then they opened fire and next second came back the sound of the thudding of the bullets on the shields and bodies of the zulu warriors ernest seated up high on his great black horse the devil for the officers did not dismount could see how terrible was the effect of that raking fire delivered as it was not by raw english boys who scarcely knew one end of a rifle from the other but by men all of whom could shoot and many of whom were crack shots all along the line of the undi companies men threw up their arms and dropped dead or staggered out of the ranks wounded but the main body never paused by and by they would come back and move the wounded or kill them if they were not likely to recover soon as the range got longer the fire began to be less deadly and ernest could see that fewer men were dropping ernest said alston galloping up to him i am going to charge them look they will soon cross the donga and reach the slopes of the mountain and we shant be able to follow them on the broken ground isnt it rather risky asked ernest somewhat dismayed at the idea of launching their little clump of mounted men at the moving mass before them risky yes of course it is but my orders were to delay the enemy as much as possible and the horses are fresh but my lad and he bent towards him and spoke low it doesnt much matter whether we are killed charging or running away i am sure that the camp must be taken there is no hope goodbye ernest if i fall fight the corps as long as possible and kill as many of those devils as you can and if you survive remember to make off well to the left the regiments will have passed by then god bless you my boy now order the bugler to sound the cease fire and let the men mount yes sir they were the last words alston ever spoke to him and ernest often remembered with affectionate admiration that even at that moment he thought more of his friends safety than he did of his own as to their tenor ernest had already suspected the truth though luckily the suspicion had not as yet impregnated the corps mazooku too who as usual was with him mounted on a basuto pony had just informed him that in his mazookus opinion they were all as good as ripped up alluding to the zulu habit of cutting a dead enemy open and adding a consolatory remark to the effect that man can die but once and good job too but strangely enough he did not feel afraid indeed he never felt quieter in his life than he did in that hour of death a wild expectancy thrilled his nerves and looked out of his eyes what would it be like he wondered in another minute all such thoughts were gone for he was at the head of his troop ready for the order alston followed by the boy roger galloped swiftly round seeing that the formation was right and then gave the word to unsheath the short swords with which he had insisted upon the corps being armed meanwhile the undi were drawing on to a flat plain four hundred yards or more broad at the foot of the mountain a very suitable spot for a cavalry manoeuvre now men of alstons horse there is the enemy before you let me see how you can go through them charge charge reechoed ernest charge roared sergeantmajor jones brandishing his sword down the slope they go slowly at first now they are on the plain and the pace quickens to a handgallop ernest feels his great horse gather himself together and spring along beneath him he hears the hum of astonishment rising from the dense black mass before them as it halts to receive the attack he glances round and sees the set faces and determined look upon the features of his men and his blood boils up with a wild exhilaration and for a while he tastes the fierce joy of war quicker still grows the pace now he can see the white round the dark eyeballs of the zulus crash they are among them trampling them down hewing them down thrusting slashing stabbing and being stabbed the air is alive with assegais and echoes with the savage zulu warcries and with the shouts of the gallant troopers fighting now as troopers have not often fought before presently as in a dream ernest sees a huge zulu seize alstons horse by the bridle jerk it on to its haunches and raise his assegai then the boy roger who is by his fathers side makes a point with his sword and runs the zulu through he falls but next moment the lad is attacked by more is assegaied and falls fighting bravely then alston pulls up and turning shoots with his revolver at the men who have killed his son two fall another runs up and with a shout drives a great spear right through alston so that it stands out a handbreadth behind his back on to the body of his son he too falls and dies next second the zulus head is cleft in twain down to the chin that was jeremys stroke all this time they are travelling on leaving a broad red line of dead and dying in their track presently it was done they had passed right through the impi but out of sixtyfour men they had lost their captain and twenty troopers as they emerged ernest noticed that his sword was dripping blood and his swordhand stained red yet he could not at the moment remember having killed anybody but alston was dead and he was now in command of what remained of the corps they were in no condition to charge again for many horses and some men were wounded so he led them round the rear of the impi which detaching a company of about three hundred men to deal with the remnants of the troop went on its way with lessened numbers and filled with admiration at the exhibition of a courage in no way inferior to their own this company running swiftly took possession of the ridge down which the troop had charged and by which alone it would be possible for ernest to retreat and taking shelter behind stones began to pour in an inaccurate but galling fire on the little party of whites ernest charged up through them losing two more men and several horses in the process but what was his horror on reaching the crest of the ridge to see about a thousand zulus drawn up apparently in reserve in the neck of the pass leading to the plain beyond to escape through them would be almost impossible for he was crippled with wounded and dismounted men and the pace of a force is the pace of the slowest their position was desperate and looking round at his men he could see that they thought so too his resolution was soon taken a few paces from where he had for a moment halted the remainder of the corps was a little eminence something like an early british tumulus to this he rode and dismounting turned his horse loose ordering this men to do the same so good was the discipline and so great his control over them that there were no wild rushes to escape they obeyed realising their desperate case and formed a ring round the rise now men of alstons horse said ernest we have done our best let us die our hardest the men set up a cheer and next minute the zulus creeping up under shelter of the rocks which were strewed around attacked them with fury in five minutes in spite of the withering fire which they poured in upon the surrounding zulus six more of the little band were dead four were shot two were killed in a rush made by about a dozen men who reckless of their own life determined to break through the white mans ring they perished in the attempt but not before they had stabbed two of alstons horse the remainder but little more than thirty men retired a few paces farther up the little rise so as to contract their circle and kept up a ceaseless fire upon the enemy the zulus thanks to the accurate shooting of the white men had by this time lost more than fifty of their number and annoyed at being put to such loss by a foe numerically so insignificant they determined to end the matter with a rush ernest saw their leader a big almost naked fellow with a small shield and a necklace of lions claws walking utterly regardless of the pitiless rifle fire from group to group and exhorting them taking up a rifle which had just fallen from the hand of a dead trooper for up to the present ernest had not joined in the firing he took a fine sight at about eighty yards at the zulu chiefs broad chest and pulled the shot was a good one the great fellow sprang into the air and dropped instantly another commander took his place and the final advance began but the zulus had to come uphill with but little cover and scores were mown down by the scorching and continuous fire from the breechloaders twice when within twenty yards were they driven back twice did they come on again now they were but twelve paces or so away and a murderous fire was kept up upon them for a moment they wavered then pushed forwards up the slope close up shouted ernest and use your swords and pistols his voice was heard above the din some of the men dropped the now useless rifles and the revolvers began to crack then the zulus closed in upon the doomed band with a shout of bulala umlungo kill the white man out rang the pistolshots and fire flew from the clash of swords and assegais and still the little band momentarily growing fewer fought on with labouring breath never did hopeforsaken men make a more gallant stand still they fought and still they fell one by one and as they fell were stabbed to death but scarcely one of them was there whose deathwound was in his back at last the remaining zulus drew back they thought that it was done but no three men yet stood together upon the very summit of the mound holding six foes at bay the zulu captain laughed aloud when he saw it and gave a rapid order thereupon the remaining zulus formed up and stabbing the wounded as they went departed swiftly over the dead after the main body of the corps which had now vanished round the mountain they left the six to finish the three three hundred had come to attack alstons horse not more than one hundred departed from the attack the overpowered white men had rendered a good account of their foes the three left alive on the summit of the little hill were as fate would have it ernest jeremy and the exsailor who had complained of the sargustic companion who it happened had just died by his side their revolvers were empty ernests sword had broken off short in the body of a zulu jeremy still had his sword and the sailor a clubbed carbine presently one of the six zulus dodged in under the carbine and ran the sailor through glancing round ernest saw his face turn grey the honest fellow died as he had lived swearing hard ah you black mate he sang out take that and be damned to you the clubbed rifle came down upon the zulus skull and cracked it to bits and both fell dead together now there were five zulus left and only ernest and jeremy to meet them but stay suddenly from under a corpse up rises another foe no it is not a foe it is mazooku who has been shamming dead but suddenly and most opportunely shows himself to be very much alive advancing from behind he stabs one of the attacking party and kills him that leaves four then he engages another and after a long struggle kills him too which leaves three and still the two white men stand back to back with flashing eyes and gasping breath and hold their own soaked with blood desperate and expecting death they were yet a gallant sight to see two of the remaining zulus rush at the giant jeremy one at ernest ernest having no effective weapon left dodges the assegaithrust and closes with his antagonist and they roll over and over down the hill together struggling for the assegai the zulu holds it snaps in two but the blade and about eight inches of the shaft remain with ernest he drives it through his enemys throat who dies then he struggles up to see the closing scene of the drama but not in time to help in it mazooku has wounded his man badly and is following to kill him and jeremy he has struck at one of the kafirs with his sword the blow is received on the edge of the cowhide shield and sinks halfway through it so that the hide holds the steel fast with a sharp twist of the shield the weapon is jerked out of his hand and he is left defenceless with nothing to trust to except his native strength surely he is lost but no with a sudden rush he seizes both zulus by the throat one in each hand and strong men as they are swings them wide apart then with a tremendous effort he jerks their heads together with such awful force that they fall senseless and mazooku comes up and spears them thus was the fight ended ernest and jeremy sank upon the bloody grass gasping for breath the firing from the direction of the camp had now died away and after the tumult the shouts and the shrieks of the dying the silence seemed deep there they lay white man and zulu side by side in the peaceable sunlight and in a vague bewildered way ernest noticed that the faces which a few minutes before looked so grim were mostly smiling now they had passed through the ivory gates and reached the land of smiles how still they all were a little blackandwhite bird such as flies from anthill to anthill came and settled upon the forehead of a young fellow scarcely more than a boy and the only son of his mother who lay quiet across two zulus the bird knew why he was so still ernest had liked the boy and knew his mother and began to wonder as he lay panting on the grass what she would feel when she heard of her sons fate but just then mazookus voice broke the silence he had been standing staring at the body of one of the men he had killed and was now apostrophising it in zulu ah my brother he said son of my own father with whom i used to play when i was little i always told you that you were a perfect fool with an assegai but i little thought that i should ever have such an opportunity of proving it to you well it cant be helped duty is duty and family ties must give way to it sleep well my brother it was painful to kill you very ernest lifted himself from the ground and laughed the hysterical laugh of shattered nerves at this naпve and thoroughly zulu moralising just then jeremy rose and came to him he was a fearful sight to see his hands his face his clothes were all red and he was bleeding from a cut on the face and another on the hand come ernest he said in a hollow voice we must clear out of this i suppose so said ernest on the plain at the foot of the hill several of the horses were quietly cropping the grass till such time as the superior animal man had settled his differences among them was ernests black stallion the devil which had been wounded though slightly on the flank they walked towards the horses stopping on their way to arm themselves from the weapons which lay about as they passed the body of the man ernest had killed in his last struggle for life he stopped and drew the broken assegai from his throat a memento said he the horses were caught without difficulty and the devil and the two next best animals selected then they mounted and rode towards the top of the ridge over which ernest had seen the body of zulus lying in reserve when they were near it mazooku got down and crept to the crest on his stomach presently to their great relief he signalled to them to advance the zulus had moved on and the valley was deserted so the three passed over the neck that an hour and a half before they had crossed with sixtyone companions who were now all dead i think we have charmed lives said jeremy presently all gone except us two it cant be chance it is fate said ernest briefly from the top of the neck they got a view of the camp which now looked quiet and peaceful with its white tents and its union jack fluttering as usual in the breeze they must be all dead too said ernest which way shall we go then it was that mazookus knowledge of the country proved of the utmost service to them he had been brought up in a kraal in the immediate neighbourhood and knew every inch of the land avoiding the camp altogether he led them to the left of the battlefield and after two hours ride over rough country brought them to a ford of the buffalo which he was acquainted with some miles below where the few survivors of the massacre struggled across the river or were drowned in attempting to do so following this route they never saw a single zulu for these had all departed in the other direction and were spared the horrors of the stampede and of fugitives drift at last they gained the farther side of the river and were comparatively speaking safe on natal ground they determined after much consultation to make for the little fort at helpmakaar and had ridden about a mile or so towards it when suddenly the zulus quick ear caught the sound of firing distant to their right it was their enemy the undi corps attacking rorkes drift leaving mazooku to hold the horses ernest and jeremy dismounted and climbed a solitary koppie or hill which just there cropped out from the surface of the plain it was of an ironstone formation and on the summit lay a huge flat slab of almost pure ore on to this they clambered and looked along the course of the river but could see nothing rorkes drift was hidden by a rise in the ground all this time a dense thundercloud had been gathering in the direction of helpmakaar and was now as is common before sunset in the south african summer season travelling rapidly up against the wind set in a faint rainbow as in a frame the sun on the other hand was sinking towards the horizon so that his golden beams flying across a space of blue sky impinged upon the black bosom of the cloud and were reflected thence in sharp lights and broad shadows flung like celestial spears and shields across the plains of zululand isandhlwanas mountain was touched by one great ray which broke in glory upon his savage crest and crowned him that days king of death but the battlefield over which he towered was draped in gloom it was a glorious scene above the wild expanse of sky broken up by flaming clouds and tinted with hues such as might be reflected from the jewelled walls of heaven behind the angry storm set in its rainbowframe like ebony in a ring of gold in front the rolling plain where the tall grasses waved the broad buffalo flashing through it like a silver snake the sunkissed mountains and the shadowed slopes it was a glorious scene nature in her most splendid mood flung all her colour streamers loose across the earth and sky and waved them wildly ere they vanished into nights abyss life in his most radiant ecstasy blazed up in varied glory before he sank like a lover to sleep awhile in the arms of his eternal mistress death ernest gazed upon it and it sank into his heart which set to natures tune responded ever when her hands swept the chords of earth or heaven it lifted him above the world and thrilled him with indescribable emotion his eyes wandered over the infinite space above searching for the presence of a god then they fell upon isandhlwana and marked the spot just where the shadows were deepest where his comrades lay and gazed upon the splendid sky with eyes that could not see and at last his spirit gave way and weakened with emotion and long toil and abstinence he burst into a paroxysm of grief o jeremy he sobbed they are all dead all except you and i and i feel a coward that i should still live to weep over them when it was over i should have let that zulu kill me but i was a coward and i fought for my life had i but held my hand for a second i should have gone with alston and the others jeremy come come old fellow you did your best and fought the corps like a brick no man could have done more yes jeremy but i should have died with them it was my duty to die and i do not care about living and they did i have been an unfortunate dog all my life i shot my cousin i lost eva and now i have seen all my comrades killed and i who was their leader alone escaped and perhaps i have not done with my misfortunes yet what next i wonder what next ernests distress was so acute that jeremy looking at him and seeing that all he had gone through had been too much for him tried to soothe him lest he should go into hysterics by putting his arm round his waist and giving him a good hug look here old chap he said it is no use bothering ones head about these things we are just so many feathers blown by the wind and must float where the wind blows us sometimes it is a good wind and sometimes a bad one but on the whole it is bad and we must just make the best of it and wait till it doesnt think it worth while to blow our particular feathers about any more and then we shall come to the ground and not till then now we have been up here for more than five minutes and given the horses a bit of a rest we must be pushing on if we want to get to helpmakaar before dark and i only hope we shall get there before the zulus thats all by jove here comes the storm come on and jeremy jumped off the lump of iron ore and began to descend the koppie ernest who had been listening with his face in his hands rose and followed him in silence as he did so a breath of icecold air from the stormcloud which was now right overhead fanned his hot brow and when he had gone a few yards he turned to meet it and to cast one more look at the scene it was the last earthly landscape he ever saw for at that instant there leaped from the cloud overhead a fierce stream of jagged light which struck the mass of ironore on which they had been seated shivered and fused it and then ran down the side of the hill to the plain together with the lightning there came an earsplitting crack of thunder jeremy who was now nearly at the bottom of the little hill staggered at the shock when he recovered he looked up where ernest had been standing and could not see him he rushed up the hill again calling him in accents of frantic grief there was no answer presently he found him lying on the ground white and still book iii chapter i the cliffs of old england it was an april evening off the south coast of england the sun had just made up his mind to struggle out from behind a particularly black showercloud and give that part of the world a look before he bade it goodnight that is lucky said a little man who was with difficulty hanging on to the bulwark netting of the rms conway castle now mr jones look if you cant see them in the sunlight mr jones accordingly looked through his glasses again yes he said i can see them distinctly see what asked another passenger coming up the cliffs of old england answered the little man joyously oh is that all said the other curse the cliffs of old england nice remark for a man who is going home to be married eh said the little man turning to where his companion had stood but mr jones had shut up his glasses and vanished aft presently he reached a deckcabin and entered without knocking england is in sight old fellow he said addressing somebody who lay back smoking in a canechair the person addressed made a movement as though to rise then put up his hand to a shade that covered his eyes i forgot he answered with a smile it will have to be very much in sight before i can see it by the way jeremy he went on nervously i want to ask you something these doctors tell such lies and he removed the shade now look at my eyes and tell me honestly am i disfigured are they shrunk i mean or have they got a squint or anything of that sort and ernest turned up his dark orbs which except that they had acquired that painful expectant look peculiar to the blind were just as they always had been jeremy looked at them first in one light then in another well said ernest impatiently i can feel that you are staring me out of countenance hamba gachlй replied the imperturbable one i am di di diagnosing the case there that will do to all appearance your optics are as sound as mine you get a girl to look at them and see what she says ah well that is something to be thankful for just then some one knocked at the cabindoor it was the steward you sent for me sir ernest o yes i remember will you be so good as to find my servant i want him yes sir ernest ernest moved impatiently confound that fellow with his everlasting sir ernest what havent you got used to your handle yet no i havent and i wish it were at jericho and that is a fact it is all your fault jeremy if you had not told that confoundedly garrulous little doctor who went and had the information printed in the natal mercury it would never have come out at all i could have dropped the title in england but now all these people know that i am sir ernest and sir ernest i shall remain for the rest of my days well most people would not think that such a dreadful misfortune yes they would if they had happened to shoot the real heir by the way what did the lawyer say in his letter as we are so near home i suppose i had better post myself up you will find it in the despatchbox read it theres a good fellow jeremy opened the box battered with many years of travel and searched about for the letter it contained a curious collection of articles prominent among which was a handkerchief which once belonged to eva ceswick a long tress of chestnut hair tied up with a blue ribbon ditto of golden which had come well not from evas locks a whole botanical collection of dead flowers tender souvenirs of goodness knows who for after a while these accumulated dried specimens are difficult to identify and many letters and other curiosities at last jeremy came to the desired document written in a fair clerks hand and having shovelled back the locks of hair c began to read it aloud st ethelreds court poultry nd january sir you see broke in ernest while we were fighting over there at isandhlwana those beggars were writing to tell me that i was a baronet case of the bloody hand with a vengeance eh sir began jeremy again it is out duty to inform you of the death on the th of the present month of our esteemed client sir hugh kershaw bart of archdale hall devonshire and of the consequent devolution of the baronetcy to yourself as only son of the late sir hughs only brother ernest kershaw esq into the question of the unhappy manner in which you came to be placed in the immediate succession it does not become us to enter we have before us at this moment a certified copy of her majestys pardon granted to you under the transvaal amnesty act of and forwarded to us by reginald cardus esq of dums ness suffolk which we have neither the wish nor the will to dispute it is clear to us that under this pardon you are totally free from any responsibility for the breach of the law which you perpetrated some years since and of this it is our duty to advise you your title to succeed is also clear under the original patent as was only to be expected under the circumstances the late sir hugh did not bear any feeling of goodwill towards you indeed we do not think that we shall be exaggerating if we say that the news of your free pardon materially hastened his end on the attainment of full age by the late hugh kershaw esq who fell by your hand the entail of the family estates was cut and only the mansionhouse of archdale hall the heirlooms which are numerous and valuable therein contained and the deerpark consisting of one hundred and eightyfive acres of land were resettled these consequently pass to you and we shall be glad to receive your instructions concerning them should you elect to honour us with your confidence the estates pass under the will of the late baronet to a distant cousin of his late wifes james smith esq camperdown road upper clapham we now think that we have put you in possession of all the facts connected with your accession to the baronetcy and awaiting your instructions have the honour to remain your obedient servants paisley paisley signed ah so much for that was ernests comment what am i to do with archdale hall its heirlooms and its deerpark of one hundred and eightyfive acres i wonder i shall sell them if i can mine is a pretty position a baronet with about sixpence halfpenny per annum to support my rank on a very pretty position hamba gachlй replied jeremy time enough to consider all that but now as we are on the reading lay i may as well give you the benefit of my correspondence with the officer commanding her majestys forces in natal and zululand fire away remarked ernest wearily first letter dated newcastle natal th january from your humble servant to officer commanding c sir i have the honour to report by order of lieutenant and adjutant kershaw of alstons horse at present incapacitated by lightning from doing so himself very nearly put that i think interpolated jeremy very go on that on the nd inst alstons horse having received orders to check the flanking movement of the undi corps proceeded to try and do so coming to a ridge commanding the advance of the undi the corps by order of their late commander captain alston dismounted and opened fire on them at a distance of about three hundred yards with considerable effect this did not however check the undi who appeared to number between three and four thousand men so captain alston issued an order to charge the enemy this was done with some success the zulus lost a number of men the corps which passed right through the enemy about twenty troopers captain alston and his son roger alston who acted as his aidedecamp several horses and one or two men were also severely wounded which crippled the further movements of the corps lieutenant and adjutant kershaw on taking command of the corps determined to attempt to retreat in this attempt however he failed owing to the presence of dismounted and wounded men to the detachment of a body of about three hundred zulus to intercept any such retreat and to the presence of a large body of zulus on the farther side of the pass leading to the valley through which such retreat might be conducted under these circumstances he determined to fight the remains of the corps to the last and dismounting them took possession of a fairly advantageous position a desperate handtohand encounter ensued it ended in the almost total extermination of alstons horse and in that of the greater part of the attacking zulus the names of the surviving members of alstons horse are lieutenant and adjutant kershaw sergeantmajor jeremy jones trooper mazooku the only native in the corps these ultimately effected their escape the enemy having either been all destroyed or having followed the track of the undi lieutenant and adjutant kershaw regrets to have to state that in process of effecting his escape he was struck by lightning and blinded he estimates the total loss inflicted on the enemy by alstons horse at from four hundred to four hundred and fifty men in face of such determined bravery as was evinced by every one of his late gallant comrades lieutenant kershaw feels that it would be invidious for him to mention any particular names every man fought desperately and died with his face to the enemy he begs to enclose a return of the names of those lost the accuracy of which he cannot however guarantee as it is compiled from memory the papers of the corps having all been lost trusting that the manoeuvres attempted by lieutenant kershaw under somewhat difficult circumstances will meet with your approval i have c by order of lieutenant kershaw signed jeremy jones sergeantmajor then follows the reply dated maritzburg nd february sir i have to direct you to convey to lieutenant and adjutant kershaw and the surviving members of the corps known as alstons horse the high sense entertained by the officer c of the gallant conduct of that corps in the face of overwhelming odds at isandhlwana on the nd of january it is with deep regret that the officer c learns of the heavy misfortune which has befallen lieutenant kershaw he wishes to express his appreciation of the way in which that officer handled the remnants of his corps and to inform him that his name will be forwarded to the proper quarter for the expression of her majestys pleasure with regard to his services i am directed to offer you a commission in any of the volunteer corps now on service in this campaign i have c signed chief of the staff it may be stated here that if this was ever done the war office did not consider ernests services worthy of notice for he never heard anything more about them then comes a letter from sergeantmajor jones gratefully acknowledging the expression of the high opinion of the officer c and declining the offer of a commission in another volunteer corps next is a private letter from the officer c offering to recommend sergeantmajor jeremy jones for a commission in the army and finally a letter from sergeantmajor jones to the officer c gratefully declining the same ernest looked up sharply the raison dиtre of the movement was gone for he could no longer see but the habit remained why did you decline the commission jeremy jeremy moved uneasily and looked through the little cabinwindow on general principles he answered presently nonsense i know you would have liked to go into the army dont you remember as we were riding up to the camp at isandhlwana you said that you proposed that if the corps did anything we should try and work it yes well well i said we i dont quite follow you jeremy my dear ernest you cant go in for a commission now can you ernest laughed a little bitterly what has that to do with it everything i am not going to leave you in your misfortune to go and enjoy myself in the army i could not do it i should be wretched if i did no old fellow we have gone through a good many things side by side and please god we will stick to each other to the end of the chapter ernest was always easily touched by kindness especially now that his nerves were shaken and his heart softened by misfortune and his blind eyes filled with tears at jeremys words putting out his hand he felt about for jeremys and when he had found it grasped it warmly if i have troubles jeremy at least i have a blessing that few can boast a true friend if you had gone with the rest at isandhlwana yonder i think that my heart would have broken i think we do bear one another a love passing the love of women it would not be worth much if it didnt that is one thing i wonder if absalom was a finer fellow than you are jeremy from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him your hair would not weigh two hundred shekels after the kings weight though jeremy wore his hair cropped like a convicts but i would back you to throw absolom over your shoulder hair and all it was his fashion to talk nonsense when affected by anything and jeremy knowing it said nothing just then there came a knock at the door and who should enter but mazooku and mazooku transformed his massive frame instead of being clothed in the loose white garments he generally wore was arrayed in a flannel shirt with an enormous stickup collar a suit of pepperandsalt reachmedowns several sizes too small for him and a pair of boots considerably too large for his small and shapely feet for like those of most zulus of good blood his hands and feet were extremely delicately made to add to the incongruity of his appearance on the top of his hair which was still done in ridges zulu fashion and decorated with long bone snuffspoons was perched an extremely small and rakishlooking billycock hat and in his hand he carried his favourite and most gigantic knobstick on opening the cabindoor he saluted in the ordinary fashion and coming in squatted down on his haunches to await orders forgetting that he was not in all the freedom of his native dress the results were most disastrous with a crack and a bang the reachmedown trousers already strained to their utmost capacity split right up the back the astonished zulu flew up into the air but presently discovering what had happened sat down again remarking that there was much more room now jeremy burst out laughing and having sketched his retainers appearance for the benefit of ernest told him what had happened where did you get those things from mazooku asked ernest mazooku explained that he had bought the rigout for three pound ten from a secondclass passenger as the weather was growing cold do not wear them again i will buy you clothes as soon as we get to england if you are cold wear your greatcoat koos how is the devil ernest had brought the black stallion on which he had escaped from isandhlwana home with him mazooku replied that the horse was well but playful a man forward had been teasing him with a bit of bread he had waited till that man passed under his box and had seized him in his teeth lifted him off the ground by his coat and shaken him severely good give him a branmash tonight koos and so you find the air cold are you not regretting that you came i warned you that you would regret ou ka inkoos o no chief the zulu answered in his liquid native tongue when first we came upon the smoking ship and went out on to the black water out of which the white men rise and my bowels twisted up and melted within me and i went through the agonies of a hundred deaths then i regretted o why i said in my heart did not mazimba my father kill me rather than bring me on to this great moving river surely if i live i shall grow like a white man from the whiteness of my heart for i am exceedingly afraid and have cast all my inside forth all this i said and many more things which i cannot remember but they were dark and heavy things but behold my father when my bowels had ceased to melt and when new ones had grown to replace those which i had thrown forth i was glad and did eat much beef and then i questioned my heart about this journey over the black water and my heart answered and said mazooku son of ingoluvu of the tribe of the maquilisini of the people of the amazulu you have done well great is the chief whom you serve great is mazimba on the huntingpath great was he in the battle all the undi could not kill him and his brother the lion jeremy and his servant the jackal mazooku who hid in a hole and then bit those who digged o yes mazimba is great and his breast is full of valour you have seen him strike the undi down and his mind is full of the white mans knowledge and discretion you have seen him form the ring that spat out fire so fast that his servants the horsemen were buried under the corpses of the undi so great is he that the heaven above smelled him out as tagati as a wizard and struck him with their lightning but could not kill him then and so now my father wanders and wanders and shall wander in the darkness seeing not the sun or the stars or the flashing of spears or the light that gathers in the eyes of brave men as they close in the battle or the love which gleams in the eyes of women and how is this shall my father want a dog to lead him in the darkness shall his dog mazooku son of ingoluvu prove a faithless dog and desert the hand that fed him and the man who is braver than himself no it shall not be so my chief and my father by the head of chaka whither thou goest thither will i go also and where thou shalt build thy kraal there shall i make my hut koos baba and having saluted after the dignified zulu fashion mazooku departed to tie up his split trousers with a bit of string there was something utterly incongruous between his present appearance and his melodious and poetical words instinct as they were with qualities which in some respects make the savage zulu a gentleman and put him above the white christian who for the most part regards the nigger as a creature beneath contempt for there are lessons to be learned even from zulu niggers and among them we may reckon those taught by a courage which laughs at death an absolute fidelity to those who have a right to command it or the qualities necessary to win it and in their raw and unconverted state perfect honesty and truthfulness he is a good fellow mazooku said ernest when the zulu had gone but i fear that one of two things will happen to him either he will get homesick and become a nuisance or he will get civilised and become drunken and degraded i should have done better to leave him in natal chapter ii ernests evil destiny about nine oclock in the morning following mazookus oration a young lady came running up the stairs of the principal plymouth hotel and burst into a private sittingroom like a human bombshell of attractive appearance somewhat to the astonishment of a bald old gentleman who was sitting at breakfast good gracious dorothy have you gone suddenly mad o reginald the conway castle is nearly in and i have been to the office and got leave for us to go off in the launch so come along quick what time does the launch leave a quarter to ten exactly then we have threequarters of an hour o please reginald be quick it might go before you know mr cardus smiled and rising put on his hat and coat to oblige dorothy he said but as a matter of fact he was as excited as she was there was a patch of red on each of his pale cheeks and his hand shook in a quarter of an hour they were walking up and down the quay by the custom house waiting for the launch to start after all these years said mr cardus and blind do you think that he will be much disfigured reginald i dont know dear your brother said nothing about it i can hardly believe it it seems so strange to think that he and jeremy should have been spared out of all those people how good god is a cynic replied mr cardus with a smile or the relations of the sixty other people who died might draw a different conclusion but dorothy was thinking how good god was to her she was dressed in pink that morning and oh she looked sweet as the little pink flower that grows in the wheat dorothy neither was nor ever would be a pretty woman but she was essentially a charming one her kindly puzzled face and to judge from the little wrinkles on it she had never got to the bottom of the questions which contracted her forehead as a child her steady blue eyes her diminutive rounded form and above all the indescribable light of goodness which shone round her like a halo all made her charming what did it matter if the mouth was a little too wide or the nose somewhat tiptilted those who can look so sweet are able to dispense with such fleshly attributes as a grecian nose or chiselled lips at the least they will have the best of it after youth is past and let me remind you my young and lovely reader that the longer and dustier portion of lifes road winds away towards the pale horizon of our path on the farther side of the grim milepost marked but what made her chiefly attractive was her piquante taking manner and the chic of her presence she was such a perfect lady all aboard if you please broke in the agent run in the gangway and they were off towards the great grey vessel with a blue pennant at the top it was a short run but it seemed long to dorothy and the old gentleman with her bigger and bigger grew the great vessel till at last it seemed to swallow up their tiny steamer ease her look out for the line there now haul away make fast it was all done in an instant and next moment they stood upon the broad white deck amid the crowd of passengers and were looking round for ernest and jeremy but they were not to be seen i hope they are here faltered dorothy mr cardus took his hat off and wiped his bald head he too hoped that they were there at that moment dorothy became aware of a black man clad in a white smock pulled on over a greatcoat and carrying a big spear and a kerrie in his hand who was pushing his way towards them next moment he stood before them saluting vigorously koos he said thrusting his spear into the air before mr carduss astonished nose inkosikaas chieftainess he repeated going through the same process before dorothy this way master this way missie the chief without eyes send me to you this way the lion bring him now they followed him through the press towards the after part of the ship while giving up the unfamiliar language he vociferated in zulu it might have been sanskrit for all they knew make way you low people make way for the old man with the shining head on whose brow sits wisdom and the fair young maiden the sweet rosebud who comes c at that moment dorothys quick eye saw a great man issuing from a cabin leading another man by the hand and then she forgot everything and ran forward o ernest ernest she cried the blind mans cheek flushed at the music of her voice he drew his hand from jeremys and stretched out his arms towards the voice it would have been easy to avoid them one never need be kissed by a blind man but she did not avoid them on the contrary she placed herself so that the groping arms closed round her while a voice said dorothy where are you here ernest here and in another moment he had drawn her to him and kissed her on the face and she had returned the kiss next she kissed jeremy too or rather jeremy lifted her up two or three feet and kissed her it came to the same thing then mr cardus wrung them both by the hand wringing ernests the hardest and mazooku stood by and zulu fashion chanted a little song of his own improvising about how the chiefs came back to their kraal after a long expedition in which they had c and how wisdom in the shape of a shining headed and ancient one the husband without any doubt of many wives and the father of at least a hundred children c and beauty in the shape of a sweet and small one c and finally they all went very near to crying and dancing a fling on the quarterdeck together after these things they all talked at once and set about collecting their goods in a muddleheaded fashion when these had been put in a pile and mazooku was seated assegai and all upon the top of them as a solemn warning to thieves and ill would it have gone with the thief who dared to meddle with that pile they started off to inspect ernests great black horse the devil behold dorothy stroked the devils nose and he recognising how sweet and good she was abandoned his usual habits and did not bite her but only whinnied and asked for sugar then ernest going into the box with the horse which nobody but he and mazooku were fond of taking liberties with felt down his flank till he came to a scar inflicted by an assegai in that mad charge through the undi and showed it to them and dorothys eyes filled with tears of thankfulness as she thought of what that horse and its rider had gone through and of the bleaching bones of those who had galloped by their side and she would have liked to kiss ernest again only there was no excuse so she only pressed his hand feeling that the sorrow of the empty years which were gone was almost atoned for by this hour of joy then they went ashore to the hotel and sat together in the pleasant sittingroom which dorothy had chosen and made sweet with great bunches of violets for she remembered that ernest loved violets and talked at length mr cardus and jeremy went off to see about getting the things through the custom house where they arrived to find mazooku keeping half a dozen gorgeous officials who wanted to open a box at bay with his knobsticks and plastering them with offensive epithets which fortunately they did not understand doll said ernest presently it is a beautiful day is it not will you take me for a walk dear i should like to go for a walk yes ernest of course i will you are sure you do not mind being seen with a blind man you must give me your hand to hold you know ernest how can you mind giving him her hand to hold indeed thought dorothy to herself as she ran to put her bonnet on o that she could give it to him for always and in her heart she blessed the accident of his blindness because it brought him so much nearer to her he would be helpless without her this tall strong man and she would be ever at his side to help him he would not be able to read a book or write a letter or to move from room to room without her surely she would soon be able so to weave herself into his life that she would become indispensable to it and then perhaps perhaps and her heart pulsed with a joy so intense at the mere thought of what might follow that it became a pain and she caught her breath and leaned against a wall for every fibre of her frame was thrilled with a passionate love for this blind man whom she had lost for so many years and now had found again and in her breast she vowed that if she could help it she would lose him no more why should she when he had been engaged to eva she had done her best for him and her and bitterly had she felt the way in which he had been treated but eva had taken her own course and was now no longer in the outward and visible running whatever place she might still hold in the inward and spiritual side of ernests nature dorothy did not underrate that place she knew well that the image of her rival had sunk too deep into his heart to be altogether dislodged by her but she was prepared to put up with that one cant have everything you know she said shaking her wise little head at her own reflection in the glass as she tied her bonnetstrings dorothy was an eminently practical little person and having recognised the eternal verity of the saying that half a loaf is better than no bread especially if one happens to be dying of hunger she made up her mind to make the best of the position since she could not help it eva would be welcome to the inward and spiritual side of ernest and only she could secure the outward and visible side for after all that is real and tangible and there isnt much human comfort in spiritual affection you know she said with another shake of the head in short the arguments which proved so convincing to her were not unlike those that carried conviction home to the gentle breast of mr plowden when he made up his mind to marry eva in the teeth of her engagement to and love for ernest but putting aside the diversity of the circumstances there was this difference between them mr plowden recognised no higher spiritual part at all he did not believe in that sort of thing he contracted for eva as he would have contracted to buy a lovely animal and when he had got the given quantity of flesh and blood he was satisfied of the soul the inner self which the human casket held and which loathed and hated him he took no account he had got the woman what did he care about the womans soul souls and spiritual parts and affinities with what is good and high and the divinity of love c c were capital things to preach about but they did not apply to the affairs of everyday life besides if he had been asked he would have given it as his candid opinion that women did not possess any of these things there are hundreds of educated men who think like mr plowden and there are thousands of educated ladies who give colour to such opinions by their idle aimless course of life their utter inappreciation of anything beyond their own little daily round and the gossip of the dozen or so of families who for them make up what they call society and the interests of existence and by their conduct in the matter of marriage truly the great factor in the lowering of women is woman herself but what does it matter in due course they have their families and the world goes on now dorothy did believe in all these things and she knew what an important part they play in human affairs and how they dominate over and direct finer minds so did she believe in the existence of the planets and in the blooming of roses in walled gardens but as she could not get near to know the beauties of the stars or to see the opening rosebuds she had to satisfy herself with the light that poured from the one and the scent that came from the other when one is starstricken or mad in the matter of roses that is better than nothing so taking ernest by the hand she led him through the crowded streets with tender care and on to the quiet hoe and as they passed the people turned to look at the handsome young fellow who was blind and some thought that they would not mind a little blindness if it led to being personally conducted by so sweet a maid soon they reached the gardens now tell me about yourself ernest what have you been doing all these long years besides growing bigger and handsomer and getting that hard look about the mouth a great many things doll shooting fighting playing the fool pshaw i know all that or at least i can guess it what have you been doing in your mind you know why thinking of you of course doll ernest if you talk to me like that i will go away and leave you to find your own way home i know well of whom you have been thinking every day and every night it was not of me now confess it dont lets talk of her doll if you talk of the devil you know you sometimes raise him not that he requires much raising in this instance he laughed bitterly i was so sorry for you ernest dear and i did my best indeed i did but i could do nothing with her she must have been off her head or that man dorothy always spoke of plowden as that man and florence had some power over her or perhaps she never really cared for you there are some women you know who seem very sweet but cannot truly care for anybody except themselves at any rate she married and has a family of children for i have seen their births in the paper oh ernest when i think of all you must have suffered out there about that woman i cease to be sorry for her and begin to hate her i am afraid you have been very unhappy ernest all these years ah yes i have been unhappy sometimes sometimes i have consoled myself there what is the use of telling lies i have always been unhappy and never more so than when i have been in process of consolation but you should not hate her poor girl perhaps she has her bad times too only unfortunately you women cannot feel at least not much not like us i mean i dont know about that put in dorothy well i will qualify my remark most women and besides it is not quite her fault people cannot help themselves much in this world she was appointed to be my evil destiny that is all and she must fulfil her mission all my life she will probably bring me trouble till at last the fate works itself out but dolly my dear there must be an end to these things and nature always fertile in analogies teaches us that the end of sorrow will be happiness it is from the darkness of night that day is born and ice and snow are followed by the flowers nothing is lost in the world as old alston used to say and it is impossible to suppose that all the grief and suffering are alone wasted that they are the only dull seeds which will not when their day comes bloom into a beautiful life they may seem to be intangible things now but after all the difference between tangible and intangible is only a difference of matter we know that intangible things are real enough and perhaps in a future state we shall find that they are the true immortal parts i think so myself i think so too well then doll you see if once one gets the mastery of that idea it makes the navigation easier once admit that everything works to an end and that end a good and enduring one and you will cease to call out under your present sorrows but it is hard for the little boy to learn to like being whipped and we are all children doll to the end of our days yes and you see doll for some reason i have been picked out for the rods it does seem rather hard that a woman like that should be allowed to turn all the wine of a mans life into vinegar but so it often is now if she had died that would have been bad enough but i could have borne it and bided my time in the hope of joining her or if she had ceased to love me and learned to love the other man i think i could have borne that because my pride would have come to my rescue and because i know that the law of her affections is the only law which the heart of woman readily acknowledges to however many others she may be forced to conform and that a woman of refined nature who has ceased to love you and is yet forced to live with you is in consequence a thing worthless to you and dishonoured in her own eyes besides i ask no favours in such matters i have no sympathy as a general rule with people who raise a din because they have lost the affection of their wives or sweethearts for they should have been able to keep them if any man could have cut me out he was welcome to do so for he would have proved himself the better man and as for the lady i would not have her without her heart but i gather that was not quite the case with eva o no indeed at least she said that she was wretched exactly as i thought well now you will understand that it is rather hard you see i did love her dearly and it is painful to think of this woman whose love i won and who by that divine right and by the law of nature should have been my wife as forced into being the wife of another man however charming he may be and i hope for her sake that he is charming in fact it fills me with a sensation i cannot describe poor ernest oh no dont pity me everybody has his troubles this is mine oh ernest but you have been unfortunate and now your sight has gone but perhaps critchett or couper would be able to do something with that all the critchetts and coupers in the world will never do anything for it my dear but you must remember that where i only lost my sight many others lost their lives and it is supposed to better to lose your sight than your life besides blindness has its advantages it gives you more time to think and it humbles you so much you can have no idea what it is like doll intense everlasting blackness hedging you in like a wall one long long night even when the sunlight is beating on your face and out of the night voices and the touching of hands like the voices and the touchings of departed spirits your physical body is as helpless and as much at the mercy of the world as your spiritual body is in the hands of the almighty things grow dim to you too you begin to wonder what familiar faces and sights are like as you wonder about the exact appearance of those who died many years ago or of places you have not seen for years all of which my dear doll is very favourable to thought when next you lie awake for five or six hours in the night try to reckon all the things which occupy your brain then imagine such wakefulness and its accompanying thoughts extended over the period of your natural life and you will get some idea of the depth and breadth and height of total blindness his words struck her and she did not know what to answer so she only pressed his hand in token of her mute sympathy he understood her meaning the faculties of the blind are very quick do you know doll he said coming back to you and your gentle kindness is like coming into the peace and quiet of a sheltered harbour after bearing the full brunt of the storm just then a cloud which had obscured the sun passed away and its full light struck up on his face there he went on it is like that it is like emerging into the sweet sunshine after riding for miles through the rain and mist you bring peace with you my dear i have not felt such peace for years as i feel holding your hand today i am very glad dear ernest she answered and they walked on in silence at that moment a little girl who was trundling a hoop down the gravelpath stopped her hoop to look at the pair she was very pretty with large dark eyes but dorothy noticed that she had a curious mark upon her forehead presently dorothy saw her run back towards an extremely tall and graceful woman who was sauntering along followed at some distance by a nurse with a baby in her arms and turning occasionally to look at the beds of spring flowers hyacinths and tulips which bordered the path o mother she heard the little girl call out in the clear voice of childhood there is such a nice blind man he isnt old and ugly and he hasnt a dog and he doesnt ask for pennies why is he blind if he hasnt a dog and doesnt ask for pennies blindness according to this little ladys ideas evidently sprang from the presence of a cur and an unsatisfied hunger for copper coin sometimes it does the tall graceful lady looked up carelessly saying hush dear she was quite close to them now for they were walking towards each other and dorothy gave a great gasp for before her stood eva plowden there was no doubt about it she was paler and haughtierlooking than of yore but it was she no one who had once seen her could mistake that queenly beauty certainly dorothy could not mistake it what is the matter doll said ernest carelessly he was thinking of other things nothing i hurt myself they were quite close now eva too looked at them she too saw a face she had never thought to see again with all her eyes and with her lips parted as though to cry out she gazed at the sight before her slowly slowly taking in all it meant they were nearly level now then there leaped up into her eyes which a second before had been so calm a wild light of love an intensity of passionate and jealous desire such as is not often to be seen on the faces of women ernest there and ernest blind being led by the hand of dorothy and looking happy with her how dared dorothy touch her love how dared he look happy with her those were the thoughts which flashed through her troubled mind she made a step towards them as though to address him and the blind eyes fell upon her lovely face and wandered over it it made her mad his eyes were on her and yet he could not see her o god dorothy saw the motion and moved by an overmastering instinct threw herself between them in an attitude of protection not unmixed with defiance so for a second their eyes flashing and their bosoms heaving with emotion the two women stood face to face and the blind pathetic eyes wandered uneasily over both feeling a presence they were unable to define it was a tragic almost a dreadful scene the passions it revealed were almost too intense for words as no brush can justly paint a landscape made vivid by the unnatural fierceness of the lightning well doll why do you stop ernest said impatiently his voice broke the spell eva withdrew her arm which was half outstretched and touched her lips with her fingers as though to enjoin silence then a deep misery spread itself over her flushed face her head sank low and she passed thence with rapid steps presently the nurse with the baby followed her and dorothy noticed vaguely that this child had also a mark upon its forehead the whole incident had not lasted forty seconds doll said ernest in a wild voice and commencing to tremble who was it that passed us a lady was the answer a lady yes i know that what lady i dont know a lady with children it was a fib but she could not tell him then an instinct warned her not to do so oh it is strange doll strange but do you know i felt just now as though eva were very near me come let us go home just then the cloud got over the sun again and they walked home in the shadow apparently too all their talkativeness had gone the way of the sun they had nothing to say chapter iii introspective eva plowden could scarcely be said to be a happy woman a refined person who has deliberately married one man when she loves another is not as a rule happy afterwards unless indeed she is blessed or cursed with a singularly callous nature but there are degrees and degrees of unhappiness such a fate as evas would have killed dorothy and would have driven florence bad as she might otherwise be to suicide or madness but with eva herself it was not so she was not sufficiently finely strung to suffer thus hers was not a very happy life but that was all she had been most miserable but when the first burst of her misery had passed like the raving storm that sometimes ushers in a wet december day like a sensible woman she had more or less reconciled herself to her position the day was always rather wet it is true but still the sun peeped out now and again and if life was not exactly a joyous thing it was at least endurable yet with it all she loved ernest in her heart as much as ever his memory was inexpressibly dear to her and her regrets were sometimes very bitter on the whole however she had got over it wonderfully better than anybody would have thought possible who could have witnessed her agony some years before when florence told her the whole truth immediately after the wedding the sabine women we are told offered a very reasonable resistance to their rape by the romans but before long they gave the strongest proofs of reconciliation to their lot there was something of the sabine woman about eva indeed the contrast between her state of mind as regarded ernest and ernests state of mind as regarded her would make a curious study they each loved the other and yet how different had the results of that love been on the two natures to eva it had been and was a shamed sorrow sometimes very real to ernest the destruction of all that made life worth living the contrast indeed was so striking as to be almost pitiable so wide a gulf was fixed between the two the passion of the one was a wretched thing compared to the other but both were real it remained merely a difference of degree if evas affection was weak when measured by ernests this was because the soil in which it grew was poorer she gave all she had to give as for mr plowden he could not but feel that on the whole his matrimonial speculation had answered very well he was honestly fond of his wife and as he had a right to be very proud of her at times she was cold and capricious and at times she was sarcastic but take it altogether she made him a good and serviceable wife and lifted him up many pegs in the social scale people saw that though plowden was not a gentleman he had managed to marry a lady and a very lovely lady too and he was tolerated indeed to a certain extent courted for the sake of his wife it was principally to attain this end that he had married her so he had every reason to be satisfied with his bargain and he was besides proud to be the legal owner of so handsome a creature eva often thought of her old lover though except in the vaguest way she had heard nothing of him for years indeed she was as it happened thinking of him tenderly enough that very morning when her little girl had called her attention to the nice blind man and when at last in a way which seemed to her little short of miraculous she set eyes again upon his face her smothered smouldering passion broke into flame and she felt that she still loved him with all her strength such as it was at that moment indeed she realised how great how bitter how complete was the mistake she had made and what a beautiful thing life might have been for her if things had gone differently but remembering how things were she bowed her head and passed on for the time completely crushed presently however two points became clear in the confusion of her mind taking shape and form as distinct and indisputable mental facts and these were first that she was wildly jealous of dorothy second that it was her fixed determination to see ernest she regretted now that she had been too overcome to go up and speak to him for see him she must and would indeed her sick longing to look upon his face and hear his voice filled her with alarm eva reached her home after the meeting on the hoe just before luncheontime her husband was now acting as locum tenens for the rector of one of the plymouth parishes they had moved thus from place to place for years waiting for the kesterwick living to fall vacant and eva liked the roving life well enough it diverted her thoughts presently she heard her husband enter bringing somebody else with him and summoned up the sweet smile for which she was remarkable to greet him in another instant he was in the room followed by a freshfaced subaltern whose appearance reminded her of the pictures of cherubs mr plowden had changed but little since we saw him last with the exception that his hair was now streaked with white and the whole face rather stouter otherwise the cold grey eyes were as cold as ever and the countenance of plowden was what the countenance of plowden had always been powerful intelligent and coarselooking let me introduce my friend lieutenant jasper to you my dear he said in his full strong voice which was yet unpleasant to the ear we met at captain johnstones and as it is a long way to go to the barracks for lunch i asked him to come and take potluck with us the cherubic jasper had screwed an eyeglass into his round eye and through it was contemplating eva with astonished ecstasy like most very beautiful women she was used to that sort of thing and it only amused her faintly mr plowden too was used to it and took it as a personal compliment i am delighted she murmured and held out her hand the cherub suddenly waking to the fact dropped his eyeglass and plunging at the hand seized it as a pike does a little fish and shook it with enthusiasm eva smiled again shall we go to lunch she said sweetly and they went to lunch she sailing down in front of them with the grace of a swan at lunch itself the conversation lagged rather that is mr plowden talked with all the facility of an extemporary preacher the cherub gazed at this pale darkeyed angel and eva fully occupied with her own thoughts contributed a great many appreciative smiles and a few random remarks just as they were to her intense relief nearing the conclusion of the meal a messenger arrived to summon mr plowden to christen a dying baby he got up at once for he was punctilious in the performance of his duties and making excuses to his guest departed on his errand thus forcing eva to carry on the conversation have you been in plymouth long mr jasper she asked the eyeglass dropped spasmodically plymouth o dear no i only landed this morning landed indeed where from i did not know that any boat was in except the conway castle well i came by her from the zulu war you know i was invalided home for fever the cherub suddenly became intensely interesting to eva for it struck her that ernest must have come from africa indeed i hope you had a pleasant voyage it depends so much on your fellowpassengers does it not o yes we had a very nice lot of men on board wounded officers mostly there were a couple of very decent civilians too a giant of a fellow called jones and a blind baronet sir ernest kershaw evas bosom heaved i once knew a mr ernest kershaw i wonder if it is the same he was tall and had dark eyes thats the man he only got his title a month or two ago a melancholy sort of chap i thought but then he cant see now that jones is a wonderful fellow though could pull two heavy men up at once as easily as you would lift a puppydog saw him do it myself i knew them both out there oh where did you meet them well it was rather curious i suppose you heard of the great disaster at that place with that awful name well i was at a beastly hole called helpmakaar when a fellow came riding like anything from rorkes drift telling us what had happened and that the zulus were coming so we all set to and worked like mad and just as we had got the place a little fit for them somebody shouted that he saw them coming that was just as it was getting dark i ran to the wall to look and saw not the zulus but a great big fellow carrying a dead man in his arms followed by a kafir leading three horses at least i thought the fellow was dead but he wasnt he had been struck by lightning we let him in and such a sight as they were you never saw all soaked with blood from top to toe ah and how did they come like that they were the only survivors of a volunteer corps called alstons horse they killed all the zulus that were attacking them when the zulus had killed everybody except them then they came away and the blind fellow that is sir ernest got struck in a storm fellows often do out there eva put further questions and listened with breathless interest to the story of ernests and jeremys wonderful escape so far as the details were known to mr jasper quite regardless of the pitiless fire that young gentleman was keeping on herself through his eyeglass at last reluctantly enough he rose to go i must be off now mrs plowden i want to go and call on sir ernest at the hotel he lent me a derringer pistol to practise at a bottle with and i forgot to give it back eva turned the full battery of her beautiful eyes upon him she saw that the young gentleman was struck and determined to make use of him women are unscrupulous when they have an end in view i am sorry you must go but i hope you will come and see me again and tell me some more about the war and the battles you are very kind he stammered i shall be delighted he did not think it necessary to add that he had not had the luck to see a shot fired himself why should he by the way if you are going to see sir ernest do you think you could give him a private message from me i have a reason for not wishing it to be overheard o yes i daresay i can nothing would give me greater pleasure you are very good another glance will you tell him that i wish he would take a fly and come to see me i shall be in all this afternoon a pang of jealousy shot through the cherubic bosom but he comforted himself with the reflection that a fine woman like that could not care for a blind fellow o certainly i will try thank you and she extended her hand he took it and intoxicated by those superb eyes ventured to press it tenderly a mild wonder took possession of evas mind that anybody so very young could have developed such an astonishing amount of impudence but she did not resent the pressure what did she care about having her hand squeezed when it was a question of seeing ernest poor deluded cherub chapter iv after many days within an hour of the departure of lieutenant jasper eva heard a fly draw up at the door then came an interval and the sound of two people walking up the steps one of whom stumbled a good deal then a ring is mrs plowden at home said a clear voice the wellremembered tones of which sent the blood to her head and then back to her heart with a rush yes sir oh wait here flyman now my good girl i must ask you to give me your hand for i am not in a condition to find my way about strange places another pause and the drawingroom opened and the maid came in leading ernest who wore a curious drawn look upon his face how do you do she said in a low voice coming and taking him by the hand that will do jane he did not speak till the door closed he only looked at her with those searching blind eyes thus they met again after many years she led him to a sofa and he sat down do not leave go of my hand he said quickly i have not yet got used to talking to people in the dark she sat down on the sofa beside him feeling frightened and yet happy for awhile they remained silent apparently they could find nothing to say and after all silence seemed most fitting she had never thought to sit hand in hand with him again she looked at him there was no need to keep a guard over her loving glances for he was blind at length she broke the silence were you surprised to get my message she asked gently yes it was like getting a message from the dead i never expected to see you again i thought that you had quite passed out of my life so you had forgotten me why do you say such a thing to me you must know eva that it is impossible for me to forget you i almost wish that it were possible i meant that you had passed out of my outward life for out of my mind you can never pass eva hung her head and was silent though his words sent a thrill of happiness through her so she had not quite lost him after all listen eva ernest went on gathering himself together and speaking sternly enough now with a strange suppressed energy that frightened her how you came to do what you have done you best know it is done do not let us speak of it i was not altogether to blame she broke in i was not going to speak of it but i was going to say this now while i have the chance because time is short and i think it right that you should know the truth i was going to tell you first that for what you have done i freely forgive you o ernest it is he went on not heeding her a question that you can settle with your conscience and your god but i wish to tell you what it is that you have done you have wrecked my life and made it an unhappy thing you have taken that from me which i can never have to give again you have embittered my mind and driven me to sins of which i should not otherwise have dreamed i loved you and you gave me proofs that i could not doubt that i had won your love you let me love you then when the hour of trial came you deserted and morally destroyed me and the great and holy affection that should have been the blessing of my life has become its curse eva covered her face with her hands and sat silent you do not answer me eva he said presently with a little laugh perhaps you find what i have to say difficult to answer or perhaps you think i am taking a liberty you are very hard she murmured had you not better wait till i have done before you call me hard if i wished to be hard i should tell you that i no longer cared for you that my prevailing feeling towards you was one of contempt it would perhaps mortify you to think that i had shaken off such heavy chains but it is not the truth eva i love you now as i always have loved you as i always shall love you i hope for nothing i ask for nothing in this business it has always been my part to give not to receive i despise myself for it but so it is she laid her hand upon his shoulder spare me ernest she whispered i have very little more to say only this i believe all that i have given you has not been given uselessly i believe that the love of the flesh will die with the flesh but my love for you has been something more and higher than that or how has it loved without hope and in spite of its dishonour through so many years it is of the spirit and i believe that its life will be like that of the spirit unending and that when this hateful existence is done with i shall in some way reap its fruits with you why do you believe that ernest it seems too happy to be true why do i believe it i cannot tell you perhaps it is nothing but the fantasy of a mind broken down with brooding on its grief in trouble we grow towards the light like a plant in the dark you know as a crushed flower smells sweet so all that is most aspiring in human nature is called into life when god lays his heavy hand upon us heaven is sorrows sole ambition no eva i do not know why i believe it certainly you have given me no grounds for faith but i do believe it and it comforts me by the way how did you know that i was here i passed you on the hoe this morning walking with dorothy ernest started i felt you pass he said and asked dorothy who it was she said she did not know she knew but i made a sign to her not to say oh ernest will you promise me something asked eva wildly what is it nothing i have changed my mind nothing at all the promise that she was about to ask was that he would not marry dorothy but her better nature rose in rebellion against it then they talked awhile of ernests life abroad well said ernest rising after a pause goodbye eva it is a very cruel world she murmured yes it is cruel but not more cruel than the rest it has been a happiness to see you ernest he shrugged his shoulders as he answered has it for myself i am not sure if it has been a happiness or a misery i must have a year or two of quiet and darkness to think it over before i make up my mind will you kindly ring the bell for the servant to take me away half unconsciously she obeyed him then she came and took his hand looking with all her eyes and all her soul into his face it was fortunate that he could not see her o ernest you are blind she said scarcely knowing what she said he laughed a hard little laugh yes eva i am blind now as you have been always ernest ernest how can i live without seeing you i love you and she fell into his arms he kissed her once twice thrice nor did he kiss alone then he never knew how he found the strength to put her from him perhaps it was because he heard the servant coming next moment she came and led him away as soon as he was gone eva flung herself down on the sofa and sobbed as though her heart would break when dorothy saw a freshfaced young officer who had come up to see ernest mysteriously lead him aside and whisper something in his ear which caused him to turn first red and then white being a shrewd observer she thought it curious but when ernest asked her to ring the bell and ordered a fly to be brought round at once the idea of eva at once flashed into her mind she and no other must be at the bottom of this mystery presently the fly was announced and ernest went off without a word leaving her to the tender mercies of the cherub who was contemplating her with his round eye as he had contemplated eva and finding her also charming it must be remembered that he had but just returned from south africa and was prepared faute de mieux to fall in love with an applewoman how much more then would he succumb to the charms of the stately eva and the extremely fascinating dorothy it was some time before the latter could get rid of him and his eyeglass on an ordinary occasion she would have been glad enough to entertain him for dorothy liked a little male society also the cherub though he did look so painfully young was not a bad fellow and after all his whole soul was in his eyeglass and his staring was meant to be complimentary but just now she had a purpose in her mind and was heartily glad when he departed to reflect over the rival attractions of the two charmers it was very evident to dorothy who was always strictly practical that to keep eva and ernest in the same town was to hold dry tow to a lighted match over a barrel of gunpowder she only hoped that he might come back now without having bred more trouble oh what fools men are she said to herself with a stamp a pretty face and a pair of bright eyes and they count the world well lost for them bah if it had been a plain woman who played ernest that trick would he be found dangling about after her now not he but with her she has only to say a soft word or two and he will be at her feet ill be bound i am ashamed of them both meanwhile she was putting on her bonnet which was a very favourite time with her for meditation having already made up her mind as to her course of action ernest had authorised her to make arrangements for an interview with an oculist she proceeded to make those arrangements by telegram wiring to a celebrated surgeon to know if he could make an appointment for the following afternoon then she took a walk by herself to think things over in an hour she returned to find ernest in the sittingroom looking extremely shaken and depressed you have been to see eva she asked yes he answered just then there was a knock at the door and the servant brought in a telegram it was from the occulist he would be glad to see sir ernest kershaw at four oclock on the following afternoon i have made an appointment for you with an eyedoctor ernest at four oclock tomorrow tomorrow he said yes the sooner you get your eyes looked to the better he sighed what is the good however i will go so next morning they all took the express and at the appointed time ernest found himself in the skilful hands of the oculist but though an oculist can mend the sight he cannot make it i can do nothing for you sir ernest he said after an exhaustive examination your eyes will remain as they are but you must always be blind ernest took the news with composure i thought as much he said but dorothy put her handkerchief to her face and wept secretly next morning he went with jeremy to call on messrs paisley and paisley and told them to try and let archdale hall and to lock up the numerous and valuable heirlooms as unfortunately he was unable to see them then they went on home to dums ness and that night ernest lay awake in the room where he had slept for so many years in the boyhood which now seemed so dim and remote and listened to the stormy wind raving round the house and thought with an aching heart of eva but was thankful that he had bid her farewell and wondered if he could find the strength to keep away from her and eva his lost love she too lay by the sea and listened to the wind and thought of him there she lay in her beauty seeking the sleep that would not settle on her she could not sleep forgetful sleep does not come readily to such as she for her and those like her are vain regrets and an empty love and longing and the wreath of thorns that crowns the brow where sorrow is enthroned yet eva lift that fevered head and turn those seeking eyes to heaven see through the casement above the tumult of the storm there gleams a star for you too there shines a star called hope but it is set in no earthly sky have patience wayward heart there is but a space of trouble as you suffer so have millions suffered and are they not at peace so shall millions suffer while thou that once didst make the place thou stoodst in lovely shalt lie still thy form departed and thy face remembered not in good or ill for of this we may be sure if suffering is not the widest gate of heaven then heaven has no gates unhappy woman stretch out those longing arms in supplication to the god of sorrows for strength to bear your load since here it shall not be lightened the burdens which providence binds on our backs providence will sometimes lessen but those which our own folly fastens remain till death deliver us so eva dry your tears for they can avail you naught and go get you to your daily task go tend your children and smile that sweet sad smile on all alike and wait as you have sowed so shall you reap but seedtime is not done not yet is the crop white to the harvest chapter v home again it was very peaceful that life at kesterwick after all the fierce racket and excitement of the past years indeed as day succeeded day and brought nothing to disturb his darkness but the sound of dorothys gentle voice and the scent of flowers on the marshes when the wind blew towards the ocean and the sharp strong odour of the sea when it set upon the land ernest could almost fancy that the past was nothing but a dream more or less ugly and that this was a dream more or less pleasant from which he should presently awake and find himself a boy again english villages change but little now and again a person dies and pretty frequently some one is born but on the whole the tide of time creeps on very imperceptibly and though in the course of nature the entire population is changed every sixty years or so nobody seems to realise that it is changing there is so little in such places by which to mark the change the same churchtower makes a landmark to the eye as it did centuries ago in the eyes of our ancestors and the same clouds sweep across the same blue space above it there are the same old houses the same streams and above all the same roads and lanes if you could put one of our saxon forefathers down in the neighbourhood of most of our country towns he would have little difficulty in finding his way about it is the men who change not the places still there were some few changes at kesterwick here and there the sea had taken another bite of the cliff notably on the north side of dums ness out of which a large slice had gone thus bringing the water considerably nearer to the house here and there a tree too had been cut down or a cottage built or a family changed its residence for instance miss florence ceswick had suddenly shut up the cottage where she had remained ever since evas marriage seeing nothing of her sister or her sisters husband and had gone abroad people said to rome to study art for florence had suddenly electrified the kesterwick neighbourhood by appearing as an artist of tragic force and gruesome imagination a large picture by her hand had been exhibited in the royal academy of the previous year and though the colouring was somewhat crude and the drawing not faultless it made a deserved sensation and finally sold for a considerable sum this picture represented a promontory of land running out far into a stormy ocean the sky above the sea was of an inky blackness except where a fierce ray of light from the setting sun pierced it and impinged upon the boiling waters which surged round the low cliff of the promontory on the extreme edge of the cliff stood a tall and lovely woman the wind caught the white robe she wore and pressed it against her revealing the extraordinary beauty of her form and lifting her long fair locks tossed them in wild confusion she was bending forward pointing with her right hand at the water with such a look of ghastly agony upon her beautiful face and in the great grey eyes that people of impressionable temperament were wont to declare it haunted their sleep for weeks down below her just where the fierce ray lit up the heaving waters gleamed a naked corpse it was that of a young man and was slowly sinking into the unfathomable darkness of the depths turning round and round as it sank the eyes and mouth were wide open and the stare of the former appeared to be fixed upon those of the woman on the cliff lastly over the corpse in the stormwreaths above there hovered on steady wings a dim female figure with its arm thrown across the face as though to hide it in the catalogue this picture was called the lost lover but speculation was rife as to what it meant dorothy heard of it and went to london to see it the first thing that struck her about the work was the extraordinary contrast it presented to the commonplace canvases by which it was surrounded of reapers of little girls frisking with baalambs and nude young women musing profoundly on the edge of pools as though they were trying to solve the great question to wash or not to wash but soon the horror of the picture laid hold upon her and seemed to fascinate her as it had so many others then she became aware that the faces were familiar to her and suddenly it broke upon her mind that the sinking corpse was ernest and the agonised woman eva she examined the faces more attentively there was no doubt about it florence with consummate art had changed the colouring of the hair and features and even to a great extent altered the features themselves but she had preserved the likeness perfectly both upon the dead face of the murdered man and in the horrorinspired eyes of his lover the picture made her sick with fear she could not tell why and she hurried from burlington house full of dread of the terrible mind that had conceived it there had been no intercourse between the two women since evas marriage florence lived quite alone at the cottage and never went out anywhere and if they met by any chance they passed with a bow but for all that it was a relief to dorothy to hear that she was not for some long time to see that stern face with its piercing brown eyes in dums ness itself there appeared to be no change at all except that mr cardus had built a new orchidhouse at the back for as he grew older his mania for these flowers increased rather than diminished the place was exactly the same even the arrangement of the sittingroom was unchanged and on its familiar bracket rested the case which jeremy had made to contain the witchs head the people in the house to all appearance had changed as little as the house itself jeremy confided to ernest that doll had grown rather tubby which was his elegant way of indicating that she had developed a very pretty figure and that grice the old housekeeper was as skinny as a flayed weasel and had eyes like the point of a knife ernest maliciously repeated these sayings to the two ladies concerned with the result that they were both furious then he retreated and left them to settle it with jeremy old atterleigh too was almost exactly the same except that of late years his intellect seemed to have brightened a little it was however difficult to make him understand that ernest was blind because the latters eyes looked all right he retained some recollection of him and brought him his notched stick to show him that according to his hardriding atterleighs calculation his time of service with the devil otherwise mr cardus would expire in a few months dorothy read what the old man wrote upon his slate and repeated it to ernest for he being practically dumb and ernest being blind that was the only way in which they could communicate and what will you do then asked ernest you will be wretched without any writs to fill up who will look after the lost souls i should like to know the old man at once wrote vigorously on his slate i shall go out hunting on the big black horse you brought with you he will carry my weight i should advise you not to try said ernest laughing he does not like strange riders but the old man at the mere thought of hunting was striding up and down the room clanking his spurs and waving his huntingcrop with his uninjured arm is your grandfather as much afraid of your uncle as ever doll oh yes i think so and do you know ernest i dont quite like the way he looks at him sometimes ernest laughed i should think that the old boy is harmless enough he said i hope so said dorothy when first they came back to dums ness jeremy was at a great loss to know what to do with himself and was haunted by the idea that mr cardus would want him to resume that stool in his office which years before he had quitted to go in search of ernest a week or so after his arrival however his fears were set at rest very pleasantly after breakfast mr cardus sent for him to come into his office well jeremy he said letting his soft black eyes wander round that young gentlemans gigantic form for it was by now painfully large not so much in height for he was not six feet three as in its great width which made big men look like children beside him and even dwarfed his old grandfathers enormous frame well jeremy and what do you think of doing youre too big for a lawyer all your clients would be afraid of you i dont know about being too big said jeremy solemnly but i know that i am too great an ass besides i cant afford several years to spend in being articled at my time of life quite so then what do you propose doing i dont know from adam well how would you like to turn your sword to a ploughshare and become a farmer i think that would suit me firstrate i have some capital laid by ernest and i made a little money out there no i would not advise you to take a farm in that way these are bad times but i want a practical man to look after my land round here salary ј what do you say you are very kind but i doubt if i can boss that coach i dont know anything of the work oh you will very soon learn there is a capital bailiff stamp you remember him he will soon put you up to the ropes so we will consider that settled thus it was that our friend jeremy entered on a new walk in life and one which suited him very well in less than a years time he grew aggressively agricultural and one never met him but what he had a handful of oats or a carrot in his coattail pocket which he was ready to swear were samples of the finest oats carrot or whatever the particular agricultural product might be that ever had been or were ever likely to be grown chapter vi how it all came about how did it all come about let us try and discover dorothy and ernest were together all day long they only separated when mazooku came to lead the latter off to bed at breakfasttime he led him back again and handed him over to dorothy for the day not that our zulu friend liked this he did not like it at all it was he considered his business to lead his master about and not that of the rosebud who was as he discovered after all nothing but a girl connected with his master neither by birth nor marriage on this point there finally arose a difference of opinion between the rosebud and mazooku the latter was leading ernest for his morning walk when dorothy perceiving it and being very jealous of what she considered her rights sallied out and took his hand from the great zulus then did mazookus longpent indignation break forth o rosebud sweet and small rosebud he commenced addressing her in zulu of which needless to say she understood not one word why do you come and take my fathers hand out of my hand is not mazimba my father blind and am i not his dog his old dog to lead him in his blindness why do you take his bone from a dog what is the man saying asked dorothy he is offended because you come to lead me he says that he is my dog and that you snatch his bone from him a pretty sort of bone indeed he added tell him said dorothy that here in this country i hold your hand what does he want is he not always with you does he not sleep across your door what more does he want ernest translated her reply ow said the zulu with a grunt of dissatisfaction he is a faithful fellow doll and has stood by me for many years you must not vex him but dorothy after the manner of loving women was tenacious of what she considered her rights tell him that he can walk in front she said putting on an obstinate little look and she could look obstinate when she liked besides she added he cannot be trusted to lead you i am sure he was tipsy last night ernest translated the first remark only into the latter he did not care to inquire for the zulu vowed that he could never understand dorothys english and mazooku accepted the compromise thus for awhile the difference was patched up sometimes dorothy and ernest would go out riding together for blind as he was ernest could not be persuaded to give up his riding it was a pretty sight to see them ernest mounted on his towering black stallion the devil which in his hands was as gentle as a lamb but with everybody else fully justified his appellation and dorothy on a creamcoloured cob mr cardus had given her holding in her right hand a steel guidingrein linked to the devils bit in this way they would wander all over the countryside and sometimes when a good piece of turf presented itself even venture on a sharp canter behind them mazooku rode as groom mounted on a stout pony with his feet stuck zulu fashion well out at right angles to his animals side they were a strange trio so from weeks end to weeks end dorothy was ever by ernests side reading to him writing for him walking and riding with him weaving herself into the substance of his life at last there came one sunny august day when they were sitting together in the shade of the chancel of titheburgh abbey it was a favourite spot of theirs for the grey old walls sheltered them from the glare of the sun and the breath of the winds it was a spot too rich in memories of the dead past and a pleasant place to sit through the gaping windowplaces came the murmur of the ocean and the warmth of the harvest sunshine and gazing out by the chancel doorway dorothy could see the long lights of the afternoon dance and sparkle on the emerald waves she had been reading to him and the book lay idle on her knees as she gazed dreamily at those lights and shadows a sweet picture of pensive womanhood he too had relapsed into silence and was evidently thinking deeply presently she roused herself well ernest she said what are you thinking about you are as dull as as the dullest thing in the world whatever that may be what is the dullest thing in the world i dont know he answered awakening yes i think i do an american novel yes that is a good definition you are as dull as an american novel it is unkind of you to say so doll my dear i was thinking of something doll she made a little face which of course he could not see and answered quickly you generally are thinking of something you generally are thinking of eva except when you are asleep and then you are dreaming of her ernest coloured up yes he said it is true she is often more or less in my mind it is my misfortune doll not my fault you see i do not do things by halves dorothy bit her lip she should be vastly flattered i am sure few women can boast of having inspired such affection in a man i suppose it is because she treated you so badly dogs love the hand that whips them you are a curious character ernest not many men would give so much to one who has returned so little so much the better for them if i had a son i think that i should teach him to make love to all women and to use their affection as a means of amusement and selfadvancement but to fall in love with none that is one of your bitter remarks for which i suppose we must thank eva you are always making them now let me tell you that there are good women in the world yes and honest faithful women who when they have given their heart are true to their choice and would not do it violence to be made queen of england but you men do not go the right way to find them you think of nothing but beauty and never take the trouble to learn the hearts of the sweet girls who grow like daisies in the grass all round you but who do not happen to have great melting eyes or a splendid figure you tread them underfoot and if they were not so humble they would be crushed as you rush off and try to pick the rose and then you prick your fingers and cry out and tell all the daisies how shamefully the rose has treated you ernest laughed and dorothy went on yes it is an unjust world let a woman but be beautiful and everything is at her feet for you men are despicable creatures and care for little except what is pleasant to the senses on the other hand let her be plain or only ordinarylooking for the fate of most of us is just to escape being ugly and you pay as much regard to her as you do to the chairs you sit on and yet strange as it may seem to you probably she has her feelings and her capacities for high affections and her imaginative power all working vigorously behind her plain little face probably too she is better than your beauty nature does not give everything when she endows a woman with perfect loveliness she robes her either of her heart or her brains or perhaps of both but you men dont see that because you wont look so in course of time all the fine possibilities in miss plainface wither up and she becomes a disappointed old maid while my lady beauty pursues her career of selfishness and mischiefmaking till at last she withers up too thats one comfort we all end in bones you know and there isnt much difference between us then ernest had been listening with great amusement to dorothys views he had no idea that she took such matters into her shrewd consideration i heard a girl say the other day that on the whole most women preferred to become old maids he said then she told fibs they dont it isnt natural that they should that is if they care for anybody just think there are more than ten hundred thousand of our charming sisterhood in these islands and more women being born every day ten hundred thousand restless unoccupied disgusted loveless women it is simply awful to think of i wonder they dont breed a revolution if they were all beautiful they would he laughed again do you know what remedy mazooku would apply to this state of affairs no the instant adoption of polygamy there are no unmarried women among the natal zulus and as a class they are extremely happy dorothy shook her head it wouldnt do here it would be too expensive i say doll you spoke just now of our charming sisterhood you are rather young to consider yourself an old maid do you want to become one yes she said sharply then you dont care for anybody eh she blushed up furiously what business is it of yours i should like to know she answered well doll not much but will you be angry with me if i say something i suppose you can say what you like yes but will you listen if you speak i cannot help hearing well then doll now dont be angry dear o ernest how you aggravate me cant you get it out and have done with it all right doll ill steam straight ahead this time it is this i have sometimes lately been vain enough to think that you cared a little about me doll although i am as blind as a bat i want to ask you if it is true you must tell me plain doll because i cannot see your eyes to learn the truth from them she turned quite pale at his words and her eyes rested upon his blind orbs with a look of unutterable tenderness so it had come at last why do you ask me that question ernest whether or no i care for you i am very sure that you do not care for me you are not quite right there doll but i will tell you why i ask it it is not out of mere curiosity you know all the history of my life doll or at least most of it you know how i loved eva and gave her all that a foolish youngster can give to a weak woman gave it in such a way that i can never have it back again well she deserted me i have lost her certainly for this world and perhaps for all others if there are any others since i cannot see why people in a new existence should differ greatly from what they were in the old the leopard does not change its spots you know the best happiness of my life has been wrecked beyond redemption that is a fact which must be accepted as much as the fact of my blindness i am physically and morally crippled and certainly in no fit state to ask a woman to marry me on the ground of my personal advantages but if dear doll you should as i have sometimes thought happen to care about anything so worthless then you see the affair assumes a different aspect i dont quite understand you what do you mean she said in a low voice i mean that in that case i will ask you if you will take me for a husband you do not love me ernest i should weary you he felt for her hand found it and took it in his own she made no resistance dear he said it is this way i can never give you that passion i gave to eva because thank god the human heart can know it but once in a life but i can and will give you a husbands tenderest love you are very dear to me doll though it is not in the same way that eva is dear i have always loved you as a sister and i think that i should make you a good husband but before you answer me i want you to thoroughly understand about eva whether i marry or not i fear that i shall never be able to shake her out of my mind at one time i thought that perhaps if i made love to other women i might be able to do so on the principle that one nail drives out another but it was a failure for a month or two i got the better of my thoughts then they would get the better of me again besides to tell you the truth i am not quite sure that i wish to do so my trouble about this woman has become a part of myself it is as i told you my evil destiny and goes where i go and now dear doll you will see why i asked you if you really cared for me before i asked you to marry me if you do not care for me then it will clearly not be worth your while to marry me for i am about as poor a catch as a man can well be if you do well then it is a matter for your consideration she paused awhile and answered suppose that the positions were reversed ernest at least suppose this suppose that you had loved your eva all your life but she had not loved you except as a brother having given her heart to some other man who was say married to somebody else or in some way separated from her well supposing that this man died and that one day eva came to you and said ernest my dear i cannot love you as i loved him who has gone and whom i one day hope to rejoin in heaven but if you wish it and it will make you the happier i will be your true and tender wife what should you answer her ernest answer why i suppose that i should take her at her word and be thankful yes i think that i should take her at her word and so dear ernest do i take you at your word for as it is with you about eva so it is with me about you as a child i loved you ever since i have been a woman i have loved you more and more even through all those cold years of absence and when you came back ah then it was to me as it would be to you if you suddenly once more saw the light of day ernest my beloved you are all my life to me and i take you at your word my dear i will be your wife he stretched out his arms found her drew her to him and kissed her on the lips doll i dont deserve that you should love me so it makes me feel ashamed that i have not everything to give you in return ernest you will give me all you can i mean to make you grow very fond of me perhaps too one day you will give me everything he hesitated a little while before he spoke again doll he said you are sure quite that you do not mind about eva my dear ernest i accept eva as a fact and make the best of her just as i should if i wanted to marry a man with a monomania that he was henry viii doll you know i call her my evil destiny the fact is i am afraid of her she overpowers my reason well now doll what i am driving at is this supposing not that i think she will that she were to crop up again and take it into her head to try and make a fool of me she might succeed doll ernest will you promise me something on your honour yes dear promise me that you will hide from me nothing that passes between eva and yourself if anything ever should pass and that in this matter you will always consider me not in the light of a wife but of a trusted friend why do you ask me to promise that because then i shall i hope be able to keep you both out of trouble you are not fit to look after yourselves either of you i promise and now doll there is one more thing notwithstanding what i said just now it is somehow fixed in my mind that my fate and that womans are intertwined i believe perhaps foolishly enough that what we are now passing through is but a single phase of interwoven existence that we have already passed through possibly many stages and that many higher stages and developments await us the question is do you care to link your life with that of a man who holds such a belief ernest i daresay your belief is a true one at any rate to you who believe it for it seems probable that as we sow so shall we reap as we spiritually imagine so shall we spiritually inherit since causes must in time produce effects these beliefs are not implanted in our hearts for nothing and surely in the wide heavens there is room for the realisation of them all but i too have my beliefs and one of them is that in gods great hereafter every loving and desiring soul will be with the soul thus loved and desired for him or her at any rate the other will be there forming a part of his or her life though perhaps it may elsewhere and with others also be pursuing its own desires and satisfying its own aspirations so you see ernest your beliefs will not interfere with mine nor shall i be afraid of losing you in another place and now ernest my hearts love take my hand and let me lead you home take my hand as you have taken my heart and never leave go of it again till at last i die so hand in hand they went home together through the lights and shadows of the twilight chapter vii mazookus farewell dorothy and ernest returned to dums ness just in time to dress for dinner for since ernest and jeremy had come back dorothy whose will in that house was law had instituted late dinner the dinner passed over as usual dorothy sitting between ernest and her grandfather and attending to the wants of those two unfortunates both of whom would have found it rather difficult to get through their meal without her gentle unobtrusive help but when dinner was over and the cloth removed and grice had placed the wine upon the table and withdrawn an unusual thing happened ernest asked dorothy to fill his glass with port and when she had done so he said uncle and jeremy i am going to ask you to drink a health the old man looked up sharply what is it ernest my boy as for dorothy she blushed a rosy red guessing what was coming and not knowing whether to be pleased or angry it is this uncle it is the health of my future wife dorothy then came a silence of astonishment mr cardus broke it years ago ernest my dear nephew i told you that i wished this to come to pass but other things happened to thwart my plans and i never expected to see it now in gods good time it has come and i drink the health with all my heart my children i know that i am a strange man and my life has been devoted to a single end which is now drawing near its final development but i have found time in it to learn to love you both dorothy my daughter i drink your health may the happiness that was denied to your mother fall upon your head her share and your share too ernest you have passed through many troubles and have been preserved almost miraculously to see this day in dorothy you will find a reward for everything for she is a good woman perhaps i shall never live to see your happiness and the children of your happiness i do not think i shall but may the solemn blessing i give you now rest upon your dear heads god bless you both my children all peace go with you dorothy and ernest amen said jeremy in a loud voice and with a vague idea that he was in church next he got up and shook ernests hand so hard in his fearful grip that the latter was constrained to cry out and lifted dolly out of her chair like a plaything and kissed her boisterously knocking the orchidbloom she wore out of her hair in the process then they all sat down again and beamed at one another and drank portwine at least the men did and were inanely happy indeed the only person to whom the news was not satisfactory was mazooku ou he said with a grunt when jeremy communicated it to him so the rosebud is going to become the rose and i shant even be able to lead my father to bed now ou and from that day forward mazookus abstracted appearance showed that he was meditating deeply on something next morning his uncle sent for ernest into the office dorothy led him in o here you are said his uncle yes here we are reginald answered dorothy what is it shall i go away no dont go away what i have to say concerns you both come and look at the orchids ernest they are beautiful ah he went on stammering i forgot you cant see them forgive me never mind uncle i can smell them and they went into the bloominghouse appropriated to the temperate kinds at the end of this house was a little table and some iron chairs where mr cardus would sometimes come to smoke a cigarette here they sat down now young people said mr cardus wiping his bald head you are going to get married may i ask what you are going to get married on by jove said ernest i never thought of that i havent got much except a title a mansion with numerous and valuable heirlooms and one hundred and eighty acres of deer park he added laughing no i dont suppose you have but luckily for you both i am not so badly off and i mean to do something for you what do you think would be the proper thing come dorothy my little housewife what do you reckon you can live on living here i mean for i suppose that you do not mean to run away and leave me alone in my old age do you dorothy wrinkled up her forehead as she used to as a child and began to calculate upon her fingers presently she answered three hundred a year comfortably quietly on two what said mr cardus when the babies begin to come dorothy blushed old gentlemen are so unpleasantly outspoken and ernest jumped for the prospect of unlimited babies is alarming till one gets used to it better make it five hundred he said oh said mr cardus thats what you think is it well i tell you what i think i am going to allow you young people two thousand a year and to pay the housekeeping bills my dear uncle that is far more than we want nonsense ernest it is there and to spare and why should you not have it instead of its piling up in the bank or in investments there are enough of them now i can tell you everything that i have touched has turned to gold i believe it has often been the case with unfortunate men money i have more than i know what to do with and there are idiots who think that to have lots of money is to be happy he paused awhile and then went on i would give you more but you are both comparatively young and i do not wish to encourage habits of extravagance in you the world is full of vicissitudes and it is impossible for anybody to know how he may be pecuniarily situated in ten years time but i wish you ernest to keep up your rank moderately if you like but still to keep it up life is all before you now and whatever you choose to go in for you shall not want money to back you look here my children i may as well tell you that when i die you will inherit nearly all i have got i have left it to be divided equally between you with reversion to the survivor i drew up that will some years back and i do not think that it is worth while altering it now forgive me said ernest but how about jeremy mr carduss face changed a little he had never got over his dislike of jeremy though his sense of justice caused him to stifle it i have not forgotten jeremy he said in a tone that indicated that he did not wish to pursue the conversation ernest and dorothy thanked the old man for his goodness but he would not listen so they went off and left him to return to his letterwriting in the passage dorothy peeped through the glass half of the door which opened into her grandfathers room there sat the old man writing writing his long irongrey hair hanging all about his face presently he seemed to think of something and a smile which the contorted mouth made ghastly spread itself over the pallid countenance rising he went to the corner and extracted a long tallystick on which notches were cut sitting down again he counted the remaining notches over and over then took a penknife and cut one out this done he put the stick back and looking at the wall began to mutter for he was not quite dumb and to clasp and unclasp his powerful hand dorothy entered the room quickly grandfather what are you doing she said sharply the old man started and his jaw dropped then the eyes grew dull and his usual apathetic look stole over his face taking up his slate he wrote cutting out my notches dorothy asked him some further questions but could get nothing more out of him i dont at all like the way grandfather has been going on lately she said to ernest he is always muttering and clinching his hand as though he had some one by the throat you know he thinks that he has been serving the fiend all these years and that his time will be up shortly whereas though reginald had no cause to love him he has been very kind to him if it had not been for reginald my grandfather would have been sent to the madhouse but because he was connected with his loss of fortune he thinks he is the devil he forgets how he served reginald you see even in madness the mind only remembers the injuries inflicted on itself and forgets those it inflicted on others i dont at all like his way i should think that he had better be shut up oh reginald would never do it come dear let us go out it was a month or so after mr carduss announcement of his pecuniary intentions that a little weddingparty stood before the altar in kesterwick church it was a very small party consisting indeed only of ernest dorothy mr cardus jeremy and a few idlers who seeing the church door open had strolled in to see what was going on indeed the marriage had been kept a profound secret for since he had been blind ernest had developed a great dislike to being stared at nor indeed had he any liking for the system under which a woman proclaims with loud and unseemly rejoicings that she has found a man to marry her and the clan of her relations celebrate her departure with a few outward and visible tears and much inward and spiritual joy but among that small crowd unobserved by any of them quite close up in the shadow of one of the massive pillars sat a veiled woman she sat quite quiet and still she might have been carved in stone but as the service went on she raised her thick veil and fixed her keen eyes upon the two who stood before the altar as she did so the lips of this shadowy lady trembled a little and a mist of trouble rose from the unhealthy marshes of her mind and clouded her finecut features long and steadily she gazed then dropped the veil again and said beneath her breath was it worth while for this well i have seen him then this shadowy noblelooking lady rose and glided from the church bearing away with her the haunting burden of her sin and ernest he stood there and said the responses in his clear manly voice but even as he did so there rose before him the semblance of the little room in faraway pretoria and the vision which he had seen of this very church and of a man standing where he himself stood now and a lovely woman standing where stood dorothy his wife well it was gone as all visions go as we who are but visions of a longer life go too it was gone gone into that limbo of the past which is ever opening its insatiable maw and swallowing us and our joys and our sorrows our virtues and our sins making a meal of the atoms of today that it may support itself till the atoms of tomorrow are ready for its appetite it was gone and he was married and dorothy his wife stood there wreathed in smiles and blushes which he could not see and mr halfords voice now grown weak and quavering was formulating heartfelt congratulations which were being repeated in the gigantic echo of jeremys deep tones and in his uncles quick jerky utterances so he took dorothy his wife into his arms and kissed her and she led him down the church to the old vestry into which so many thousand newlymarried couples had passed during the course of the last six centuries and he signed his name where they placed his pen upon the parchment wondering the while if he was signing it straight and then went out and was helped into the carriage and driven home ernest and his wife went upon no honeymoon they stopped quietly there at the old house and began to accustom themselves to their new relationship indeed to the outsider at any rate there seemed to be little difference between it and the former one for they could not be much more together now than they had been before yet in dorothys face there was a difference a great peace an utter satisfaction which had been wanting before came down and brooded upon it and made it beautiful she both looked and was a happy woman but to the zulu mazooku this state of affairs did not appear to be satisfactory one day it was three days after the marriage ernest and dorothy were walking together outside the house when jeremy coming in from a visit to a distant farm advanced and joining them began to converse on agricultural matters for he was already becoming intensely and annoyingly technical presently as they talked they became aware of the sound of naked feet running swiftly over the grass that sounds like a zulu dancing said ernest quickly it was a zulu it was mazooku but mazooku transformed it had been his fancy to bring a suit of war finery such as he had worn when he was one of cetywayos soldiers with him from natal and now he had donned it all and stood before them a striking yet an alarming figure from his head a single beautiful grey feather taken from the bell crane rose a good two feet into the air around his waist hung a kilt of white oxtails and beneath his right knee and shoulder were small circles of white goats hair for the rest he was naked in his left hand he held a milkwhite fightingshield made of oxhide and in his right his great bangwan or stabbing assegai still as a statue he stood before them his plume bending in the breeze and dorothy looking with wondering eyes marvelled at the broad chest scarred all over with assegai wounds and the huge sinewy limbs suddenly he raised the spear and saluted in sonorous tones koos baba speak said ernest i speak mazimba my father i come to meet my father as a man meets a man i come with spear and shield but not in war with my father i came from the land of the sun into this cold land where the sun is as pale as the white faces it shines on is it not so my father i hear you with my father i came did you my father and i stand together for many a day did i not slay the two basutos down in the land of secocoeni chief of the bapedi at my fathers bidding did i not once save my father from the jaws of the wild beast that walks by night from the fangs of the lion did i not stand by the side of my father at the place of the little hand when all the plain of isandhlwana was red with blood do i dream in the night or was it so my father i hear you it was so then when the heavens above smelt out my father and smote him with their fire did i not say ah my father now art thou blind and canst fight no more and no more play the part of a man better that thou hadst died a mans death o my father but as thou art blind lo whither thou goest thither i will go also and be my fathers dog did i not say this o mazimba my father thou didst say it and so we sailed across the black water thou mazimba and i and the great lion like unto whom no man was ever born of woman and came hither and have lived for many moons the lives of women have eaten and drunken and have not fought or hunted or known the pleasure of men is it not so mazimba my father thou speakest truly mazooku it is even so yes we sailed the black water in the smoking ship sailed to the land of wonders which is full of houses and trees so that a man cannot breathe in it or throw out his arms lest they should strike a wall and behold there came an ancient one with a shining head wonderful to look on and a girl rosebud small but very sweet and greeted my father and the lion and led them away in the carriages which put the horses inside them and set them in this place where they may look for ever at the sadness of the sea and then behold the rosebud said what doth this black dog here shall a dog lead mazimba by the hand begone thou black dog and walk in front or ride behind it is i who will hold mazimbas hand then my father sinking deep in ease and becoming a fat man rich in oxen and waggons and corn said to himself i will take this rosebud to wife so the rosebud opened her petals and closed them round my father and became a rose and now she sheds her fragrance round him day by day and night by night and the black dog stands and howls outside the door thus my father it came to pass that mazooku thy ox and thy dog communed with his heart and said here is no more any place for thee mazimba thy chief has no longer any need of thee and behold o soldier in this land of women thou too shalt grow like a woman so arise and go to thy father and say to him o my father years ago i put my hand between thy hands and became a loyal man to thee now i would withdraw it and return to the land whence we came for here i am not wanted and here i cannot breathe i have spoken o my father and my chief mazooku umdanda ga ingoluvu umfana ga amazulu son of ingoluvu child of the zulu race answered ernest adopting the zulu metaphor his voice sounding wonderfully soft as the liquid tongue he spoke so well came rolling out thou hast been a good man to me and i have loved thee but thou shalt go thou art right now is my life the life of a woman never again shall i hear the sound of rifles or the ringing of steel in war and so thou goest mazooku it is well but at times thou wilt think of thy blind master mazimba and of alston the wise captain who sleeps and of the lion who threw the ox over his shoulder go and be happy many be thy wives many thy children and countless thy cattle the lion shall take thee by the hand and lead thee to the sea and shall give thee of my bounty wherewith to buy a little food when thou comest to thine own land and a few oxen and a piece of ground or a waggon or two so that thou shalt not be hungry nor want for cattle to give for wives mazooku fare thee well one word mazimba my father and i will trouble thine ears no more since for thee my voice shall be silent for ever when the time has come for thee to die and thou dost pass as the white men say up into the heavens above and thy sight dawns again and thou art once more a man eager for battle then turn thee and cry with a loud voice mazooku son of ingoluvu of the tribe of the maquilisini where art thou o my dog come thou and serve me and surely if i still live then i shall hear thy voice and groan and die that i may pass to thee and if i be already dead then shall i be at thy side even as thou callest this thou wilt do for me o mazimba my father and my chief because lo i have loved thee as the child loves her who suckled it and i would look upon thy face again o my father from the olden time my chief from generation to generation if it be in my power this i will do mazooku the great zulu drew himself up raised his spear and for the first and last time in his life gave ernest the royal salute to which by the way he had no right at all bayиte bayиte then he turned and ran swiftly thence nor would he see ernest again before he went the pain of death was over he said as the sound of his footsteps grew faint ernest turned his head aside and sighed there goes our last link with south africa jeremy my boy it is a good thing for he was growing too fond of the bottle and the women they all do here but it makes me very sad and sometimes i think that as mazooku says it is a pity we did not go under with alston and the others it would all have been over now thank you said jeremy after reflecting on the whole i am pretty comfortable as i am chapter viii mr cardus accomplishes his revenge mr de talor owed his great wealth not to his own talents but to a lucky secret in the manufacture of the grease used on railways discovered by his father talor pиre had been a railwayguard till his discovery brought him wealth he was a shrewd man however and on his sudden accession of fortune did his best to make a gentleman of his only son at that date a lad of fifteen but it was too late the associations and habits of childhood are not easily overcome and no earthly power or education could accomplish the desired object when his son was twenty years of age old jack talor died and his son succeeded to his large fortune and a railwaygrease business which supplied the principal markets of the world his son had inherited a good deal of his fathers shrewdness and set himself to make the best of his advantages first he placed a de before his name and assumed a canting crest next he bought the ceswick ness estates and bloomed into a country gentleman it was shortly after this latter event that he made a mistake and fell in love with the beauty of the neighbourhood mary atterleigh but mary atterleigh would have none of him being at the time secretly engaged to mr cardus in vain did he resort to every possible means to shake her resolution even going so far as to try to bribe her father to put pressure upon her but at this time atterleigh hardriding atterleigh as he was called was well off and resisted his advances thereupon de talor in a fit of pique married another woman who was only too glad to put up with his vulgarity in consideration of his wealth and position as a county magnate shortly afterwards three events occurred almost simultaneously hardriding atterleigh got into money difficulties through overgratification of his passion for hounds and horses mr cardus was taken abroad for the best part of a year in connection with a business matter and a man named jones a friend of mr de talors staying in his house at the time fell in love with mary atterleigh herein de talor saw an opportunity of revenge upon his rival mr cardus he urged upon jones that his real road to the possession of the lady lay through the pocket of her father and even went so far as to advance him the necessary funds to bribe atterleigh for though jones was well off he could not at such short notice lay hands upon a sufficient sum in cash to serve his ends the plot succeeded atterleighs scruples were overcome as easily as the scruples of men in his position without principle to back them generally are and pressure of a most outrageous sort was brought to bear upon the gentleminded mary with the result that when mr cardus returned from abroad he found his affianced bride the wife of another man who became in due course the father of jeremy and dolly this cruel and most unexpected bereavement drove mr cardus partially mad and when he came to himself there arose in his mind a monomania for revenge on all concerned in bringing it about it became the passion and object of his life directing all his remarkable intelligence and energy to the matter he early discovered the heinous part that de talor had played in the plot and swore to devote his life to the unholy purpose of vengeance for years he pursued his enemy trying plan after plan to achieve his ruin and as one failed fell back upon another but to ruin a man of de talors wealth was no easy matter especially when as in the present instance the avenger was obliged to work like a mole in the dark never allowing his enemy to suspect that he was other than a friend how he ultimately achieved his purpose the reader shall now learn ernest and dorothy had been married about three weeks and the latter was just beginning to get accustomed to hearing herself called lady kershaw when one morning a dogcart drove up to the door and out of it emerged mr de talor dear me how mr de talor has changed of late said dorothy who was looking out of the window how has he grown less like a butcher asked ernest no she answered but he looks like a usedup butcher about to go through the bankruptcy court butchers never go bankrupt said ernest and at that moment mr de talor came in dorothy was right the man was much changed the fat cheeks were flabby and fallen the insolent air was gone and he was so shrunken that he looked not more than half his former size how do you do lady kershaw i saw cardus ad got some one with him so i drove round to pay my respects and congratulate the bride why bless me sir ernest you ave grown since i saw you last ah we used to be great friends then you remember how you used to come and shoot up at the ness he had once or twice given the two lads a days rabbitshooting but bless me i hear that you have become quite a fireeater since then and been knocking the niggers right and left eh he paused for breath and ernest said a few words not many for he disliked the mans flattery as much as in past years he used to dislike his insolence ah went on de talor looking up and pointing to the case containing the witchs head i see youve still got that beastly thing your brother once showed me i thought it was a clock and he pretty well frightened me out of my wits now i think of it ive never ad any luck since i saw that thing at this moment the housekeeper grice came to say that mr cardus was ready to see mr de talor if he would step into the office dorothy thought that their visitor turned paler at this news and it evidently occupied his mind sufficiently to cause him to hurry from the room without bidding them goodbye when mr de talor entered the office he found the lawyer pacing up and down how do you do cardus he said jauntily how do you do mr de talor was the cold reply de talor walked to the glass door and looked at the glowing mass of blooming orchids pretty flowers cardus those very orchids aint they must have cost you a pot of money they have not cost me much mr de talor i have reared most of them then you are lucky the bill my man gives me for his orchids is something awful you did not come to speak to me about orchids mr de talor no cardus i didnt business first pleasure afterwards eh yes said mr cardus in his soft jerky way business first pleasure afterwards mr de talor fidgeted his legs about well cardus about that mortgage you are going to give me a little more time i hope on the contrary mr de talor the interest being now eight months overdue i have given my london agents orders to foreclose for i dont conduct such business myself de talor turned pale foreclose good god cardus it is not possible on such an old friend too excuse me it is not only possible but a fact business is business even where old friends are concerned but if you foreclose what is to become of me cardus that i imagine is a matter for your exclusive consideration his visitor gasped and looked like an unfortunate fish suddenly pulled out of the water let us recapitulate the facts i have at different periods within the last several years lent you sums of money secured on your landed estates at ceswicks ness and the neighbourhood amounting in all referring to a paper to one hundred and seventysix thousand five hundred and thirtyeight pounds ten shillings and fourpence or reckoning in the overdue interest to one hundred and seventynine thousand and fiftytwo pounds eight shillings that is so i think yes i suppose so cardus there is no supposition about it the documents prove it well cardus well mr de talor and now as you cannot pay i have instructed my london agents to commence an action in chancery for the sale of the lands and to buy in the property it is a most desirable property o cardus dont be rough on me i am an old man now and you led me into this speculation mr de talor i also am an old man if not very old in years at least as old as methuselah in heart i dont understand it all cardus it will give me the greatest pleasure to explain but to do so i must go back a little some ten or twelve years ago you may remember he began sitting down with his back to the light which struck full on the wretched de talors face that a firm named rastrick and codley took out a patent for a new railwaygrease and set up an establishment in manchester not far from the famous de talor house which was established by your father yes curse them groaned de talor mr cardus smiled by all means curse them but what did this enterprising firm do mr de talor they set to work and sold a grease superior to the article manufactured by your house at about eighteen per cent cheaper but the de talor house had the ear of the markets and the contracts with all the leading lines and continental firms and for awhile it seemed as though the new house must go to the wall and if they had not had considerable capital at command they must have gone to the wall ah and where did they get it from thats the mystery said de talor precisely that was the mystery i shall clear it up a little presently to return after awhile the buyers began to find that rastrick and codleys grease was a better grease and a cheaper grease and as the contracts lapsed the companies renewed them not with the de talor house but with the house of rastrick and codley doubtless you remember mr de talor groaned in acquiescence and the lawyer continued in time this state of affairs produced its natural results de talors house was ruined and the bulk of the trade fell into the hands of the new firm ah i should just like to know who they really were the low sneaks would you i will tell you the firm of rastrick and codley were reginald cardus solicitor of dums ness mr de talor struggled out of his chair looked wildly at the lawyer and sank down again you look ill may i offer you a glass of wine the wretched man shook his head very good doubtless you are curious to know how i a lawyer and not otherwise connected with manchester obtained the monopoly of the grease trade which is by the way at this moment paying very well i will satisfy your curiosity i have always had a mania for taking up inventions quite quietly and in the names of others sometimes i have made money over them sometimes i have lost on the whole i have made largely but whether i have made or lost the inventors as a rule have never known who was backing them one day one lucky day this railway grease patent was brought to my notice i took it up and invested fifty thousand in it straight off the reel then i invested another fifty thousand still your firm cut my throat i made an effort and invested another fifty thousand had i failed i should then have been a ruined man i had strained my credit to the utmost but fortune favours the brave mr de talor and i succeeded it was your firm that failed i have paid all my debts and i reckon that the railwaygrease concern is worth after paying liabilities some two hundred thousand pounds if you should care to go in for it messrs rastrick and codley will i have no doubt be most happy to treat with you it has served its purpose and is now in the market de talor looked at him with amazement he was too upset to speak so much mr de talor for my share in the grease episode the failure of your firm or rather its stoppage from loss of trade left you still a rich man but only half as rich as you had been and this you may remember made you furious you could not bear the idea of losing money you would rather have lost blood from your veins than sovereigns from your purse when you thought of the grease which had melted in the fire of competition you could have wept tears of rage in this plight you came to me to ask advice yes and you told me to speculate not quite accurate mr de talor i said i remember the words well you are an able man and understand the money market why dont you take advantage of these fluctuating times and recoup yourself for all you have lost the prospect of gain tempted you mr de talor and you jumped at the idea you asked me to introduce you to a reliable firm and i introduced you to messrs campsey and ash one of the best in the city confound them for a set of rogues answered de talor rogues i am sorry you think so for i have an interest in their business good heavens what next groaned de talor well notwithstanding the best efforts of messrs campsey and ash on your behalf in pursuance of written instructions as you from time to time communicated to them and to which you can no doubt refer if you please things went wrong with you mr de talor and year by year when your balance sheet was sent in you found that you had lost more than you had gained at last one unlucky day about three years ago you made a plunge against the advice you may remember of messrs campsey and ash and lost it was after that that i began to lend you money the first loan was for fifty thousand then came more losses and more loans till at length we had reached the present state of affairs o cardus you dont mean to sell me up do you what shall i do without money and think of my daughters ow will they manage without their comforts give me time what makes you so rough on me mr cardus had been walking up and down the room rapidly at de talors words he stopped and going to a despatchbox unlocked it and drew from a bundle of documents a yellow piece of stamped paper it was a cancelled bill for ten thousand pounds in the favour of jonas de talor esquire this bill he came and held before his visitors eyes that i believe is your signature he said quietly pointing to the receipt written across the bill de talor turned almost livid with fear and his lips and hands began to tremble where did you get that he asked mr cardus regarded him or rather all round him with the melancholy black eyes that never looked straight at anything and yet saw everything and then answered among your friend joness papers you scoundrel he went on with a sudden change of manner now perhaps you begin to understand why i have hunted you down step by step why for thirty years i have waited and watched and failed and at last succeeded it is for the sake of mary atterleigh it was you who infuriated because she would have none of such a coarse brute set the man jones on to her it was you who lent him the money with which to buy her from old atterleigh there lies the proof before you by the way jones need never have repaid you that ten thousand pounds for it was marriagebrokerage and therefore not recoverable at law it was you i say who were the first cause of my life being laid waste and who nearly drove me to the madhouse ay who did drive mary my betrothed wife into the arms of that fellow whence god be praised she soon passed to her rest mr cardus paused breathing quick with suppressed rage and excitement the large white eyebrows contracted till they nearly met and abandoning his usual habit he looked straight into the eyes of the abject creature in the chair before him its a long while ago cardus cant you forgive and let bygones be bygones forgive yes for my own sake i could forgive but for her sake whom you first dishonoured and then killed i will never forgive where are your companions in guilt jones is dead i ruined him atterleigh is there i did not ruin him because after all he was the author of marys life but his illgotten gains did him no good a higher power than mine took vengeance on his crime and i saved him from the madhouse and joness children they are here too for once they lay beneath her breast but do you think that i will spare you you coarse arrogant knave you who spawned the plot no not if it were to cost me my own life would i forego one jot or tittle of my revenge at that moment mr cardus happened to look up and saw through the glass part of the door of his office of which the curtain was partially drawn the wildlooking head of hardriding atterleigh he appeared to be looking through the door for his eyes in which there was a very peculiar look were fixed intently upon mr carduss face when he saw that he was observed he vanished now go said the lawyer sternly to the prostrate de talor and never let me see your face again but i havent any money where am i to go groaned de talor wherever you like mr de talor this is a free country but if i had control of your destination it should be to the devil the wretched man staggered to his feet all right cardus ill go ill go youve got it all your own way now you are damned hard you are but perhaps youll get it taken out of you some day im glad you never got hold of mary it must have been pleasant to you to see her marry jones in another second he was gone and mr cardus was left thinking among other things of that look in old atterleighs eyes which he could not get out of his mind thus did he finally accomplish the revenge to which he had devoted his life chapter ix mad atterleighs last ride a month had passed since mr de talor had crept utterly crushed from the presence of the man whom he had wronged during this time mr cardus had been busy from morning till night he was always a busy man writing daily with his own hand an almost incredible number of letters for he carried on all or nearly all his great affairs by correspondence but of late his work seemed to have doubled in the course of that month the society in the neighbourhood of kesterwick experienced a pleasurable sensation of excitement for suddenly the de talor family vanished off the face of the kesterwick world and the ceswick ness estates after being advertised were put up for sale and bought so said report by a london firm of lawyers on behalf of an unknown client the de talors were gone where to nobody knew nor did they much care to inquire that is with the exception of the servants whose wages were left unpaid and the tradespeople to whom large sums were owing they inquired vigorously enough but without the smallest result the de talors had gone and left no trace except the trace of bankruptcy and kesterwick knew them no more but was glad over the sensation made by their disappearance but on one saturday mr carduss business seemed to come to a sudden stop he wrote some letters and put them in the post bag then he went to admire his orchids life he said aloud to himself shall be all orchids now my work is done i will build a new house for tropical sorts and spend two hundred pounds on stocking it well i can afford it this was about five oclock half an hour later when he had well examined his flowers he strolled out titheburgh abbey way and here he met ernest and his wife who had been sitting in their favourite spot well my dears he said and how are you pretty well uncle thank you and how are you i o i am very jolly indeed for an old man as jolly as an individual who has just bid goodbye to work for ever should be he said why reginald what do you mean mean dorothy my dear i mean that i have wound up my affairs and retired on a modest competence ah you young people should be grateful to me for let me tell you that everything is now in applepie order and when i slip off you will have no trouble at all except to pay the probate duty and that will be considerable i never quite knew till a week ago how rich i was but as i said the other day everything i have touched has turned to gold it will be a large fortune for you to manage my dears you will find it a great responsibility i hope you will live many years to manage it yourself said ernest ah i dont know i am pretty tough but who can see the future dolly my dear girl he went on in a dreamy way you are growing like your mother do you know i sometimes think that i am not far off her now you see i speak plainly to you two years ago i used to think that is sometimes that your mother was dust and nothing more that she had left me for ever but of late i have changed my ideas i have seen he went on speaking in an absent way as though he were meditating to himself how wonderfully providence works even in the affairs of this imperfect world and i begin to believe that there must be a place where it allows itself a larger development yes i think i shall find your mother somewhere dorothy my dear i seem to feel her very near me sometimes well i have avenged her i think that you will find her reginald she answered but your vengeance is wicked and wrong i have often made bold to tell you so though sometimes you have been angry with me and i tell you so again it can only bring evil with it what have we poor creatures to do with vengeance who do not understand the reason of things and can scarcely see an inch before our noses what right have we to judge others who if we knew everything would probably be the first to pardon them perhaps you are right my love you generally are right in the main but my desire for vengeance upon that man de talor has been the breath of my nostrils and i have achieved it man if he only lives long enough and has strength of will enough can achieve everything except happiness but man fritters away his powers over a variety of objects he is led astray in pursuit of the butterfly pleasure or the bubble ambition or the destroying angel woman and his purposes fall to the ground between a dozen stools most men too are not capable of a purpose men are weak creatures and yet what a mighty seed lies hid in every human breast think my children what man might nay may become when his weakness and follies have fallen from him when his rudimentary virtues have been developed and his capacities for physical and mental beauties brought to an undreamed of perfection look at the wild flower and the flower of the hothouse it is nothing compared to the possibilities inherent in man even as we know him it is a splendid dream will it ever be fulfilled i wonder well well whatever there is to know that we shall know one day come let us turn it will soon be time to dress for dinner by the way dorothy that reminds me i dont quite like the way that your respected grandfather is going on i told him that i had no more deeds for him to copy that i had done with deeds and he went and got that confounded stick of his and showed me that according to his own little calculations his time was up and then he got his slate and wrote about my being the devil on it but that i had no more power over him and that he was bound for heaven the other day too i caught him staring at me through the glass of the door with a very queer look in his eyes ah reginald so you have noticed it i quite agree with you i dont at all like his goingson do you know i think that he had better be shut up i dont like to shut him up dorothy however here we are we will talk about it tomorrow having led ernest to his room dorothy before beginning to dress herself went to the office to see if her grandfather was still there and there sure enough she found him pacing up and down muttering and waving his long stick out of which all the notches had now been cut what are you doing grandfather she asked why havent you gone to dress he snatched up his slate and wrote rapidly upon it times up times up times up ive done with the devil and all his works im off to heaven on the big black horse to find mary who are you you look like mary grandfather said dolly quietly taking the slate out of his hand what do you mean by writing such nonsense let me hear no more of it you ought to be ashamed of yourself now mind i will have no more of it put away that stick and go and wash your hands for dinner the old man did as he was bid somewhat sulkily dorothy thought but when he arrived at the dinnertable there was nothing noticeable about his manner they dined at a quarter to seven and dinner did not take them very long when it was over old atterleigh drank some wine and then according to his habit went and sat in the ancient inglenook which had presumably been built by the forgotten dum for his comfort on winter evenings and on winter evenings when there was a jolly woodfire burning on the hearth it was a pleasant spot enough but to sit there in the dark on a lovely summer night was an act well worthy of old atterleigh after dinner the conversation turned upon that fatal day when alstons horse was wiped out at isandhlwana it was a painful subject both to ernest and jeremy but the former was gratifying his uncles curiosity by explaining to him how that last dread struggle with the six zulus came to determine itself in their favour and how was it asked mr cardus that you managed to get the better of the fellow with whom you rolled down the hill because the assegai broke and fortunately enough the blade was left in my hand where is it doll for jeremy had brought it home with him dorothy got up and reached the broken assegai which had about eight inches of the shaft from its place over the mantelpiece now then jeremy if you would be so good as to sprawl upon your back upon the floor i will just show my uncle what happened jeremy complied not without grumbling about dirtying his dresscoat jeremy my boy where are you o there well excuse my taking the liberty of kneeling on your chest and holloa out of the assegai goes into you if we are going to have a performance at all it may as well be a realistic one now uncle you see when we finished rolling which was just as this assegai snapped in two as luck would have it i was uppermost and managed to get my knee on my friends left arm and to hold his right with my left then before he could get loose i drove this bit of spear through the side of his throat just there so that it cut the jugular vein and he died shortly afterwards and now you know all about it here ernest rose and laid the spear upon the table and jeremy entering into the spirit of the thing began to die as artistically as a regard for his dresscoat would allow just then dorothy looking up saw her grandfather atterleighs distorted face peering round the wall of the inglenook where he was sitting in the dark and looking at the scene of mimic slaughter with that same curious gaze which he had worn on several occasions lately he withdrew his head at once get up jeremy said his sister sharply and stop writhing about there like a great snake you look as though you had been murdered it is horrible jeremy arose laughing and having obtained dorothys permission they all lit their pipes and sitting there in the fading light fell to talking about that sad scene of slaughter which indeed appeared that night to have a strange fascination for mr cardus he asked ernest and jeremy about it again and again how this man was killed and that did they die at once and so on the subject was always distressing to ernest and one to which he rarely alluded full as it was for him of the most painful recollections especially those connected with his dear friend alston and his son dorothy knew this and knew too that ernest would be low spirited for at least a day after the conversation which she did her best to stop at last she succeeded but the melancholy associations connected with the talk had apparently already done their work for everybody lapsed into the most complete silence and sat grouped together at the topend of the old oak table as quietly as though they were cut in stone meanwhile the twilight deepened little gusts of wind arose and gently shook the oldfashioned windowlattices making a sound as though feeble hands were trying to throw them open the dull evening light crept from place to place and threw great shadows about the room glanced upon the armour on its panelled walls and at last began to die away into darkness the whole scene was eerie and for some unknown reason it oppressed dorothy she wondered why everybody was so silent and yet she herself did not feel equal to breaking the silence there was a load upon her heart just then a curious thing happened as may be remembered the case containing the wonderful mummied head found by eva ceswick had years before been placed by jeremy upon a bracket at the end of the room round about this case hung various pieces of armour and among others above it suspended by a piece of string from a projecting hook was a heavy iron gauntlet for many years twenty or more it had hung from the hook but now at last the string was worn through and even as dorothy was wondering at the silence it gave down came the heavy iron hand with a crash and as it passed it caught the latch of the long airtight case and jarred the door wide open everybody in the room sprang to their feet and as they did so a last ray from the setting sun struggled through one of the windows and rested upon the open case staining it and all about it the hue of blood and filling the fearful crystal eyes within with a lurid light how they glowed and shone to be sure after their long sleep for the case had scarcely been opened for years while their tremulous glance now dull now intense according as the light played upon them appeared to wander round and round the room as though in search of somebody or something it was an awful sight which that ray of sunlight showed as it played upon the trembling crystal orbs the scornful deathly features and the matchless hair that streamed on either side together with the sudden break in the silence caused by the crashing fall of the gauntlet as it had done many years before it proved altogether too much for the beholders nerves what is that asked ernest with a start as the gauntlet fell dorothy glanced up and gave a little cry of horror oh that dreadful head it is looking at us they all rose to their feet and dorothy seizing ernest by one hand and covering her eyes with the other retreated slowly followed by the others towards the swingdoor soon they had reached the door were through it down the passage and out into the peaceful stillness of the evening then jeremy spoke and his language was more forcible than polite well i am blowed he said wiping the cold perspiration from his forehead oh reginald i do wish you would get that horrible thing out of the house there has been nothing but misfortune ever since it has been here i cannot bear it i cannot bear it said dolly hysterically nonsense you superstitious child answered mr cardus who was now recovering from his start the gauntlet knocked the door open that was all it is nothing but a mummied head but if you dont like it i will send it to the british museum tomorrow oh please do reginald answered dorothy who appeared quite unhinged so hurried had been their retreat from the room that everybody had forgotten hardriding atterleigh sitting in the dark in the inglenook but the bustle in the room had attracted him and already before they were gone he had projected his large head covered with the tangled grey locks and begun to stare about presently his eyes fell upon the crystal orbs and then to him the orbs appeared to cease their wanderings and rest upon his eyes for awhile the two heads stared at each other thus the golden head without a body in the box and the grey head that thrust out as it were from the inglewall seemed to have no body either they stared and stared till at last the golden head got the mastery of the grey head and the old man crept from his corner crept down the room till he was almost beneath the baleful eyes and nodded nodded nodded at them and they too seemed to nod nod nod at him then he retreated backwards as slowly as he had come nodding all the while till he came to where the broken assegai lay upon the table and taking it thrust it up his sleeve as he did so the ray of light faded and the fiery eyes went out it was as though the thick white lids and long eyelashes had dropped over them none of the other four returned to the sittingroom that night when he had recovered from his fright jeremy went into his little room the same in which he used to stuff birds as a boy and busied himself with his farm accounts mr cardus dorothy and ernest walked about together in the balmy moonlight for very shortly after the twilight had departed the great harvestmoon came up and flooded the world with light mr cardus was in a talkative excited mood that night he talked about his affairs which he had now finally wound up and about mary atterleigh mentioning little tricks of manner and voice which were reproduced in dorothy he talked too about ernests and dorothys marriage and said what a comfort it was to him finally about ten oclock he said that he was tired and going to bed god bless you my dears sleep well goodnight he said we will settle about that new orchidhouse tomorrow goodnight goodnight shortly afterwards dorothy and ernest also went to bed reaching their room by a back entrance for they neither of them felt inclined to come under the fire of the crystal eyes again and soon they were asleep in each others arms the minutes stole on one by one through the dead silence of the night bearing their records with them to the archives of the past eleven oclock came and fled away midnight came too and swept across the world everywhere on land sky and sea there was silence nothing but silence sleeping in the moonlight hark oh heavens what was that one fearful heartrending yell of agony ringing all through the ancient house rattling the casements shaking the armour against the panelled walls pulsing and throbbing in horrible notes out into the night echoing and dying far away over the sea then silence again silence sleeping in the moonlight they sprang from their beds did every living soul beneath that roof and rushed in their nightgear men and women together into the sittingroom the crystal eyes seemed to be awake again for the moon was up and played upon them causing them now and then to flash out in gleams of opalescent light somebody lit a candle somebody missed mr cardus surely he could never have slept through that yes he had slept through it they ran and tumbled a confused mass of white into the room where he lay he was there sure enough and he slept very sound with a red gash in his throat from which the blood fell in heavy drops down down to the ground they stood aghast and as they stood from the courtyard outside there came a sound of galloping hoofs they knew the sound of the galloping it was that of ernests great black stallion a mile or more away out on the marshes just before you come to the wellknown quicksands which have tradition says swallowed so many unfortunates and which shudder palpably at times and are unpleasant to look on stands a lockhouse inhabited by one solitary man who has charge of the sluice on this very night it is necessary for him to open his sluicegates at a particular moment and now he stands awaiting that propitious time he is an ancient mariner his hands are in his pockets his pipe is in his mouth his eyes are fixed upon the sea we have met him before suddenly he hears the sound of a powerful horse galloping furiously he turns and his hair begins to rise upon his head for this is what he sees in the bright moonlight fast fast towards him thunders a great coalblack horse snorting with mingled rage and terror and on its bare back there sits a man with a grip of iron an old man for his grey locks stream out behind him who waves above his head the fragment of a spear on they come before them is the wide sluice if they are mortal they will turn or plunge into it no the great black horse gathers himself and springs into the air by heaven he has cleared it no horse ever took that leap before or will again on at whirlwind speed towards the shuddering quicksand two hundred yards away splash horse and man are in it making the moist mass shake and tremble for twenty yards round the bright moonlight shows it all the horse shrieks in fear and agony as only a horse can the man on his back waves the spear the horse vanishes the man vanishes the spear glitters an instant longer in the moonlight and then vanishes too they have all vanished for ever they have all vanished and again the perfect silence sleeps in the moonlight bust me says the ancient one aloud and shaking with a mortal dread bust me i have stood still and seed many a queer thing but i never seed a thing like that then he turned and fled fast as his old legs would carry him forgetful of dutch cheeses and of sluicegates forgetful of everything except that demon horse and man thus ended hardriding atterleighs maddest gallop and thus too ended the story of mr cardus and his revenge chapter x dorothys triumph some years passed before eva plowden returned to kesterwick and then she was carried thither alive she did not return nor during all these years did she and ernest ever meet they buried her in obedience to her last wishes in the churchyard where lay generation upon generation of her ancient race and the daisies grew above her head twice had they bloomed above her before sir ernest kershaw stood by the spot hallowed with the presence of what once enshrined the spirit of the woman he had loved ernest was now getting well into middle life and dorothys bright hair was slightly lined with grey when they stood that summer evening by evas grave many things had happened to the pair since mr carduss tragic death they had children born to them some they had lost some remained honest english lads and lasses with their fathers eyes they had enjoyed great wealth and spent it royally giving to all who needed they had drunk deep of the cup of this worlds joys and sorrows ernest had gone into parliament for a couple of years and made something of a name there then impatient for the active life of other days he had accepted a high colonial appointment for which notwithstanding his blindness his wealth and parliamentary reputation eminently fitted him now he was just about to leave to fill the governorship of one of the australian colonies long years had passed many things had happened and yet as he stood by that heap of turf which he could not see it seemed but yesterday when and he sighed not quite cured yet ernest said dorothy interrogatively yes dorothy he answered with a little sigh i think i am cured at any rate he went on as she took his hand to lead him away from the grave i have learned to accept the decrees of providence without murmuring i have done with dreams and outlived pessimism life would it is true have been different thing for me if poor eva had not deserted me for she poisoned its waters at the fount and so they have always tasted bitter but happiness is not the end and object of mans existence and if i could i would not undo the past take me to the old flat tombstone dolly near the door she led him to it and he sat down ah he went on how beautiful she was was there ever woman like her i wonder and now her bones lie there her beauty is all gone and there lives of her only the unending issues of what she did i have only to think dolly and i can see her as i saw her a score of times passing in and out of this churchdoor yes i can see her and the people round her and the clothes she wore and the smile in her beautiful dark eyes for her eyes seemed to smile you remember dolly how i worshipped her too with all my heart and soul and strength as though she were an angel and that was my mistake dolly she was only a woman a very weak woman you said just now that you were cured ernest one would hardly think it to hear you talk put in dorothy smiling yes doll i am cured you have cured me my dear wife for you have crept into my life and taken possession of it so that there is little room for anybody else and now dorothy i love you with all my heart she pressed his hand and smiled again for she knew that she had triumphed and that he did love her truly love her and that this passion for eva was a poor thing compared to what it had been years before more indeed of a tender regret not unmingled with a starry hope than a passion at all dorothy was a clever little person and understood something of ernest and the human heart in general she had thought long ago that she would win ernest altogether to her in the end by what tenderness by what devotion and nobility of character she had accomplished this those who know her can well imagine but in the end she did accomplish it as she deserved to do the contrast between the conduct of the two women who had mainly influenced his life was too marked for ernest a man of a just and reasonable mind to altogether ignore and when once he came to comparisons the natural results followed yet though he learned to love dorothy so dearly it cannot be said that he forgot eva because there are things that some men can never forget since they are a part of their inner life and of these unfortunately first love is one ernest went on dorothy you remember what you told me when you asked me to marry you in titheburgh abbey about your belief that your affection for eva would outlast this world do you still believe that yes doll to some extent his wife sat and thought for a minute ernest she said presently yes dear i have managed to hold my own against eva in this world when she had all the chances and all the beauty on her side and what i have to say about your theories now is that when we get to the next and are all beautiful it will be very strange if i dont manage to hold my own there she had her chance and she threw it away now i have got mine and i dont mean to throw it away either in this world or the next ernest laughed a little i must say my dear it would be a very poor heaven if you were not there i should think so indeed those whom god hath joined let not man put asunder nor woman either but what is the good of our stopping here to talk such stuff about things of which we really understand nothing come ernest jeremy and the boys will be waiting for us so hand in hand they went on homeward through the quiet twilight
