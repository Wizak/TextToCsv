hornblower in the west indies c s forester st elizabeth of hungary rear admiral lord hornblower for all his proud appointment as commanderinchief of his majestys ships and vessels in the west indies paid his official visit to new orleans in hm schooner crab only mounting two sixpounders and with a crew of no more than sixteen men not counting supernumeraries his britannic majestys consulgeneral at new orleans mr cloudesley sharpe remarked on the fact i hardly expected to see your lordship in so diminutive a craft he said looking round him he had driven down in his carriage to the pier against which crab was lying and had sent his liveried footman to the gangway to announce him and it had been something of an anticlimax to be received by the trilling of the only two bosuns calls that crab could muster and to find on the quarterdeck to receive him besides the admiral and his flaglieutenant a mere lieutenant in command the exigencies of the service sir explained hornblower but if i may lead the way below i can offer you whatever hospitality this temporary flagship of mine affords mr sharpe surely there never was a name that accorded so ill with its possessors figure for he was a fat man a mountain of puffy flesh squeezed himself into a chair at the table in the pleasant little cabin and replied to hornblowers suggestion of breakfast with the statement that he had already broken his fast he obviously had the gravest doubts as to the quality of any breakfast that could be served in this little ship gerard the flaglieutenant made himself inconspicuous in a corner of the cabin notebook and pencil on his knee while hornblower reopened the conversation phoebe was struck by lightning off morant cape said hornblower she was the ship i had planned to come in clorinda was already in dock refitting and roebucks off curacao keeping an eye on the dutchmen theres a brisk trade in arms with venezuela at present well i know that said sharpe those are my three frigates said hornblower with the arrangements all made i judged it better to come in this schooner rather than not to come at all how are the mighty fallen was mr sharpes comment your lordship a commanderinchief with no more than three frigates and half a dozen sloops and schooners fourteen sloops and schooners sir corrected hornblower they are very desirable craft for the duties i have to perform no doubt my lord said sharpe but i can remember the days when the commanderinchief on the west india station disposed of a squadron of ships of the line that was in time of war sir explained hornblower recalling the verbal comments of the first sea lord in the interview when he had been offered this command the house of commons would sooner allow the royal navy to rot at its moorings than reimpose the income tax at any rate your lordship has arrived said sharpe your lordship exchanged salutes with fort st philip gun for gun as your despatch informed me had been arranged excellent said sharpe it had been a strange little formality all hands on board crab had lined the rail very properly during the salute and the officers had stood at attention on the quarterdeck but all hands amounted to very little with four men manning the saluting gun and one at the signal halliards and one at the helm it had poured with rain too hornblowers glittering uniform had clung damply around him your lordship made use of the services of a steam tug yes by george exclaimed hornblower a remarkable experience for your lordship apparently indeed yes said hornblower i he held himself back from giving utterance to all his thoughts on that subject they would lead to too many exciting irrelevancies but a steam tug had brought crab against the hundred miles of current from the sea to new orleans between dawn and dusk arriving at the very minute the tug captain had predicted and here was new orleans crowded not merely with oceangoing sailing ships but also with a fleet of long narrow steamers manoeuvring out into the stream and against piers with a facility that even crab with her handy fore and aft rig could not attempt to emulate and with a thresh of those paddlewheels they would go flying upstream with a rapidity almost unbelievable steam has laid open a continent my lord said sharpe echoing hornblowers thoughts a veritable empire thousands and thousands of miles of navigable waterways the population of the mississippi valley will be counted in millions within a few years hornblower remembered discussions at home when he was a halfpay officer awaiting his promotion to flag rank when the steam kettles had been mentioned even the possibility of oceangoing ships propelled by steam had been suggested and had been properly laughed to scorn it would mean the ruin of good seamanship hornblower had not been quite so sure on either point but he had been careful to keep his opinions to himself having no desire to be regarded as a dangerous crank he did not want to be drawn into any similar discussions now not even with a mere civilian what intelligence do you have for me sir he asked a considerable amount my lord mr sharpe produced a fold of papers from his tail pocket here are the latest advices from new granada more recent i expect than anything you have had the insurgents mr sharpe entered into a rapid exposition of the military and political situation in central america the spanish colonies were entering into the final stage of their struggle for independence it cannot be long before his majestys government recognises that independence said sharpe and our minister in washington informs me that the government of the united states meditates a similar recognition it remains to be seen what the holy alliance will have to say on that score my lord europe under the rule of absolute monarchy would turn a jaundiced eye upon the establishment of a whole new series of republics no doubt but it hardly mattered what europe had to say as long as the royal navy even the depleted peacetime navy controlled the seas and the two englishspeaking governments continued in amity cuba shows small signs of restlessness went on sharpe and i have information of the issue of further letters of marque by the spanish government to vessels sailing from havana letters of marque were one of the principal sources of hornblowers troubles they were being issued by insurgent and nationalist governments alike to prey upon ships flying the old flags and the new and the bearers of letters of marque turned pirates in the twinkling of an eye in the absence of legitimate prizes and efficient prize courts thirteen of hornblowers fourteen small craft were scattered over the caribbean keeping an eye on the activities of the privateers i have prepared duplicates of my reports for your lordships information concluded sharpe i have them here to give to your lordship along with copies of the complaints of the mastermariners concerned thank you sir said hornblower while gerard took the papers into his charge now for the slave trade with your lordships permission went on sharpe opening a fresh series of papers the slave trade was as acute a question as piracy even more acute in some ways because the antislavery society in england commanded a great deal of powerful and vocal support in both houses of parliament and would raise an even more violent todo about a cargo of slaves run into havana or rio de janeiro than a shipping company pestered by privateers at this moment my lord said sharpe a raw hand newly brought from the slave coast is selling for eighty pounds in the havana baracoons and he cost no more than a pound in trade goods at whydah those profits are tempting my lord naturally said hornblower i have reason to believe that ships of both british and american registry are engaged in the traffic my lord so have i the first sea lord had tapped ominously on the table in that interview when touching on this part of his instructions to hornblower under the new law british subjects who engaged in the slave trade could be hanged and the ships seized but care would be necessary in dealing with ships flying american colours if they refused to heaveto on the high seas for examination the utmost tact would have to be employed to shoot away an american spar or to kill an american citizen would mean trouble america had gone to war with england only nine years before over matters very similar we want no trouble my lord said sharpe he had a pair of hard intelligent grey eyes deepset in his puffy face i am aware of that sir and in this connection my lord i must employ special emphasis in calling your lordships attention to a vessel making ready for sea here in new orleans which ship is this she is visible from the deck my lord in fact sharpe struggled out of his chair and walked to the cabin window yes there she is what do you make of her my lord hornblower looked out from beside sharpe he saw a beautiful ship of eight hundred tons or more her fine lines the lofty rake of her masts the wide spread of her yards were all clear indications of speed for which some sacrifice of cargocarrying capacity had been made she was flush decked with six painted gunports along each side american shipbuilders had always evinced a tendency towards building fast ships but this was an advanced example of the type are there guns behind those ports asked hornblower twelve pounders my lord even in these days of peace it was not unusual for merchant vessels to carry guns whether for voyages in the west indies or the east but this was a heavier armament than usual she was built as a privateer said hornblower quite right my lord shes the daring she was built during the war and made one voyage and took six prizes from us before the treaty of ghent and now my lord she could be a slaver your lordship is right again of course that heavy armament would be desirable in a slaver anchoring up a west african river liable to a treacherous attack she could easily have a slave deck with that flush build her speed would minimise deaths among the slaves during the middle passage her lack of capacity for bulk cargo would be unimportant in a slaver is she a slaver asked hornblower apparently not my lord despite her appearance she is being chartered to carry a great many men all the same i would like you to explain further if you please mr sharpe i can only tell your lordship the facts as disclosed to me she is under charter to a french general count cambronne cambronne cambronne the man who commanded the imperial guard at waterloo thats the man my lord the man who said the old guard dies but does not surrender yes my lord although report says he actually used a ruder expression he was wounded and taken prisoner but he did not die so i have heard but what does he want with this ship it is all open and above board apparently after the war boneys old guard formed an organisation for mutual aid in they decided to become colonists your lordship must have heard something about the project hardly anything they came out and seized an area of land on the coast of texas the province of mexico adjacent to this state of louisiana i have heard about it but that is the extent of my knowledge it was easy enough to start with mexico in the throes of her revolt against spain there was no opposition to them as you understand my lord but it was not so easy to continue i cannot imagine that soldiers of the old guard would ever make good agriculturists and on that pestilential coast it is a series of dreary lagoons with hardly an inhabitant the scheme failed as your lordship might expect half of them died of malaria and yellow fever and half of the rest simply starved cambronne has come out from france to carry the survivors home five hundred of them the government of the united states never liked the project as your lordship can imagine and now the insurgent government is strong enough to take exception to the presence on the shores of mexico of a large body of trained soldiers however peaceable their intentions your lordship can see cambronnes story could be perfectly true yes an eighthundredton ship equipped as a slaver could pack five hundred soldiers on board and feed them during a long passage cambronne is stocking her largely with rice and water slave rations my lord but the best adapted to the purpose for that very reason the slave trade had had long experience of how to keep alive a closepacked body of men if cambronne is going to take them back to france i should do nothing to hinder him said hornblower rather on the contrary exactly my lord sharpes grey eyes met hornblowers in an expressionless stare the presence of five hundred trained soldiers afloat in the gulf of mexico was very much the concern of the british admiral commanding in chief when the shores of the gulf and of the caribbean were in as much of a turmoil as at present bolivar and the other spanishamerican insurgents would pay a high price for their services in the present war or someone might be meditating the conquest of haiti or a piratical descent upon havana any sort of filibustering expedition was possible the actual bourbon government in france might be looking for a pie in which to put a finger for that matter a chance to snap up a colony and confront the englishspeaking powers with a fait accompli ill keep my eye on them until they are safely out of the way said hornblower i have called your lordships attention officially to the matter said sharpe it would be one more drain upon hornblowers limited resources for the policing of the caribbean he already was wondering which of his few craft he could detach to observe the gulf coast and now my lord said sharpe it is my duty to discuss the details of your lordships stay here in new orleans i have arranged a programme of official calls for your lordship does your lordship speak french yes said hornblower fighting down the urge to say my lordship does that is excellent because french is commonly spoken among good society here your lordship will of course be calling upon the naval authorities here and upon the governor there is an evening reception planned for your lordship my carriage is of course at your lordships disposition that is extremely kind of you sir no kindness at all my lord it is a great pleasure to me to assist in making your lordships visit to new orleans as enjoyable as possible i have here a list of the prominent people your lordship will meet along with brief notes regarding them perhaps it might be as well if i explain it to your lordships flaglieutenant certainly said hornblower he was able now to relax his attention a little gerard was a good flaglieutenant and had supported his commanderinchief very satisfactorily during the ten months that hornblower had held command he supplied some of the social flair that hornblower was too indifferent to acquire the business was rapidly settled very well then my lord said sharpe now i can take my leave i will have the pleasure of seeing your lordship again at the governors house i am deeply obliged to you sir this city of new orleans was an enchanting place hornblower was bubbling internally with excitement at the prospect of exploring it nor was he the only one as appeared as soon as sharpe had taken his leave when lieutenant harcourt captain of the crab intercepted hornblower on the quarterdeck pardon my lord he said saluting are there any orders for me there could be no doubt about what harcourt had in mind forward of the mainmast most of the crew of crab were congregated together looking eagerly aft in a tiny ship like this everyone was aware of everyone elses business and discipline ran on lines different from those in a big ship can you trust your men to be steady on shore mr harcourt asked hornblower yes my lord hornblower looked forward again the hands looked remarkably smart they had been labouring on making new clothes for themselves all the way from kingston from the moment when it was announced that crab would have the astonishing distinction of flying the admirals flag they were wearing neat blue frockjumpers and white ducks and shady straw hats hornblower saw their selfconscious poses as he glanced towards them they knew perfectly well what was being discussed these were peacetime sailors voluntarily enlisted hornblower had had twenty years of wartime service with pressed crews who could never be trusted not to desert and even now he had consciously to adjust his mind to the change if you could give me notice of when you intend to sail sir i mean my lord said harcourt until dawn tomorrow in any case said hornblower coming to a sudden decision his day was full until then aye aye my lord would the grogshops of new orleans waterfront be any different from the grogshops of kingston or port of spain now perhaps i can have my breakfast mr gerard said hornblower unless you have any objection aye aye my lord answered gerard carefully ignoring the sarcasm he had long learned that his admiral objected to nothing in the world as much as having to be active before breakfast it was after breakfast that a coloured man trotting barefooted along the pier came bearing on his head a basket of fruit which he handed in at the gangway at the moment when hornblower was about to start off on his official round of calls theres a note with it my lord said gerard shall i open it yes it is from mr sharpe reported gerard after breaking the seal and then some seconds later i think you had better read this yourself my lord hornblower took the thing impatiently my lord i have imposed upon myself the pleasure of sending some fruit to your lordship it is my duty to inform your lordship that i have just received information that the freight which count cambronne brought out here from france and which has been lying in bond in charge of the united states customs services will shortly be transferred by lighter through the agency of a bonded carrier to the daring as your lordship will of course understand this is an indication that the daring will be sailing soon my information is that the amount of bonded freight is very considerable and i am endeavouring to discover in what it consists perhaps your lordship might from your lordships coign of vantage find an opportunity of observing the nature of this freight i am with great respect your lordships humble and obedient servant cloudesley sharpe hbms consulgeneral at new orleans now what could cambronne have possibly brought from france in large amount that could be legitimately needed for the purpose he had avowed when he chartered the daring not personal effects certainly not food or liquor he could pick those up cheaply in new orleans then what warmweather clothing would be a possible explanation those guardsmen might well need it when returning to france from the gulf of mexico it was possible but a french general with five hundred men of the imperial guard at his disposal would bear the closest watching when the caribbean was in such a turmoil it would be a great help to know what kind of freight he was shipping mr harcourt sir my lord i would like your company in the cabin for a moment if you please the young lieutenant stood at attention in the cabin a little apprehensively waiting to hear what his admiral had to say this isnt a reprimand mr harcourt said hornblower testily not even an admonition thank you my lord said harcourt relaxing hornblower took him to the cabin window and pointed out through it just as sharpe had done previously thats the daring he said an exprivateer now under charter to a french general harcourt looked his astonishment that is the case went on hornblower and today she will be taking on some cargo out of bond it will be brought round to her out of bond by lighter yes my lord i want to know as much about that cargo as possible yes my lord naturally i do not want the world to know that i am interested i want nobody to know unnecessarily yes my lord i could use a telescope from here and see a good deal with luck very true you can take note of whether it is bales or boxes or bags how many there are of each from the tackle employed you can guess at the weights you can do all that aye aye my lord make careful note of all you see aye aye my lord hornblower fixed his eyes on his youthful flagcaptains face trying to estimate his discretion he remembered so well the emphatic words of the first sea lord regarding the necessity for the utmost tenderness regarding american susceptibilities hornblower decided the young man could be trusted now mr harcourt he said pay special attention to what i have to say the more i know about that cargo the better but dont go at it like a bull at a gate should an opportunity present itself for finding out what it is you must seize upon it i cant imagine what that opportunity may be but opportunities come to those who are ready for them long long ago barbara had said to him that good fortune is the portion of those who merit it i understand my lord if the slightest hint of this gets out if the americans or the french get to know what you are doing you will be sorry you were ever born mr harcourt yes my lord ive no use for a dashing young officer in this connection mr harcourt i want someone with ingenuity someone with cunning you are sure you understand yes my lord hornblower at last took his eyes from harcourts face he himself had been a dashing young officer once now he had far more sympathy than ever before with the older men who had entrusted him with enterprises a senior officer had perforce to trust his juniors while still carrying the ultimate responsibility if harcourt should blunder if he should be guilty of some indiscretion leading to a diplomatic protest it would certainly be true that he might wish he had never been born hornblower would see to that but hornblower would be wishing he himself had never been born too but there was no useful purpose to be served in pointing that out that is all then mr harcourt aye aye sir come on mr gerard were late already the upholstery of mr sharpes carriage was of green satin and the carriage was admirably sprung so that although it lurched and swayed over the uneven street surfaces it did not jolt or jerk yet after five minutes of lurching and swaying the carriage had been standing for some time in the hot may sun hornblower felt himself turning as green as the upholstery the rue royale the place darmes the cathedral received hardly a glance from him he welcomed the halts despite the fact that each halt meant a formal meeting with strangers the kind of meeting he disliked most heartily he stood and gulped in the humid air during the blessed moments between descending from the carriage and entering in under the ornate porticoes that stood to welcome him it had never occurred to him before that an admirals full dress uniform might with advantage be made of something thinner than broadcloth and he had worn his broad red ribbon and his glittering star far too often by now to feel the slightest pleasure in displaying it at the naval headquarters he drank an excellent madeira the general gave him a heavy marsala at the governors mansion he was given a tall drink which had been iced extraordinarily to the point where actual frost was visible on the tumbler the delicious cold contents of that tumbler disappeared rapidly and the tumbler was as rapidly refilled he checked himself abruptly when he found himself talking a little too loudly and dogmatically regarding some point of trivial importance he was glad to catch gerards eye and withdraw as gracefully as he could he was also glad that gerard seemed perfectly cool and sober and had charge of the cardcase dropping the necessary number of cards into the silver trays that the coloured butlers held out to receive them by the time he reached sharpes house he was glad to see a friendly face friendly even though it was only that morning that he had first set eyes on it it is an hour before the guests are due to arrive my lord said sharpe would your lordship care for a short rest i would indeed said hornblower mr sharpes house had a contrivance which merited much attention it was a douche bath hornblower only knew the french name for it it was in a corner of the bathroom floored and walled with the most excellent teak from the ceiling hung an apparatus of perforated zinc and from this hung a bronze chain when hornblower stood under this apparatus and pulled the chain a deluge of delicious cold water came streaming down on him from some unseen reservoir above it was as refreshing as ever it had been to stand under the washdeck pump on the deck of a ship at sea with the additional advantage of employing fresh water and in his present condition after his experiences of the day it was doubly refreshing hornblower stood under the raining water for a long time reviving with every second he made a mental note to install a similar contrivance at smallbridge house if ever he found himself at home again a coloured valet in livery stood by with towels to save him from the reheating exertion of drying himself and while he was being dabbed a knock at the door heralded gerards entrance i sent to the ship for a fresh shirt for you my lord he said gerard was really displaying intelligence hornblower put on the fresh shirt with gratitude but it was with distaste that he tightened his stook and pulled on his heavy uniform coat again he hung the red ribbon over his shoulder adjusted his star and was ready to face the next situation the darkness of evening was descending but it had not brought much relief from the heat on the contrary the drawingroom of mr sharpes house was brightly lit with wax candles that made it feel like an oven sharpe was awaiting him wearing a black coat his ruffled shirt made his bulky form appear larger than ever mrs sharpe sweeping in in turquoise blue was of much the same size she curtseyed deeply in response to hornblowers bow when sharpe presented him and made him welcome to the house in a french whose soft tang rang pleasantly on hornblowers ears a little refreshment my lord asked sharpe not at present thank you sir said hornblower hastily we are expecting twentyeight guests beside your lordship and mr gerard said sharpe some of them your lordship already met during your lordships official calls today in addition there are hornblower did his best to keep the list of names in his mind with mental labels attached gerard who came in and found himself a secluded chair listened intently and there will be cambronne of course said sharpe indeed i could hardly give a dinner party of this magnitude without inviting the most distinguished foreign visitor after your lordship present in this city of course not agreed hornblower yet six years of peace had hardly stilled the prejudices established during twenty years of war there was something a little unnatural about the prospect of meeting a french general on friendly terms especially the late commanderinchief of bonapartes imperial guard and the meeting might be a little strained because bonaparte was under lock and key in st helena and complaining bitterly about it the french consulgeneral will accompany him said sharpe and there will be the dutch consulgeneral the swedish the list seemed interminable there was only just time to complete it before the first of the guests was announced substantial citizens and their substantial wives the naval and military officers whom he had already met and their ladies the diplomatic officers soon even that vast drawingroom was crowded men bowing and women curtseying hornblower straightened up from a bow to find sharpe at his elbow again i have the honour of making two distinguished figures acquainted with each other he said in french son excellence rear admiral milord hornblower chevalier de lordre militaire du bain son excellence le lieutenantgeneral le comte de cambronne grand cordon de la legion dhonneur hornblower could not help being impressed even at this moment at the neat way in which sharpe had evaded the thorny question of whom to introduce to whom a french general and count and an english admiral and peer cambronne was an immensely tall beanpole of a man across one lean cheek and the beaky nose ran a purple scar perhaps the wound he had received at waterloo perhaps a wound received at austerlitz or jena or any other of the battles in which the french army had overthrown nations he was wearing a blue uniform covered with gold lace girt about with the watered red silk ribbon of the legion of honour a vast plaque of gold on his left breast enchanted to make your acquaintance sir said hornblower in his best french no more enchanted than i am to make yours milord replied cambronne he had a cold greenygrey eye with a twinkle in it a grey catswhisker moustache adorned his upper lip the baroness de vautour said sharpe the baron de vautour his most christian majestys consulgeneral hornblower bowed and said again that he was enchanted his most christian majesty was louis xviii of france using the papal title conferred on his house centuries earlier the count is being mischievous said vautour he indicated cambronnes star he is wearing the grand eagle given him during the last rgime officially the grand cordon has been substituted as our host very properly said vautour called attention to his own star a more modest affair cambronnes displayed an immense eagle of gold the badge of the now defunct french empire i won this on the field of battle said cambronne don alphonso de versage said sharpe his most catholic majestys consulgeneral this was the representative of spain then a word or two with him regarding this pending cession of florida might be informative but hornblower had hardly time to exchange formal courtesies before another presentation was being made it was some time before hornblower had a breathing space and could look round the pretty scene in the candlelight with the uniforms and the broadcloth coats the bare arms and shoulders of the women in their bright gowns and flashing jewellery and the two sharpes moving unobtrusively through the throng marshalling their guests in order of precedence the entrance of the governor and his lady was the signal for the announcement of dinner the diningroom was as vast as the drawingroom the table with covers for thirtytwo stood comfortably in it with ample room all round for the numerous footmen the candlelight was more subdued here but it glittered impressively on the silver which crowded the long table hornblower seated between the governors lady and mrs sharpe reminded himself that he must be alert and careful regarding his table manners it was the more necessary to be alert because he had to speak french on one side of him and english on the other he looked dubiously at the six different wine glasses that stood at each place the sherry was already being poured into the first of the glasses he could see cambronne seated between two pretty girls and obviously making himself pleasant to both of them he did not look as if he had a care in the world if he were meditating a filibustering expedition it did not weigh very heavily on his mind a steaming plate of turtle soup thick with gobbets of green fat this was to be a dinner served in the continental fashion which had come in after waterloo with no hodgepodge of dishes set out on the table for the guests to help themselves he spooned cautiously at the hot soup and applied himself to making small talk with his dinner partners dish succeeded dish and soon he had to face in the hot room the delicate question of etiquette as to whether it was more ungentlemanly to mop the sweat from his face or to leave it there flowing and visible his discomfort decided him in the end to mop furtively now sharpe was catching his eye and he had to rise to his feet striving to make his stupefied brain work while the buzz of conversation died down he raised his glass the president of the united states he said he had been about to continue idiotically long may he reign he checked himself with a jerk and went on long may the great nation of which he is president enjoy prosperity and the international amity of which this gathering is symbolic the toast was drunk with acclaim with nothing said about the fact that over half the continent spaniards and spanishamericans were busy killing each other he sat down and mopped again now cambronne was on his feet his britannic majesty george the fourth king of great britain and ireland the toast was drunk and now it was hornblowers turn again as evidenced by sharpes glance he stood up glass in hand and began the long list his most christian majesty his most catholic majesty his most faithful majesty that disposed of france and spain and portugal his majesty the king of the netherlands for the life of him he could not remember who came next but gerard caught his despairing eye and gave a significant jerk of his thumb his majesty the king of sweden gulped hornblower his majesty the king of prussia a reassuring nod from gerard told him that he had now included all the nations represented and he plucked the rest of his speech out of the whirlpool of his mind long may their majesties reign in increasing honour and glory well that was over and he could sit down again but now the governor was on his feet speaking in rhetorical phrases and it broke in upon hornblowers dulled intelligence that his own health was the next to be drunk he tried to listen he was aware of keen glances shot at him from around the table when the governor alluded to the defence of this city of new orleans from the misguided hordes who had assailed it in vain the allusion was perhaps inevitable even though it was over six years since the battle and he tried to force a smile at long last the governor reached his end his lordship admiral hornblower and i couple with his name a toast to the british navy hornblower climbed back upon his feet as the approving murmur of the company died down thank you for this unexpected honour he said and gulped as he sought for further words and to have my name coupled with that of the great navy in which it has been my privilege to serve so long is an additional honour for which to thank you the ladies were all rising now that he had sat down and he stood again while they withdrew the highly trained footmen swept the table clear of its accessories in a trice and the men gathered to one end of the table as the decanter was put into circulation the glasses were filled as sharpe brought one of the merchants present into the conversation with a question about the cotton crop it was safe ground from which to make brief and cautious sorties upon the much more debatable ground of world conditions but only a few minutes later the butler came in and murmured something to sharpe who turned to convey the news he brought to the french consulgeneral vautour rose to his feet with an expression of dismay perhaps you will accept my excuses sir he said i much regret the necessity no more than i regret it baron said sharpe i trust it is only a slight indisposition i trust so said vautour the baroness finds herself indisposed explained sharpe to the company i am sure you gentlemen will all join me in hoping as i said that the indisposition is slight and regretting that it involves the loss to us of the barons charming company there was a sympathetic murmur and vautour turned to cambronne shall i send back the carriage for you count he asked cambronne pulled at his catswhisker moustache perhaps it might be better if i came with you he said much as i regret leaving this delightful assembly the two frenchmen took their leave after polite farewells it is a great pleasure having made your acquaintance milord said cambronne bowing to hornblower the stiffness of his bow was mitigated by the twinkle in his eye it has been a profound experience to meet so distinguished a soldier of the late empire replied hornblower the frenchmen were escorted out of the room by sharpe voluble in his regrets your glasses need refilling gentlemen said sharpe on his return there was nothing hornblower disliked more than drinking large glasses of port in a hot and humid room even though he now found himself free to discuss the florida question with the spanish consulgeneral he was glad when sharpe made the move to rejoin the ladies somewhere within earshot of the drawingroom a string orchestra was playing but luckily in a subdued manner so that hornblower was spared much of the irritation that he usually suffered when he was compelled to listen to music with his tonedeaf ear he found himself sitting next to one of the pretty young women beside whom cambronne had been sitting at dinner in reply to her questions he was forced to admit that on this his first day he had seen almost nothing of the city of new orleans but the admission led to a discussion of other places he had visited two cups of coffee poured for him by a footman passing round the drawingroom cleared his head a little the young woman was attentive and listened well and nodded sympathetically when the conversation revealed that hornblower had left behind at the call of duty a wife and a tenyearold son in england gradually the night wore on and at last the governor and his lady rose to their feet and the party was over there were the last few weary minutes of awkward conversation as the carriages were announced one by one and then sharpe returned to the drawingroom after escorting the last of the guests to the door a successful evening i fancy i trust your lordship agrees with me he said and turned to his wife but i must ask you my dear to remember to reprimand grover about the souffl the entry of the butler with another murmured message prevented mrs sharpes reply your lordships pardon for a moment said sharpe he wore an expression of dismay and hastened out of the room leaving hornblower and gerard to begin polite words of thanks to his hostess for his pleasant evening gambronnes stolen a march on us exclaimed sharpe returning with a rapid waddle daring left her mooring three hours ago cambronne must have gone on board her the moment he left here he swung round on his wife was the baroness really ill he demanded of her she seemed decidedly faint replied mrs sharpe it must have been all a plant said sharpe she was acting cambronne put the vautours up to it because he wanted a chance to get clear away what do you think he means to do asked hornblower god knows but i expect he was disconcerted by the arrival of a kings ship here his leaving in this fashion means hes up to no good san domingo cartagena wherell he take that imperial guard of his ill get after him in any case said hornblower rising to his feet youll find it hard to overtake him said sharpe the fact that he said you and not your lordship was a proof of his agitation he has taken two tugs the lightning and the star and with the new lighthouses on the river a galloping horse wouldnt overtake him before he reaches the pass hell be clear out to sea by daylight i dont know if we can find a tug for you tonight in any case my lord ill start after him all the same said hornblower ive ordered the carriage round my lord said sharpe forgive me my dear if we leave without ceremony mrs sharpe received the hasty bows of the three men the butler was waiting with their hats the carriage stood at the door and they scrambled in cambronnes bonded freight went on board at nightfall said sharpe my man is meeting me at your ship with his report that may help us make up our minds said hornblower the carriage lurched in along the pitch dark streets may i make a suggestion my lord asked gerard yes what is it whatever scheme cambronne has in mind my lord vautour is party to it and he is a servant of the french government youre right the bourbons want a finger in every pie agreed sharpe thoughtfully they take every opportunity to assert themselves anyone would think it was them that we beat at waterloo and not boney the sound of the horses hoofs changed suddenly as the carriage reached the pier they stopped and sharpe had the door open before the footman could leap down from the box but as the three men scrambled out he stood beside the door hat in hand his dark face illuminated by the carriage lamps wait snapped sharpe they almost ran along the pier to where the glimmer of a lamp revealed the gangway the two hands of the anchor watch stood at attention in the darkness as they hastened on board mr harcourt shouted hornblower as soon as his foot touched the deck this was no time to stand on ceremony there was a light in the companion and harcourt was there here my lord hornblower pushed his way into the after cabin a lighted lantern dangled from the deck beam and gerard brought in another one whats your report mr harcourt the daring sailed at five bells in the first watch my lord said harcourt she had two tugs with her i know what else the lighter with the freight came alongside her early in the second dogwatch just after dark my lord a short dark man came unobtrusively into the cabin as he spoke and remained in the background well this gentleman whom mr sharpe sent kept watch as well as me on what they took on board my lord what was it i kept count as they swayed it up my lord they had lights in the mizzen stay well harcourt had a piece of paper in his hand and he proceeded to read from it there were twentyfive wooden cases my lord harcourt went on just in time to forestall an exasperated exclamation from hornblower i recognised those cases my lord they are the usual ones in which muskets are shipped twentyfour stand of arms in each case six hundred muskets and bayonets put in gerard calculating rapidly i guessed as much said sharpe what else demanded hornblower there were twelve large bales my lord oblong ones and twenty other bales long narrow ones couldnt you guess would you hear the report of the hand i sent my lord very well come down here jones yelled harcourt up the companion and then turned back to hornblower jones is a good swimmer my lord i sent him and another hand off in the quarterboat and jones swam to the lighter tell his lordship what you found jones jones was a skinny stunted young man who came in blinking at the lights ill at ease in this distinguished company when he opened his mouth he spoke with the accent of seven dials uniforms they was in them big bales sir how do you know i swum to the side of the lighter sir i could reach over an feel em sir did anyone see you this was from sharpe no sir no one didnt see me at all sir they was all busy swayin up the cases uniforms they was in the bales like i said sir what i could feel through the sacking was buttons sir not flat buttons sir like yours sir round buttons like bullets sir rows of em on each coat an i thought i could feel hembroidery too gold lace praps sir uniforms they was sir im sure of it the dark man came forward at this moment in his hands was a limp something that looked like a drowned black cat jones pointed to the object before he went on i couldnt guess for the life of me what was in the other bales sir the long ones so i outs with my knife youre sure no one saw you certain sure sir i outs with my knife an cuts the stitching at the end theyll think it come apart in the handlin sir an i takes the end one out an i swims with it back to the quarterboat sir the dark man held it forward for inspection and hornblower took it gingerly a black soggy wet mass of hair but his fingers encountered metal as he turned it in his hands heagles sir said jones there was a brass chain and a big brass badge the same displayed eagle as he had seen that evening on cambronnes chest what he held in his hands was a bearskin uniform cap soaked with its recent immersion and adorned with the brass finery is that what the imperial guard wore my lord suggested gerard yes said hornblower he had seen prints for sale often enough purporting to illustrate the last stand of the guard at waterloo in london now the guards sported bearskin caps not unlike this that he held in his hand they had been awarded to the guards in recognition of their overthrow of the imperial guard at the crisis of the battle then we know all we need to know said sharpe i must try and catch him said hornblower call all hands mr harcourt aye aye my lord after the automatic reply harcourt opened his mouth again to speak but he could make no sound come from it i remember said hornblower his cup of unhappiness filling to the brim i said i would not need the hands before morning yes my lord but theyll not be far ill send along the waterfront and find em ill have em back here in an hour thank you mr harcourt do your best mr sharpe we shall need to be towed as far as the pass will you send and order a steam tug for us sharpe looked over at the dark man who had brought in the bearskin cap doubt if therell be one before noon said the dark man daring took two and i know now why she did the president madisons laid up toueurs gone up to baton rouge with flat boats ecrevisse the one that brought this ship up went down again in the afternoon i think temeraires on her way up we might be able to get her to turn round as soon as she arrives and thats all there are noon said hornblower thirteen hours start daringll be at sea before we leave here and shes one of the fastest ships built said sharpe she logged fifteen knots when she was being chased by tenedos during the war whats the mexican port where shell take the soldiers on board its only a village on a lagoon corpus christi my lord five hundred miles and a fair wind hornblower could picture the daring with her beautiful lines and enormous spread of canvas booming along before the trade wind the little crab in whose cabin he stood was not intended for fast ocean runs she had been built and rigged small and handy to work in and out of obscure inlets doing the police work of the west indian archipelago on the run to corpus christi daring would certainly gain several hours a day or more perhaps to add to the twelve hours lead she already enjoyed it would not take long to march or to ferry five hundred disciplined men on board and then she would sail again where hornblowers weary brain baulked at the contemplation of the immensely complex political situation in the lands within easy run of corpus christi if he could guess he might be able to anticipate darings arrival at the danger point if he merely pursued her to corpus christi he would almost certainly arrive there to find her already gone soldiers and all having vanished out into the trackless sea on whatever errand of mischief she meditated darings an american ship my lord said sharpe to add to his troubles that was an important point a very important point daring had an ostensibly legal errand and she flew the stars and stripes he could think of no excuse for taking her into port for examination his instructions had been very strict regarding his treatment of the american flag no more than nine years ago america had gone boldly to war against the greatest maritime power in the world on account of the royal navys attitude towards the american mercantile marine shes armed and shell be full of men my lord said gerard that was another important point and a very positive point at that with her twelvepounders and five hundred disciplined soldiers and her large american crew as well she could laugh at anything crab could threaten with her sixpounders and her crew of sixteen daring would be within her rights to refuse to obey any signals from crab and crab could do nothing to compel obedience shoot away a spar not so easy with a sixpounder and even if no one were to be killed by accident there would be a terrible diplomatic storm if he were to fire on the stars and stripes could he shadow her so at least to be on hand when her real purpose was revealed no impossible anywhere out at sea daring had only to spread her wings to a fair wind to leave crab below the horizon in an afternoon and then daring could resume her true course unpursued sweating in the stifling night hornblower felt like a lassoed wild animal at every moment some fresh coil was being wound about him to render him more helpless he was tempted like a wild animal to lose all self control to lapse into mad panic to fling away all his strength in an explosion of rage he had sometimes seen during his long professional career senior officers giving vent to explosions of that sort but it would not help he looked round at the circle of faces in the lamplight the faces wore the sober expressions of men who were witnessing a failure men who were aware that they were in the presence of an admiral who had made a woeful hash of the first important business he had encountered that in itself could drive him insane with fury pride came to help him he would not sink to human weaknesses in the sight of these men i shall sail in any case he said coldly as soon as i have a crew and a steam tug may i ask what your lordship intends to do asked sharpe hornblower had to think quickly to make a reasonable answer to this question he had no idea all he knew was that he was not going to give up without a struggle no crisis was ever alleviated by wasting time i shall employ what time i have here in the composition of orders for my squadron he said my flaglieutenant will write them at my dictation and i shall ask you mr sharpe to undertake the distribution of them by all the means you find available very good my lord hornblower remembered at that moment something he should have done already it was not too late this part of his duty he must still carry out and it would at least disguise the anguish he felt mr harcourt he said i have to commend you greatly on the excellent way in which you executed my orders you carried out the task of observing daring in most exemplary fashion you can be sure i shall call the attention of their lordships to your behaviour thank you my lord and this man jones went on hornblower no seaman could have acted with more intelligence you made a good selection mr harcourt and jones justified it i have it in mind to reward him i can give him an acting rating and confirm it as soon as possible thank you my lord he has been rated before and disrated drink is that why he was denied shore leave im afraid so my lord then what do you recommend harcourt was at a loss you could say to his face what youve already said to me my lord you could shake his hand hornblower laughed and be known through the navy as the meanest admiral who ever flew a flag no a golden guinea at least two guineas ill give them to him myself and i shall request you to give him three days leave as soon as we see kingston again let him have his debauch if that is the only way in which we can reward him i have to consider the feelings of the whole squadron aye aye my lord now mr gerard ill begin the writing of those orders it was indeed noon before crab cast off and was taken in tow by the tug temeraire it was significant of hornblowers state of mind that he never gave a thought to the implication of that glorious name the interval before sailing all the long stifling morning was taken up by the dictation of orders to be dispersed to every ship of his squadron an infinity of copies was necessary sharpe would send them under seal by every british ship leaving new orleans for the west indies in the hope that should one of them encounter a kings ship his orders would be passed on without the delay of being sent to kingston and then transmitted through official channels every ship of the west india squadron was to keep a sharp lookout for the american ship daring every ship was to enquire her business and was to ascertain if possible whether daring had troops on board but captains of hms vessels were reminded of that passage in the commanderinchiefs original instructions regarding behaviour towards the american flag if troops were not on board an effort was to be made to ascertain where they had been landed if they were daring was to be kept in sight until they should be landed captains were to exercise a wide discretion regarding any interference with darings operations seeing that these orders would not leave new orleans until tomorrow and would travel by slow merchant ship it was hardly likely that they would reach any ship of the squadron before daring had done whatever she planned to do yet it was necessary to take every possible precaution hornblower signed twenty copies of his orders with a sweating hand saw them sealed and handed them over to sharpe they shook hands before sharpe went down the gangway cambronne will head for port au prince or havana in my opinion my lord said sharpe the two places were not more than a thousand miles apart might it not be cartagena or la guayra asked hornblower with elaborate irony those places were about a thousand miles apart as well and more than a thousand miles from havana it well might be said sharpe the irony quite wasted on him yet it could not be said that he was unsympathetic regarding hornblowers difficulties for he went on the very best of good fortune my lord in any case i am certain your lordship will command success crab cast off and temeraire had her in tow smoke and sparks belching from her chimneys much to harcourts indignation he was afraid not only of fire but of stains on his spotless deck he had the hands at work pumping up water from overside continuously soaking deck and rigging breakfast my lord said gerard at hornblowers elbow breakfast it was one oclock in the afternoon he had not been to bed he had drunk far too much last night and he had had a busy morning an anxious morning and he was as desperately anxious at this moment his first reaction was to say no then he remembered how he had complained yesterday about his delayed breakfast he would not allow his agitation to be so obvious of course it could have been served more promptly mr gerard he said hoping he was displaying the irascibility of a man who had not broken his fast aye aye my lord said gerard he had been hornblowers flaglieutenant for several months now and knew nearly as much about hornblowers moods as a wife might have done he knew too of hornblowers kindly interior he had received his appointment as the son of an old friend at a moment when admirals sons and dukes sons had yearned to serve as flaglieutenant to the fabulous hornblower hornblower forced himself to eat his fruit and his boiled eggs to drink his coffee despite the heat he whiled away a considerable time before he came on deck again and during that period he had actually contrived to forget his problems at least nearly to forget them but they returned in full force as soon as he came on deck again so harassing were they that he could feel no interest in this still unusual method of navigating a river no interest in the low banks that were going by so fast alongside this hurried departure from new orleans was only a gesture of despair after all he could not hope to catch the daring she would bring off whatever coup she had in mind almost under his very nose and leave him the laughingstock of the world of his world at least this would be the last command he would ever hold hornblower looked back over the years of half pay he had endured since waterloo they had been dignified and happy years one would think with a seat in the lords and a position of influence in the county a loving wife and a growing son but he had not been living the right life even so the five years after waterloo until at last the course of nature brought his promotion to flag rank had been fretful years he had only realised it when he knew the intense joy of his appointment to the west indies now all the years to come until he went down into the grave would be as dreary as those five more dreary because they would be unrelieved by the hope of future employment at sea here he was pitying himself he said to himself bitterly when what he should be doing was working out the problems set him what was it cambronne had in mind if he could head him off arrive triumphantly at the place where cambronne intended to strike his blow he could retrieve his reputation he might be able with great good fortune to intervene decisively but there was turmoil everywhere through spanish america and through the west indies as well save for the british colonies one place was as likely as another in any case it would be extremely doubtful if he would have any excuse to interfere cambronne probably held a commission from bolivar or some other leader but on the other hand the precautions cambronne had taken seemed to imply that he would at least prefer that the royal navy would not have a chance to intervene intervene with a crew of sixteen not counting supernumeraries and with nothing larger than a sixpounder rubbish he was a fool but he must think think think it will be sunset before we sight st philip my lord reported harcourt saluting very well mr harcourt there would be no salutes fired then he would make his departure from the united states with his tail between his legs so to speak there could hardly fail to be comment about the briefness of his visit sharpe might do his best to explain why he had left so hurriedly but any explanation would be unsatisfactory in every way this command for which he had yearned was turning out to be a ridiculous fiasco even this visit to which he had looked forward so eagerly was a disappointment he had seen almost nothing of new orleans of america or of the americans he could take no interest in this vast mississippi his problems deprived him of interest in his surroundings and his surroundings distracted him from a proper attention to his problems this fantastic method of progression for instance crab was going through the water at a good five knots and there was the current as well quite a breeze was blowing past him in consequence it was extraordinary to be going ahead with the wind dead foul without a heel or a pitch with the standing rigging uttering a faint note and yet not a creak from the running rigging your dinner is served my lord said gerard appearing on deck again darkness was closing in round the crab as hornblower went below but the cabin was hot and stuffy scotch broth my lord said giles putting a steaming plate before him hornblower dipped his spoon perfunctorily into the plate tried to swallow a few mouthfuls and laid his spoon down again giles poured him a glass of wine he wanted neither wine nor soup yet he must not display human weaknesses he forced himself to take a little more of the soup enough to preserve appearances chicken marengo my lord said giles putting another plate before him appearances were more easily preserved with chicken hornblower haggled the joints apart ate a couple of mouthfuls and laid down his knife and fork they would report to him from the deck if the miracle had happened if darings two steam tugs had broken down or if daring had run aground and they were passing her triumphantly absurd hope he was a fool giles cleared the table reset it with cheese dish and cheese plate and poured a glass of port a sliver of cheese a sip of port and dinner might be considered over giles set out the silver spirit lamp the silver coffee pot the porcelain cup barbaras last present to him somehow there was comfort in coffee despite his misery the only comfort in a black world on deck again it was quite dark on the starboard bow gleamed a light moving steadily aft to the starboard beam that must be one of the lighthouses installed by the americans to make the navigation of the mississippi as convenient by night as by day it was one more proof of the importance of this developing commerce the fact that as many as six steam tugs were being constantly employed was a further proof if you please my lord said harcourt in the darkness beside him we are approaching the pass what orders my lord what could he do he could only play a losing game out to the bitter end he could only follow daring far far astern of her in the hope of a miracle a fortunate accident the odds were a hundred to one that by the time he reached corpus christi the bird would be flown completely vanished yet perhaps the mexican authorities if there were any or local gossip if he could pick up any might afford him some indication of the next destination of the imperial guard as soon as we are at sea set a course for corpus christi if you please mr harcourt aye aye my lord corpus christi study your sailing directions for the gulf of mexico mr harcourt for the pass into the lagoon there aye aye my lord that was done then the decision was taken yet he stayed up on deck trying to wrestle with the problem in all its vague and maddening complexity he felt rain on his face and soon it was falling in torrents roaring on the deck soaking his best uniform his cocked hat weighed on his head like lead with the accumulation of water in the brim he was about to take shelter below when his mind began to follow an old train of thought and he stayed gerard loomed up in the darkness with his souwester and oilskins but he paid no attention to him was it possible that all this was a false alarm that cambronne had nothing else in mind than to take back the guard to france no of course not he would not have taken six hundred muskets on board in that case nor bales of uniforms and there would have been no need for a hurried and clandestine departure if you please my lord said gerard standing insistently by with his oilskins hornblower remembered how before he left england barbara had taken gerard to one side and had talked to him long and earnestly no doubt she had been telling him of the need to see he did not get wet and that he had his meals regularly too late now mr gerard he said with a grin im soaked through then please my lord go below and shift your clothes there was genuine anxiety in gerards voice a real concern the rain was roaring on gerards oilskins in the darkness like the nitrecrusher of a powdermill oh very well said hornblower he made his way down the little companion gerard following him giles called gerard sharply hornblowers servant appeared at once put out dry clothes for his lordship giles began to bustle round the little cabin kneeling on the deck to fish a fresh shirt out of the chest half a gallon of water cascaded down beside him as hornblower took off his hat see that his lordships things are properly dried ordered gerard aye aye sir said giles with sufficient restrained patience in his tone to make gerard aware that it was an unnecessary order hornblower knew that these men were both fond of him so far their affection had survived his failure for how long very well he said in momentary irritation i can look after myself now he stood alone in the cabin stooping under the deck beams unbuttoning his soaking uniform coat he realised he was still wearing his ribbon and star the ribbon as he passed it over his head was soaking wet too ribbon and star mocked at his failure just at the very moment when he was sneering at himself for hoping again that daring might have gone aground somewhere during her passage down the river a tap at the door brought gerard back into the cabin i said i could look after myself snapped hornblower message from mr harcourt my lord said gerard unabashed the tug will be casting off soon the wind is fair a strong breeze east by north very well a strong breeze a fair wind would be all in darings favour crab might have stood a chance of overhauling her in fluky contrary airs fate had done everything possible to load the dice against him giles had taken the opportunity to slip back into the cabin he took the wet coat from hornblowers hand didnt i tell you to get out blared hornblower cruelly aye aye my lord replied giles imperturbably what about this this cap my lord he had picked up the bearskin cap of the imperial guard which was still lying in the locker oh take it away roared hornblower he had kicked off his shoes and was beginning to peel off his stockings when the thought struck him he remained stooping to consider it a bearskin cap bales and bales of bearskin caps why muskets and bayonets he could understand uniforms too perhaps but who in their sane senses would outfit a regiment for service in tropical america with bearskin caps he straightened up slowly and stood still again thinking deeply even uniform coats with buttons and embroidery would be out of place among the ragged ranks of bolivars hordes bearskin caps would be quite absurd giles he roared and when giles appeared round the door bring that cap back to me he took it into his hands again within him surged the feeling that he held in his hands the clue to the mystery there was the heavy chain of lacquered brass the brazen imperial eagle cambronne was a fighting soldier of twenty years experience in the field he would never expect men wearing things like this to wage war in the pestilential swamps of central america or the stirling canebrakes of the west indies then the imperial guard in their uniforms and bearskins already historic would be associated in everyones mind with the bonapartist tradition even now making itself felt as a political force a bonapartist movement in mexico impossible in france then within his wet clothes hornblower felt a sudden surge of warmth as his blood ran hot with the knowledge that he had guessed the solution st helena bonaparte was there a prisoner an exile in one of the loneliest islands in the world five hundred disciplined troops arriving by surprise out of a ship flying american colours would set him free and then there were few ships in the world faster than the daring sailing for france she would arrive there before any warning could reach the civilised world bonaparte would land with his guard oh the purpose of the uniforms and bearskins was quite plain everyone would remember the glories of the empire the french army would flock to his standard as it had done once before when he returned from elba the bourbons had already outworn their welcome sharpe had remarked how they were acting as international busybodies in the hope of dazzling the people with a successful foreign policy bonaparte would march again to paris without opposition then the world would be in a turmoil once more europe would experience again the bloody cycle of defeat and victory after elba a campaign of a hundred days had been needed to overthrow bonaparte at waterloo but a hundred thousand men had died during those hundred days millions and millions of money had been expended this time it might not even be as easy as that bonaparte might find allies in the disturbed state of europe there might be twenty more years of war leaving europe in ruins hornblower had fought through twenty years of war he felt physically sick at the thought of their repetition the prospect was so monstrous that he went back through the deductions he had been making but he could not avoid reaching the same conclusion cambronne was a bonapartist no man who had been commanderinchief of the imperial guard could be anything else it was even indicated by a trifle he had worn the bonapartist grand eagle of the legion of honour instead of the bourbon grand cordon which had been substituted for it he had done that with vautours knowledge and agreement vautour was a servant of the bourbons but he must be a traitorous one the whole business of chartering the daring and sending her fatal freight on board could only have been carried out with the connivance of the french authorities presumably france was riddled with a fresh bonapartist conspiracy the baronesss behaviour was further proof central america and the west indies might be in a turmoil but there was no particular strategic point there inviting an invasion by the imperial guard in uniforms and bearskins it must be st helena and then france he could have no doubt about it now now the lives of millions the peace of the whole world depended on the decisions he had to make at this moment there was a rush of feet on the deck just above his head he heard ropes slapping down upon it orders being given loud creakings the cabin suddenly leaned over sideways with the setting of sail catching him completely unaware so that he staggered and dropped the bearskin cap which lay unnoticed at his feet crab rose to an even keel again the deck under his feet felt suddenly lively as if the breath of life had been breathed into it they were at sea they were heading for corpus christi with the wind east by north crab would be running wingandwing possibly now he had to think fast with every second of value he could not afford to run to leeward in this fashion if he were going to change his plans and he knew he was going to change them he had yearned so desperately for a chance to guess whither daring would head after calling at corpus christi now he could intervene now he had a chance to preserve the peace of the world with his eyes unseeing focused upon an infinite distance he stood in the swaying cabin calling up into his mental sight the charts of the gulf of mexico and the caribbean the northeast trades blew across them not quite as reliably at this time of year as during the winter but constantly enough to be a calculable factor a ship bound for the south atlantic for st helena from corpus christi would be bound to take the yucatan channel then especially if her business were such as not to invite attention she would head for the shoulder of south america down the centre of the caribbean with scores of miles of open sea on either beam but she would have to pass through the chain of the antilles before breaking through into the atlantic there were a hundred passages available but only one obvious one only one route that would be considered for a moment by a captain bound for st helena and with the trade winds to contend with he would round galera point the northernmost extremity of trinidad he would give it as wide a berth as possible but he could not give it a very wide berth because to the northward of galera point lay the island of tobago and the tobago channel between the two was no more than hornblower could not be sure exactly certainly no more than fifty miles wide in favourable conditions a single ship could patrol that channel and make certain that nothing passed through unsighted it was a typical example of maritime strategy on a tiny scale sea power made its influence felt all over the wide oceans but it was in the narrow seas at the focal points that the decisive moments occurred the yucatan channel would not be nearly as suitable as the tobago channel for the former was more than a hundred miles wide crab would get there first that could be taken for granted seeing that daring would have two sides of a triangle to cover calling at corpus christi and with a long beat to windward as a result it would be best to employ the advantage so gained to hasten to the tobago channel there would be just time to anticipate daring there just time and there was a substantial chance that on the way he might meet some ship of his squadron to take her along with him a frigate now that would give him all the force he needed he made his resolve at that moment conscious as he did so of his quickened heartbeat giles shouted hornblower giles reappeared and within the wide discretion of a spoiled servant displayed shocked disapproval at the sight of him still in his wet shirt and ducks my compliments to mr harcourt and i would be glad to see him here as quickly as is convenient to him that was very quickly naturally when an admiral needed the presence of a lieutenant mr harcourt i have decided on a change of plan there is no time to be lost kindly set a course for cape san antonio cape san antonio aye aye sir harcourt was a good officer there was neither surprise nor doubt in his voice as he heard the surprising order when we are on the new course i will explain what i intend to do if you will have the goodness to report to me with the charts mr harcourt bring mr gerard with you aye aye sir now he could take off his wet shirt and trousers and dab himself dry with a towel somehow the little cabin did not seem so oppressively hot perhaps because they were out at sea perhaps because he had reached a decision he was putting on his trousers at the moment when harcourt had the helm put down crab came round like a top with lusty arms hauling in on the sheets she lay far over to starboard with the wind abeam and hornblower one leg in his trousers after a frantic hop trying to preserve his balance fell on his nose across his cot with his legs in the air he struggled to his feet again crab still heeled over to starboard farther and then less as each roller of the beam sea passed under her each roll taking hornblower by surprise as he tried to put his other leg into his trousers so that he sat down twice abruptly on his coat before he managed it it was as well that harcourt and gerard reentered the cabin only after he had succeeded they listened soberly while hornblower told them of his deductions regarding darings plans and of his intention to intercept her at the tobago channel harcourt took his dividers and measured off the distances and nodded when he had finished we can gain four days on her to san antonio my lord he said that means well be three days ahead of her there three days should be just enough start for crab in the long long race down the length of the caribbean could we call at kingston on our way my lord asked gerard it was tempting to consider it but hornblower shook his head it would be no use calling at headquarters telling the news possibly picking up reinforcements if daring slipped past them as they were doing so it would take too long to work in he said even if we had the sea breeze and there would be delay while we were there weve nothing to spare as it is i suppose not my lord agreed gerard grudgingly he was playing the part of the staff officer whose duty it was to be critical of any suggested plan then what do we do when we meet her hornblower met gerards eyes with a steady glance gerard was asking the question that had been already asked and left unanswered i am forming plans to meet that situation said hornblower and there was a rasping tone in his voice which forbade gerard to press the matter theres not more than twenty miles of navigable water in the tobago channel my lord said harcourt still busy with his dividers then she can hardly pass us unobserved even by night said hornblower i think gentlemen that we are acting on the best possible plan perhaps the only possible plan yes my lord said harcourt his imagination was hard at work if boney once gets loose again he could not go on he could not face that appalling possibility we have to see to it that he does not gentlemen and now that we have done all that we can it would be sensible if we took some rest i dont think any one of us has had any sleep for a considerable time that was true now that he had made up his mind upon a course of action now that he was committed to it for good or ill hornblower felt his eyelids drooping and sleep overcoming him he lay down on his cot after his officers had left him with the wind on the port beam and the cot against the bulkhead to starboard he could relax completely with no fear of rolling out he closed his eyes already he had begun to form the answer to the question gerard had asked the answer was a hideous one something horrible to contemplate but it seemed to be inevitable he had his duty to do and now he could be sure that he was doing it to the best of his ability with his conscience clear with a reassuring certainty that he was using the best of his judgment the inevitability of the rest of the future reinforced his need for sleep he slept until dawn he even dozed for a few minutes after that before he began to think clearly enough again in the daylight for that horrible thought to begin to nag at him again that was how the crab began her historic race to the tobago channel over a distance nearly as great as the atlantic is wide with the brave trade wind laying her over as she thrashed along all hands on board knew that she was engaged in a race for in a little ship like crab nothing could be kept secret and all hands entered into the spirit of the race with the enthusiasm to be expected of them sympathetic eyes were turned towards the lonely figure of the admiral standing braced on the tiny quarterdeck with the wind singing round him everyone knew the chances he was taking everyone thought that he deserved to win and no one could guess at his real torment over the certainty that was crystallising in his mind that this was the end of his career whether he should win the race or lose it no one on board begrudged the constant labour involved in getting every yard of speed out of crab the continual hauling in and letting out of the sheets as the sails were trimmed to the least variation of the wind the lightening and urgent shortening of canvas at the last possible moment as squalls came hurtling down upon them the instant resetting as the squalls passed on their way all hands constituted themselves as unofficial lookouts there was really no need for the admiral to have offered a golden guinea to the man who should first sight daring there was always the chance of an encounter even before reaching the tobago channel nobody minded wet shirts and wet beds as the spray burst over crabs bows in dazzling rainbows and found its way below through the deck as the overdriven schooner worked her seams open in the heavy swell the hourly casting of the log the daily calculation of the ships run were eagerly anticipated by men who usually displayed all the fatalistic indifference towards these matters of the hardened sailor i am shortening the water allowance my lord said harcourt to hornblower the first morning out to how much hornblower asked the question trying to appear as if he were really interested in the answer so that his misery over something else should not be apparent to half a gallon my lord two quarts of fresh water a day per man that would be hardship for men labouring hard in the tropics you are quite right mr harcourt said hornblower every possible precaution must be taken it was impossible to predict how long the voyage would last nor how long they would have to remain on patrol without refilling their water casks it would be absurd if they were driven prematurely into port as a result of thoughtless extravagance ill instruct giles went on hornblower to draw the same ration for me harcourt blinked a little at that his small experience with admirals led him to think they led a life of maximum luxury he had not thought sufficiently far into the problem to realise that if giles had a free hand as regards drinking water for his admiral giles and perhaps all giless friends would also have all the drinking water they needed and there was no smile on hornblowers face as he spoke hornblower wore the same bleak and friendless expression that he had displayed towards everyone since reaching his decision when they went to sea they sighted cape san antonio one afternoon and knew they were through the yucatan channel not only did this give them a fresh departure but they knew that from now on it would not be extremely unlikely for them to sight daring at any moment they were pursuing very much the same course as she would be taking from this point onwards two nights later they passed grand cayman they did not sight it but they heard the roar of the surf on one of the outlying reefs that was a proof of how closely harcourt was cutting his corners hornblower felt that he would have given grand cayman a wider berth than that it was a moment when he chafed more than usual at the convention which prohibited an admiral from interfering in the management of his flagship the following night they picked up soundings on the pedro bank and knew that jamaica and kingston were a scant hundred miles to windward of them from this new departure harcourt could set a fresh course direct for the tobago channel but he could not hold it the trade wind took it into its head to veer round south of east as was not surprising with midsummer approaching and it blew dead foul harcourt laid crab on the starboard tack never voluntarily would any captain worth his salt yield a yard to the southward in the caribbean and clawed his way as close to the wind as crab would lie i see youve taken in the topsls mr harcourt remarked hornblower venturing on ticklish ground yes my lord in response to his admirals continued enquiring glance harcourt condescended to explain further a beamy schooner like this isnt intended to sail on her side my lord we make less leeway under moderate sail like this my lord as long as were closehauled with a strong breeze you know your own ship best of course mr harcourt said hornblower grudgingly it was hard to believe that crab was making better progress without her magnificent square topsails spread to the breeze he could be sure that daring would have every stitch of canvas spread perhaps a single reef crab thrashed on her way once or twice shipping it green over her starboard bow those were the moments when it was necessary for every man to grab and hold on at dawn next morning there was land right ahead a blue line on the horizon the mountains of haiti harcourt held on until noon raising them farther and farther out of the water and then he went about hornblower approved in an hour or two the land breeze might set in and there was beata point to weather it was maddening that on this tack they would actually be losing a little ground for it was perfectly possible that daring wherever she was might have the wind a point or two more in her favour and could be able to hold her course direct and it was quite remarkable to see the foremast hands raising wetted fingers to test the wind and studying the windward horizon and criticising the way the quartermaster at the tiller struggled to gain every yard to windward that he could for a day and a half the wind blew foul in the middle of the second night hornblower lying sleepless in his cot was roused by the call for all hands he sat up and reached for his dressinggown while feet came running above his head crab was leaping madly all hands shorten sail three reefs in the mainsl harcourts voice was pealing out as hornblower reached the deck the wind blew the tails of hornblowers dressinggown and nightshirt up round him as he stood out of the way by the taffrail darkness was roaring all round him a midsummer squall had come hurtling at them in the night but someone had had a weather eye lifting and had been prepared for it out of the southward had come the squall let her pay off shouted harcourt hands to the sheets crab came round in a welter of confused water plunged and then steadied now she was flying along in the darkness belying her unlovely name she was gaining precious distance to the northward an invaluable squall this was as long as it permitted them to hold this course the roaring night was hurrying by hornblowers dressinggown was whipping about his legs it was impossible not to feel exhilarated to stand thus compelling the elements to work in their favour cheating the wind that thought to take them by surprise well done mr harcourt shouted hornblower into the wind as harcourt came and stood beside him in the darkness thank you sir my lord two hours of this is what we need fate granted them an hour and a half at any rate before the squall died away and the trade wind pigheadedly resumed its former direction of east by south but next morning at breakfast giles was able to report good news winds backing to the norrard my lord he said giles was as interested as everyone else in the vessels progress excellent said hornblower it was only some seconds later that the dull pain grew up again inside him that wind would bear him more swiftly to his fate as the day wore on the trade wind displayed some of its midsummer freakishness it died away died away more and more until it blew only in fitful puffs so that there were intervals when crab drifted idly over the glassy blue sea turning her head to all points of the compass in turn while the vertical sun blazed down upon a deck in whose seams the pitch melted flying fish left fleeting dark tracks upon the enamel surface of the sea no one cared every eye was scanning the horizon for the first hint of the next catspaw of wind creeping towards them perhaps not too far away in this moody caribbean daring was holding her course with all sail set and drawing the day ended and the night went by and still the trade wind did not blow only occasionally would a puff send crab ghosting along momentarily towards the tobago channel the sun blazed down and men limited to two quarts of water a day were thirsty thirsty all the time they had seen very few sail and the ones they saw were of no use in furthering hornblowers plans an island schooner bound to belize a dutchman homeward bound from curaao no one with whom hornblower could entrust a letter and no ship of his own squadron that was something almost beyond the bounds of possibility hornblower could only wait as the days went by in grim bleak patience at last the freakish wind blew again from one point north of east and they were able to hold their course with topsails set again heading steadily for the antilles reeling off as much as six knots hour after hour now as they approached the islands they saw more sails but they were only interisland sloops trading between the leeward islands and trinidad a square rigger seen on the horizon roused momentary excitement but she was not the daring she flew the red and gold of spain a spanish frigate heading for the venezuelan coast presumably to deal with the insurgents the voyage was nearly completed hornblower heard the cry of land from the masthead lookout and it was only a moment before gerard came into the cabin grenada in sight my lord very well now they were entering the waters where they could really expect to meet daring now the direction of the wind was of more importance than ever it was blowing from the northeast now and that was helpful it extinguished the very faint possibility that daring might pass to the northward of tobago instead of through the tobago channel darings bound to make the same landfall my lord said gerard and by daylight if she can we can hope for it at least said hornblower if daring had been as long out of sight of land as had crab in the fluky winds and unpredictable currents of the caribbean her captain would certainly take all precautions in his approach i think mr harcourt said hornblower that we can safely hold our course for point galera aye aye my lord now was the worst period of waiting of wondering whether the whole voyage might not prove to be a fools errand patrolling beating up to within sight of trinidad and then going about and reaching past tobago again towards grenada waiting was bad if the voyage should not turn out to be a fools errand it meant something that hornblower and hornblower alone knew to be worse gerard raised the question again how do you propose to stop him my lord there may be means answered hornblower trying to keep the harshness out of his voice that would betray his anxiety it was on a blue and gold blazing day with crab ghosting along before only the faintest breeze that the masthead lookout hailed the deck with the news of the sighting sail ho dead to looard sir a sail might be anything but at long intervals as crab crept closer the successive reports made it more and more likely that the strange sail was daring three masts even that first supplementary report made it reasonably sure for not many big ships plied out into the south atlantic from the caribbean all sail set even skysails and stunsls to the royals that did not mean quite so much she looks like an american sir the skysails had already hinted strongly in the same direction then harcourt went up to the mainmast head with his own glass and came down again with his eyes shining with excitement thats daring my lord im sure of it ten miles apart they lay on the brilliant blue of the sea with the brilliant blue of the sky above them and on the far horizon a smudge of land crab had won her race by twentyfive hours daring was boxing the compass swinging idly in all directions under her pyramids of sails in the absence of all wind crab carried her way for a while longer and then she too fell motionless under the blazing sun all eyes turned on the admiral standing stiffly with his hands locked behind him gazing at the distant white rectangles that indicated where lay his fate the schooners big mainsail flapped idly flapped again and then the boom began to swing over hands to the sheets yelled harcourt the air was so light that they could not even feel it on their sweating faces but it sufficed to push the booms out and a moment later the helmsman could feel the rudder take hold just enough to give him control with crabs bowsprit pointed straight at daring the breath of wind was coming in over the starboard quarter almost dead astern almost dead foul for daring if ever it should reach her but she was still becalmed the breath of wind increased until they could feel it until they could hear under the bows the music of the schooners progress through the water and then it died away abruptly leaving crab to wallow on the swell then it breathed again over the port quarter this time and then it drew farther aft so that the topsails were braced square and the foresail could be hauled over to the port side and crab ran wingandwing for ten blessed minutes until the wind dropped again to a dead flaming calm they could see daring catch a wind see her trim her sails but only momentarily only long enough to reveal her intentions before she lay once more helpless despite her vast sail area her greater dead weight made her less susceptible to these very faint airs thank god for that said gerard glass to his eye as he watched her swing idly again i think she aims to pass us beyond cannonshot my lord i shouldnt be surprised at that agreed hornblower another breath another slight closing of the gap another dead calm mr harcourt perhaps it would be best if you let the men have their dinners now aye aye my lord salt beef and pease pudding under a noonday sun in the tropics who could have any appetite for that especially with the excitement of watching for a wind and in the middle of dinner hands were sent again to the sheets and braces to take advantage of another breath of wind at what time will you have your dinner my lord asked giles not now was all the answer hornblower would give him glass to eye hes hoisted his colours my lord pointed out gerard american colours the stars and stripes regarding which he had been expressly ordered to be particularly tender but he could be nothing else in any case seeing that daring mounted twelvepounders and was full of men now both vessels had a wind but crab was creeping bravely along at a full two knots and daring trying to head to the southward closehauled was hardly moving now she was not moving at all turning aimlessly in a breeze too faint to give her steerage way i can see very few people on her deck my lord said harcourt the eye with which he had been staring through his glass was watering with the glare of sun and sea shed keep em below out of sight said gerard that was so likely as to be certain whatever daring and cambronne thought of crabs intentions it would be safest to conceal the fact that she had five hundred men on board while heading for the south atlantic and between her and that south atlantic lay crab the frailest barrier imaginable let daring once pass through the channel out into the open sea and nothing could be done to stop her no ship could hope to overtake her she would reach st helena to strike her blow there and no possible warning could be given it was now or never and it was hornblowers fault that matters had reached such a pass he had been utterly fooled in new orleans he had allowed cambronne to steal a march on him now he had to make any sacrifice that circumstances demanded of him any sacrifice whatever to redeem the peace of the world crab could do nothing to stop daring it could only be done by his own personal exertions mr harcourt said hornblower in his harsh expressionless monotone ill have the quarterboat cleared away ready to lower if you please have a full boats crew told off to double bank the oars aye aye my lord wholl go in her my lord asked gerard i will said hornblower the mainsail flapped the boom came creaking inboard swung out again swung in the breeze was dying away again for a few minutes more crab held her course and then the bowsprit began to turn away from daring cant keep her on her course sir reported the quartermaster hornblower swept his gaze round the horizon in the blazing afternoon there was no sign of a further breeze the decisive moment had come and he snapped his telescope shut ill take that boat now mr harcourt let me come too my lord said gerard a note of protest in his voice no said hornblower in case a breeze should get up during the next half hour he wanted no useless weight in the boat while crossing the twomile gap put your backs into it said hornblower to the boats crew as they shoved off the oarblades dipped in the blue blue water shining gold against the blue the boat rounded crabs stern with anxious eyes looking down on them hornblower brought the tiller over and pointed straight for daring they soared up a gentle swell and down again up again and down again with each rise and fall crab was perceptibly smaller and daring perceptibly larger lovely in the afternoon light during what hornblower told himself were the last hours of his professional life they drew nearer and nearer to daring until at last a hail came borne by the heated air boat ahoy coming aboard hailed hornblower back again he stood up in the sternsheets so that his goldlaced admirals uniform was in plain sight keep off hailed the voice but hornblower held his course there could be no international incident made out of this an unarmed boats crew taking an admiral alone on board a becalmed ship he directed the boat towards the mizzen chains keep off hailed the voice an american voice hornblower swung the boat in in oars he ordered with the way she carried the boat surged towards the ship hornblower timed his movements to the best of his ability knowing his own clumsiness he leaped for the chains got one shoe full of water but held on and dragged himself up lie off and wait for me he ordered the boats crew and then turned to swing himself over on to the deck of the ship the tall thin man with a cigar in his mouth must be the american captain the burly fellow beside him one of the mates the guns were cast off although not run out and the american seamen were standing round them ready to open fire did you hear me say keep off mister asked the captain i must apologise for this intrusion sir said hornblower i am rear admiral lord hornblower of his britannic majestys service and i have the most urgent business with count cambronne for a moment on the sunlit deck they stood and looked at each other and then hornblower saw cambronne approaching ah count said hornblower and then made himself speak french it is a pleasure to meet monsieur le comte again he took off his cocked hat and held it over his breast and doubled himself in a bow which he knew to be ungainly and to what do i owe this pleasure milord asked cambronne he was standing very stiff and straight his catswhisker moustache bristling out on either side i have come to bring you the very worst of news i regret to say said hornblower through many sleepless nights he had rehearsed these speeches to himself now he was forcing himself to make them naturally and i have come also to do you a service count what do you wish to say milord bad news well it is with the deepest regret count that i have to inform you of the death of your emperor no the emperor napoleon died at st helena last month i offer you my sympathy count hornblower told the lie with every effort to appear like a man speaking the truth it cannot be true i assure you that it is count a muscle in the counts cheek twitched restlessly beside the purple scar his hard slightly protruding eyes bored into hornblowers like gimlets i received the news two days back in port of spain said hornblower in consequence i cancelled the arrangements i had made for the arrest of this ship cambronne could not guess that crab had not made as quick a passage as he indicated i do not believe you said cambronne nevertheless it was just the sort of tale that might be told to halt daring in her passage sir said hornblower haughtily he drew himself up even stiffer acting as well as he could the part of the man of honour whose word was being impugned the pose was almost successful you must understand the importance of what you are saying milord said cambronne with the faintest hint of apology in his voice but then he said the fatal dreaded words that hornblower had been expecting milord do you give me your word of honour as a gentleman that what you say is true my word of honour as a gentleman said hornblower he had anticipated this moment in misery for days and days he was ready for it he compelled himself to make his answer in the manner of a man of honour he made himself say it steadily and sincerely as if it did not break his heart to say it he had been sure that cambronne would ask him for his word of honour it was the last sacrifice he could make in twenty years of war he had freely risked his life for his country he had endured danger anxiety hardship he had never until now been asked to give his honour this was the further price he had to pay it was through his own fault that the peace of the world was in peril it was fitting that he should pay the price and the honour of one man was a small price to pay for the peace of the world to save his country from the renewal of the deadly perils she had so narrowly survived for twenty years in those happy years of the past returning to his country after an arduous campaign he had looked about him and he had breathed english air and he had told himself with fatuous patriotism that england was worth fighting for was worth dying for england was worth a mans honour too oh it was true but it was heartrending it was far far worse than death that it should be his honour that had to be sacrificed a little group of officers had appeared on deck and were standing grouped on either side of cambronne listening to every word to one side stood the american captain and his mate facing them alone his gaudy uniform flashing in the sun stood hornblower waiting the officer on cambronnes right spoke next he was some kind of adjutant or staff officer clearly of the breed that hornblower hated of course he had to repeat the question to turn the iron in the wound your word of honour milord my word of honour repeated hornblower still steadily still like a man of honour no one could disbelieve the word of honour of a british admiral of a man who had held his majestys commission for more than twenty years he went on now with the arguments he had rehearsed this exploit of yours can be forgotten now count he said with the emperors death all hope of reconstituting the empire is at an end no one need know of what you had intended you and these gentlemen and the imperial guard below decks can remain uncompromised with the regime that rules france you can carry them all home as you had said you would do and on the way you can drop your warlike stores quietly overboard it is for this reason that i have visited you like this alone my country your country do not desire any new incident to imperil the amity of the world no one need know this incident can remain a secret between us cambronne heard what he said and listened to it but the first news he had heard was of such moving importance that he could speak of nothing else the emperor is dead he said i have already assured you of my sympathy count said hornblower i offer it to these gentlemen as well my very deepest sympathy the american captain broke into the murmurs of cambronnes staff theres a catspaw of wind coming towards us he said well be under way again in five minutes are you coming with us mister or are you going over the side wait said cambronne he seemingly had some english he turned to his staff and they plunged into debate when they all spoke at once hornblowers french was inadequate to follow the conversation in detail but he could see they were all convinced he might have been pleased if there had been any pleasure left in the world for him someone walked across the deck and shouted down the hatchway and next moment the imperial guard began to pour up on deck the old guard bonapartes old guard they were all in full uniform apparently in readiness for battle if crab had been foolish enough to risk one there were five hundred of them in their plumes and bearskins muskets in hand a shouted order formed them up on deck line behind line gaunt whiskered men who had marched into every capital in europe save london alone they carried their muskets and stood at rigid attention only a few of them did not look straight to their front but darted curious glances at the british admiral the tears were running down cambronnes scarred cheeks as he turned and spoke to them he told them the news in broken sentences for he could hardly speak for sorrow they growled like beasts as he spoke they were thinking of their emperor dying in his island prison under the harsh treatment of his english jailers the looks that were turned upon hornblower now showed hatred instead of curiosity but cambronne caught their attention again as he went on to speak of the future he spoke of france and peace the emperor is dead he said again as if he were saying that the world had come to an end the ranks were ragged now emotion had broken down even the iron discipline of the old guard cambronne drew his sword raising the hilt to his lips in the beautiful gesture of the salute the steel flashed in the light of the sinking sun i drew this sword for the emperor said cambronne i shall never draw it again he took the blade in both hands close to the hilt and put it across his lifted knee with a convulsive effort of his lean powerful body he snapped the blade across and turning he flung the fragments into the sea the sound that came from the old guard was like a long drawn moan one man took his musket by the muzzle swung the butt over his head and brought it crashing down on the deck breaking the weapon at the small of the butt others followed his example the muskets rained overside the american captain was regarding the scene apparently unmoved as if nothing more would ever surprise him but the unlit cigar in his mouth was now much shorter and he must have chewed off the end he approached hornblower obviously to ask the explanation of the scene but the french adjutant interposed france said the adjutant we go to france france repeated the captain not he did not say the words st helena but they were implicit in his expression france repeated the adjutant heavily cambronne came towards them stiffer and straighter than ever as he mastered his emotion i will intrude no further on your sorrow count said hornblower remember always you have the sympathy of an englishman cambronne would remember those words later when he found he had been tricked by a dishonourable englishman but they had to be said at this moment all the same i will remember said cambronne he was forcing himself to observe the necessary formalities i must thank you milord for your courtesy and consideration i have done my duty towards the world said hornblower he would not hold out his hand cambronne later would feel contaminated if he touched him he came stiffly to attention and raised his hand instead in salute goodbye count he said i hope we shall meet again in happier circumstances goodbye milord said cambronne heavily hornblower climbed into the mizzen chains and the boat pulled in to him and he fell rather than climbed into the sternsheets give way he said no one could feel as utterly exhausted as he felt no one could feel as utterly unhappy they were waiting for him eagerly on board crab harcourt and gerard and the others he still had to preserve an unmoved countenance as he went on board he still had duties to do you can let daring go past mr harcourt he said it is all arranged arranged my lord this was from gerard cambronne has given up the attempt they are going quietly to france france to france my lord you heard what i said they looked across the strip of sea purple now in the dying day daring was bracing round her yards to catch the faint breeze that was blowing your orders are to let them pass my lord persisted gerard yes damn you said hornblower and instantly regretted the flash of rage and bad language he turned to the other mr harcourt we can now proceed into port of spain i presume that even if the wind is fair you will prefer not to risk the dragons mouth by night you have my permission to wait until daylight aye aye my lord even then they would not leave him in peace as he turned to go below dinner my lord asked gerard ill give orders for it at once hopeless to snarl back that he wanted no dinner the discussion that would have ensued would have been worse than going through the form of eating dinner even so it meant that on entering his cabin he could not do as he wanted and fall on his cot with his face in his hands and abandon himself to his misery he had to sit up stiff and square while giles laid and served and cleared away while the tropical sunset flamed in the sky and black night swooped down upon the little ship on the purple sea only then after giless last goodnight my lord could he think again and work back through all the horror of his thoughts he had ceased to be a gentleman he was disgraced everything was at an end he would have to resign his command he would have to resign his commission how would he ever face barbara when little richard grew up and could understand what had happened how would he ever be able to meet his eyes and barbaras aristocratic family would sneer knowingly to each other and never again would he walk a quarterdeck and never again step on board with his hand to his hat and the bosuns calls shrilling in salute never again his professional life was at an end everything was at an end he had made the sacrifice deliberately and coldbloodedly but that did not make it any less horrible his thoughts moved into the other half of the circle he could have done nothing else if he had turned aside to kingston or port of spain daring would have slipped past him as her time of arrival off tobago proved and any additional strength he might have brought with him if any as was not likely would have been useless if he had stayed at kingston and sent a despatch to london if he had done that he might at least have covered himself with the authorities but it would have been unavailing how much time would elapse between the arrival of his letter in london and the arrival of daring on the coast of france with bonaparte on board two week very likely less than that the clerks at the admiralty would have treated his despatch at first as coming from a madman there would be delay in its reaching the first lords hands delay in its being laid before the cabinet delay while action was being debated delay while the french ambassador was informed delay while joint action was being agreed upon and what action if any if the cabinet did not dismiss his letter as that of an unbalanced alarmist the peacetime navy of england could never have been got to sea in time and in sufficient numbers to cover the whole coast of france so as to make it impossible for daring to land her deadly cargo and the mere inevitable leakage of the news that bonaparte was at sea and expected to land would throw france into immediate revolution no doubt about that and italy was in a turmoil too by writing to london he would have covered himself as he had already decided from the censure of the government but it was not the measure of a mans duty to avoid blame he had a positive duty to do and he had done it in the only way possible nothing else would have stopped cambronne nothing else he had seen where his duty lay he had seen what the price would be and now he was paying it he had bought the peace of the world at the price of his own honour he had ceased to be a gentleman his thoughts completed the other half of the circle his mind plunged on struggling desperately like a man in utter darkness waist deep in a slough it would not be long before the world knew of his dishonour cambronne would talk and so would the other frenchmen the world would hear soon of a british admiral giving his plighted word in the certain knowledge that he was telling a lie before then he would have left the service resigned his command and his commission that must be done at once his contaminated flag must fly no longer he must give no further orders to gentlemen in port of spain there was the governor of trinidad tomorrow he would tell him that the west india squadron no longer had a commanderinchief the governor could take all the necessary official action in circularising the squadron and informing the government just as if yellow fever or apoplexy had taken off the commanderinchief in this way anarchy would be reduced to a minimum and a change of command arranged as simply as possible that was the last service he could perform for his country the very last the governor would think he was mad of course he might be in a straitjacket tomorrow unless he confessed his shame and then the governor would pity him the first of the pity the first of the contempt he would have to face for the rest of his life barbara richard the lost soul plunged on through the stinking slough through the dark night at the end of that dark night a knock at the door brought in gerard the message he was bearing died on his lips as he looked at hornblowers face white under the tan and at his hollow eyes are you quite well my lord he asked anxiously quite well what is it mr harcourts respects my lord and we are off the dragons mouth the wind is fair at nornoreast and we can make the passage as soon as day breaks in half an hour my lord well drop anchor in port of spain by two bells in the forenoon watch my lord thank you mr gerard the words came slowly and coldly as he forced himself to utter them my compliments to mr harcourt and that will do very well aye aye my lord this will be the first appearance of your flag in port of spain and a salute will be fired very well the governor by virtue of his appointment takes precedence of you my lord your lordship must therefore pay the first call shall i make a signal to that effect thank you mr gerard i would be obliged if you would the horror still had to be gone through and endured he had to make himself spick and span he could not appear on deck unshaven and dirty and untidy he had to shave and endure giless conversation fresh water my lord said giles bringing in a steaming can capns given permission seeing that well be watering today there might once have been sheer sensuous pleasure in shaving in fresh water but now there was none there might have been pleasure in standing on deck watching crab make the passage of the dragons mouth in looking about him at new lands in entering a new port but now there was none there might have been pleasure once in fresh linen even in a crisp new neckcloth even in his ribbon and star and goldhilted sword there might have been pleasure in hearing the thirteen guns of his salute fired and answered but there was none now there was only the agony of knowing that never again would a salute be fired for him never again would the whole ship stand at attention for him as he went over the side he had to hold himself stiff and straight so as not to droop like a weakling in his misery he even had to blink hard to keep the tears from overflowing down his cheeks as if he were a sentimental frenchman the blazing blue sky overhead might have been black for all he knew the governor was a ponderous majorgeneral with a red ribbon and a star too he went rigidly through the formalities of the reception and then unbent as soon as they were alone together delighted to have this visit from you my lord he said please sit down i think you will find that chair comfortable i have some sherry which i think you will find tolerable may i pour your lordship a glass he did not wait for an answer but busied himself with the decanter and glasses by the way my lord have you heard the news boneys dead hornblower had not sat down he had intended to refuse the sherry the governor would not care to drink with a man who had lost his honour now he sat down with a jerk and automatically took the glass offered him the sound he made in reply to the governors news was only a croak yes went on the governor he died three weeks back in st helena theyve buried him there and thats the last of him well are you quite well my lord quite well thank you said hornblower the cool twilit room was swimming round him as he came back to sanity he thought of st elizabeth of hungary she disobeying her husbands commands had been carrying food to the poor an apron full of bread when her husband saw her what have you in your apron he demanded roses lied st elizabeth show me said her husband st elizabeth showed him and her apron was full of roses life could begin anew thought hornblower the star of the south here where the trade winds blew at their freshest just within the tropics in the wide unbroken atlantic was as hornblower decided at that moment the finest stretch of water for a yachting excursion to be found anywhere on the globe this was nothing more than a yachting excursion to his mind only recently he had emerged from a profound spiritual experience during which the peace of the whole world had depended on his judgement by comparison it seemed now as if the responsibilities of being commanderinchief on the west indian station were mere nothings he stood on the quarterdeck of his britannic majestys frigate clorinda balancing easily as she reached to windward under moderate sail and allowed the morning sunshine to stream down on him and the trade wind to blow round his ears with the pitch and the roll as clorinda shouldered against the sea the shadows of the weather rigging swooped back and forth over the deck when she took a roll to windward towards the nearly level morning sun the shadows of the ratlines of the mizzen shrouds flicked across his eyes in rapid succession hypnotically adding to his feeling of wellbeing to be a commanderinchief with nothing more to worry about than the suppression of the slave trade the hunting down of piracy and the policing of the caribbean was an experience more pleasant than any emperor or even any poet could ever know the barelegged seamen washing down the decks were laughing and joking the level sun was calling up dazzling rainbows in the spray flung up by the weather bow and he could have breakfast at any moment that he wanted it standing here on the quarterdeck he was finding additional pleasure in anticipation and wantonly postponing that moment the appearance of captain sir thomas fell on the quarterdeck took something away from the feeling of wellbeing sir thomas was a gloomy lanternjawed individual who would feel it his bounden duty to come and be polite to his admiral and who would never have the sensitivity to be aware when his presence was undesired good morning my lord said the captain touching his hat good morning sir thomas replied hornblower returning the salute a fine fresh morning my lord yes indeed sir thomas was looking over his ship with a captains eye along the decks up aloft and then turning aft to observe where right astern a smudgy line on the horizon marked the position of the hills of puerto rico hornblower suddenly realised that he wanted his breakfast more than anything on earth and simultaneously he realised that he now could not gratify that desire as instantaneously as a commanderinchief should be able to there were limitations of politeness that constrained even a commanderinchief or that constrained him at least he could not turn away and go below without exchanging a few more sentences with fell maybe well catch something today my lord said fell instinctively with the words the eyes of both men turned aloft to where a lookout sat perched up at the dizzy height of the main topgallant masthead lets hope we do said hornblower and because he had never succeeded in liking fell and because the last thing he wanted to do was to enter into a technical discussion before breakfast he blundered on so as to conceal these feelings its likely enough the spaniards will want to run every cargo they can before the conventions signed said fell so we decided agreed hornblower rehashing old decisions before breakfast was not to his taste but it was typical of fell to do that and this is the landfall theyd make went on fell remorselessly glancing astern again at puerto rico on the horizon yes said hornblower another minute or two of this pointless conversation and he would be free to escape below fell took the speakingtrumpet and directed it upwards masthead there keep a good lookout or ill know the reason why aye aye sir came the reply head money my lord said fell in apologetic explanation we all find it useful answered hornblower politely head money was paid by the british government for slaves freed on the high seas to the royal naval ships concerned in the capture of the slaves and divided among the ships company like any other prize money it was a small fund compared with the gigantic sums acquired during the great wars but at five pounds a head a big capture could bring in a substantial sum to the ship making the capture and of that substantial sum onequarter went to the captain on the other hand oneeighth went to the admiral commanding wherever he happened to be hornblower with twenty ships at sea under his command was entitled to oneeighth of all their head money it was a system of division which explained how during the great wars the admirals commanding the channel fleet or in the mediterranean became millionaires like lord keith no one could find it more useful than i my lord said fell maybe said hornblower hornblower knew vaguely that fell was in difficulties about money he had had many years of half pay since waterloo and even now as captain of a fifthrate his pay and allowances were less than twenty pounds a month lucky though he was in peacetime to have command even of a fifthrate he had had experience himself of being a poor captain of wearing cotton stockings instead of silk and brass epaulettes instead of gold but he had no desire whatever to discuss the tables of personal pay before breakfast lady fell my lord went on fell persistently has a position to maintain in the world she was an extravagant woman so hornblower had heard lets hope we have some luck today then said hornblower still thinking about breakfast it was a melodramatic coincidence that at that very moment a hail came down from the masthead sail ho sail right to windard perhaps thats what were waiting for sir thomas said hornblower as likely as not my lord masthead there hows the sail heading mr sefton bring the ship to the wind hornblower backed away to the weatherrail he felt he could never grow used to his situation as admiral and having to stand by and be no more than an interested spectator while the ship he was in was being handled at decisive moments it was quite painful to be a spectator but it would be more painful still to go below and remain in ignorance of what was going on and much more painful than to postpone breakfast again deck there shes a twomaster heading straight down for us all sail to the royals captain sir shes a schooner a big schooner sir still running down for us young gerard the flaglieutenant had come running on deck at the first hail from the masthead to his place beside his admiral a topsl schooner he said a big one she could be what were looking for my lord plenty of other things she could be said hornblower doing his best to conceal his absurd excitement gerard had his telescope pointing to windward there she is coming down fast right enough look at the rake of those masts look at the cut of those topsls my lord shes no island schooner it would not be a very remarkable coincidence if she should be a slaver he had brought clorinda here to the windward of san juan in the full expectation that slave cargoes would be hurrying here spain was meditating joining in the suppression of the slave trade and every slaver would be tempted to run cargoes and take advantage of enhanced prices before the prohibition should take effect the main slave market for the spanish colonies was at havana a thousand miles to leeward but it could be looked upon as certain that spanish slavers making their passage from the slave coast would touch first at puerto rico to refill with water if not to dispose of part of their cargo it had only been logical to station clorinda to intercept them hornblower took the telescope and trained it on the fastnearing schooner he saw what gerard had spoken about hull up now he could see how heavily sparred she was and how built for speed with those fine lines it would only pay for her to carry highly perishable cargo human cargo as he looked he saw the rectangles of her square sails narrow vertically the small distance between her masts widened greatly she was wheeling away from the waiting clorinda a final proof if any was needed that she was what she appeared to be laying herself on the starboard tack she proceeded to keep at a safe distance and to increase that distance as fast as possible mr sefton shouted fell fill the main topsl after her on the starboard tack set the royals in an orderly and disciplined rush some of the hands hurried to the braces while others scurried aloft to set more sail it was only a matter of moments before clorinda as closehauled as she would lie was thrashing to windward in pursuit with everything braced up sharp and carrying every inch of sail that the brisk trade wind would allow she lay steeply over plunging through the sea each wave in turn bursting on her weather bow with the spray flying aft in sheets and the taut weatherrigging shrieking in the wind it was a remarkable transition from the quiet that had reigned not so long ago hoist the colours ordered fell lets see what she says she is through the telescope hornblower watched the schooner hoist her colours in reply the red and yellow of spain you see my lord asked fell pardon capn interposed sefton the officer of the watch i know who she is i saw her twice last commission shes the estrella the australia exclaimed fell mishearing seftons spanish pronunciation the estrella sir the estrella del sur the star of the south sir i know about her then said hornblower her captains gomez runs four hundred slaves every passage if he doesnt lose too many four hundred repeated fell hornblower saw a momentary calculating look pass over fells face five pounds a head meant two thousand pounds a quarter of that was five hundred pounds two years pay at one swoop fell darted glances aloft and overside keep your luff there he shouted at the helmsman mr sefton hands to the bowlines there forrard shes weathering on us said gerard the glass to his eye it was really only to be expected that a welldesigned schooner would work to windward more efficiently than even the best of squarerigged frigates shes forereaching on us too said hornblower gauging the distances and angles she was not only lying closer to the wind but travelling faster through the water very little faster it was true a knot or perhaps two knots but enough to render her safe from clorindas pursuit ill have her yet said fell mr sefton call all hands run out the guns on the weather side mr james find mr noakes tell him to start the water hands to the pumps mr sefton pump her dry hands came pouring up through the hatchways with the gunports opened the guns crews flung their weight on the gun tackles inch by inch dragging the guns on the weather side up the steep slope presented by the heeling deck the rumble of the wooden wheels over the seams of the planking made a stirring sound it had been the preliminary of many a desperate fight in the old days now the guns were merely being run out in order to keep the ship on a slightly more even keel giving her a better grip on the water and minimising leeway hornblower watched the pumps being manned the hands threw their weight on the handles with a will the rapid clankclank proving how hard they were at work pumping overside the twenty tons of drinking water which might be thought of as the lifeblood of a cruising ship but the slight reduction of draught that would result might combined with the running out of the weather guns add a few yards to her speed the call for all hands had brought mr erasmus spendlove on deck hornblowers secretary he looked round him at the organised confusion on deck with that air of olympian superiority which always delighted hornblower spendlove cultivated a pose of unruffled calm that exasperated some and amused others yet he was a most efficient secretary and hornblower had never once regretted acting on the recommendation of lord exmouth and appointing him to his position you see the vulgar herd all hard at work mr spendlove said hornblower truly they appear to be my lord he looked to windward at the estrella i trust their labours will not be in vain fell came bustling by still looking up at the rigging and overside at the estrella mr sefton call the carpenter ill have the wedges of the mainmast knocked loose more play there may give us more speed hornblower caught a change of expression on spendloves face and their eyes met spendlove was a profound student of the theory of ship design and hornblower was a man with a lifetime of experience and the glance they exchanged brief as it was was enough for each to know that the other thought the new plan unwise hornblower watched the main shrouds on the weather side taking the additional strain it was as well that clorinda was newly refitted cant say were doing any better my lord said gerard from behind his telescope the estrella was perceptibly farther ahead and more to windward if she wished she would run clorinda practically out of sight by noon hornblower observed an odd expression on spendloves face he was testing the air with his nose sniffing curiously at the wind as it blew past him it occurred to hornblower that once or twice he had been aware without drawing any conclusions from the phenomenon that the clean trade wind had momentarily been tainted with a hint of a horrible stench he himself tried the air again and caught another musky whiff he knew what it was twenty years ago he had smelt the same stench when a spanish galley crowded with galley slaves had passed to windward the trade wind blowing straight from the estrella to the clorinda was bearing with it the reek from the crowded slave ship tainting the air over the clean blue sea far to leeward of her we can be sure shes carrying a full cargo he said fell was still endeavouring to improve clorindas sailing qualities mr sefton set the hands to work carrying shot up to windard shes altering course half a dozen voices made the announcement at the same moment belay that order mr sefton fells telescope like all the others was trained on the estrella she had put her helm up a little and was boldly turning to cross clorindas bows damned insolence exclaimed fell everyone watched anxiously as the two ships proceeded headlong on converging courses shell pass us out of range decided gerard the certainty became more apparent with every second of delay hands to the braces roared fell quartermaster starboard your helm handsomely handsomely steady as you go two points off the wind said hornblower we stand more chance now clorindas bows were now pointed to intercept the estrella at a far distant point several miles ahead moreover lying a little off the wind as both ships now were it seemed probable that estrellas foreandaft rig and fine lines might not convey so great an advantage take a bearing gerard ordered hornblower gerard went to the binnacle and read the bearing carefully my impression said spendlove gazing over the blue blue water is that shes still forereaching on us if thats the case said hornblower then all we can hope for is that she carries something away we can at least hope for it my lord said spendlove the glance he directed upwards was indicative of his fear that it would be the clorinda whose gear would give way clorinda now had wind and sea very nearly abeam she was lying over very steeply under every inch of canvas she could carry and lifting unwillingly to the seas which came rolling in upon her swirling in through her open gunports hornblower realised that he had not a dry stitch of clothing on him and probably no one else on board had either my lord said gerard youve had no breakfast as yet hornblower tried to conceal the discomfiture he felt at this reminder he had forgotten all about breakfast despite the cheerful anticipation with which he had once been looking forward to it quite right mr gerard he said jocular but only clumsily so thanks to being taken by surprise and what of it its my duty to remind you my lord said gerard her ladyship her ladyship told you to see that i took my meals regularly replied hornblower i am aware of that but her ladyship owing to her inexperience made no allowance for encounters with fastsailing slavers just at mealtimes but cant i persuade you my lord the thought of breakfast now that it had been reimplanted in his mind was more attractive than ever but it was hard to go below with a pursuit being so hotly conducted take that bearing again before i decide he temporised gerard walked to the binnacle again bearings opening steadily my lord he reported she must be drawing ahead fast clearly so said spendlove telescope trained out towards the estrella and it looks it looks as if shes hauling in on her sheets maybe hornblower had whipped his telescope to his eye on the instant shes gibing over he pronounced see how she comes round by george estrella must have a bold captain and a welltrained crew they had hauled in on her sheets and had stood ready at her topsail braces then with the helm hard over she had spun round on her heel her whole beautiful profile was now presented to hornblowers telescope she was headed to cross clorindas bows from starboard to port and not too far ahead either damned insolence said hornblower but full of admiration for the daring and skill displayed fell was standing close by staring at the impertinent schooner he was rigid even though the wind was flapping his coattails round him for a few seconds it seemed as if the two vessels were heading towards a common point where they must meet but the impression soon passed even without taking a compass bearing it became apparent that estrella must pass comfortably ahead of the frigate run the guns in bellowed fell stand by to wear ship clear away the bow chasers there it might be just possible that the schooner would pass within range of the bow chasers but to take a shot at her at long range and on that heaving sea would be a chancy business should they score a hit it might as likely take effect in the hull among the wretched slaves as on the spars or rigging hornblower was prepared to restrain fell from firing the guns were run in and after another minutes examination of the situation fell ordered the helm to be put astarboard and the ship laid right before the wind hornblower through his telescope could see the schooner lying right over with the wind abeam so far over that she as she heaved presented a streak of copper to his view pinkish against the blue of the sea clearly she was drawing across the frigates bows as fell tacitly acknowledged when he ordered a further turn of two points to port thanks to her two knots superiority in speed and thanks also to her superior handiness and weatherliness the estrella was literally making a circle round the clorinda shes built for speed my lord said spendlove from behind his telescope so was clorinda but with a difference clorinda was a fighting ship built to carry seventy tons of artillery with forty tons of powder and shot in her magazines it was no shame to her that she should be outsailed and outmanoeuvred by such a vessel as the estrella i fancy shell make for san juan sir thomas said hornblower fells face bore an expression of helpless fury as he turned to his admiral it was with an obvious effort that he restrained himself from pouring out his rage presumably in a torrent of blasphemy its its he spluttered its enough to madden a saint said hornblower clorinda had been ideally stationed twenty miles to windward of san juan estrella had run practically into her arms so to speak and had yet dodged neatly round her and had won for herself a clear run to the port ill see him damned my lord said fell quartermaster there was now the long run ahead to san juan one point off the wind in what was practically a race with an even start fell laid a course for san juan it was obvious that estrella comfortably out of range on the starboard beam was heading for the same point both ships had the wind practically abeam this long run would be a final test of the sailing qualities of the two ships as though they were a couple of yachts completing a triangular course in a race in the solent hornblower reminded himself that earlier this morning he had compared the present voyage with a yachting excursion but the expression in fells face showed that his flagcaptain by no means looked on it in the same light fell was in the deadliest earnest and not from any philanthropic feelings about slavery either it was the head money he wanted about that breakfast my lord said gerard an officer was touching his hat to fell with the request that it might be considered noon make it so said fell the welcome cry of up spirits rang through the ship breakfast my lord asked gerard again lets wait and see how we do on this course said hornblower he saw something of dismay in gerards face and laughed its a question of your breakfast i fancy as well as mine youve had nothing this morning no my lord i starve my young men i see said hornblower looking from gerard to spendlove but the latters expression was peculiarly unchanging and hornblower remembered all he knew about him ill wager a guinea that spendlove hasnt spent the morning fasting the suggestion was answered by a wide grin i am no sailor my lord said spendlove but i have learned one thing while i have been at sea and that is to snatch at any meal that makes its appearance fairy gold vanishes no faster than the opportunity of eating food at sea so while your admiral has been starving you have been walking this deck with a full belly shame on you i feel that shame as deeply as the situation merits my lord spendlove obviously had all the tact that an admirals secretary needed to have hands to the mainbrace bellowed fell clorinda was hurtling along over the blue sea with the wind abeam it was her best point of sailing and fell was doing all he could to get the very best out of her hornblower looked over at estrella i fancy were falling behind he said i think so too my lord said gerard after a glance in the same direction he walked over and took a bearing and fell glared at him with irritation before turning to hornblower i hope you will agree my lord he said that clorinda has done all a ship can do certainly sir thomas said hornblower fell real meant to say that no fault could be found with his handling the ship and hornblower while convinced that he himself could have handled her better had no doubt that in any case estrella would have evaded capture that schooner sails like a witch said fell look at her now my lord estrellas lovely lines and magnificent sail plan were obvious even at this distance shes a beautiful vessel agreed hornblower shes headreaching on us for sure announced gerard from the binnacle and i think shes weathering on us too and there goes five hundred pounds said fell bitterly assuredly he was in need of money quartermaster bear up a point hands to the braces he brought clorinda a little closer to the wind and studied her behaviour before turning back to hornblower ill not give up the chase until im compelled my lord he said quite right agreed hornblower there was something of resignation something of despair in fells expression it was not only the thought of the lost money that troubled him hornblower realised the report that fell had tried to capture the estrella and had failed almost ludicrously would reach their lordships of the admiralty of course even if hornblowers own report minimised the failure it would still be a failure that meant that fell would never be employed again after his present two years appointment had expired for every captain with a command in the royal navy now there were twenty at least hungry for commands the slightest lapse would be seized upon as reason for ending a mans career it could not be otherwise fell was now looking forward apprehensively to spending the rest of his life on half pay and lady fell was an expensive and ambitious woman no wonder that fells usually red cheeks had a grey tinge the slight alteration of course fell had ordered was really a final admission of defeat clorinda was retaining her windward position only at the cost of seeing estrella draw more rapidly ahead but i fear shell beat us easily into san juan went on fell with admirable stoicism right ahead the purple smear on the horizon that marked the hills of puerto rico was growing loftier and more defined what orders have you for me in that case my lord what water have you left on board asked hornblower in return five tons my lord say six days at short allowance six days repeated hornblower mostly to himself it was a tiresome complication the nearest british territory was a hundred miles to windward i had to try the effect of lightening the ship my lord said fell selfexculpatory i know i know hornblower always felt testy when someone tried to excuse himself well well follow estrella in if we dont catch her first it will be an official visit my lord asked gerard quickly it can hardly be anything else with my flag flying said hornblower he took no pleasure in official visits we may as well kill two birds with one stone its time i called on the spanish authorities and we can fill up with water at the same time aye aye my lord a visit of ceremony in a foreign port meant many calls on the activity of his staff but not as many as on him he told himself with irritation ill have my breakfast before anything else comes to postpone it he said the perfect good humour of the morning had quite evaporated now he would be in a bad temper now if he allowed himself to indulge in the weaknesses of humanity when he came on deck again the failure to intercept estrella was painfully obvious the schooner was a full three miles ahead and had weathered upon clorinda until the latter lay almost in her wake the coast of puerto rico was very well defined now estrella was entering into territorial waters and was perfectly safe all hands were hard at work in every part of the ship bringing everything into that condition of perfection really no more perfect than invariably prevailed which a british ship must display when entering a foreign port and submitting herself to the jealous inspection of strangers the deck had been brought to a whiteness quite dazzling in the tropical sun the metalwork was equally dazzling painful when the eye received a direct reflection gleaming cutlasses and pikes were ranged in decorative patterns on the bulkhead aft white cotton lines were being rove everywhere with elaborate turks heads very good sir thomas said hornblower approvingly authority in san juan is represented by a captaingeneral my lord said spendlove yes i shall have to call upon him agreed hornblower sir thomas i shall be obliged if you will accompany me aye aye my lord ribbons and stars i fear sir thomas aye aye my lord fell had received his knighthood of the bath after a desperate frigate action back in it had been a tribute to his courage if not to his professional abilities schooners taking a pilot on board hailed the masthead lookout very well our turn shortly said hornblower time to array ourselves for our hosts they will be grateful i hope that our arrival will take place after the hour of the siesta it was also the hour when the sea breeze was beginning to blow the pilot they took on a big handsome quadroon took the ship in without a moments difficulty although naturally fell stood beside him consumed with anxiety hornblower free from any such responsibility was able to go forward to the gangway and examine the approaches to the city it was a time of peace but spain had been an enemy before and might perhaps be an enemy again and at least nothing would be lost if he knew as much as possible about the defences firsthand it did not take very long to perceive why san juan had never been attacked not to speak of captured by the numerous enemies of spain during the long life of the city it was ringed by a lofty wall of stout masonry with ditches and bastions moats and drawbridges on the lofty bluff overlooking the entrance morro castle covered the approaches with artillery there was another fortress which must be san cristobal and battery succeeded battery along the waterfront with heavy guns visible in the embrasures nothing less than a formal siege with powerful army and a battering train could make any impression on san juan as long as it was defended by an adequate garrison the sea breeze brought them up the entrance passage there was the usual momentary anxiety about whether the spaniards were prepared to salute his flag but the anxiety was speedily allayed as the guns in the morro began to bang out their reply hornblower held himself stiffly to attention as the ship glided in the forecastle saluting carronade firing at admirably regular intervals the hands took in the canvas with a rapidity that did them credit hornblower was watching unobtrusively from under the brim of his cocked hat and then clorinda roundedto and the anchor cable rumbled through the hawsehole a deeply sunburned officer in a fine uniform came up the side and announced himself in passable english as the port medical officer and received fells declaration that clorinda had experienced no infectious disease during the past twentyone days now that they were in the harbour where the sea breeze circulated with difficulty and the ship was stationary they were aware of the crushing heat hornblower felt instantly the sweat trickling down inside his shirt under his heavy uniform coat and he turned his head uncomfortably from side to side feeling the constriction of his starched neckcloth a brief gesture from gerard beside him pointed out what he had already observed the estrella del sur in her gleaming white paint lying at the pier close beside them it seemed as if the reek of her still reached his nostrils from her open hatchways a file of soldiers in blue coats with white crossbelts was drawn up on the pier standing somewhat negligently under command of a sergeant from within the hold of the schooner came a most lamentable noise prolonged and doleful wailings as they watched they saw a string of naked negroes come climbing with difficulty up through the hatchway they could hardly walk in fact some of them could not walk at all but fell to their hands and knees and crawled in that fashion over the deck and on to the pier theyre landing their cargo said gerard some of it at least replied hornblower in nearly a year of study he had learned much about the slave trade the demand for slaves here in puerto rico was small compared with that at havana during the middle passage the slaves he saw had been confined on the slave decks packed tight spoon fashion lying on their sides with their knees bent up into the bend of the knees of the next man it was only to be expected that the captain of the estrella would take this opportunity of giving his perishable cargo a thorough airing a hail from overside distracted them a boat with the spanish flag at the bow was approaching sitting in the sternsheets was an officer in a brilliant goldlaced uniform that reflected back the setting sun here comes authority said hornblower the side was manned and the officer came aboard to the trilling of the pipes of the bosuns mates very correctly raising his hand in salute hornblower walked over to join fell in receiving him he spoke in spanish and hornblower was aware that fell had none of that language major mendezcastillo the officer announced himself first and principal aidedecamp to his excellency the captaingeneral of puerto rico he was tall and slender with a thin moustache that might have been put on with grease paint he looked cautiously without committing himself at the two officers in their red ribbons and stars and glittering epaulettes who were receiving him welcome major said hornblower i am rear admiral lord hornblower commanderinchief of his britannic majestys ships and vessels in west indian waters may i present captain sir thomas fell commanding his britannic majestys ship clorinda mendezcastillo bowed to each of them his relief at knowing which was which faintly apparent welcome to puerto rico your excellency he said we had of course heard that the famous lord hornblower was now commanderinchief here and we had long hoped for the honour of a visit from him many thanks said hornblower and welcome to you and to your ship captain added mendezcastillo hastily nervous in case it should be too apparent that he had been so engrossed in his meeting with the fabulous hornblower that he had paid insufficient attention to a mere captain fell bowed awkwardly in reply interpretation was unnecessary i am instructed by his excellency went on mendezcastillo to enquire if there is any way in which his excellency can be of service to your excellency on the notable occasion of this visit in spanish the phrasing of the pompous sentence was even more difficult than in english and as mendezcastillo spoke his glance wavered momentarily towards the estrella obviously all the details of the clorindas attempted interception were already known much of the unavailing pursuit must have been visible from the morro something in the majors attitude conveyed the impression that the subject of the estrella was not open to discussion we intend to make only a brief stay major captain fell is anxious to renew the water supply of his ship said hornblower and mendezcastillos expression softened at once of course he said hastily nothing could be easier i will give instructions to the captain of the port to afford captain fell every facility you are too kind major said hornblower bows were exchanged again fell joining in although unaware of what had been said his excellency has also instructed me said mendezcastillo that he hopes for the honour of a visit from your excellency i had hoped that his excellency would be kind enough to invite me his excellency will be charmed to hear it perhaps your excellency would be kind enough to visit his excellency this evening his excellency would be charmed to receive your excellency at eight oclock along with the members of your excellencys staff at la fortaleza the palace of santa catalina his excellency is too good we shall be delighted naturally i shall inform his excellency perhaps your excellency would find it convenient if i were to come on board at that time to escort your excellency and your excellencys party we shall be most grateful major the major took his leave after a final reference to the captain of the port and the watering of the ship hornblower explained briefly to fell aye aye my lord here came another visitor up the port side of the ship a squat heavilybuilt man in dazzling white linen wearing a broadbrimmed hat which he took off with scrupulous politeness as he reached the quarterdeck hornblower watched him address himself to the midshipman of the watch and saw the latter hesitate and look round him while trying to make up his mind as to whether he should grant the request very well midshipman said hornblower what does the gentleman want he could guess very easily what the gentleman wanted this might be an opportunity of making contact with the shore other than through official channels something always desirable and peculiarly so at this moment the visitor came forward a pair of bright quizzical blue eyes studied hornblower closely as he did so my lord he said he at least could recognise an admirals uniform when he saw it yes i am admiral lord hornblower i fear to trouble you with my business my lord he spoke english like an englishman like a tynesider perhaps but obviously as if he had not spoken it for years what is it i came on board to address myself to your steward my lord and to the president of the wardroom mess and to the purser the principal ship chandler of the port beef cattle my lord chickens eggs fresh bread fruits vegetables what is your name eduardo stuart edward stuart my lord second mate of the brig columbine out of london captured back in my lord and brought in here as a prisoner i made friends here and when the dons changed sides in i set up as ship chandler and here ive been ever since hornblower studied the speaker as keenly as the speaker was studying him he could guess at much of what was left unsaid he could guess at a fortunate marriage and probably at a change of religion unless stuart had been born a catholic as was possible enough and i am at your service my lord went on stuart meeting his gaze without flinching in a moment ill let you speak to the purser said hornblower but tell me first what impression has our arrival made here stuarts face crinkled into a grin the whole town was out watching your chase of the estrella del sur my lord i guessed as much they all rejoiced when they saw her escape you and then when they saw you coming in they manned the batteries indeed the royal navys reputation for prompt action both daring and highhanded must still be very much alive if there could be even a momentary fear that a single frigate would attempt to snatch a prize from out of the shelter of a port as well guarded as san juan in ten minutes your name was being spoken in all the streets my lord hornblowers keen glance reassured him that he was not being paid an idle compliment and what is the estrella going to do now she has only come in to land a few sickly slaves and renew with water my lord its a poor market for slaves here she sails for havana at once as soon as she can be sure of your movements my lord at once shell sail with the land breeze at dawn tomorrow my lord unless you are lying outside the port i dont expect i shall be said hornblower then shell sail without a doubt my lord shell want to get her cargo landed and sold in havana before spain signs the convention i understand said hornblower now what was this here were the old symptoms as recognisable as ever the quickened heartbeat the feeling of warmth under the skin the general restlessness there was something just below the horizon of his mind some stirring of an idea and within a second the idea was up over the horizon vague at present like a hazy landfall but as certain and as reassuring as any landfall and beyond still over the horizon were other ideas only to be guessed at he could not help glancing over at the estrella sizing up the tactical situation seeking further inspiration there testing what he already had in mind it was all he could do to thank stuart politely for his information without betraying the excitement he felt and without terminating the interview with suspicious abruptness a word to fell made certain that stuart would receive the business of supplying the clorinda and hornblower waved away stuarts thanks hornblower turned away with as great an appearance of nonchalance as he could manage there was plenty of bustle over there by the estrella just as there was round the clorinda with preparations being made for filling the water casks it was hard to think in the heat and the noise it was hard to face the cluttered deck and darkness was approaching and then would come eight oclock when he would be making his call upon the captaingeneral and obviously everything must be thought out before that and there were complications successive ideas were arising one out of another like chinese boxes and each one in turn had to be examined for flaws the sun was down into the hills leaving a flaming sky behind when he came to his final resolution spendlove he snapped excitement made him curt come below with me down in the big stern cabin it was oppressively hot the red sky was reflected in the water of the harbour shining up through the stern windows the magnificent effect was dissipated with the lighting of the lamps hornblower threw himself into his chair spendlove stood looking at him keenly as hornblower was well aware spendlove could be in no doubt that his temperamental commanderinchief had much on his mind yet even spendlove was surprised at the scheme that was sketched out to him and at the orders he received he even ventured to protest my lord he said carry out your orders mr spendlove not another word aye aye my lord spendlove left the cabin with hornblower sitting there alone waiting the minutes passed slowly precious minutes there were few to spare before the knock came on the door that he expected it was fell entering with every appearance of nervousness my lord have you a few minutes to spare always a pleasure to receive you sir thomas but this is unusual i fear my lord i have a suggestion to make an unusual suggestion suggestions are always welcome too sir thomas please sit down and tell me we have an hour at least before we go ashore i am most interested fell sat bolt upright in his chair his hands clutching the arms he swallowed twice it gave hornblower no pleasure to see a man who had faced steel and lead and imminent death apprehensive before him it made him uncomfortable my lord began fell and swallowed again you have all my attention sir thomas said hornblower gently it has occurred to me said fell growing more fluent with each word until at last he spoke in a rush that we still might have a chance at the estrella really sir thomas nothing could give me greater pleasure if it were possible i would like to hear what you suggest well my lord shell sail tomorrow most likely at dawn with the land breeze tonight we might we might fix some kind of drogue to her bottom perhaps to her rudder shes no more than a knot or two faster than we are we could follow her out and catch her at sea this is brilliant sir thomas really ingenious but nothing more than could be expected of a seaman of your reputation let me add you are too kind my lord there was a struggle only too perceptible in fells expression and he hesitated before he went on at last it was your secretary spendlove who put the idea in my mind my lord spendlove i can hardly believe it he was too timid to make the suggestion to you my lord and so he came to me with it im sure he did no more than set the wheels of your thought turning sir thomas in any case since you have assumed the responsibility the credit must be yours of course if credit is to be awarded let us hope there will be a great deal thank you my lord now about this drogue what do you suggest sir thomas it need be no more than a large sea anchor a bolt of no canvas sewn into a funnel one end larger than the other it would have to be reinforced even so not even no canvas could stand the strain with estrella going at twelve knots yes my lord i was sure of that boltropes sewn in in plenty that would be easy enough of course we have a spare bobstay chain on board that could be sewn round the mouth of the drogue and could be attached to the estrella to take the main strain yes my lord that was what i thought it would serve to keep the drogue under water out of sight as well yes my lord fell found hornblowers quickness in grasping the technical points vastly encouraging his nervousness was now replaced by enthusiasm and where would you propose to attach this drogue sir thomas i was thinking spendlove suggested my lord that it might be passed over one of the lower pintles of the rudder it would be likely to tear the rudder clean away when exerting its full force that would serve our purpose equally well my lord of course i understand fell walked across the cabin to where the great cabin window stood open wide you cant see her from here as we lie now my lord he said but you can hear her and smell her said hornblower standing beside him yes my lord theyre hosing her out at present but you can hear her as i said over the water came very plainly to them along with the miasma of her stench the continued wailing of the wretched slaves hornblower fancied he could even hear the clanking of the leg irons sir thomas said hornblower i think it would be very desirable if you would put a boat overside to row guard round the ship tonight row guard my lord fell was not very quick in the uptake in the peacetime navy it was unnecessary to take elaborate precautions against desertion oh yes most certainly half these men would be overside swimming for the shore as soon as night falls surely you understand that sir thomas we must restrain their passion to desert from this brutal service and in any case a guardboat will prevent the sale of liquor through the gunports er yes i suppose so my lord but fell clearly had not grasped the implications of the suggestion and hornblower had to elaborate let us set a boatrowing guard now before nightfall i can explain to the authorities why it is necessary then when the time comes well have a boat ready in the water enlightenment had broken in on fell at last attracting no attention supplemented hornblower of course the red sunset showed fells face lit up with animation it would be best if you gave that order soon sir thomas but meanwhile theres little time to spare we must have this drogue in the making before we go ashore shall i give the orders my lord spendlove has figures at his fingertips he can work out the measurements would you be kind enough to send for him sir thomas the cabin was soon crowded with people as the work was put in hand spendlove came first after him gerard was sent for and then sefton the firstlieutenant next came the sailmaker the armourer the carpenter and the boatswain the sailmaker was an elderly swede who had been forced into the british navy twenty years ago in some conscienceless action of the press gang and who had remained in the service ever since his wrinkled face broke into a grin like a shattered window as the beauties of the scheme dawned upon him when he was told about it he just managed to restrain himself from slapping his thigh with glee when he remembered he was in the august presence of his admiral and his captain spendlove was busy sketching out with pencil and paper a drawing of the drogue with gerard looking over his shoulder perhaps even i might make a contribution to this scheme said hornblower and everyone turned to look at him he met spendloves eye with a glassy stare that forbade spendlove to breathe a word to the effect that the whole scheme was his original idea yes my lord said fell a length of spun yarn said hornblower made fast to the tail of the drogue and led forrard and the other end secured to the chain just a single strand to keep it tail end forward while estrella gets under way then when she sets all sail and the strain comes the yarn will part said spendlove youre right my lord then the drogue will take the water and shell be ours lets hope concluded hornblower excellent my lord said fell was there perhaps a mild condescension a tiny hint of patronage in what he said hornblower felt that there was and was momentarily nettled at it already fell was quite convinced that the whole scheme was his own despite his handsome earlier admission that spendlove had contributed and he was generously allowing hornblower to add a trifling suggestion hornblower allayed his irritation with cynical amusement at the weaknesses of human nature in this stimulating atmosphere of ideas he said modestly one can hardly help but be infected yyes my lord said gerard eyeing him curiously gerard was too sharp altogether and knew him too well he had caught the echo of mockmodesty in hornblowers tone and was on the verge of guessing the truth no need for you to put your oar in mr gerard snapped hornblower do i have to recall you to your duty wheres my dinner mr gerard do i always have to starve while im under your care what will lady barbara say when she hears you allow me to go hungry i beg pardon my lord spluttered gerard entirely taken aback id quite forgotten youve been so busy my lord his embarrassment was intense he turned this way and that in the crowded cabin as if looking about him for the missing dinner no time now mr gerard said hornblower until the need for distracting gerards attention had arisen he had been equally forgetful of the need for dinner lets hope his excellency will offer us some small collation i really must beg your pardon my lord said fell equally embarrassed oh no matter sir thomas said hornblower waving the apologies aside testily you and i are in the same condition let me see that drawing mr spendlove he was continually being led into playing the part of a peppery old gentleman when he knew himself to be nothing of the sort he was able to mellow again as they went once more through the details of the construction of the drogue and he gave his approval i believe sir thomas he said that you have decided to entrust the work to mr sefton during our absence ashore fell bowed his agreement mr spendlove will remain under your orders mr sefton mr gerard will accompany sir thomas and me i dont know what you have decided sir thomas but i would suggest that you bring a lieutenant and a midshipman with you to his excellencys reception aye aye my lord mr sefton i am sure i can trust you to have this work completed by the time of our return early in the middle watch i fancy yes my lord so there it was all settled except for the dreary interval of waiting this was just like wartime standing by with a crisis looming in the near future dinner my lord suggested gerard eagerly he wanted no dinner he was weary now that all was settled and the tension easing ill call for giles if i want some he said looking round the crowded cabin he wanted to dismiss the horde of people and sought words to do so politely then ill attend to my other duties my lord said fell suddenly and surprisingly tactful very well sir thomas thank you the cabin emptied itself rapidly hornblower was able by a mere look to put an end to gerards tendency to linger then he could sink back into his chair and relax sturdily ignoring giles when he came in with another lighted lamp for the darkening cabin the ship was full of the sound of the business of watering sheaves squealing in blocks pumps clanking hoarse orders the noise was sufficiently distracting to prevent his thoughts maintaining any regular course he was in half a doze when a knock on the door preceded the arrival of a midshipman capns respects my lord and the shore boat is approaching my compliments to the captain and ill be on deck at once the shore boat was bright with a lantern hanging over the sternsheets in the midst of the darkness of the harbour it lit up mendezcastillos resplendent uniform down the side they went midshipman lieutenants captain admiral in the reversed order of naval precedence and powerful strokes of the oars carried them over the black water towards the city where a few lights gleamed they passed close by the estrella there was a light hanging in her rigging but apparently she had completed her watering for there was no activity about her nevertheless there came a continuous faint wailing from up her open hatchways perhaps the slaves there were mourning the departure of those of them who had been taken from them perhaps they were voicing their apprehension at what the future held in store for them it occurred to hornblower that these unfortunate people snatched from their homes packed into a ship whose like they had never seen before guarded by white men could have no idea at all of what lay in store for them any more than he himself would have if he were to be abducted to another planet his excellency said mendezcastillo beside him has had pleasure in deciding to receive your excellency with full ceremonial that is most kind of his excellency replied hornblower recalling himself to his present duties with an effort and expressing himself in spanish with even more effort the tiller was put over and the boat turned abruptly round a corner revealing a brightlylit jetty with a massive gateway beyond the boat ran alongside and half a dozen uniformed figures stood to attention as the party climbed on shore this way your excellency murmured mendezcastillo they passed through the gateway into a courtyard lit by scores of lanterns which shone on ranks of soldiers drawn up in two treble lines as hornblower emerged into the courtyard a shouted order brought the muskets to the present and at the same moment a band burst into music hornblowers tonedeaf ear heard the jerky braying and he halted at attention with his hand to the brim of his cocked hat his fellow officers beside him until the deafening noise echoed and multiplied by the surrounding walls came to an end a fine military appearance major said hornblower looking down the rigid lines of white crossbelts your excellency is too kind would your excellency please proceed to the door in front an imposing flight of steps lined on either side with more uniforms beyond that an open doorway and a vast room a prolonged whispered conference between mendezcastillo and an official beside the door and then their names blared out in resounding spanish hornblower had long given up hope of ever hearing his name pronounced intelligibly by a foreign tongue the central figure in the room rose from his chair which was almost a throne to receive the british commanderinchief standing he was a much younger man than hornblower had expected in his thirties dark complexioned with a thin mobile face and a humorous expression at odds with his arrogant hooked nose his uniform gleamed with gold lace with the order of the golden fleece on his breast mendezcastillo made the presentations the englishmen bowed deeply to the representative of his most catholic majesty and each received a polite inclination in return mendezcastillo ventured so far as to murmur their hosts titles probably a breach of etiquette thought hornblower for it should be assumed that visitors were fully aware of them his excellency the marques de ayora captaingeneral of his most catholic majestys dominion of puerto rico ayora smiled in welcome i know you speak spanish your excellency he said i have already had the pleasure of hearing you do so indeed your excellency i was a major of migueletes under claros at the time of the attack on rosas i had the honour of serving beside your excellency i remember your excellency well your excellency would naturally not remember me it would have been too flagrant to pretend he did and hornblower was for once at a loss for a word and could only bow again your excellency went on ayora has changed very little since that day if i may venture to say so it is eleven years ago your excellency is too kind that was one of the most useful phrases in polite language ayora had a word for fell a compliment on the appearance of his ship and a supplementary smile for the junior officers then as if it were a moment for which he had been waiting mendezcastillo turned to them perhaps you gentlemen would care to be presented to the ladies of the company he said his glance passed over hornblower and fell and took in only the lieutenants and the midshipmen hornblower translated and saw them depart a little nervously under mendezcastillos escort ayora etiquette and spanish training notwithstanding wasted no time in coming to the point the moment he found himself alone with hornblower and fell i watched your pursuit of the estrella del sur today through my telescope he said and hornblower once more found himself at a loss for a word a bow and a smile also seemed out of place in this connection he could only look blank it is an anomalous situation said ayora under the preliminary convention between our governments the british navy has the right to capture on the high seas spanish ships laden with slaves but once within spanish territorial waters those ships are safe when the new convention for the suppression of the slave trade is signed then those ships will be forfeit to his most catholic majestys government but until that time it is my duty to give them every protection in my power your excellency is perfectly correct of course said hornblower fell was looking perfectly blank not understanding a word of what was said but hornblower felt that the effort of translating was beyond him and i fully intend to carry out my duty said ayora firmly naturally said hornblower so perhaps it would be best to come to a clear understanding regarding future events there is nothing i would like better your excellency it is clearly understood then that i will tolerate no interference with the estrella del sur while she is in waters under my jurisdiction of course i understand that your excellency said hornblower the estrella wishes to sail at the first light of morning tomorrow that is what i expected your excellency and for the sake of the amity between our governments it would be best if your ship were to remain in this harbour until after she sails ayoras eyes met hornblowers in a steady stare his face was perfectly expressionless there was no hint of a threat in that glance but a threat was implied the ultimate hint of superior strength was there at ayoras command a hundred thirtytwopounders could sweep the waters of the harbour hornblower was reminded of the roman who agreed with his emperor because it was ill arguing with the master of thirty legions he adopted the same pose as far as his acting ability allowed he smiled the smile of a good loser we have had our chance and lost it your excellency he said we can hardly complain if ayora felt any relief at his acquiescence it showed no more plainly than his previous hint of force your excellency is most understanding he said naturally we are desirous of taking advantage of the land breeze to leave tomorrow morning said hornblower deferentially now that we have refilled with water for the opportunity of doing so i have to thank your excellency we would not like to trespass too far upon your excellencys hospitality hornblower did his best to maintain an appearance of innocence under ayoras searching stare perhaps we might hear what captain gomez has to say said ayora turning aside to summon someone close at hand he was a young man strikingly handsome dressed in plain but elegant blue clothes with a silverhiked sword at his side may i present said ayora don miguel gomez y gonzalez captain of the estrella del sur bows were exchanged may i felicitate you on the sailing qualities of your ship captain said hornblower many thanks seor clorinda is a fast frigate but your ship is superior at all points of sailing hornblower was not too sure about how to render that technical expression into spanish but apparently he contrived to make himself understood many thanks again seor and i could even venture hornblower spread his hands deprecatingly to congratulate her captain on the brilliance with which he managed her captain gomez bowed and hornblower suddenly checked himself these highflown spanish compliments were all very well but they could be overdone he did not want to give the impression of a man too anxious to please but he was reassured by a glance at the expression on gomezs face he was actually simpering that was the only word for it hornblower mentally classified him as a young man of great ability and well pleased with himself another compliment would not be one too many i shall suggest to my government he went on that they request permission to take off the lines of the star of the south and study the plan of her sails in order to build a similar vessel she would be ideal for the work of the navy in these waters but of course it would be hard to find a suitable captain gomez bowed once more it was hard not to be selfsatisfied when complimented by a seaman with the legendary reputation of hornblower his excellency put in ayora is desirous of leaving the harbour tomorrow morning so we understood said gomez even ayora looked a trifle disconcerted at the admission hornblower could see it plainly stuart so helpful with his information had not hesitated to help both sides as hornblower had expected he would he had gone straight to the spanish authorities with the intelligence hornblower had supplied him with but hornblower had no desire to allow a jarring note to creep into the present conversation you can understand captain he said that i would be glad to leave on the same tide and with the same land breeze that takes you out after our experiences today i fear you need be under no apprehension none at all said gomez there was something of condescension in his smile that agreement was all that hornblower wanted he was at pains to conceal his relief it will be my duty to pursue you if you are still in sight when i leave he said apologetically by his glance he made it clear that the remark was addressed to the captaingeneral as well as to gomez but it was gomez who answered i have no fear he said in that case your excellency said hornblower clinching the matter i can inform your excellency officially that his majestys ship in which my flag is being flown will leave harbour tomorrow morning as early as suits captain gomezs convenience that is understood agreed ayora i regret greatly that your excellencys visit should be so brief in the life of a sailor said hornblower duty seems invariably to interfere with inclination but at least during this brief visit i have had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of your excellency and of captain gomez there are numerous other gentlemen here also desirous of making your excellencys acquaintance said ayora may i be permitted to present them to your excellency the real business of the evening had been transacted and now it was only necessary to go through the other formalities the rest of the reception was as dreary as hornblower had expected and feared the puerto rican magnates who were led up in turn to meet him were as dull at midnight hornblower caught the eye of gerard and gathered his flock together ayora noted the gesture and gave in courteous terms the leave to depart which as his catholic majestys representative he had to give unless his guests were to be guilty of discourtesy your excellency has doubtless need to rest in readiness for your early start tomorrow he said i will not attempt to detain your excellency in consequence much as your excellencys presence here has been appreciated the goodbyes were said and mendezcastillo undertook to escort the party back to the clorinda it was something of a shock to hornblower to find that the band and the guard of honour were still in the courtyard to offer the official compliments on his departure he stood at the salute while the band played some jerky tune or other then they went down into the waiting boat the harbour was pitch dark as they rowed out into it the few lights visible doing almost nothing to alleviate the blackness they rounded the corner and passed astern of the estrella again there was a single lantern hanging in her main rigging and she was quiet by now no in the still night at one moment hornblower heard the faint rattle of legirons as some one of the slaves in her hold indicated that he was still awake and restless that was good farther along a quiet challenge came over the inky water issuing from a nucleus of darkness even more solid than the darkness surrounding it flag answered the midshipman clorinda the two brief words were all that were needed to inform the guardboat that an admiral and a captain were approaching you see major said hornblower that captain fell deemed it necessary to row guard round the ship during the night i understood that to be the case your excellency answered mendezcastillo our seamen will go to great lengths to indulge themselves in the pleasures of the shore naturally your excellency said mendezcastillo the boat ran alongside the clorinda standing awkwardly in the sternsheets hornblower said his last goodbyes and uttered his last words of thanks to the representative of his host before going up the side from the entry port he watched the boat shove off again and disappear into the darkness now he said we can make better use of our time on the maindeck just visible in the light from the lantern hanging from the mainstay was a thing that was the only way to describe it something of canvas and cordage with a length of chain attached to it sefton was standing beside it i see youve finished it mr sefton yes my lord a full hour ago the sailmaker and his mates worked admirably hornblower turned to fell i fancy sir thomas he said that you have in mind the necessary orders to give perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me about them before you issue them aye aye my lord that eternal navy answer was the only one fell could make in the circumstances even if fell had not yet given full thought to the next problems down in the cabin alone with his admiral fells unreadiness was a little apparent i suppose prompted hornblower that you will tell off the necessary personnel for the expedition which officer can you trust fully to exercise discretion little by little the details were settled powerful swimmers who could work under water an armourers mate who could be relied upon to put the final shackle in the chain in the darkness the boats crew was decided upon summoned and instructed in all the details of the plan when the guardboat came in for the relief of its crew there was another crew standing by all ready who went down overside rapidly and quietly although encumbered with the thing and the necessary gear it pushed off again into the darkness and hornblower stood on the quarterdeck to watch it go there might be an international incident arising out of this or he might be made to appear a fool in the eyes of the world which would be just as bad he strained his ears for any sounds in the darkness which would tell him how the work was progressing but he could hear nothing the land breeze had just begun to blow gently but strongly enough to swing clorinda to her anchor it would carry any sounds away from him he realised but it would also serve to obscure any suspicious noises if anyone in the estrella was awake enough to hear them she had a full counter with as was only to be expected plenty of rake a swimmer who reached her stern unobserved would be able to work at her rudder unobserved certainly my lord said gerards voice quietly beside him would not this be a suitable time to rest you are quite right mr gerard a most suitable time answered hornblower continuing to lean against the rail well then my lord i have agreed with you mr gerard surely you can be content with that but gerards voice went on remorseless as the voice of conscience there is cold beef laid out in the cabin my lord fresh bread and a bottle of bordeaux that was a different story hornblower suddenly realised how hungry he was during the past thirty hours he had eaten one meagre meal because the cold collation he had expected at the reception had failed to materialise and he could still pretend to be superior to the weaknesses of the flesh you would have made an excellent wetnurse mr gerard he said if nature had treated you more generously but i suppose my life will be unbearable until i yield to your importunity on the way to the companion they passed fell he was striding up and down the quarterdeck in the darkness and they could hear his hard breathing it pleased hornblower to know that even these muscular heroes could feel anxiety it might be polite even kind to invite fell to join them at this cold supper but hornblower dismissed the idea he had had as much of fells company already as he could bear down below spendlove was waiting in the lighted cabin the vultures are gathered together said hornblower it was amusing to see spendlove was pale and tense too i hope you gentlemen will join me the younger men were silent as they ate hornblower put his nose to his glass of wine and sipped thoughtfully six months in the tropics has done this bordeaux no good he commented it was inevitable that as host and admiral and older man his opinion should be received with deference spendlove broke the next silence that length of spun yarn my lord he said the breaking strain mr spendlove said hornblower all the discussion in the world wont change it now we shall know in good time meanwhile lets not spoil our dinner with technical discussions your pardon my lord said spendlove abashed was it by mere coincidence or through telepathy that hornblower had been thinking at that very moment about the breaking strain of that length of spun yarn in the drogue but he would not dream of admitting that he had been thinking about it the dinner continued well said hornblower raising his glass we can admit the existence of mundane affairs long enough to allow of a toast heres to head money as they drank they heard unmistakable sounds on deck and overside the guardboat had returned from its mission spendlove and gerard exchanged glances and poised themselves ready to stand up hornblower forced himself to lean back and shake his head sadly his glass still in his hand too bad about this bordeaux gentlemen he said then came the knock on the door and the expected message capns respects my lord and the boat has returned my compliments to the captain and ill be glad to see him and the lieutenant here as soon as is convenient one glance at fell as he entered the cabin was sufficient to indicate that the expedition had been successful so far at least all well my lord he said his florid face suffused with excitement excellent the lieutenant was a grizzled veteran older than hornblower and hornblower could not help but think to himself that had he not enjoyed great good fortune on several occasions he would be only a lieutenant too will you sit down gentlemen a glass of wine mr gerard order fresh glasses if you please sir thomas would you mind if i hear mr fields story from his own lips field had no fluency of speech his story had to be drawn from him by questions everything had gone well two strong swimmers their faces blackened had slipped overside from the guardboat and had swum unseen to the estrella working with their knives they had been able to prise off the copper from the second rudderbrace below the waterline with an auger they had made a space large enough to pass a line through the most ticklish part of the work had been approaching near enough in the guardboat and putting the drogue overside after it had been attached to the line but field reported that no hail had come from the estrella the chain had followed the line and had been securely shackled now the drogue hung at estrellas stern safely out of sight below the surface ready to exert its full force on her rudder when and if the spun yarn which held the drogue reversed should part excellent said hornblower again when fields last halting sentence was uttered youve done very well mr field thank you thank you my lord when field had left hornblower could address himself to fell your plan has worked out admirably sir thomas now it only remains to catch the estrella i would strongly recommend you to make all preparations for getting under way at daylight the sooner we leave after the estrella has sailed the better dont you think aye aye my lord the ships bell overhead anticipated the next question hornblower was about to ask three hours to daylight he said ill say goodnight to you gentlemen then it had been a busy day of ceaseless activity mental if not physical since dawn after a long hot evening it seemed to hornblower that his feet had swollen to twice their ordinary size and that his goldbuckled shoes had made no allowance for this expansion he could hardly pry them off he took off ribbon and star and goldlaced coat and reluctantly reminded himself that he would have to put them on again for his ceremonial departure in three hours time he sponged himself down with water from his washbasin and sank down sighing with relief on his cot in the night cabin he woke automatically when the watch was called the cabin was still quite dark and he was at a loss for a couple of seconds about why there should be this feeling of urgency within him then he remembered and was wide awake at once shouting to the sentry at the door to pass the word for giles he shaved by lamplight in feverish haste and then once more in the hated fulldress uniform he sped up the ladder to the quarterdeck it was still pitch dark no perhaps there was the slightest glimmering of daylight perhaps the sky was the smallest trifle brighter over the morro perhaps the quarterdeck was crowded with shadowy figures more even than would be found there with the ships company at stations for getting under way at sight of them he nearly turned back having no wish to reveal that he shared the same weaknesses as the rest of them but fell had caught sight of him good morning my lord morning sir thomas land breeze blowing full my lord no doubt about that hornblower could feel it breathing round him delightful after the sweltering stuffiness of the cabin in these midsummer tropics it would be of short duration it would be cut off short as soon as the sun lifting over the horizon should get to work in its brassy strength upon the land estrellas making ready for sea my lord there was no doubt about that either the sounds of it made their way over the water through the twilight i dont have to ask if you are ready sir thomas all ready my lord hands standing by at the capstan very well undoubtedly it was lighter already the figures on the quarterdeck now much more clearly defined had all moved over to the starboard side lining the rail half a dozen telescopes were being extended and pointed towards the estrella sir thomas put an end to that if you please send that crowd below theyre anxious to see i know what they want to see send them below immediately aye aye my lord everyone of course was desperately anxious to see if anything was visible at the estrellas waterline aft which might reveal what had been done at night but there could be no surer way of calling the attention of the estrellas captain to something suspicious under his stern than by pointing telescopes at it officer of the watch my lord see to it that no one points a telescope for one moment towards the estrella aye aye my lord when theres enough light to see clearly you can sweep round the harbour as you might be expected to do not more than five seconds for the estrella but make sure you see all there is to see aye aye my lord the eastern sky was now displaying faint greens and yellows against which the morro silhouetted itself magnificently though faintly but in its shadow all was still dark even before breakfast it was a romantic moment it occurred to hornblower that the presence of an admiral in full dress on the quarterdeck so early might itself be a suspicious circumstance im going below sir thomas please keep me informed aye aye my lord in the day cabin gerard and spendlove sprang to their feet as he entered presumably they had been among those driven below by fells order mr spendlove i am profiting by your admirable example of yesterday i shall make sure of my breakfast while i may would you please order breakfast mr gerard i presume you gentlemen will favour me with your company he threw himself negligently into a chair and watched the preparations half way through them a knock at the door brought in fell himself estrellas clearly in sight now my lord and theres nothing visible under her stern thank you sir thomas a cup of coffee was welcome at this time in the morning hornblower did not have to pretend eagerness to drink it daylight was creeping in through the cabin windows making the lamplight garish and unnecessary another knock brought in a midshipman capns respects my lord and estrellas casting off very well soon she would be under way and their device would be put to the test hornblower made himself bite and masticate another mouthful of toast cant you young men sit still for even a moment he snapped pour me some more coffee gerard estrellas warping out into the channel my lord reported the midshipman again very well said hornblower sipping fastidiously at his coffee and hoping that no one could guess how much his pulse rate had accelerated the minutes dragged by estrellas preparing to make sail my lord very well hornblower put down his coffee cup slowly and as slowly as he could manage it rose from his chair the eyes of the two young men never leaving him i think he said dragging out his words we might now go on deck pacing as slowly as when he had been a mourner at nelsons funeral he walked out past the sentry and up the ladder behind him the young men had to curb their impatience it was dazzling bright on deck the sun was just over the morro in the centre of the fairway at less than a cables length distance lay the estrella gleaming in her white paint as hornblowers eyes rested on her her jib extended itself upwards to catch the wind and swing her round next moment her mainsail took the wind and she steadied herself gathering way in a few seconds she was moving forward past the clorinda this was the moment fell was standing staring at her and muttering to himself he was blaspheming in his excitement estrella dipped her colours on her deck hornblower was able to recognise the figure of gomez standing directing the handling of the schooner gomez caught sight of him at the same moment and bowed holding his hat across his chest and hornblower returned the compliment shes not making two knots through the water said hornblower thank god for that said fell estrella glided on towards the entrance preparatory to making the doglegged turn out to sea gomez was handling her beautifully under her very easy sail shall i follow her now my lord i think its time sir thomas hands to the capstan there headsail sheets mr field even at two knots there would be some strain on that length of spun yarn it must not part it must not before estrella was well out to sea lusty arms and sturdy backs were heaving clorindas cable short clear away the saluting carronade there estrella had made the turn the last of her mainsail was vanishing round the corner fell was giving his orders to get clorinda under way steadily and clearly despite his excitement hornblower was watching him narrowly this was not a bad test of how he would behave in action of how he would take his ship down into the smoke and fury of a battle main topsl braces fell was bringing the big frigate round in as neat a fashion as gomez had handled estrella clorinda steadied herself and gathered way moving down the channel man the rail whatever was going on round the corner whatever was happening to the estrella out of sight the compliments must be paid ninetenths of clorindas crew on deck could be spared for the purpose with the ship creeping forward before the land breeze the other onetenth sufficed to keep her under control hornblower drew himself up and faced the spanish flag flying over the morro his hand to his hat brim fell beside him the other officers in rank behind while the salute banged out and was returned the flags dipping respectfully carry on they were approaching the turn it was possible that at any moment one of those grinning cannons up there would pitch a warning shot at them a shot warning them that a hundred other guns were ready to pound them into a wreck that would be if the drogue had begun to take obvious effect on the estrella main topsl braces came fells order again already the big atlantic rollers were making their effect felt hornblower could feel clorindas bows lift momentarily to a dying surge hard astarboard clorinda turned steadily meet her steady as you go she had hardly settled on her new course when estrella came in sight again a mile farther out to sea her bows pointed in almost the opposite direction she was still under very easy canvas thank god steadying herself for the final turn from the channel out into the ocean clorindas main topsail shivered briefly as the morro height intercepted the land breeze but drew again instantly estrella was turning again now she was hardly within cannon shot of the morro port came fells order steady the land breeze was right aft now but dying away partly with their increased distance from land and partly with the growing heat of the sun set the mainsl fell was quite right there was need to hasten lest the ship be delayed in the belt of doldrums between the land breeze and the trade wind the enormous sail area of the main course carried clorinda forward boldly and once more the sound of the ships way through the water became audible estrella was clear of the channel now hornblower watching anxiously saw her set foresail and staysails and jibs all her fore and aft canvas in fact she was holding her course northward closehauled directly away from the land she must have caught the trade wind and was making northing very sensibly because she would have to weather haiti before next morning on her course to the old bahama channel and havana they were far enough from the morro now and from estrella to incur no suspicion by staring through telescopes at her hornblower looked long and carefully he could detect nothing unusual about her appearance it suddenly occurred to him that perhaps gomez had detected the drogue under his stern and had removed it he might even now be exploding with laughter along with his officers looking back at the british frigate hopefully following them port came fells order again and clorinda took the final turn leading marks in line sir reported the master looking aft at the land with his telescope to his eye very well steady as you go now the waves they were encountering were true atlantic rollers heaving up clorindas starboard bow and passing aft as the bows dipped to heave up the port quarter estrella right ahead was still closehauled on a northerly course under fore and aft canvas shell be making six knots estimated gerard standing with spendlove a yard from hornblower that spun yarn should hold at six knots said spendlove meditatively no bottom with this line reported the leadsman in the chains all hands make sail the order was being piped through the ship topgallants and royals were being spread it was not long before clorinda had every stitch of canvas set yet the land breeze was dying fast clorinda was hardly making steerage way once twice the sails flapped like thunder but she still held her course creeping forward over the blue and white sea with the sun blazing down upon her from a blue sky with hardly a fleck of cloud cant keep her on her course sir reported the quartermaster clorinda was yawing sluggishly as the rollers came at her far ahead the estrella was almost hull down now came a breath of a different air the tiniest breath hornblower felt it nearly imperceptible on his sweating face long before clorinda made response it was a different air indeed not the heated air of the land breeze but the fresher air of the trade wind clean with its passage over three thousand miles of ocean the sails flapped and shivered clorinda swung more meaningly here it comes exclaimed fell full and by a stronger puff came so that the rudder could bite a lull another puff another lull another puff yet each puff was stronger yet the next puff did not die away it endured heeling clorinda over a roller burst against her starboard bow in a dazzling rainbow now they had caught the trade wind now they could thrust their way northwards closehauled in the trail of the estrella with the clean fresh wind blowing and the sensation of successful striving with it a new animation came over the ship there were smiles to be seen she hasnt set her topsls yet my lord said gerard his telescope still to his eye i doubt if she will while she makes her northing replied hornblower on a wind she can weather and headreach on us said spendlove just as she did yesterday yesterday was it only yesterday it could have been a month ago so much had happened since yesterdays chase do you think that drogue ought to have any effect asked fell approaching them none sir practically speaking answered spendlove not while that spun yarn keeps it tail forward fell had one huge hand clasped in the other grinding his knuckles into his palm for me said hornblower and every eye turned to him i am going to say farewell to gold lace a cooler coat and a looser neckcloth let fell display worry and nervousness he himself was going below as if he had no interest whatever in the outcome of the affair down in the hot cabin it was a relief to throw off his fulldress uniform ten pounds of broadcloth and gold and to have giles get out a clean shirt and white duck trousers ill take my bath said hornblower meditatively he knew perfectly well that fell thought it undignified and dangerous to discipline that an admiral should disport himself under the washdeck pump hosed down by grinning seamen and he neither agreed nor cared no miserable sponging down could take the place of his bath the seamen pumped vigorously and hornblower pranced with middleaged abandon under the stinging impact of the water now the clean shirt and trousers were doubly delightful he felt a new man as he came on deck again and his unconcern was not all pretence when fell nervously approached him shes running clean away from us again my lord he said we know she can sir thomas we can only wait until she puts her helm up and sets her topsls as long as we can keep her in sight said fell clorinda was lying right over fighting her way to the northward i can see that were doing all we can sir thomas said hornblower soothingly the morning was wearing on up spirits was piped and fell agreed with the sailing master that it was noon and the hands were sent to dinner now it was only when clorinda lifted to a wave that a telescope trained over the starboard bow from the quarterdeck could detect the gleam of estrellas sails over the horizon she still had no topsails set gomez was acting on the knowledge that closehauled his schooner behaved better without her square sails unless he was merely playing with his pursuers the hills of puerto rico had sunk out of sight below the horizon far far astern and the roast beef at dinner roast fresh beef had been most disappointing tough and stringy and without any taste whatever stuart said hed send me the best sirloin the island could produce my lord said gerard in answer to hornblowers expostulations i wish i had him here said hornblower id make him eat it every bit without salt sir thomas please accept my apologies er yes my lord said fell who had been invited to his admirals table and who had been recalled from his own private thoughts by hornblowers apologies that drogue having said those words that special word rather he was unable to say more he looked across the table at hornblower his lanternjawed face the brickred cheeks always looked odd in that conformation showed his anxiety which was accentuated by the look in his eyes if we dont know all about it today said hornblower well hear all about it at some later date it was the truth even though it was not the kindest thing to say well be the laughingstock of the islands said fell no one in the world could look more miserable than he did at that moment hornblower himself was inclined to give up hope but the sight of that despair roused his contrary nature theres all the difference in the world between six knots which shes making now closehauled and twelve knots which shell make when she puts up her helm he said mr spendlove here will tell you that the water resistance is a function of the square of the speed isnt that so mr spendlove perhaps a function of the cube or even one of the higher powers my lord so we can still hope sir thomas that spun yarn will have eight times the pull upon it when she alters course itll be chafing now as well my lord added spendlove if they didnt see the thing last night and cast it off said fell still gloomy when they reached the deck again the sun was inclining towards the west masthead there hailed fell is the chase still in sight yes sir hull down from here sir but plain in sight two points or thereabouts on the weather bow shes made all the northing she needs grumbled fell why doesnt she alter course there was nothing to do except wait to try and extract some pleasure from the clean wind and the blue and white sea but the pleasure was only faint now the sea did not seem so blue nothing to do except wait with the minutes dragging like hours then it happened deck there chase is altering course to port shes running right before the wind very well fell looked round at all the faces of the crowd on the quarterdeck his own was as tense as anyone elses mr sefton alter course four points to port he was going to play the game out to the bitter end even though yesterdays experience closely parallel to the present had shown that clorinda stood no chance in normal circumstances of intercepting deck there shes settin her topsls tgarnsls too sir very well well soon know now said spendlove with the drogue in action she must lose speed she must deck there capn sir the lookouts voice had risen to a scream of excitement shes flown up into the wind shes all aback fore topmasts gone sir so have her rudder pintles said hornblower grimly fell was leaping on the deck actually dancing with joy his face radiant but he recollected himself with all speed come two points to starboard he ordered mr james get aloft with you and tell me how she bears shes taking in her mainsl shouted the lookout trying to get before the wind again commented gerard capn sir this was jamess voice from the masthead youre heading a point to looard of her very well shes coming before the wind no shes all aback again sir the thing still had her by the tail then her struggles would be as unavailing as those of a deer in the claws of a lion steer small you said fell using a horrible word to the helmsman everyone was excited everyone seemed to be obsessed with the fear that estrella would clear away the wreck and make her escape after all with her rudder gone shell never be able to hold a course said hornblower and shes lost her foretopmast too another wait but of a very different nature now clorinda thrashing along seemed to have caught the excitement and to have put on a spurt as she hurled herself at her quarry racing forward to triumph there she is said gerard telescope trained forward all aback still as the next wave lifted clorinda they all caught sight of her they were approaching her fast a sorry pitiful sight she looked her foretopmast broken off clean at the cap her sails shivering in the wind clear away the bow chaser ordered fell fire a shot across her bow the shot was fired something rose to the schooners main peak and broke out into the red and gold of spain it hung there for a moment and then came slowly down again congratulations on the success of your plans sir thomas said hornblower thank you my lord answered fell he was beaming with pleasure i could have done nothing without your lordships acceptance of my suggestions that is very good of you sir thomas said hornblower turning back to look at the prize the estrella was a pitiful sight the more pitiful as they approached her and could see more clearly the raffle of wreckage dangling forward and the rudder torn loose aft the sudden tug of the drogue when it took effect using enormous force and leverage had broken or pulled straight the stout bronze pintles on which the rudder had hung suspended the drogue itself weighted by its chain still hung out of sight below the dangling rudder gomez brought triumphantly aboard had still no idea of the cause of the disaster and had not guessed at the reason for the loss of his rudder he had been young and handsome and dignified in the face of undeserved misfortune when he arrived on clorindas deck there was no pleasure in observing the change in him when he was told the truth no pleasure at all the sight even took away the feeling of pleasure over a professional triumph to see him wilting under the eyes of his captors but still more than three hundred slaves had been set free hornblower was dictating his despatch to their lordships and spendlove who numbered this newfangled shorthand among his surprising accomplishments was slashing down the letter at a speed that made light of hornblowers stumbling sentences hornblower had not yet acquired the art of dictation in conclusion said hornblower it gives me particular pleasure to call their lordships attention to the ingenuity and activity of captain sir thomas fell which made this exemplary capture possible spendlove looked up from his pad and stared at him spendlove knew the truth but the unblinking stare which answered him defied him to utter a word add the usual official ending said hornblower it was not for him to explain his motives to his secretary nor could he have explained them if he had tried he liked fell no better now than before now a letter to my agent said hornblower aye aye my lord said spendlove turning a page hornblower began to assemble in his mind the sentences composing this next letter he wanted to say that because the capture was due to sir thomass suggestions he did not wish to apply for his share of head money for himself it was his desire that the share of the flag should be allocated to sir thomas no said hornblower belay that i wont write after all aye aye my lord said spendlove it was possible to pass on to another man distinction and honour but one could not pass on money there was something obvious something suspicious about that sir thomas might guess and sir thomass feelings might be hurt and he would not risk it but he wished he liked sir thomas better all the same the bewildered pirates oh the dames of france are foond aand free and flemish liips aare willing that was young spendlove singing lustily only two rooms away from hornblowers at admiralty house and he might as well be in the same room as all the windows were open to let in the jamaican sea breeze and sweet the maids of iitaaly that was gerard joining in my compliments to mr gerard and mr spendlove growled hornblower to giles who was helping him dress and that caterwauling is to stop repeat that to make sure you have the words right his lordships compliments gentlemen and that caterwauling is to stop repeated giles dutifully very well run and say it giles ran and hornblower was gratified to hear the noise cease abruptly the fact that those two young men were singing and still more the fact that they had forgotten he was within earshot was proof that they were feeling lighthearted as might be expected seeing they were dressing for a ball yet it was no excuse for they knew well enough that their tonedeaf commanderinchief detested music and they should also have realised that he would be more testy than usual on account of that very ball because it meant that he would be forced to spend a long evening listening to those dreary sounds cloying and irritating at the same moment there would certainly be a table or two of whist mr hough would be aware of his principal guests tastes but it was too much to hope for that all sound of music would be excluded from the cardroom the prospect of a ball was by no means as exhilarating to hornblower as to his flaglieutenant and to his secretary hornblower tied his white neckcloth and painfully adjusted it to geometrical symmetry and giles helped him into his black dresscoat hornblower regarded the result in the mirror by the light of the candles round its frame at least tolerable he said to himself the growing peacetime convention whereby naval and military men appeared in civilian clothes had a good deal to recommend it so had the other increasing fad for men to wear black dresscoats barbara had helped him select this one and had supervised its fitting by the tailor the cut was excellent hornblower decided turning back and forth before the mirror and black and white suited him only gentlemen can wear black and white barbara had said and that was very gratifying giles handed him his tall hat and he studied the additional effect then he took up his white gloves remembered to remove his hat again and stepped out through the door which giles opened for him and entered the corridor where gerard and spendlove in their best uniforms were waiting for him i must apologise on behalf of spendlove and myself for the singing my lord said gerard the softening effect of the black dresscoat was evident when hornblower refrained from a rasping reprimand what would miss lucy say spendlove if she heard you singing about the dames of france he asked spendloves answering grin was very attractive i must ask your lordships further indulgence not to tell her about it he said ill make that conditional upon your further good behaviour said hornblower the open carriage was waiting outside the front door of admiralty house four seamen stood by with lanterns to add to the light thrown by the lamps on the porch hornblower climbed in and seated himself etiquette was different here on land hornblower missed the shrilling of the pipes that he felt should accompany this ceremonial as it would if it were a boat he was entering and in a carriage the senior officer entered first so that after he was seated spendlove and gerard had to run round and enter by the other door gerard sat beside him and spendlove sat opposite his back to the horses as the door shut the carriage moved forward between the lanterns at the gate and out to the pitch dark jamaican night hornblower breathed the warm tropical air and grudgingly admitted to himself that after all it was no great hardship to attend a ball perhaps you have a rich marriage in mind spendlove he asked i understand miss lucy will inherit it all but i advise you to make certain before committing yourself that there are no nephews on the fathers side a rich marriage might be desirable my lord replied spendloves voice out of the darkness but i must remind you that in affairs of the heart i have been handicapped from birth or at least from my baptism from your baptism repeated hornblower puzzled yes my lord you remember my name perhaps erasmus said hornblower exactly my lord it is not adapted to endearments could any woman fall in love with an erasmus could any woman bring herself to breathe the words razzy darling i fancy it could happen said hornblower may i live long enough to hear it said spendlove it was remarkably agreeable to be driving thus through the jamaican night behind two good horses and with two pleasant young men especially as he told himself smugly because he had done work satisfactory enough to justify relaxation his command was in good order the policing of the caribbean was proceeding satisfactorily and smuggling and piracy were being reduced to small proportions tonight he had no responsibilities he was in no danger at all not any danger was far away over the horizons both of time and space he could lean back relaxed against the leather cushions of the carriage taking only moderate care not to crease his black dresscoat or crumple the careful pleats of his shirt naturally his reception at the houghss house was somewhat overpowering there was a good deal of my lord and his lordship hough was a substantial planter a man of considerable wealth with enough of dislike for english winters not to be the usual west indian absentee landlord yet for all his wealth he was greatly impressed by the fact that he was entertaining in one and the same person a peer and an admiral and a commanderinchief and someone whose influence might at any moment be of great importance to him the warmth of his greeting and of mrs houghs was so great that it even overflowed round gerard and spendlove as well perhaps the houghs felt that if they wished to be sure of standing well with the commanderinchief it might be as well to cultivate good relations with his flaglieutenant and secretary too lucy hough was a pretty enough girl of some seventeen or eighteen years of age whom hornblower had already met on a few occasions hornblower told himself he could feel no interest in a child straight from the schoolroom almost straight from the nursery however pretty he smiled at her and she dropped her eyes looked up at him again and once more looked away it was interesting that she was not nearly so timid when she met the glances and acknowledged the bows of the young men who were far more likely to be of interest to her your lordship does not dance i understand said hough it is painful to be reminded of what i am missing in the presence of so much beauty replied hornblower with another smile at mrs hough and at lucy perhaps a rubber of whist then my lord suggested hough the goddess of chance instead of the muse of music said hornblower he always tried to talk about music as if it meant something to him i will woo the one instead of the other from what i know about your lordships skill at whist said hough i would say that as regards your lordship the goddess of chance has but small need for wooing the ball had been in progress apparently for some time before hornblowers arrival there were two score young people on the floor of the great room a dozen dowagers on chairs round the wall an orchestra in the corner hough led the way to another room hornblower dismissed his two young men with a nod and settled down to whist with hough and a couple of formidable old ladies the closing of the heavy door shut out luckily nearly all the exasperating din of the orchestra the old ladies played a sound game and a pleasant hour enough went by it was terminated by the entrance of mrs hough it is time for the polonaise before supper she announced i really must beg you to leave your cards and come and witness it would your lordship asked hough apologetically mrs houghs wish is my command said hornblower the ballroom was of course stifling hot faces were flushed and shiny but there was no lack of energy apparent as the double line formed up for the polonaise while the orchestra grated out its mysterious noises to encourage the young people spendlove was leading lucy by the hand and they were exchanging happy glances hornblower from the weary age of fortysix could look with condescension at these young men and women in their immature teens and twenties tolerant of their youth and enthusiasm the noises the orchestra made became more jerky and confusing but the young people could find some sense in them they capered round the room skirts swaying and coattails flapping everyone smiling and lighthearted the double lines became rings melted into lines again turned and reformed until in the end with a final hideous crash from the orchestra the women sank low in curtsies and the men bent themselves double before them a pretty sight once the music had ceased there was a burst of laughter and applause before the lines broke up the women with sidelong looks at each other gathered into groups which edged out of the room they were retiring to repair the damages sustained in the heat of action hornblower met lucys eyes again and once more she looked away and then back at him shy eager it was hard to tell with these mere children but it was not the sort of glance she had bestowed on spendlove ten minutes at least before the supper march my lord said hough your lordship will be kind enough to take in mrs hough delighted of course replied hornblower spendlove approached he was mopping his face with his handkerchief i would enjoy a breath of cooler air my lord he said perhaps ill come with you said hornblower not sorry to have an excuse to be rid of houghs ponderous company they stepped out into the dark garden so bright had been the candles in the ballroom that they had to tread cautiously at first i trust you are enjoying yourself said hornblower very much indeed thank you my lord and your suit is making progress of that i am not so sure my lord you have my best wishes in any case thank you my lord hornblowers eyes were more accustomed now to the darkness he could see the stars now when he looked up sirius was visible resuming once more his eternal chase of orion across the night sky the air was warm and still with the cessation of the sea breeze then it happened hornblower heard a movement behind him a rustling of foliage but before he could pay attention to it hands gripped his arms a hand came over his mouth he began to struggle a sharp burning pain under his right shoulderblade made him jump quiet said a voice a thick heavy voice or this he felt the pain again it was a knife point in his back and he held himself still the unseen hands began to hustle him away there were at least three men round him his nose told him they were sweating with excitement perhaps spendlove he said quiet said the voice again he was being hustled down the long garden a momentary sharp cry instantly stifled presumably came from spendlove behind him hornblower had difficulty in preserving his balance as he was hurried along but the arms that held him sustained him when he stumbled he could feel the pressure of the knife point against his back sharpen into pain as it pierced his clothes at the far end of the garden they emerged into a narrow path where a darkness loomed up in the night hornblower bumped into something that snorted and moved a mule apparently get on said the voice beside him hornblower hesitated and felt the knife against his ribs get on said the voice someone else was wheeling the mule round again for him to mount there were neither stirrups nor saddle hornblower put his hands on the withers and hauled himself up astride the mule he could find no reins although he heard the chink of a bit he buried his fingers in the scanty mane all round him he could hear a bustle as the other mules were mounted his own mule started with something of a jerk that made him cling wildly to the mane someone had mounted the mule ahead and was riding forward with a leading rein attached to his mule there seemed to be four mules altogether and some eight men the mules began to trot and hornblower felt himself tossed about precariously on the slippery back of the mule but there was a man running on each side of him helping to keep him on his perch a second or two later they slowed down again as the leading mule turned a difficult corner who are you demanded hornblower with the first breath that the motion had not shaken out of his body the man by his right knee waved something at him something bright enough to shine in the starlight it was a cutlass the machete of the west indies quiet he said or i cut off your leg the next moment the mule broke into a trot again and hornblower could have said no more even if he were inclined to do so mules and men hurried along a path between great fields of cane with hornblower bounding about on the mules back he tried to look up at the stars to see which way they were going but it was difficult and they altered course repeatedly winding about over the countryside they left the cane behind and seemed to emerge into open savannah then there were trees then they slowed down for a sharp ascent broke into a trot again down the other side the men on foot running tirelessly beside the mules and climbed again the mules slipping and plunging on what appeared to be an insecure surface twice hornblower nearly fell off to be heaved back again by the man beside him soon he was atrociously saddlesore if the word could be considered appropriate when he was riding bareback and the ridge of the mules spine caused him agony he was drenched with sweat his mouth was parched and he was desperately weary he grew stupefied with misery despite the pain he suffered more than once they splashed across small streams roaring down from the mountains again they made their way through a belt of trees several times they seemed to be threading narrow passes hornblower had no idea how long they had been travelling when they found themselves beside a small river seemingly placid as it reflected the stars on the far side faint in the darkness towered a lofty cliff here the party halted and the man beside him tugged at his knee in an obvious invitation to dismount hornblower slid down the mules side he had to lean against the animal for a moment when his legs refused to hold him up when he was able to stand upright and look about him he saw a white face among the dark ones that surrounded him he could just make out spendlove his knees sagging and his head lolling as he stood supported on either side spendlove he said there was an agonising moment of waiting before the drooping figure said my lord the voice was thick and unnatural spendlove are you wounded im well my lord someone pushed hornblower in the back come swim said a voice spendlove several hands turned hornblower away and thrust him stumbling down to the waters edge it was hopeless to resist hornblower could only guess that spendlove had been stunned by a blow and was only now recovering his unconscious body having been carried so far by mule swim said the voice and a hand pressed him forward to the water no croaked hornblower the water seemed immeasurably wide and dark even while hornblower struggled at the waters edge he had a horrible realisation of the indignity he was undergoing as a commanderinchief acting like a child in the hands of these people somebody led a mule slowly down into the water beside him hold his tail said the voice and there was the knife in his back again he took hold of the mules tail and despairingly let himself flop into the water spreadeagled for a moment the mule floundered and then struck out the water as it closed round hornblower seemed hardly colder than the warm air it was no more than a moment it seemed before the mule was plunging up the other bank and hornblower found the bottom under his feet and waded out after him the water streaming from his clothes the rest of the gang and the animals splashing after him the hand was back on his shoulder turning him to one side and urging him along he heard an odd creaking in front of him and a swaying object struck him on the chest his hands felt smooth bamboo and some sort of creeper liana knotted to it it was a makeshift rope ladder dangling in front of him up said the voice up he could not he would not and there was the knife point at his back again he stretched his arms up and grasped a rung feeling desperately with his feet for another up he began the climb with the ladder writhing under his feet in the animal fashion rope ladders always display it was horrible in the darkness feeling with his feet for each elusive rung in turn clutching desperately with his hands his sodden shoes tended to slip on the smooth bamboo nor did his hands feel secure on the creeper someone else was climbing close after him and the ladder twined about unpredictably he knew himself to be swaying pendulumfashion in the darkness up he went one rung at a time his hands gripping so convulsively that it was only by a conscious effort that he was able to make each one unclasp in turn and seek a fresh hold then the gyrations and swinging grew less his upwardstretching hand touched earth or rock the next moment was not easy he was unsure of his handhold and he hesitated he knew himself to be a prodigious height up in the air just below him on the ladder he heard a sharp command issued by the man following him and then a hand above him grasped his wrist and pulled his feet found the next rung and there he was lying gasping on his belly on solid earth the hand dragged at him again and he crawled on all fours forward to make room for the man behind him he was almost sobbing there was no trace left now of the haughty and selfsatisfied human who had admired himself in the mirror not so many hours ago other people trod past him my lord my lord that was spendlove asking for him spendlove he answered sitting up are you all right my lord asked spendlove stooping over him was it sense of humour or sense of the ridiculous was it natural pride or force of habit which made him take a grip on himself as right as i might expect to be thank you after these rather remarkable experiences he said but you what happened to you they hit me on the head replied spendlove simply dont stand there sit down said hornblower and spendlove collapsed beside him do you know where we are my lord he asked somewhere at the top of a cliff as far as i can estimate said hornblower but where my lord somewhere in his majestys loyal colony of jamaica more than that i cant say it will be dawn soon i suppose said spendlove weakly soon enough nobody about them was paying them any attention there was a great deal of chatter going on in marked contrast with the silence the almost disciplined silence which had been preserved during their dash across country the chatter mingled with the sound of a small waterfall which he realised he had been hearing ever since his climb the conversations were in a thick english which hornblower could hardly understand but he could be sure that their captors were expressing exultation he could hear womens voices too while figures paced about too excited to sit down despite the fatigues of the night i doubt if were at the top of the cliff my lord if youll pardon me said spendlove he pointed upwards the sky was growing pale and the stars were fading vertically over their heads they could see the cliff above them overhanging them looking up hornblower could see foliage silhouetted against the sky strange he said we must be on some sort of shelf on his right hand the sky was showing a hint of light of the palest pink even while on his left it was still dark facing northnorwest said spendlove the light increased perceptibly when hornblower looked to the east again the pink had turned to orange and there was a hint of green they seemed immeasurably high up almost at their feet it seemed as they sat the shelf ended abruptly and far down below them the shadowy world was taking form concealed at the moment by a light mist hornblower was suddenly conscious of his wet clothes and shivered that might be the sea said spendlove pointing the sea it was blue and lovely in the far distance a broad belt of land some miles across extended between the cliff on which they were perched and the edge of the sea the mist still obscured it hornblower rose to his feet took a step forward leaning over a low crude parapet of piled rock he shrank back before nerving himself to look again under his feet there was nothing they were indeed on a shelf in the face of the cliff about the height of a frigates mainyard sixty feet or so vertically below them he could see the small stream he had crossed holding the mules tail the rope ladder still hung down from where he stood to the waters edge when with an effort of will he forced himself to lean out and look over he could see the mules standing dispiritedly below him in the narrow area between the river and the foot of the cliff the overhang must be considerable they were on a shelf in a cliff undercut through the ages by the river below when in spate nothing could reach them from above and nothing from below if the ladder were to be drawn up the shelf was perhaps ten yards wide at its widest and perhaps a hundred yards long at one end the waterfall he had heard tumbled down the cliff face in a groove it had cut for itself it splashed against a cluster of gleaming rocks and then leaped out again the sight of it told him how thirsty he was and he walked along to it it was a giddy thing to do to stand there with the cliff face at one elbow and a vertical drop under the other with the spray bursting round him but he could fill his cupped hands with water and drink and drink again before splashing his face and head refreshingly he drew back to find spendlove waiting for him to finish matted in spendloves thick hair and behind his left ear and down his neck was a black clot of blood spendlove knelt to drink and to wash and rose again touching his scalp cautiously they spared me nothing he said his uniform was spattered with blood too at his waist dangled an empty scabbard his sword was missing and as they turned back from the waterfall they could see it it was in the hand of one of their captors who was standing waiting for them he was short and square and heavily built not entirely negro possibly as much as half white he wore a dirty white shirt and loose ragged blue trousers with dilapidated buckled shoes on his splay feet now lord he said he spoke with the island intonation with a thickening of the vowels and a slurring of the consonants what do you want demanded hornblower putting all the rasp into his voice that he could manage write us a letter said the man with the sword a letter to whom to the governor asking him to come and hang you asked hornblower the man shook his big head no i want a paper a paper with a seal on it a pardon for us all with a seal on it who are you ned johnson the name meant nothing to hornblower nor as a glance showed did it mean anything to the omniscient spendlove i sailed with harkness said johnson ah that meant something to both the british officers harkness was one of the last of the petty pirates hardly more than a week ago his sloop blossom had been cut off by the clorinda off savannalamar and her escape to leeward intercepted under longrange fire from the frigate she had despairingly run herself aground at the mouth of the sweet river and her crew had escaped into the marshes and mangrove swamps of that section of coast all except her captain whose body had been found on her deck almost cut in two by a round shot from clorinda this was her crew left leaderless unless johnson could be called their leader and to hunt them down the governor had called out two battalions of troops as soon as clorinda beat back to kingston with the news it was to cut off their escape by sea that the governor at hornblowers suggestion had posted guards at every fishing beach in the whole big island otherwise the cycle they had already probably followed would be renewed with the theft of a fishing boat the capture of a larger craft and so on until they were a pest again theres no pardon for pirates said hornblower yes said johnson write us a letter and the governor will give us one he turned aside and from the foot of the cliff at the back of the shelf he picked up something it was a leatherbound book the second volume of waverley hornblower saw when it was put in his hands and johnson produced a stub of pencil and gave him that as well write to the governor he said he opened the book at the beginning and indicated the flyleaf as the place to write on what do you think i would write asked hornblower ask him for a pardon for us with his seal on it apparently johnson must have heard somewhere in talk with fellow pirates of a pardon under the great seal and the memory had lingered the governor would never do that then i send him your ears then i send him your nose said johnson that was a horrible thing to hear hornblower glanced at spendlove who had turned white at the words you the admiral continued johnson you the lord the governor will do that i doubt if he would said hornblower he conjured up in his mind the picture of fussy old general sir augustus hooper and tried to imagine the reaction produced by johnsons demand his excellency would come near to bursting a blood vessel at the thought of granting pardons to two dozen pirates the home government when it heard the news would be intensely annoyed and without doubt most of the annoyance would be directed at the man whose idiocy in allowing himself to be kidnapped had put everyone in this absurd position that suggested a question how did you come to be in the garden he asked we was waiting for you to go home but you came out first if they had been intending stand back yelled johnson he leaped backwards with astonishing agility for his bulk bracing himself knees bent body tense on guard with the sword hornblower looked round in astonishment in time to see spendlove relax he had been poising himself for a spring with that sword in his hand and its point against johnsons throat the position would have been reversed some of the others came running up at the cry one of them had a staff in his hand a headless pike stave apparently and thrust it cruelly into spendloves face spendlove staggered back and the staff was whirled up to strike him down hornblower leaped in front of him no he yelled and they all stood looking at each other the drama of the situation ebbing away then one of the men came sidling towards hornblower cutlass in hand cut off his ear he asked over his shoulder to johnson no not yet sit down you two when they hesitated johnsons voice rose to a roar sit down under the menace of the cutlass there was nothing to do but sit down and they were helpless you write that letter asked johnson wait a little said hornblower wearily he could think of nothing else to say in that situation he was playing for time hopelessly like a child at bedtime confronted by stern guardians lets have some breakfast said spendlove at the far end of the shelf a small fire had been lighted its smoke clinging in the still dawn in a thin thread to the sloping overhang of the cliff an iron pot hung from a chain attached to a tripod over the fire and two women were crouching over it attending to it packed against the back wall of the shelf were chests and kegs and barrels muskets were ranged in a rack it occurred to hornblower that he was in the situation common in popular romances he was in the pirates lair perhaps those chests contained untold treasures of pearls and gold pirates like any other seafarers needed a land base and these pirates had established one here instead of on some lonely cay his brig clement had cleaned out one of those last year you write that letter lord said johnson he poked at hornblowers breast with the sword and the point pierced the thin shirtfront to prick him over the breastbone what is it you want asked hornblower a pardon with a seal hornblower studied the swarthy features in front of him the jig was up for piracy in the caribbean he knew american shipsofwar in the north french shipsofwar working from the lesser antilles and his own busy squadron based on jamaica had made the business both unprofitable and dangerous and this particular band of pirates the remains of the harkness gang were in a more precarious position than any with the loss of their ship and with their escape to sea cut off by his precautions it had been a bold plan and well executed to save their necks by kidnapping him presumably the plan had been made and executed by this rather stupidseeming fellow almost bewildered in appearance before him appearances might be deceitful or else the desperate need of the situation had stimulated that dull mind into unusual activity you hear me said johnson offering another prick with the sword and breaking in upon hornblowers train of thought say you will my lord muttered spendlove close to hornblowers ear gain time johnson turned on him sword pointed at his face shut that mouth he said another idea occurred to him and he glanced round at hornblower you write or i prick his eye ill write said hornblower now he sat with the volume of waverley open at the flyleaf and the stub of pencil in his hand while johnson withdrew for a couple of paces presumably to allow free play for inspiration what was he to write dear sir augustus your excellency that was better i am held to ransom here along with spendlove by the survivors of the harkness gang perhaps the bearer of this will explain the conditions they demand a free pardon in exchange for hornblower held the pencil poised over the paper debating the next words our lives he shook his head to himself and wrote our freedom he wanted no melodrama your excellency will of course be a better judge of the situation than i am your obdt servant hornblower hesitated again and then he dashed off the hornblower of his signature there you are he said holding out the volume to johnson who took it and looked at it curiously and turned back to the group of a dozen or so of his followers who had been squatting on the ground behind him silently watching the proceedings they peered at the writing over johnsons shoulder others came to look as well and they fell into a chattering debate not one of them can read my lord commented spendlove so it appears the pirates were looking from the writing over to their prisoners and back again the argument grew more intense johnson seemed to be expostulating or exhorting and some of the men he addressed drew back shaking their heads its a question of who shall carry that note to kingston said hornblower who shall beard the lion that fellow has no command over his men commented spendlove harkness would have shot a couple of them by now johnson returned to them pointing a dark stubby finger at the writing what you say here he asked hornblower read the note aloud it did not matter whether he spoke the truth or not seeing they had no way of knowing johnson stared at him studying his face johnsons own face betrayed more of the bewilderment hornblower had noticed before the pirate was facing a situation too complex for him he was trying to carry out a plan which he had not thought out in all its details beforehand no one of the pirates was willing to venture into the grip of justice bearing a message of unknown content nor for that matter would the pirates trust one of their number to go off on such a mission he might well desert throwing away the precious message to try and make his escape on his own the poor ragged shiftless devils and their slatternly women were in a quandary with no master mind to find a way out for them hornblower could have laughed at their predicament and almost did until he thought of what this unstable mob could do in a fit of passion to the prisoners in their power the debate went on furiously with a solution apparently no nearer do you think we could get to the ladder my lord asked spendlove and then answered his own question no theyd catch us before we could get away a pity we can bear the possibility in mind said hornblower one of the women cooking over the fire called out at this moment in a loud raucous voice interrupting the debate food was being ladled out into wooden bowls a young mulatto woman hardly more than a child in a ragged gown that had once been magnificent brought a bowl over to them one bowl no spoon or fork they stared at each other unable to keep from smiling then spendlove produced a penknife from his breeches pocket and tendered it to his superior after opening it perhaps it may serve my lord he said apologetically adding after a glance at the contents of the bowl not such a good meal as the supper we missed at the houghss my lord boiled yams and a trifle of boiled salt pork the former presumably stolen from some slave garden and the latter from one of the hogsheads stored here on the cliff they ate with difficulty hornblower insisting on their using the penknife turn about juggling with the hot food for which both of them discovered a raging appetite the pirates and the women were mostly squatting on their heels as they ate after their first mouthfuls they were beginning to argue again over the use to be made of their prisoners hornblower looked out again from the shelf at the view extended before them that must be the cockpit country he said no doubt of it my lord the cockpit country was territory unknown to any white man an independent republic in the northwest of jamaica at the conquest of the island from the spaniards a century and a half earlier the british had found this area already populated by runaway slaves and the survivors of the indian population several attempts to subdue the area had failed disastrously yellow fever and the appalling difficulty of the country allying themselves with the desperate valour of the defenders and a treaty had finally been concluded granting independence to the cockpit country on the sole condition that the inhabitants should not harbour runaway slaves in future that treaty had already endured fifty years and seemed likely to endure far longer the pirates lair was on the edge of this area with the mountains at the back of it and thats montego bay my lord said spendlove pointing hornblower had visited the place in clorinda last year a lonely roadstead providing fair anchorage and shelter for a few fishing boats he gazed over to the distant blue water with longing he tried to think of ways of escape of some method of coming to honourable terms with the pirates but a night entirely without sleep made his brain sluggish and now that he had eaten it was more sluggish still he caught himself nodding and pulled himself up with a jerk now that he was in his middle forties the loss of a nights sleep was a serious matter especially when the night had been filled with violent and unaccustomed exertion spendlove had seen him nod i think you could sleep my lord he said gently perhaps i could he let his body sink to the hard ground he was pillowless and uncomfortable here my lord said spendlove two hands on his shoulders eased him round and now he was pillowed on spendloves thigh the world whirled round him for a moment there was the whisper of a breeze the loud debate of the pirates and their women was monotonous in pitch the waterfall was splashing and gurgling then he was asleep he awoke some time later with spendlove touching his shoulder my lord my lord he lifted his head a little surprised to find where it had been resting it took him several seconds to recall where he was and how he had come there johnson and one or two other pirates were standing before him in the background one of the women was looking on in an attitude that conveyed the impression that she had contributed to the conclusion that had evidently been reached we send you to the governor lord said johnson hornblower blinked up at him although the sun had moved round behind the cliff the sky above was dazzling you said johnson you go we keep him johnson indicated spendlove by a gesture what do you mean asked hornblower you go to the governor and get our pardon said johnson you can ask him and he will give it he stays here we can cut off his nose we can dig out his eyes good god almighty said hornblower johnson or his advisers perhaps that woman over there were people of considerable insight after all they had some conception of honour of gentlemanly obligations they had perceived something of the relationship between hornblower and spendlove they may have been guided by the sight of hornblower sleeping with his head pillowed on spendloves thigh they knew that hornblower could never abandon spendlove to the mercy of his captors that he would do everything possible to obtain his freedom even perhaps hornblowers imagination surged in a great wave over the barrier of his sleepiness even perhaps to the extent of coming back to share spendloves captivity and fate in the event of not being able to obtain the necessary pardons we send you lord said johnson the woman in the background said something in a loud voice we send you now said johnson get up hornblower rose slowly he would have taken his time in any case in an effort to preserve what dignity was left to him but he could not have risen swiftly if he had wanted to his joints were stiff he could almost hear them crack as he moved his body ached horribly these two men take you said johnson spendlove had risen to his feet too are you all right my lord he asked anxiously only stiff and rheumaticy replied hornblower but what about you oh im all right my lord please dont give another thought to me my lord that was a very straight glance that spendlove gave him a glance that tried to convey a message not another thought my lord repeated spendlove he was trying to tell his chief that he should be abandoned that nothing should be done to ransom him that he was willing to suffer whatever tortures might be inflicted on him so long as his chief came well out of the business ill be thinking about you all the time said hornblower giving back glance for glance hurry said johnson the rope ladder still dangled down from the lip of the shelf it was a tricky business to lower himself with his creaking joints over the edge and to find foothold on the slippery bamboo rungs the ladder swung away under the thrust of his feet as if it was a live thing determined to cast him down he clung with frantic hands back downward forcing himself against his instincts to straighten up and allow the ladder to swing back again gingerly his feet found foothold again and he continued his descent just as he grew accustomed to the motion of the ladder his rhythm was disturbed by the first of his escort lowering himself upon the ladder above him he had to cling and wait again before he resumed his downward progress his feet had hardly gratefully touched ground than first one and then the other of his escorts dropped beside him goodbye my lord good luck that was spendlove calling from above hornblower standing on the very edge of the river his face towards the cliff had to bend far backwards to see spendloves head over the parapet and his waving hand sixty feet above he waved back as his escorts led the mules to the waters edge once more it was necessary to swim the river it was no more than thirty feet across he could have swum it last night without assistance had he been sure about that in the darkness now he let himself flop into the water clothes and all alas for that beautiful black dresscoat and turning on his back kicked out with his legs but his clothes were already wet and were a ponderous burden to him and he knew a moment of worry before his already weary limbs carried him to the rocky bank he crawled out the water streaming from his clothes unwilling to move even while the mules came plunging up out of the water beside him spendlove up above still leaning over the parapet waved to him again now it was a question of mounting a mule again his wet clothes weighed upon him like lead he had to struggle up the animals wet hide was slippery and as soon as he settled himself astride he realised that he was horribly saddlesore from the night before and the raw surfaces caused him agony he had to brace himself to endure it it was dreadfully painful as his mount plunged about making his way over the irregular surface from the river they made an abrupt ascent into the mountains they were retracing the path they had taken the night before hardly a path hardly a track they picked their way up a steep gully down the other side up again they splashed across little torrents and wound their way among trees hornblower was numb both in body and mind by now his mule was weary and by no means as sure of foot as a mule should be stumbling more than once so that only by frantic efforts could he retain his seat the sun was sinking towards the west as they jolted on downhill at last passage through a final belt of trees brought them into open country upon which the sun blazed in tropical glory this was savannah country hardly rocky at all there were cattle to be seen in the distance and beyond a great sea of green the vast sugarcane fields of jamaica stretching as far as the eye could see half a mile farther they reached a welldefined track and there his escorts checked their mounts now you can go on said one of them pointing along the path winding towards the distant cane it was a second or two before hornblowers stupefied brain could grasp the fact that they were turning him loose that way he asked unnecessarily yes said his escort the two men turned their mules hornblower had to struggle with his who disliked the separation one of the escorts struck the brute on the rump sending him down the path in a jerky trot acutely painful to hornblower as he sought to retain his seat soon the mule eased to a legweary walk and hornblower was content to sit idly as it crawled along down the path the sun was now clouded over and it was not long before heralded by a brisk wind a blinding rain began to fall blotting out the landscape and slowing the mule even more on the slippery surface hornblower sat exhausted on the sharp spine of the animal so heavy was the rain that he found it difficult to breathe as it poured upon his face gradually the roaring rain ceased the sky while it remained overcast above him opened to the west and admitted a gleam of the setting sun so that the landscape on his left was made glorious with a rainbow which hornblower hardly noted here was the first canefield the track he was following became here a rough and narrow roadway through the cane deeply rutted by cartwheels the mule plodded on eternally through the cane now the road crossed another and the mule pulled up at the crossroads before hornblower could rouse himself to urge the mule onwards he heard a shout to his right far down the road he saw a group of horsemen illuminated against the sunset with an urgent drumming of hoofs they came galloping towards him and reined up at his side a white man followed by two coloured men its lord hornblower isnt it asked the white man a young fellow hornblower noticed dully that although mounted he was still in fulldress clothes with his ruffled neckcloth all awry and bedraggled yes said hornblower thank god youre safe sir said the young man are you hurt are you wounded my lord no said hornblower swaying with fatigue on the back of the mule the young man turned to one of his coloured companions and issued rapid orders and the coloured man wheeled his horse round and went galloping full pelt down the road the whole island has been turned out to seek for you my lord said the young man what happened to you we have searched for you all day it would never do for an admiral a commanderinchief to betray unmanly weakness hornblower made himself stiffen his spine i was kidnapped by pirates he said he tried to speak nonchalantly as if that was something that could happen to anyone any day but it was difficult his voice was only a hoarse croak i must go at once to the governor where is his excellency he must be at government house i fancy said the young man no more than thirty miles away thirty miles hornblower felt as if he could not ride another thirty yards very well he said stiffly i must go there the hough house is only two miles down the road here my lord said the young man your carriage is still there i believe i have already sent a messenger well go there first then said hornblower as indifferently as he could manage a word from the white man brought the other coloured man from his horse and hornblower slid ungracefully from the mule it was an enormous effort to get his foot up into the stirrup the coloured man had to help him heave his right leg over he had hardly gathered the reins in his hands he had not yet discovered which was which when the white man put his horse into a trot and hornblowers mount followed him it was torture to bump about in the saddle my name is colston said the white man checking his horse so that hornblower came up alongside him i had the honour of being presented to your lordship at the ball last night of course said hornblower tell me what happened there you were missed my lord after the supper march had been kept waiting for you to head it with mrs hough you and your secretary mr mr spendlove said hornblower yes my lord at first it was thought that some urgent business was demanding your attention it was not for an hour or two i suppose that your flaglieutenant and mr hough could agree that you had been spirited away there was great distress among the company my lord yes then the alarm was given all the gentlemen present rode out in search for you the militia was called out at dawn the whole countryside is being patrolled i expect the highland regiment is in full march for here at this moment indeed said hornblower a thousand infantrymen were making a forced march of thirty miles on his account a thousand horsemen were scouring the island hoofbeats sounded in front of them two horsemen approached in the gathering darkness hornblower could just recognise hough and the messenger thank god my lord said hough what happened hornblower was tempted to answer mr colston will tell you but he made himself make a more sensible reply hough uttered the expected platitudes i must go on to the governor at once said hornblower there is spendlove to think of spendlove my lord oh yes of course your secretary he is still in the hands of the pirates said hornblower indeed my lord replied hough no one seemed to have a care about spendlove except lucy hough presumably here was the house and the courtyard lights were gleaming in every window please come in my lord said hough your lordship must be in need of refreshment he had eaten yams and salt pork some time that morning he felt no hunger now i must go on to government house he said i can waste no time if your lordship insists yes said hornblower i will go and have the horses put to then my lord hornblower found himself alone in the brightlylit sittingroom he felt that if he threw himself into one of the vast chairs there he would never get up again my lord my lord it was lucy hough fluttering into the room her skirts flying with her haste he would have to tell her about spendlove oh youre safe youre safe what was this the girl had flung herself on her knees before him she had one of his hands in both hers and was kissing it frantically he drew back he tried to snatch his hand away but she clung on to it and followed him on her knees still kissing it miss lucy i care for nothing as long as youre safe she said looking up at him and still clasping his hand tears were streaming down her cheeks ive been through torment today youre not hurt tell me speak to me this was horrible she was pressing her lips her cheek against his hand again miss lucy please compose yourself how could a girl of seventeen act like this towards a man of fortyfive was she not enamoured of spendlove but perhaps that was the person she was thinking about i will see that mr spendlove is safe he said mr spendlove i hope hes safe but its you you you miss lucy you must not say these things stand up please i beg you somehow he got her to her feet i couldnt bear it she said ive loved you since the moment i saw you there there said hornblower as soothingly as he knew how the carriage will be ready in two minutes my lord said houghs voice from the door a glass of wine and a bite before you start hough came in with a smile thank you sir said hornblower struggling with embarrassment this child has been in a rare way since this morning said hough indulgently these young people she was the only person in the island i fancy who gave a thought to the secretary as well as to the commanderinchief er yes these young people said hornblower the butler entered with a tray at that moment pour his lordship a glass of wine lucy my dear said hough and then to hornblower mrs hough has been considerably prostrated but she will be down in a moment please do not discommode her i beg of you said hornblower his hand was shaking as he reached for the glass hough took up carving knife and fork and set about carving the cold chicken excuse me please said lucy she turned and ran from the room as quickly as she had entered it sobbing wildly i had no idea the attachment was so strong said hough nor had i said hornblower he had gulped down the whole glass of wine in his agitation he addressed himself to the cold chicken with all the calm he could muster the carriage is at the door sir announced the butler ill take these with me said hornblower a slice of bread in one hand and a chicken wing in the other would it be troubling you too much to ask you to send a messenger ahead of me to warn his excellency of my coming that has already been done my lord answered hough and i have sent out messengers to inform the patrols that you are safe hornblower sank into the cushioned ease of the carriage the incident with lucy had at least had the effect of temporarily driving all thought of fatigue from his mind now he could lean back and relax it was five minutes before he remembered the bread and chicken in his hands and set himself wearily to eat them the long drive was not particularly restful for there were continual interruptions patrols who had not heard that he was safe stopped the carriage ten miles down the road they encountered the highland battalion encamped at the roadside and the colonel insisted on coming and paying his respects to the naval commanderinchief and congratulating him farther on a galloping horse reined up beside the carriage it was gerard the light of the carriage lamp revealed that he had ridden his horse into a lather hornblower had to listen to him say thank god you are safe my lord everyone used those same words and explain to him what had happened gerard abandoned his horse at the first opportunity and got into the carriage beside hornblower he was full of selfreproach at having allowed this to happen to his chief hornblower rather resented the implication that he was incapable of looking after himself even though the event seemed to prove it and at not having rescued him we tried to use the bloodhounds they track runaway slaves with my lord but they were of no use naturally since i was on muleback said hornblower in any case the scent must have been several hours old now forget the past and let me think about the future well have those pirates dangling on ropes before two days are up my lord indeed and what about spendlove oh er yes of course my lord spendlove was very much of an afterthought with everyone even with gerard who was his friend but to gerard must be given the credit at least for appreciating hornblowers difficulty the moment it was pointed out to him we cant let anything happen to him of course my lord and how do we prevent it do we grant those pardons do we persuade his excellency to grant them well my lord theres nothing i would not do to set spendlove free said hornblower do you understand that nothing hornblower caught himself setting his jaw in grim determination his ineradicable tendency to selfanalysis revealed him to himself he was cynically surprised at his own flow of emotion ferocity and tenderness intermingled let those pirates touch one hair of spendloves head and but how was he to prevent it how to free spendlove from men who knew that their lives their actual lives and not merely their fortunes depended on keeping him prisoner how could he ever live with himself if anything were to happen to spendlove if the worst came to the worst he would have to go back to the pirates and yield himself up to them as that roman regulus returned to death at the hands of the carthaginians and the worst seemed likely to come to the worst government house my lord said gerard breaking in upon this train of nightmare thoughts sentries at the gates sentries at the door a brightlylit entrancehall where aidesdecamp looked at him curiously curse them so did gerard he was ushered through into an inner room where after only a moment another door opened to admit his excellency and the escorting aidedecamp discreetly retired his excellency was an angry man angry as a man can only be who had been badly scared now what is all this my lord there was none of the usual deference displayed towards the man who had attained a peerage the man of legendary fame hooper was a full general far above a mere rearadmiral moreover as governor he was absolute ruler throughout this island his red face and bulging blue eyes as well as the rage he was displaying seemed to confirm the rumour that he was a grandson of the royal blood hornblower explained briefly and quietly what had happened his fatigue if not his common sense prevented an angry reply do you realise the cost of all this my lord blared hooper every white man who can sit a horse is out my last reserve the highlanders are bivouacked at the roadside what that will mean in malaria and yellow fever i do not dare guess for two weeks every man of the garrison except for them has been out guarding fishing boats and watching beaches at your request the sicklists are enormous and now this my instructions and i believe your excellencys as well laid the greatest stress on the suppression of piracy sir i dont need any whippersnapper jumped up rearadmiral to interpret my instructions roared hooper what sort of bargain did you make with these pirates of yours there it was it was not an easy thing to explain to a man in this mood i made no actual bargain your excellency hard to believe you had that much sense but my honour is pledged your honour pledged to whom the pirates no your excellency to my secretary spendlove what was the pledge he was retained as a hostage when i was set free what did you promise him what he had said something about thinking about him i made no verbal promise your excellency but one was implied undoubtedly what was implied that i should set him free and how did you think you could do that nothing for it but to take the bull by the horns i was released in order that i might solicit from your excellency pardons under seal for the pirates pardons par hooper could not even finish the word a second time he could only gobble like a turkey for several seconds before with a gulp he was able to continue are you insane my lord that was why i was released and that is why spendlove is still retained then this spendlove must take his chance your excellency do you think i could grant pardons to a gang of pirates what dye mean so that they can live like lords on their booty rolling in coaches round the island a fine way that would be of suppressing piracy dye want the whole west indies in a turmoil have you lost your senses the effect of this speech was in no way modified by the fact that hornblower had guessed long before that hooper would argue exactly along this line i fully see the difficulty of the situation your excellency im glad you do you know the hidingplace of these pirates yes your excellency it is a very secure place no matter it can be reduced of course a few hangings will quiet this island down again what in the world was there that he could do or could say the sentence he framed in his mind was patently absurd to him even before he uttered it i shall have to go back there before you take any steps your excellency go back there hoopers eyes almost came out of their sockets as the implications of what hornblower was saying dawned upon him what new foolery do you have in mind i must go back and join spendlove if your excellency does not see fit to grant the pardons rubbish i can grant no pardons i cannot i will not then i have no alternative your excellency rubbish i said rubbish you made no promise you said yourself that you gave no pledge i am the judge of that your excellency youre in no condition to judge anything at present if ever you were can you imagine for one moment ill let you tie my hands like this no one regrets the necessity more than i do your excellency necessity are you dictating to me ill have you know that im your superior officer as well as governor of this island one more word and youll be under arrest my lord lets hear no more of this nonsense your excellency not one more word i said this spendlove is one of the kings servants he must run the risks of his position even though he is only a secretary but i order you to keep silence my lord you have fair warning tomorrow when youre rested we can plan to smoke out this wasps nest hornblower himself checked the protest that still rose to his lips hooper meant what he said when he threatened arrest the massive discipline that permeated the armed forces of the crown had hornblower in its grip as surely as if he were the least seaman to disobey an order was hopeless from the start the irresistible force of his own conscience might be driving him forward but here he was up against the immovable barrier of discipline tomorrow tomorrow was another day very well your excellency a nights rest will do you all the good in the world my lord perhaps it would be best if you slept here i will give the necessary orders if you instruct your flaglieutenant as to the fresh clothes you will need i will send to admiralty house for them to be ready for you in the morning clothes hornblower looked down at himself he had forgotten entirely that he was wearing his black fulldress one glance was enough to tell him that never again could he wear that suit now he could guess about the rest of his appearance he knew that his haggard cheeks must be sprouting a bristly beard his neckcloth in wild disorder no wonder that people had looked at him curiously in the anteroom your excellency is very kind he said there was no harm in being formally polite in the face of the temporarily inevitable there had been that in hoopers tone which told him that the invitation might as well have been an order that he was as much a prisoner in government house as if hooper had actually carried out his threat of putting him under arrest it was best to yield gracefully since he had to yield for the moment at least tomorrow was another day allow me to conduct you to your room my lord said hooper the mirror in the bedroom confirmed his worst fears regarding his appearance the bed with its enormous mosquito net was wide and inviting his aching joints clamoured that he should allow himself to fall across that bed and repose himself his weary brain demanded that he should sink into oblivion forget his troubles in sleep as a drunkard might forget them in liquor it was a relaxation to soap himself in a tepid bath despite the smarting protests of the raw places on his body and yet bathed and relaxed with one of his excellencys nightshirts flapping round his knees he could not give way to his weaknesses his innermost ego refused to recognise them he found himself hobbling barefooted about the room he had no quarterdeck to pace the candleheated tropical air of the bedroom was not as conducive to inspiration as was a fresh sea breeze mosquitoes buzzed about him stinging his neck and his bare legs and distracting him it was one of those dreadful nights sometimes he relaxed so far as to sit on a chair but within a few seconds a new train of thought brought him to his feet again to limp up and down it was maddening that he could not keep his thoughts concentrated on the problem of spendlove he felt a contempt for himself that he should find his mind deserting his devoted secretary there was a rival train of thought which was frequently successful in holding his attention he knew before the night was over just how he would deal with the pirates lair if his hands were free he even knew satisfaction in recapitulating his plans only to find the satisfaction replaced by sick despair at the thought of spendlove in the pirates hands there were moments when his stomach turned over as he remembered johnsons threat to dig out spendloves eyes weariness took him by surprise in the end he had sat down and rested his head on his hand and then awakened with a start as he fell forward in his chair the awakening was not complete enough unconscious of what he was doing he settled himself back in his chair and slept in that fashion the vast comfortable bed untenanted until a knocking at his door roused him to blink about him wondering where he was before bracing himself to make it seem as if it were the most ordinary thing in the world to sleep in a chair when a bed was available it was giles who came in bearing clean linen and a uniform and razors the business of shaving and of dressing carefully served to steady him and kept him from thinking too furiously about the problem he would have to solve in the next few minutes his excellency would be glad if his lordship would take breakfast with him that was a message conveyed through the door to giles the invitation must be accepted of course as it was the equivalent of a royal command hooper apparently was partial to a steak for breakfast a silver dish of steak and onions was brought in almost as soon as hornblower had uttered his formal good morning hooper looked at hornblower oddly when he answered the butlers enquiry with a request for papaya and a boiled egg that was a bad start for it confirmed hooper in his opinions of hornblowers eccentricity that he should have these outlandish frenchified notions about breakfast years of living on shore had not yet dulled the appetite for fresh eggs in their shells which hornblower had acquired during decades at sea hooper daubed mustard on his steak and set about it with appetite did you sleep well well enough thank you your excellency hoopers abandonment of the formal my lord was a not too subtle indication that he was willing to forget last nights discussion and to act magnanimously as if hornblower was a normal person with only a temporary lapse on his record well leave business until weve eaten as you wish your excellency but not even a governor can be sure of his future there was a bustle at the door and a whole group of people came hurrying in not merely the butler but two aidesdecamp and gerard and and who was that pale and ragged and weary almost unable to stand on tottering legs spendlove said hornblower his spoon clattering to the floor as he rose and hurried to him hornblower clasped his hand grinning with delight perhaps there had never been a moment in his life which had held so much sheer pleasure for him spendlove he could only repeat the name at first is this the return of the prodigal asked hooper from the table hornblower remembered his manners your excellency he said may i take it upon myself to present my secretary mr erasmus spendlove glad to see you young man take a seat at the table bring mr spendlove some food he looks as if a glass of wine would not come amiss bring the decanter and a glass youre not wounded asked hornblower youre not hurt no my lord said spendlove extending his legs cautiously under the table it is only that seventy miles on horseback have stiffened my unaccustomed limbs seventy miles asked hooper from where montego bay your excellency then you must have escaped in the night at nightfall your excellency but what did you do man demanded hornblower how did you get away i jumped my lord into the water into the water yes my lord there was eight feet of water in the river at the foot of the cliff enough to break my fall from any height so there was but but in the dark that was easy my lord i looked over the parapet during the day i did when i said goodbye to your lordship i marked the spot and i measured the distance with my eye and then and then i jumped when it was fully dark and raining hard what were the pirates doing asked hooper they were taking shelter your excellency they were paying no attention to me thinking i was safe enough there with the ladder pulled up and so so i took a run your excellency and jumped the parapet as i said and came down feet first into the water unhurt unhurt your excellency hornblowers vivid imagination conjured up everything about the feat the halfdozen strides through the dark and the roaring rain the leap the endless fall he felt the hair at the back of his neck lifting a most commendable deed commented hooper nothing for a desperate man your excellency perhaps not and then after you were in the water were you pursued as far as i can tell your excellency i was not perhaps it was some time before they noticed my absence even then they would have to let down the ladder and climb down it i heard nothing as i made off which way did you go asked hornblower i kept to the river my lord making my way downstream it reaches the sea at montego bay as we decided if you remember my lord when we were making our first observations was it an easy journey asked hornblower something was stirring in his mind demanding his attention despite the strong emotions he was experiencing not easy in the dark my lord there were rapids in places and the boulders were slippery i fancy the main pass is narrow although i could not see it and at montego bay asked hooper there was the guard over the fishing boats a halfcompany of the west indian regiment your excellency i had their officer awakened and he found me a horse and i took the road through cambridge and ipswich you got yourself remounts on the way i claimed i was on a mission of the greatest importance your excellency you made good time even then the patrol at mandeville told me his lordship was on his way to your excellency and so i rode straight to government house very sensible to the picture in hornblowers mind of the leap in the darkness were now added others of a nightmare journey down the river falling over slippery boulders rumbling into unexpected pools struggling along invisible banks then the endless weary ride i shall represent your conduct to the lords commissioners mr spendlove he said formally i must thank your lordship and i shall represent it to the secretary of state added hooper your excellency is too kind to hornblower it was not the least of spendloves achievements that spendlove had contrived somehow to gulp down a whole plateful of steak and onions while making his report the man must have learned to dispense with chewing enough of compliments said hooper mopping up his gravy with a piece of bread now we have to destroy these pirates this lair of theirs you say it is strong hornblower let spendlove answer impregnable to direct assault your excellency mm dye think theyll make a stand there for the past several minutes hornblower had been debating this point with himself those leaderless men dazed now by the complete failure of their scheme what would they do they could scatter all over the island your excellency said spendlove so they could then ill have to hunt them down patrols on every road movable columns in the mountains and the sicklist is high already troops exposed to the weather and the night air for long in the west indies died like flies and it might well take weeks to run the outlaws down maybe theyll scatter said hornblower and then he committed himself but in my opinion your excellency they will not hooper looked at him sharply you think not i think not your excellency that gang had been despairing as well as desperate when he had been among them there was something childlike about them leaderless as they were on the cliff they had shelter food they had a home if the expression could be tolerated they would not readily leave it and you say this place is impregnable it would mean a long siege i might reduce them quickly with a naval force your excellency if your excellency would give me leave to try your lordship is welcome to try anything that will save lives hooper was looking at him curiously then ill make my arrangements said hornblower youll go round to montego bay by sea yes hornblower restrained himself from saying of course soldiers always found it hard to realise the convenience of the sea for rapid and secret movements ill maintain my patrols in case they bolt while you smoke out the nest said hooper i think your excellency would be taking a wise precaution in doing so i trust my plan will not take long in execution with your excellencys leave hornblower rose from the table youre going now every hour is of importance your excellency hooper was looking at him more inquisitively than ever the navy displays its notorious reserve he said oh very well then order his lordships carriage you have my leave to try my lord report to me by courier there they were in the warm morning air sitting the three of them hornblower spendlove and gerard in the carriage the dockyard ordered hornblower briefly he turned to spendlove from the dockyard you will go on board clorinda and convey my order to captain fell to make ready for sea i shall be hoisting my flag within an hour then it is my order to you that you get yourself some rest aye aye my lord at the dockyard the captainsuperintendent did his best not to appear surprised at an unheralded visit from his admiral who by the last news had been kidnapped i want a boat mortar holmes said hornblower brushing aside the expressions of pleased surprise a boat mortar my lord yyes my lord theres one in store i know its to go on board clorinda at once now there are shells for it yes my lord uncharged of course ill have clorindas gunner charge em while were under way twenty pounds apiece i believe send two hundred with the fuses aye aye my lord and i want a punt two punts ive seen your hands using em for caulking and breaming twenty foot are they twentytwo foot my lord answered holmes he was glad that he could answer this question while his admiral had not insisted on an answer regarding so obscure a matter as the weight of boatmortar shells ill have two as i said send them round to be hove on deck aye aye my lord captain sir thomas fell had his best uniform on to greet his admiral i received your order my lord he said as the twittering of the pipes died away in a last wail very well sir thomas i want to be under way the moment the stores i have ordered are on board you can warp your ship out we are going to montego bay to deal with pirates aye aye my lord fell did his best not to look askance at the two filthy punts that he was expected to heave on to his spotless deck they were only the floating stages used in the dockyard for work on ships sides and the two tons of greasy mortar shells for which he had to find space were no better he was not too pleased when he was ordered to tell off the greater part of his ships company two hundred and forty men and all his marine detachment for a landing party the hands were naturally delighted with the prospect of a change of routine and the possibility of action the fact that the gunner was weighing out gunpowder and putting two pounds apiece in the shells a glimpse of the armourer going round with the admiral on an inspection of the boardingpikes the sight of the boat mortar squat and ugly crouching on its bed at the break of the forecastle all excited them it was a pleasure to thrash along to the westward under every stitch of canvas leaving portland point abeam rounding negril point at sunset catching some fortunate puffs of the sea breeze which enabled them to cheat the trade wind ghosting along in the tropical darkness with the lead at work in the chains and anchoring with the dawn among the shoals of montego bay the green mountains of jamaica all fiery with the rising sun hornblower was on deck to see it he had been awake since midnight having slept since sunset two almost sleepless nights had disordered his habits and he was already pacing the quarterdeck as the excited men were formed up in the waist he kept a sharp eye on the preparations that boat mortar weighed no more than four hundred pounds a mere trifle for the yardarm tackle to lower down into the punt alongside the musketmen were put through an inspection of their equipment it was puzzling to the crew that there were pikemen axemen and even malletmen and crowbarmen as well as the sun climbed higher and blazed down hotter the men began to file down into the boats gigs alongside my lord said gerard very well on shore hornblower returned the salute of the astonished subaltern commanding the detachment of the west indian regiment on guard over the boats he had turned out his men apparently expecting nothing less than a french invasion and dismissed him then he ran a final glance over the rigid lines of the marine detachment scarlet tunics and white crossbelts and all they would not be nearly as tidy by the end of the day you can make a start captain he said keep me informed mr spendlove if you please aye aye my lord with spendlove as guide the marines marched forward they were the advanced guard to secure the main body from surprise it was time to give orders to clorindas firstlieutenant now mr sefton we can move the little river had a little bar at its mouth but the two punts carrying the mortar and the ammunition had been floated in round it for a mile there was even a track beside the water and progress was rapid as they dragged the punts along while the vegetation closed in round them the shade was gratifying when they first entered into it but they found it breathless damp stifling as they progressed farther in mosquitoes stung with venomous determination men slipped and fell on the treacherous mudbanks splashing prodigiously then they reached the first stretch of shallows where the river came bubbling down a long perceptible slope between steep banks under the light filtering in through the trees at least they had saved a mile and more by water carriage even this far hornblower studied the grounded punts the soil and the trees this was what he had been thinking about it was worth making the experiment before putting the men to the toil of carrying the mortar up by brute force well try a dam here mr sefton if you please aye aye my lord axemen pikemen malletmen the men were still in high spirits it called for exertion on the part of the petty officers to restrain their exuberance a line of pikes driven head downward where the soil was soft enough to receive them formed the first framework of the dam axemen felled small trees with a childish delight in destruction crowbarmen levered at stumps and rocks a small avalanche came tumbling down into the river bed the water swirled about the trash already there was sufficient obstruction to hold it hornblower saw the level rise before his very eyes more rocks here roared sefton keep your eye on those punts mr sefton said hornblower the clumsy craft were already afloat again felled trees and rocks extended heightened and strengthened the dam there was water spouting through the interstices but not as much as was being held back get the punts upstream ordered hornblower four hundred willing hands had achieved much the water was banked up sufficient to float the punts twothirds of the way up the shallows another dam i think mr sefton if you please already they had learned much about the construction of temporary dams the stream bed was choked in a twinkling it seemed splashing kneedeep in water the men dragged the punts higher still they grounded momentarily but a final heave ran them over the last of the shallows into a reach where they floated with ease excellent mr sefton that was a clear gain of a quarter of a mile before the next shallows as they were preparing to work on the next dam the flat report of a musket shot came echoing back to them in the heated air followed by half a dozen more it was several minutes before they heard the explanation brought back by a breathless messenger captain seymour reports sir we was fired on by someone up there sir saw im in the trees sir but e got away very well so the pirates had posted a lookout downstream now they knew that a force was advancing against them only time would show what they would do next meanwhile the punts were afloat again and it was time to push on the river curved back and forth washing at the foot of vertical banks preserving for a time miraculously enough depth of water to float the punts at the expense of occasionally dragging them up slight rapids now it began to seem to hornblower as if he had spent days on this labour in the blinding patches of sunlight and the dark stretches of shade with the river swirling round his knees and his feet slipping on the rocks at the next dam he was tempted to sit and allow the sweat to stream down him he had hardly done so when another messenger arrived from the advanced guard captain seymour reporting sir e says to say the pirates ave gorn to ground sir theyre in a cave sir right up in the cliff how far ahead of here oh not so very fur sir hornblower could have expected no better answer he realised they was shooting at us sir supplemented the messenger that defined the distance better for they had heard no firing for a long time the pirates lair must be farther than the sound could carry very well mr sefton carry on if you please im going ahead come along gerard he set himself to climb and scramble along the river bank on his left hand as he progressed he noticed the bank was growing steeper and loftier now it was really a cliff another stretch of rapids at a corner and then he opened up a fresh vista there it was just as he remembered it the lofty overhanging cliff with the waterfall tumbling down it to join the river at its foot and the long horizontal seam half way up the cliff open grassland with a few trees on his right and even the little group of mules on the narrow stretch of grass between the cliff and the river redcoated marines were strung out over the grassland in a wide semicircle whose centre was the cave hornblower forgot his sweating fatigue and strode hastily forward to where he could see seymour standing among men gazing up at the cliff spendlove at his side they came to meet him and saluted there they are my lord said seymour they took a few shots at us when we arrived thank you captain how do you like the look of the place now spendlove as much as before my lord but no more spendloves leap said hornblower he was pressing forward along the river bank towards the cave staring upwards have a care my lord said spendlove urgently a moment after he had spoken something whistled sharply just above hornblowers head a puff of smoke appeared over the parapet of the cave and a sharp ringing report came echoing from the cliff face then made tiny by the distance dolllike figures appeared over the parapet waving their arms in defiance and the yells they were uttering came faintly to their ears someone has a rifle up there my lord said seymour indeed perhaps then it would be best to withdraw out of range before he can reload the incident had made little impression on hornblower until that moment now he suddenly realised that the almost legendary career of the great lord hornblower might have been terminated then and there that his future biographer might have had to deplore the ironic chance which after so many pitched battles brought him death at the hands of an obscure criminal in an unknown corner of a west indian island he turned and walked away the others at his side he found he was holding his neck rigid his muscles tense it had been a long time since his life was last in danger he strove to appear natural sefton will be up with the mortar before long he said after casting about in his mind for something natural to say and he hoped it did not sound as unnatural to the others as it did to him yes my lord where shall we site it he swung round and looked about him measuring ranges with his eye it had better be out of range of that rifle his interest in what he was doing immediately erased the memory of his danger another puff of smoke from the parapet another echoing report did anyone hear that bullet no then we can assume were out of rifle shot here if you please my lord asked spendlove what range can you expect with a boat mortar the encyclopedic spendlove displaying ignorance seven hundred yards with a onepound charge of powder and a time of flight of fifteen seconds but here we have to burst the shell sixty feet above the firingpoint a nice problem in ballistics hornblower spoke with perfect indifference confident that no one knew that at one oclock that morning he had been studying those figures in the manual those trees there will be useful when we come to sway the mortar up and theres level ground within twenty feet of them excellent here they come my lord the first of the main body appeared round the distant corner of the cliff hurrying along the river bank as they took in the situation they broke into a yell and a run leaping and scrambling over the broken ground hornblower was reminded of hounds rushing up clamouring at sight of their quarry at bay silence there he roared you midshipman there cant you keep your men under control mark their names for punishment and ill mention yours to mr sefton abashed the seamen formed up quietly here came the punts gliding like fate along the silent pool towed by working parties scrambling along the bank orders my lord asked sefton hornblower glanced finally round the terrain before issuing them the sun was long past its zenith as eager men clambered up the trees to fix the tackles soon the mortar hung dangling from a stout limb while the mortar bed was hoisted out and settled in a smooth spot the gunner fussing over it with a spirit level to make sure it was horizontal then with violent manual labour the mortar was swung over and finally heaved up into position and the gunner drove the keys through the eyebolts shall i open fire my lord asked sefton hornblower looked over at the distant seam in the face of the s cliff across the river the pirates there would be watchingthem had they recognised this squat object inconsiderable in size undistinguished in shape which meant death to them they might well not know what it was they were probably peering over the parapet trying to make out what it was that had occupied the attention of so considerable a body of men whats your elevation gunner sixty degrees sir my lord try a shot with a fifteensecond fuse the gunner went carefully through the processes of loading measuring the powder charge and wadding it down into the chamber clearing the touchhole with the priming iron and then filling it with finegrain powder from the horn he took his bradawl and drove it carefully into the wooden stem of the fuse at the selected point these were very newfangled fuses graduated with ink lines to mark the time of burning and screwed it into the shell he lowered the shell down upon the wad linstocks he said someone had been chipping away with flint and steel to catch a spark upon the slow match he transferred the glow to a second linstock which he handed to the gunner the gunner stooping checked the pointing of the weapon fuse he said his assistant touched his linstock down and the fuse spluttered then the gunner thrust his glowing match upon the touchhole a roar and a billow of powder smoke standing far back from the mortar hornblower already had his face turned to the sky to track the shell in its flight against that light blue there was nothing to be seen no there at the height of the trajectory there was a brief black streak instantly invisible again a further wait an inevitable thought that the fuse had failed and then a distant explosion and a fountain of smoke down at the base of the cliff somewhat to the right of the cave there was a groan from the watching seamen silence there bellowed sefton try again gunner said hornblower the mortar was trained round a trifle on its bed its bore was sponged out and when the charge had been put in the gunner took a gill measure from his pocket and added a measure of powder to the charge he pierced the fuse again lowered the shell into the bore gave his final order and fired a wait and then a bold puff of smoke hung in the air seemingly right in line with the seam in the cliff the wretched people there were watching their fate creeping up on them fuse a little short said hornblower range short i fancy my lord said the gunner at the next shot there was a cloud of dust and a small avalanche from the cliff face high above the seam and instantly afterwards the burst of the shell on the ground at the near edge of the river where it had fallen better said hornblower he had seen the principles of ranging with a mortar a huge thirteeninch one at the siege of riga nearly twenty years before two more shots both wasted the shells exploded at the top of their trajectory high high up apparently those newfangled fuses were not quite reliable fountains spouted momentarily from the river surface as fragments rained into it but the pirates must by now be fully aware of what the mortar implied give me that telescope gerard he trained the instrument on the seam in the face of the cliff he could see every detail now the rough stone parapet the waterfall at one end but he could see no sign of the garrison they were at the back of the cave or crouching behind the parapet fire another shot fifteen long seconds after the report then he saw fragments flying from under the overhang good shot he called still watching the shell must have fallen right into the cave but as he uttered the words a dark figure appeared at the parapet the arms swinging together he saw the tiny black disc of the shell against the background of rock curving downwards and then a burst of smoke someone had seized the hot shell in his two hands and slung it over the parapet in the nick of time a desperate deed pitch another shell there with a seconds less fuse and it will be all over he said and then wait surely those helpless people must surrender and not stay to be massacred what must he do to persuade them he knew perfectly well send a white flag forward my lord asked spendlove voicing his thoughts i was thinking about it said hornblower it would be a dangerous mission if the pirates were determined not to surrender they would not respect a flag of truce and would fire on the bearer of it there were a score of muskets and at least one rifle up there hornblower wanted neither to order someone forward nor to ask for a volunteer ill do it my lord said spendlove they know me this was the price he had to pay thought hornblower for his lofty position for being an admiral he had to order his friends to their death yet on the other hand very well said hornblower lets have your shirt and your pike my man said spendlove a white shirt tied by the sleeves to a pikestaff made a fair white flag as spendlove went forward with it through the cordon of redcoated marines hornblower was tempted to call him back it was only unconditional surrender that could be offered after all he went as far as to open his mouth but closed it again without saying the words he had in mind spendlove walked towards the river bank stopping every few seconds to wave the flag through the telescope hornblower could see nothing up in the cave then he saw a flash of metal and a line of heads and shoulders over the parapet a dozen muskets were taking aim at spendlove but spendlove saw them too and halted with a wave of his flag there were long seconds of tension and then spendlove turned his back upon the muskets and began to retrace his steps as he did so there was a puff of smoke from the parapet the rifleman had fired as soon as he had seen there was no chance of luring spendlove within musket shot spendlove came walking back trailing the pike and the shirt he missed me my lord he said thank god said hornblower gunner fire the wind may have shifted a little or the powder was not consistent the shell burst in the air just below the level of the cave so that the fuse must have been efficient but some considerable distance from the cliff fire again said hornblower there it was a burst of smoke a fountain of fragments right in the cave horrible to think of what was happening there fire again another burst right in the cave fire again no wait figures were appearing on the parapet there had been some survivors then from those two bursts two figures tiny dolls in the field of the telescope seemed to hang in the air as they leaped the telescope followed them down one struck water in a fountain of spray the other fell on the rocky shore broken and horrible he raised the telescope again there was the ladder being thrown over from the parapet there was a figure and another figure climbing down hornblower shut the telescope with a snap captain seymour send a party forward to secure the prisoners he did not have to see the horrors of the cave the mutilated dead and the screaming wounded he could see them in his minds eye when seymour made his report of what he found when he ascended the ladder it was done finished the wounded could be bandaged and carried down to the beach on litters to the death that awaited them the unwounded driven along with them with their wrists bound a courier could be sent off to the governor to say that the pirate horde had been wiped out so that the patrols could be called in and the militia sent home he did not have to set eyes on the wretched people he had conquered the excitement of the hunt was over he had set himself a task to do a problem to solve just as he might work out a longitude from lunar observations and he had achieved success but the measure of that success could be expressed in hangings in dead and in wounded in that shattered brokenbacked figure lying on the rocks and he had undertaken the task merely on a point of pride to reestablish his selfesteem after the indignity of being kidnapped it was no comfort to argue with himself as he did that what he had done would otherwise have been done by others at great cost in disease and in economic disturbance that only made him sneer at himself as a hairsplitting casuist there were few occasions when hornblower could do what was right in hornblowers eyes yet there was some cynical pleasure to be derived from his lofty rank to be able to leave all this after curt orders to sefton and seymour to bring the landing party back to the shore with the least delay and the shortest exposure to the night air to go back on board and eat a comfortable dinner even if it meant fells rather boring company and to sleep in a comfortable bed and it was pleasant to find that fell had already dined so that he could eat his dinner merely in the company of his flaglieutenant and his secretary nevertheless there was one more unexpected crumpled petal in his roseleaf bed and he discovered it contrariwise as a result of what he intended to be a kindly action i shall have to add a further line to my remarks about you to their lordships spendlove he said it was a brave deed to go forward with that flag of truce thank you my lord said spendlove who bent his gaze down on the tablecloth and drummed with his fingers before continuing eyes still lowered in unusual nervousness then perhaps your lordship will not be averse to putting in a word for me in another quarter of course i will replied hornblower in all innocence where thank you my lord it was with this in mind that i did the little you have been kind enough to approve of i would be deeply grateful if your lordship would go to the trouble of speaking well of me to miss lucy lucy hornblower had forgotten all about the girl he quite failed to conceal his surprise which was clearly apparent to spendlove when he lifted his glance from the tablecloth we jested about a wealthy marriage my lord said spendlove the elaborate care with which he was choosing his words proved how deep were his emotions i would not care if miss lucy had not a penny my lord my affections are deeply engaged she is a very charming young woman said hornblower temporising desperately my lord i love her burst out spendlove casting aside all restraint i love her dearly at the ball i tried to interest her in myself and i failed im sorry to hear that said hornblower i could not but be aware of her admiration for you my lord she spoke of your lordship repeatedly i realised even then that one word from you would carry more weight than a long speech from me if you would say that word my lord im sure you overestimate my influence said hornblower choosing his words as carefully as spendlove had done but he hoped not as obviously but of course i will do all i can there is no need for me to reiterate my gratitude my lord said spendlove this pleading creature this poor lovelorn fellow was the spendlove whose cool daring had risked a leap in the darkness down a sixtyfoot precipice hornblower remembered lucys lips on his hands remembered how she had followed him on her knees across the floor the less he had to do with any of this the better he decided but the passion of a child hardly out of the schoolroom for a man of mature years was likely to be fleeting transient and the memory of her lost dignity would later be as painful to her as it was to him she would find need to assert herself to show him that he was not the only man in the world and how could she demonstrate that more plainly than by marrying someone else to use a vulgar phrase there was quite a chance that spendlove might catch her on the rebound if good wishes can help he said you have all mine spendlove even an admiral had to choose his words with care two days later he was announcing his immediate departure to the governor im taking my squadron to sea in the morning your excellency he said arent you going to stay for the hangings asked hooper in surprise i fear not answered hornblower and added an unnecessary explanation hangings dont agree with me your excellency it was not merely an unnecessary explanation it was a foolish one as he knew as soon as he saw the open astonishment in hoopers face hooper could hardly have been more surprised at hearing that hangings did not agree with hornblower than he would have been if he had heard that hornblower did not agree with hangings and that was very nearly as correct the guns of carabobo she was exactly like a british ship of war naturally perhaps since she had been one most of her life until she was sold out of the service now as she came up into the harbour she could pass without question for a manowar brig except that she flew the royal yacht squadron burgee instead of a commission pendant hornblower put down the telescope through which he had been watching curiously her progress into kingston harbour and referred again to barbaras letter two months old now which had arrived a fortnight ago my dearest husband you are shortly going to have a visitor a mr charles ramsbottom a millionaire who has purchased an old ship of the navy to use as a yacht which he has named the bride of abydos and in which he proposes to visit the west indies he has only lately made his appearance in society having inherited his fathers fortune bradford wool and army clothing contracts yet despite this obscure origin he has succeeded in entering into society perhaps because he is very young very charming unmarried mildly eccentric and as i said a millionaire i have met him frequently of late in very good houses and i recommend him to you dearest if for no other reason than that he has won some small portion of my heart by a delightful mixture of deference and interest which i might have found irresistible were i not married to the most irresistible man in the world he has indeed won golden opinions in society both on the government side and with the opposition and he might become an important factor in politics should he decide to enter into them i have no doubt that he will bring you introductions from personages even more influential than your loving wife hornblower had to read the letter through to the end although it contained no further reference to mr charles ramsbottom but he returned again to the opening paragraph it was the first time he had ever seen this new word millionaire which occurred twice he disliked it on sight it was inconceivable that a man should have a million pounds and presumably not in broad estates but in factories and in stocks and shares probably with a huge holding in consols and an immense balance at the bank as well the existence of millionaires whether in society or not was something as distasteful as the word itself now called into existence and this one had been charming to barbara he was not too sure if that really constituted a recommendation he picked up the telescope again and watched the brig come to an anchor the rapidity with which she took in sail showed that she carried a large crew hornblower as a commanderinchief of a squadron and accountable to the niggardly lords of the admiralty for every penny expended knew perfectly well what this sort of thing cost this mr ramsbottom to indulge himself in his naval toy was expending enough money to maintain a thousand families in bread and beer and bacon the brig roundedto and anchored very neatly indeed if she had been a vessel included in his command he would have grunted with grudging satisfaction as it was he grunted with a mixture of envy and derision and turned away to await the inevitable call in the seclusion of admiralty house when it came he fingered the visiting card with its plain mr charles ramsbottom and found some small satisfaction in deciding that he had at last come across a name more unlovely than his own but the owner of the name when he was ushered in made a better impression in his very early twenties he was small and slight and for what it was worth strikingly handsome with black hair and eyes and what could only be described as chiselled features deeply tanned after weeks at sea not at all what might be expected of a bradford wool manufacturer while his darkgreen coat and formal white breeches were in quiet good taste my wife wrote to me about you mr ramsbottom said hornblower that was very kind of lady hornblower but of course she is kindness personified may i present my letters of introduction from lord liverpool and bishop wilberforce my lord barbara was perfectly right then in predicting that ramsbottom would win favour with both political parties here were letters from the prime minister himself and a prominent member of the opposition hornblower glanced through them and was conscious of an undernote of cordiality despite their formal wording excellent mr ramsbottom said hornblower he tried to adopt the tone which he presumed would be adopted by a man who had just read a letter of introduction from the prime minister is there any way in which i can be of service to you none that i am aware of at present my lord i must complete with water and stores naturally but my purser is a capable man i intend to continue my voyage through these charming islands of course said hornblower soothingly he could not imagine why anyone should voluntarily spend any time in these waters where piracy was still smouldering nor why anyone should wish to visit countries where malaria and yellow fever were endemic and where civil war revolution and massacre claimed even heavier toll you find the bride of abydos a comfortable ship asked hornblower those eighteengun brigs of the royal navy were notoriously unpleasant craft crowded and crank comfortable enough my lord thank you answered ramsbottom i lightened her by changing the armament she mounts only twelve guns now two long sixes and ten carronades twentyfourpounders instead of thirtytwopounders so you could still deal with a pirate oh yes indeed my lord and with the reduction in weight on deck a full ten tons and modifications in her sail plan i have made a seaworthy craft of her i believe and hope im sure you have mr ramsbottom said hornblower it was likely enough the brigsofwar were naturally crammed with guns and warlike stores to the limit of stability and human endurance so that a moderate reduction in dead weight might bring profound results in comfort and handiness it would give me the greatest pleasure went on mr ramsbottom if i could induce your lordship to visit me on board it would indeed be an honour and would gratify my crew perhaps i could even persuade your lordship to dine on board we can discuss that after you have dined with me mr ramsbottom replied hornblower remembering his manners and his obligation to invite to dinner any bearer of a reasonable introduction you are most kind my lord said mr ramsbottom i must of course present my introductions to his excellency at the earliest opportunity there was something quite winning about mr ramsbottoms smile as he said this an awareness and a tolerance of the rules of social etiquette a visitor to jamaica would normally be bound to pay his respects first to the governor but ramsbottom was no ordinary visitor as captain of a ship his first call was due to the naval authorities to hornblower in fact a trivial point as his smile implied but etiquette being etiquette trivial points demanded strict attention by the time ramsbottom took his leave he had made a very good impression on the reluctant hornblower he had talked sensibly about ships and the sea he was easy and natural in his manner and not in the least like lord byron who was probably more responsible than anyone else for the growing fad for yachting among the wealthy hornblower was even prepared to forgive him for having won some small portion of barbaras heart and in the course of his several days stay in jamaica hornblower really came to like the young man especially after having lost two pounds to him in a desperate tussle at whist and then winning ten pounds back in another tussle where admittedly ramsbottom encountered a run of bad luck jamaican society gave ramsbottom a warm welcome even the governor looked on him with approval and the governors wife lady hooper was loud in her praises of his excellent manners and considerate ways i wouldnt have expected it of a bradford manufacturers son said hooper grudgingly are you dining on board the bride of abydos sir asked hornblower i am going there to dinner answered hooper who enjoyed food but seeing that it is only a yacht i have little hope of dining hornblower arrived on board early at ramsbottoms suggestion so as to have time to inspect the vessel he was received in navy fashion with sideboys attending the side and a long flourish on boatswains pipes as he stepped on board he looked keenly about him even while he shook ramsbottoms hand he could not have said he was not in a kings ship as his eye took in the gleaming white deck the ropes coiled in perfect symmetry the gleaming trophy of pikes and cutlasses against the bulkhead the brass winking in the sunshine the disciplined orderly crew in blue jumpers and white trousers may i present my officers my lord asked ramsbottom they were two halfpay lieutenants hardbitten men as hornblower shook their hands he told himself that if it had not been for a dozen strokes of luck he himself might still be a lieutenant perhaps eking out his halfpay by serving in a rich mans yacht as ramsbottom led him forward he recognised one of the hands standing at attention by a gun you were with me in the renown out here in he said yes sir my lord so i was sir the man grinned with uneasy pleasure as he shyly took hornblowers outstretched hand and charlie kemp sir my lord over there sir e was with you in the baltic and bill cummings up on the focsle e was foretopman in the lydia round the horn with you sir my lord glad to see you again said hornblower that was true but he was equally glad that he had not been under the necessity of remembering names he moved on you seem to have a navy crew mr ramsbottom he remarked yes my lord they are nearly all manowars men in these years of peace and depression it would be easy enough to recruit a crew thought hornblower ramsbottom might be considered to be doing a public service in providing easy employment for these men who had deserved well of their country listening to the sharp orders given as the crew was put through their paces hornblower could not suppress a smile it was a harmless enough fad he supposed for ramsbottom to indulge himself in playing at commanding a ship of war you have a most efficient ship and a welltrained crew mr ramsbottom he said it is a pleasure to hear your lordship say so you have seen no service yourself none my lord there was a certain degree of surprise still to be found in the fact that in this year of there were to be found grown men even heads of families who nevertheless had been too young to see service in the wars that had devastated the world for a whole generation it made hornblower feel like a centenarian here come further guests my lord if you will pardon me two planters hough and doggart and then the chief justice of the island so the arrival of the governor would make a dinner party of six three officials and three men in private life they gathered under the awning which stretched across the main boom shaded the quarterdeck and watched the reception of his excellency do you think the dinner will come up to the ceremonial asked doggart ramsbottoms purser bought two tons of ice yesterday said hough at sixpence a pound that bids fair commented doggart jamaica was the centre of a small trade in ice brought down from new england in fast schooners cut and stored away in deep places during the winter it was hurried to the caribbean insulated in a packing of sawdust at the height of summer it commanded fantastic prices hornblower was interested he was more interested still in the sight of a seaman down in the waist steadily turning a crank it did not seem a very hard labour although unremitting he could not for the life of him think of what function that crank could play in the life of the ship the guests made their bows to his excellency and at his suggestion seated themselves in the comfortable chairs a steward appeared at once passing round glasses of sherry excellent by george exclaimed the governor after his first cautious sip none of your olorosos none of your sweet sticky dark sherries the governor by virtue of his reputed royal blood as well as in consequence of his position could make remarks that well might appear rude in another man but the sherry was indeed delightful pale dry infinitely delicate in flavour and bouquet cool but not chilled a new sound struck on hornblowers ear and he turned and looked forward at the foot of the mainmast a small orchestra had struck up of various stringed instruments whose names he had never bothered to learn except for the fiddle if it were not for the intrusion of this horrible music there could be nothing more delightful than to sit under an awning on the deck of a wellfound ship with the sea breeze just beginning to come in drinking this excellent sherry the governor made a small gesture which brought a fresh glass promptly to him ah said the governor you keep a good orchestra mr ramsbottom it was well known that the royal family inherited a taste for music i must thank your excellency said ramsbottom and the glasses went round again before he turned an ear to the murmured words of the steward your excellency my lord gentlemen dinner is served they filed down the companion apparently every bulkhead had been taken down in the after part of the ship to make a cabin spacious though low the carronades on either side struck a subdued warlike note in a scene of luxury for there were flowers everywhere the dining table stood in the centre concealed under a glittering linen cloth wind scoops at the scuttles helped to deflect the trade wind into the cabin which under the double shade of the awning and the deck was pleasantly cool but hornblowers eye at once caught sight of a couple of strange objects like small wheels set in two scuttles and ceaselessly whirling round then he knew why the seaman was turning that crank in the waist he was driving these two wheels which by some ingenious mechanism propelled currents of air from outside into the cabin acting like windmill vanes but in the opposite sense seated at the table in accordance with the courteous indications of their host the guests awaited the serving of the dinner the first course made its appearance two ample dishes set in dishes even more ample filled with cracked ice the inner dishes held a grey granular substance caviare exclaimed his excellency helping himself liberally after his first astonished stare i hope it is to your taste sir said ramsbottom and i hope you will accompany it with some of the vodka here it is the same as is served at the russian imperial table conversation regarding caviare and vodka occupied the attention of all during the first course the last time hornblower had tasted the combination was during the defence of riga in the experience enabled him to add his quota to the conversation the next course made its appearance you gentlemen are accustomed to this dish said ramsbottom but i need not apologise for it it is i believe one of the delicacies of the islands it was flying fish certainly no need to apologise when it is served like this commented his excellency your chef de cuisine must be a man of genius the sauce that came with it had the merest hint of mustard ock or champagne my lord murmured a voice in hornblowers ear hornblower had already heard the governor answer the same question with ill try the hock first the champagne was dry and insidiously delicate an ideal companion for the food the great eaters of antiquity nero or vitellius or lucullus had never known what it was like to partake of champagne and flying fish youll be living differently from this soon hornblower said his excellency no doubt about that sir ramsbottom between them looked a polite inquiry your lordships going to sea next week replied hornblower i take my squadron to sea for exercises before the coming of the hurricane season of course that would be necessary to maintain efficiency agreed ramsbottom the exercises will last for long a couple of weeks or more said hornblower i have to keep my men accustomed to hard tack and salt pork and water from the cask and yourself too chuckled the governor myself too agreed hornblower ruefully and you take your whole squadron my lord asked ramsbottom all i can i work em hard and try to make no exceptions a good rule i should think said ramsbottom the soup that followed the flying fish was a fiery mulligatawny well adapted to west indian palates good was the governors brief comment after his first spoonful the champagne went round again and conversation became livelier and livelier and ramsbottom deftly kept it going what news from the mainland sir he asked the governor this fellow bolivar is he making any progress he fights on answered the governor but spain hurries out reinforcements whenever her own troubles permit the government at caracas is looking for the arrival of more at this moment i believe then they may be able to conquer the plains and drive him out again you know he was a refugee here in this very island a few years ago indeed sir all the guests at the table were interested in the desperate civil war that was being fought on the mainland massacre and murder blind heroism and devoted selfsacrifice loyalty to the king and thirst for independence all these were to be found in venezuela war and pestilence were laying waste the fertile plains and depopulating the crowded cities how will the spaniards stand now that maracaibo has revolted hornblower asked the governor its not a serious loss sir as long as they have the use of la guaira their sea communications remain open the roads are so bad that caracas has always made use of la guaira to preserve contact with the outside world its only an open roadstead but it provides good anchorage has maracaibo revolted your excellency asked ramsbottom mildly the news came this morning a feather in bolivars cap after his recent defeats his army must have been growing disheartened his army sir this was the chief justice speaking half his men are british infantry hornblower knew that to be true british veterans formed the backbone of bolivars army the llaneros the men of the venezuelan plains supplied him with a brilliant cavalry but not with the material for permanent conquest even british infantry could grow disheartened in a hopeless cause said the governor solemnly the spaniards control most of the coast ask the admiral here thats so agreed hornblower theyve made it hard for bolivars privateers i hope youre not going to venture into that turmoil mr ramsbottom said the governor theyll make short work of you if you do added the chief justice the dons will tolerate no interference theyll snatch you up and youll languish in a spanish prison for years before we can extricate you from king ferdinands clutches unless jail fever carries you off first or they hang you as a pirate i have certainly no intention of venturing near the mainland said ramsbottom at least not while this war continues it is a pity because venezuela was my mothers country and it would give me pleasure to visit it your mothers country mr ramsbottom asked the governor yes sir my mother was a venezuelan lady there i would be carlos ramsbottom y santona most interesting remarked the governor and more grotesque than horatio hornblower it was significant of the worldwide interests of british commerce that a bradford woollen manufacturer should have a venezuelan mother at any rate it accounted for ramsbottoms dark almost swarthy good looks i can very well wait until peace is settled one way or the other said ramsbottom offhandedly there will be other voyages to make meanwhile sir let me call your attention to this dish here the main course had now arrived on the table roast chickens and a leg of pork as well as the dish that ramsbottom indicated what lay in it was concealed by poached eggs covering the surface a made dish asked the governor doubtfully his tone indicated that at this stage of the dinner he looked rather for a substantial roast please try it sir said ramsbottom coaxingly the governor helped himself and tasted cautiously pleasant enough he decided what is it a ragout of preserved beef answered ramsbottom can i persuade you gentlemen to try it my lord at least it was something new it was like nothing hornblower had ever tasted before certainly not in the least like the beef preserved in brine which he had eaten for twenty years extremely good said hornblower how is it preserved ramsbottom made a gesture to the waiting steward who laid a square box apparently of iron upon the table it weighed heavy in hornblowers hand glass serves equally well explained ramsbottom but it is not as convenient on shipboard the steward was now at work upon the iron box with a stout knife he cut it open and prized back the top and offered it for inspection a tinned box went on ramsbottom sealed at a high temperature i venture to suggest that this new method will make a noticeable difference to the food supply on shipboard this beef can be eaten cold on removal from the box or it can be hashed as you have it here and the poached egg asked the governor that was the inspiration of my cook sir discussion of this new invention and of the excellent burgundy served with this course distracted attention from the troubles of venezuela and even from ramsbottoms venezuelan mother conversation became general and somewhat disjointed as the wine flowed hornblower had drunk as much as he desired and with his habitual dislike of excess contrived to avoid drinking more it was noticeable that ramsbottom remained sober as well cool and quietvoiced while the other faces grew redder and redder and the cabin echoed to the roaring toasts and the bursts of inconsequential song hornblower guessed that his host was now finding the evening as tedious as he himself found it he was glad when at last his excellency rose supporting himself by the table to take his leave a damned good dinner he said and youre a damned good host ramsbottom wish there were more like you hornblower shook hands it was very good of you to come my lord said ramsbottom i regret that i must take this opportunity to say goodbye to your lordship you are sailing soon in a couple of days i expect my lord i trust you will find your squadron exercises satisfactory thank you very much where will you head for now i shall beat back through the windward channel my lord perhaps i shall see something of the bahamas be careful of your navigation there i must wish you good luck and a pleasant voyage i shall write to my wife and tell her of your visit please give lady hornblower my best wishes and respects my lord ramsbottoms good manners persisted to the end he remembered to send round his cards pour prendre cong before he left and mothers of unmarried daughters much regretted his leaving hornblower saw the bride of abydos in the early dawn reaching to the eastward to round morant point with the land breezes and then forgot about her in the bustle of taking his squadron to sea for exercises it never failed to raise a wry smile on his face when he looked about him at his majestys ships and vessels in the west indies under his command in wartime he would have had a powerful fleet now he had three small frigates and a motley collection of brigs and schooners but they would serve his purpose in his scheme the frigates became threedeckers and the brigs seventyfours and the schooners frigates he had a van a centre and a rear he cruised in formation ready to meet the enemy with rasping reprimands soaring up his signal halliards when any ship failed to keep station he cleared for action and he turned by divisions into fighting line ahead he tacked to double on the imaginary enemys line in pitch darkness he would burn blue lights with the signal enemy in sight so that a score of captains and a thousand seamen came tumbling from their beds to deal with the nonexistent foe without warning he would hang out a signal putting the most junior lieutenants in command of their respective ships and then he would plunge into intricate manoeuvres calculated to turn the anxious substantive captains looking helplessly on grey with anxiety but those junior lieutenants might some day be commanding ships of the line in a battle on which the destiny of england might depend and it was necessary to steel their nerves and accustom them to handle ships in dangerous situations in the middle of sail drill he would signal flagship on fire all boats away he called for landing parties to storm nonexistent batteries on some harmless uninhabited cay and he inspected those landing parties once they were on shore to the last flint in the last pistol with a rigid disregard for excuses that made men grind their teeth in exasperation he set his captains to plan and execute cuttingout expeditions and he commented mordantly on the arrangements for defence and the methods of attack he paired off his ships to fight singleship duels sighting each other on the horizon and approaching ready to fire the vital opening broadside he took advantage of calms to set his men to work towing and sweeping in desperate attempts to overtake the ship ahead he worked his crews until they were ready to drop and then he devised further tasks for them to prove to them that they still had one more effort left in them so that it was doubtful whether old horny was mentioned more often with curses or with admiration it was a toughened squadron that hornblower led back to kingston but while clorinda was still working up into the harbour a shore boat came pulling out to her with on board an aidedecamp of the governors with a note for hornblower sir thomas would you have the kindness to call away my barge asked hornblower there was much apparent need for haste for the note from government house said briefly my lord it is necessary that your lordship should attend here at the earliest possible moment to offer an explanation regarding the situation in venezuela your lordship is therefore requested and required to report to me immediately augustus hooper governor hornblower naturally had no idea of what had happened in venezuela for the last two weeks and more he made no guess while the carriage took him up to government house at its best pace and in any case if he had tried he would never have succeeded in coming near to the truth what is all this hornblower were the governors opening words to him what authority have you for blockading the venezuelan coast why was i not informed ive done nothing of the sort replied hornblower indignantly but damn it man ive the proof here ive dutchmen and spaniards and half the nations of the earth here all protesting about it i assure you sir i have taken no action on the venezuelan coast i have not been within five hundred miles of it then what does this mean shouted the governor look here at this he held some papers up with one hand and slapped wildly at them with the other so that hornblower had some difficulty in taking them from him hornblower was bewildered already he was more bewildered still as he read one paper was an official dispatch in french from the dutch governor of curaao the other was larger and clearer and he read it first it was a big sheet of paper with bold writing whereas it began notice has been received by the lords commissioners for executing the office of the lord high admiral from the right honourable viscount castlereagh one of his britannic majestys principal secretaries of state concerning the need to establish a blockade of the coast of his most catholic majestys dominion of venezuela and of the islands pertaining to the dominion of his majesty the king of the netherlands namely and to wit curaao aruba and bonaire therefore i horatio lord hornblower knight grand cross of the most honourable order of the bath rearadmiral of the white squadron commanding his britannic majestys ships and vessels in west indian waters hereby proclaim that the coast of the continent of south america from cartagena to the dragons mouth and the dutch islands aforesaid of curaao aruba and bonaire are now in a state of blockade and that any vessel of whatever description whether carrying materials of war or not found attempting to enter any port harbour or roadstead within the territory so defined or hovering with the intent to enter any such port harbour or roadstead will be boarded and sent in for adjudication under his britannic majestys high court of admiralty and will be condemned and seized without compensation to owners freight owners charterers captain or crew given under my hand this first day of june hornblower rearadmiral having read this document hornblower was able to spare a second glance at the other it was a vigorous protest from the dutch governor at curaao demanding explanations apologies the immediate withdrawal of the blockade and exemplary compensation hornblower stared at hooper in astonishment this is in legal form he said indicating the proclamation but i never signed it this is not my signature then spluttered hooper i thought you might be acting under secret orders from london of course not sir hornblower stared at hooper for another long second before the explanation came to him ramsbottom what do you mean hes been posing as me or as one of my officers at least is the dutch officer who brought this available hes waiting in the next room theres a spaniard there too sent over in a fishing boat by morillo from la quaira can we have them in sir the dutchman and the spaniard were men full of indignation which was not abated in the least by their presentation to the admiral responsible in their minds for this trouble the dutchman spoke fluent english and it was to him that hornblower first addressed himself how was this proclamation delivered he asked by one of your ships by one of your officers what ship the brigofwar desperate i have no such ship theres none in the navy list who brought it the captain who was he what was he like he was an officer a commander with epaulettes in uniform in full uniform young old very young small slender handsome yes hornblower exchanged a glance with hooper and this brig the desperate about a hundred and seventy tons bowsprit sieved nearly level mainmast stepped rather far aft yes that settles it sir said hornblower to hooper and to the dutchman youve been fooled im sorry to say this man was an impostor this proclamation is a forgery the dutchman stamped with annoyance he was unable to find words to express himself in a foreign tongue for some moments finally from his splutterings emerged a name which he repeated until it was understandable the helmond the helmond what is the helmond sir asked hornblower one of our ships your ship this desperate captured her a valuable ship she had on board the guns for the spanish army two batteries of field artillery guns limbers ammunition everything piracy exclaimed hooper it sounds like it said hornblower the spanish officer had been standing by impatiently apparently only half understanding the english conversation hornblower turned to him and after desperately trying to recapture his halfforgotten spanish entered upon a limping explanation the spaniard replied volubly so volubly that more than once hornblower had to ask him to speak more slowly ramsbottom had come sailing into la guaira and had brought his precious proclamation with him at the merest hint that the british navy was instituting a blockade no ship had dared to stir on the south american coast except for the helmond she had been badly needed bolivar was marching on caracas a battle was imminent on which depended the entire spanish control of venezuela morillo and the spanish army were in need of artillery now not only were they left destitute but with this news it could be taken as certain that those guns those two batteries of field artillery were in bolivars hands the spanish officer wrung his hands in despair hornblower translated briefly for the governors benefit and hooper shook his head in sympathy bolivar has those guns no doubt about it gentlemen i much regret this occurrence but i must impress upon you that his majestys government assumes no responsibility for it if your chiefs took no steps to detect this impostor that touched off a new explosion the british government should make sure that no impostor wore its uniform or posed as an officer in its service it called for all hoopers elephantine tact to quiet down the angry officers if you will permit me to consult with the admiral gentlemen we may reach some satisfactory conclusion alone with the governor again hornblower struggled with a smile he had never outgrown his tendency to laugh during a crisis there was something amusing in the thought that a cocked hat and a pair of epaulettes should change the course of a war it was a tribute to the power of the navy that a single tiny ship should exert such enormous pressure ramsbottom and his venezuelan mother said hooper its not merely piracy its high treason we shall have to hang him mm said hornblower he probably holds a privateering commission from bolivar but masquerading as a british officer forging official documents that was a ruse of war an american officer deceived the portuguese authorities in brazil in much the same way in ive heard some things about you too added hooper with a grin no doubt sir in war a belligerent who believes what hes told is a fool but were not belligerents no sir and weve suffered no loss the dutch and the spaniards have only themselves to blame but ramsbottoms a subject of his majesty quite true sir but if he holds bolivars commission he can do things as an officer of the revolutionary forces which he could not do as a private person dye mean to suggest we ought to allow him to continue this blockade of his nonsense man of course not sir ill arrest him and ill send his ship in for adjudication at the first opportunity but a friendly power has asked you sir the representative of his majesty if you have instituted a blockade you must do everything in your power to demonstrate the truth now for once youre talking like a sensible man we must send word at once to curaao and caracas that will be your immediate duty youd better go in person yes sir ill sail with the land breeze have you any further instructions for me sir none whatever what goes on on the high seas is your affair not mine youre answerable to the cabinet through the admiralty i dont envy you frankly no doubt ill survive sir ill sail for la guaira and send another vessel to curaao perhaps if your excellency were to write official replies to the enquiries addressed to you they would be ready by the time i sail ill draft em now the governor could not repress one further outburst this ramsbottom and his corned beef and caviare he used a sprat to catch a mackerel your excellency said hornblower so it came about that the crew of hms clorinda did not spend that night in the debauchery of kingston as they had expected instead they worked until dawn completing with stores and water so hard that they had no breath to spare to curse the admiral who did these things to them in the very first light of morning they warped their ship out with the aid of the faint puffs of the land breeze and clorinda her admirals flag flying at the mizzen headed closehauled to the southeastward on her thousandmile voyage to la guaira she had on board brigadiergeneral don manuel ruiz morillos representative to whom hornblower had offered a passage back to his headquarters the man was in a fever to return and put an end to ramsbottoms blockade it was clear that the royal forces in venezuela were hard pressed he had no thought for anything else during that voyage the lovely sunsets meant to him merely that another day had gone by without his reaching his destination the gallant way in which clorinda held her course closehauled shouldering the long rollers aside in showers of spray held no fascination for him for she was not flying before the wind at her best speed at noon each day when the ships position was pricked off on the chart he would look long and despairingly estimating by eye the further distance to be traversed he had not had sufficient experience at sea to acquire the knack of resigning himself to the influence of forces beyond human control when the wind drew southerly and foul as it did for two days consecutively he was clearly on the verge of accusing hornblower of being in league with his enemies and made no attempt to understand hornblowers soothing explanation that on the starboard tack on which clorinda was compelled to lie they were making easting which might be invaluable in possible later eventualities he resented the caution of captain fell which led to clorindas shortening sail as they entered the dangerous proximity of grand cay and at dawn next day he was climbing the foremast shrouds as high as he dared looking out for the first sight of the mountains of venezuela and even then he did not recognise as land the blue streak which he saw a shore boat came out to them before ever they dropped anchor and there was an urgent conference on clorindas quarterdeck between ruiz and the officer it brought out my general is in carabobo said ruiz to hornblower a battle is going to be fought bolivar is marching on puerto cabello and my general has taken the army to meet him where is ramsbottom and his ship ruiz looked to the arrival for the information near puerto cabello that was of course the likeliest place a hundred miles or less to the westward a roadstead where supplies might possibly be landed and an ideal situation for intercepting all communications between curaao and la guaira then i shall head for puerto cabello said hornblower you can accompany me if you wish don manuel the wind is fair and ill land you there quicker than a horse would carry you ruiz hesitated for a moment he knew all about horses and he was suspicious about ships but the advantage was so obvious that he accepted very well then said hornblower sir thomas well hoist that anchor again if you would be so kind set a course for puerto cabello now clorinda had the lusty trade wind on her quarter her best point of sailing she had her studding sails out and every possible stitch of canvas out and she flew along a horse at full gallop might go faster but no horse could do as clorinda was doing and maintain full speed for hour after hour nor could any horse ever attain full speed on the mountain tracks of the maritime andes naturally no amount of speed could satisfy ruiz with telescope to his eye he watched the distant coast go by until his weary eye was almost blind and then he paced about the quarterdeck trickles of sweat running down his forehead and cheeks as the sun climbing to its noontide height blazed vertically down on him he turned a suspicious eye on hornblower when the crew of clorinda poured aloft to take in sail we are going in to shore now general explained hornblower soothingly the leadsmen were in the chains as clorinda headed in towards the roadstead in the middle of their chant ruiz suddenly turned to hornblower and stood rigid listening to another more distant sound cannons he said hornblower strained his ears the faintest almost imperceptible noise and then silence save for the sound of the ship through the water and the bustle of preparing to come to an anchor order the still for a moment if you please sir thomas now the leadsmen ceased their chant and every man in clorinda stood silent even though the wind still played through the rigging and the sea chattered alongside a very distant flat detonation another two more thank you sir thomas you may carry on now cannons repeated ruiz glaring at hornblower they are fighting the battle somewhere on the outskirts of puerto cabello royalists and republicans were locked in combat and those guns that they had heard they might well be those that the helmond had carried now in the hands of the insurgents and firing upon their legal owners the fact that artillery was being employed indicated a pitched battle no petty skirmish over there the fate of venezuela was being decided ruiz was pounding his fist into his open palm sir thomas kindly have a boat ready to land the general without delay as the gig pulled away from clorindas side hornblower looked up at the sun called up before his minds eye the chart of the venezuelan coast and reached a further decision as always in the service a long dull interval had heralded a period of activity as the gig came skimming back again he was ready with his next order will you be so good as to make sail again sir thomas we can continue to search to the westward for ramsbottom while daylight lasts it was desirable to obtain the earliest possible news of the result of the battle but it was also or more desirable to lay hands on ramsbottom as quickly as might be they had not sighted him between la guaira and puerto cabello he could not be much farther along the coast the sun was descending now dazzling the lookouts as they peered towards it while clorinda continued her course along the shores of the province of carabobo not so far ahead the land trended abruptly northward to san juan point a lee shore it was curious that ramsbottom should have gone even this far to leeward unless he had put up his helm and headed clear away guessing that his period of grace was at an end deck there the lookout at the foretopgallant masthead was hailing theres summat on the port bow just in sight right in the eye of the sun but it may be a ship sir a ships masts an yards sir with no sail set it would be incredible that ramsbottom had anchored here on this dangerous lee shore but incredible things have to be done in war clorinda had long ago taken in her studding sails now after a sharp order from fell and five minutes activity on the part of her crew she was gliding along under topsails and headsails alone the sun sank into a bank of cloud suffusing it with scarlet deck there two ships sir at anchor one of ems a brig sir a brig ramsbottom almost for certain now with the sun behind the cloud it was possible to train a telescope in the direction indicated there they were sharp and clear against the sunset silhouetted in black against the scarlet cloud the masts and yards of a ship and a brig at anchor sir thomas was looking to hornblower for orders approach as close as you consider advisable if you please sir thomas and a boarding party ready to take possession an armed boarding party my lord as you please hell never dare to oppose us by force the guns of the brig were not run out there were no boarding nettings rigged in any case the little brig stood no chance in an unsheltered anchorage against a frigate ill anchor if i may my lord certainly that was the bride of abydos without a doubt no mistaking her at all and the other one most likely the helmond with the revolt of maracaibo this part of the coast had fallen into the power of the insurgents the batteries of field artillery that she had carried could be rafted ashore here there was a beach in that little cove where it would be possible and delivered to the insurgent army gathering for its march on puerto cabello ramsbottom his task completed would presumably be prepared to brazen it out pleading as hornblower had already guessed some privateering commission from bolivar ill go with the boarding party sir thomas fell shot a questioning glance admirals had no business boarding strange craft from small boats not only when bullets might fly but when one of the infinite variety of accidents possible in small boats might lead to an elderly and not so active senior officer being dropped overside and never coming up again with endless trouble later for the captain hornblower could follow fells train of thought but he was not going to wait quiescent on clorindas quarterdeck until a report came back from the bride of abydos not when a word would give him the power of finding out several minutes earlier ill get your sword and pistols my lord said gerard nonsense said hornblower look there he had kept his telescope trained on the anchored ships and had detected a significant activity around them boats were pulling hastily away from both of them and heading for the shore ramsbottom seemed to be absconding come along said hornblower he ran to the ships side and leaped for the boats falls sliding down clumsily cost him some of the skin from his soft palms cast off pull he ordered as gerard tumbled in beside him pull the boat swung away from the ships side soared giddily up a swell and down again the men throwing their weight on the oars but the boat that was leaving the bride of abydos was not being handled in the manowar fashion one would have expected of ramsbottom the oars were being plied without any coordination the boat swung round on the swell and then as somebody caught a crab swung round again in next to no time hornblower found himself alongside the struggling craft the men at the oars were not the spruce seamen he had seen on board the bride of abydos they were swarthy men clothed in rags nor was that ramsbottom in the sternsheets instead it was someone with a heavy black moustache wearing some vestiges of a blue and silver uniform the reddening sunset glared down upon him who are you demanded hornblower and then repeated the question in spanish the boat had ceased its struggles and was lying on its oars rising and falling on the swell lieutenant perez of the first regiment of infantry of the army of greater colombia greater colombia that was what bolivar called the republic he was trying to establish by his rebellion against spain where is mr ramsbottom the admiral has been on shore for the last week the admiral don carlos ramsbottom y santona admiral of the navy of greater colombia an admiral no less what were you doing on board that ship i was taking care of her until your excellency came is there nobody on board then nobody the boats soared up a swell and sank down again it was a sickly thing to do not conducive to logical thought he had been prepared to arrest ramsbottom but it would be another matter to arrest a lieutenant of infantry in territorial waters where is the crew of the ship on shore with the admiral with the army fighting for bolivar presumably and presumably as artillerymen serving the stolen guns very well you may go it was sufficient to make sure of the bride of abydos there was no purpose in laying hands on men of bolivars army who had only been obeying the orders of their superiors lay me alongside the brig in the fading light the deck of the bride of abydos was not in too great disorder the departing crew had apparently left everything shipshape and the caretaking party of south american soldiers had not disturbed anything although below deck it would probably be a different story but what would have happened if a gale had blown up in this perilous anchorage on a lee shore would not bear thinking about presumably ramsbottom had not cared what happened to his little ship once he had brought off his coup ahoy ahoy someone was hailing through a speaking trumpet from the other ship hornblower took the speaking trumpet from its becket by the wheel and hailed back i am admiral lord hornblower of his britannic majestys service i am coming aboard it was almost dark when he mounted to the deck of the helmond to be welcomed by the light of a couple of lanterns the captain who greeted him was a thickset man speaking excellent english with a marked accent dutch presumably you have not arrived too soon sir was his uncompromising beginning not the way to address any officer of the royal navy certainly not an admiral and a peer ill thank you to be civil snapped hornblower his temper frayed two angry men faced each other in the wavering light and then the dutchman realised that it would be better to restrain his illtemper in dealing with someone who after all had the power on this lonely coast to enforce any orders he might issue please come below sir he said perhaps a glass of schnapps it was a comfortable wellfurnished cabin in which hornblower was offered a seat and a glass i was glad when i saw your topsails sir said the dutch captain for ten days i have been through misery my ship my cargo this shore the disjointed words conveyed the anxieties of finding himself in the hands of the insurgents and of being compelled to anchor off a lee shore with an armed guard on board what happened asked hornblower that damned little brig fired a shot across my bows with bonaire still in sight they boarded me when i hoveto put an armed party on board i thought she was one of yours a shipofwar they brought me here and anchored and the army came out to us that was when i knew she was not a shipofwar not british then they took your cargo they did twelve ninepounder field guns with limbers and caissons and horse harness one ammunition waggon one repair cart with tools two thousand rounds of ammunition one ton of gunpowder in kegs everything the dutchman was obviously quoting verbatim from his bill of lading how did they get it ashore on rafts those britishers worked like madmen and there were seamen among them it was a handsome admission hardly grudging presumably kegpontoons had been employed hornblower told himself that he would have tackled the problem of getting the cargo on to the beach in that way at least presumably a good deal of unskilled labour had been provided on shore by the insurgent forces but that hardly detracted from the achievement and then every single man went off with the guns asked hornblower every man not too many for twelve guns not too many the bride of abydos carried a crew of some seventyfive men hardly sufficient in fact to man two batteries in action and they left a venezuelan guard on board yes you saw them go when you came they kept me here at anchor on a lee shore that of course was to prevent the dutchman spreading the news of the fraud that had been practised those those brigands knew nothing about ships the dutchman was continuing his tale of tribulation the desperate started dragging her anchor once i had to send my own men you were lucky they didnt burn your ship said hornblower luckier still they didnt plunder it youre lucky not to be in some prison on shore that may be so but as it is sir said hornblower rising you are free you can use the land breeze to make an offing tomorrow night you can anchor in willemstadt but my cargo sir i have been detained i have been in danger my countrys flag your owners can take action as they please i understand that ramsbottom is a wealthy man he can be sued for damages but but the dutchman could find no words that would express adequately his feelings regarding both his recent treatment and hornblowers scant sympathy your government can address protests of course to the government of greater colombia or to king ferdinand hornblower kept his face expressionless as he made the ridiculous suggestion i must congratulate you sir on your escape from very serious dangers i trust you will have a prosperous voyage home he had freed the helmond and he had laid hands on the bride of abydos that much he had accomplished so far said hornblower to himself as the boat took him back to clorinda the governments at home could squabble over the legal details if they cared to go to the trouble what the cabinet and the admiralty would think about his actions he could not imagine he was conscious of a slight chill of apprehension when his mind dwelt upon that side of the situation but an admiral could not show apprehension to anyone certainly not to a captain as stupid as sir thomas fell ill be obliged sir thomas he said when he regained clorindas deck if you will send a prize crew on board the brig would you please be good enough to instruct the officer whom you put in command to keep company with us we shall sail for puerto cabello again as soon as it is convenient to you fell might be stupid but he was a capable seaman hornblower could leave to him the anxious business of making his way back along the coast at night the land breeze fluky and unpredictable though it might be afforded an opportunity which must not be missed of regaining the precious miles that had been squandered to leeward hornblower could go down into his stifling cabin and compose himself to sleep it had been a busy day and he was physically weary he lay on his cot with the sweat trickling irritatingly over his ribs trying to persuade his mind to cease from debating the situation the british public was turning a kindly eye on the struggle for liberty that was being waged in every corner of the world british volunteers were playing their part richard church had been leading the greek rebellion against the turks for years now cochrane was at this very moment fighting in the pacific for south american independence for that matter as he knew thousands of british soldiers were serving in the ranks of bolivars army just over there on the mainland private fortunes in england had been lavished in the cause of liberty just as ramsbottom had been lavishing his but none of this was any indication as to how the british cabinet would react national policy might well be at odds with national opinion and the lords of the admiralty could be counted upon to be as unpredictable as ever and that was equally true of his majesty king george iv hornblower suspected that the first gentleman of europe had long ago forsaken his halfhearted liberalism the near future might hold a severe reprimand for his majestys commanderinchief in the west indies it might even hold disavowal and recall hornblowers mind had now attained the comforting certainty that the future was uncertain and that nothing he could do during the next few hours could change it with that he might well have gone to sleep he was in fact on the point of dozing off when he brushed what he thought was a trickle of sweat from his bare ribs it was not sweat a flurry against his fingers told him it was a cockroach crawling over his skin and he started up in disgust the caribbean was notorious for its cockroaches but he had never grown to tolerate them he walked across in the darkness and opened the door to the after cabin admitting light from the lamp that swung there and this revealed a dozen of the disgusting creatures scuttling about my lord it was the faithful gerard hurrying out of bed as soon as he heard his admiral stirring go back to bed said hornblower he put on the silk nightshirt with the elaborate smocking down the front which had been laid out for him and went on deck the moon had risen now and clorinda was creeping steadily along with the land breeze now blowing fresh abeam cockroaches had driven away all thought of his troubles he could lean against the rail and contemplate the beauties of the beautiful night with placidity it fell calm at dawn but half an hour later a fortunate slant of wind enabled clorinda and the bride of abydos a mile astern to hold their course for puerto cabello the town on its peninsula was already in sight through the telescope and clorinda approached rapidly there were fishing boats setting out from the town small craft which were using oars to enable them to get to seaward despite the unfavourable wind something about them appeared strange in the telescope and as clorinda drew up to them it became apparent that they were crowded with people ridiculously overloaded but they plied their oars unceasingly and boldly rounded the peninsula into the open sea turning eastward towards la guaira i think general morillo has lost his battle said hornblower indeed my lord said fell deferentially and i think there are plenty of people in puerto cabello who have no desire to be found there when el liberador comes marching in added hornblower he had heard that the war of independence was being waged with spanish ferocity that even bolivars reputation had been clouded by executions and massacres here was a proof of it but those crowded boats were also a proof that puerto cabello was expected to fall to bolivar he had won his battle of carabobo a victory in the open field so close to caracas meant the certain collapse of the royal cause carabobo would be the yorktown of the south american war of independence no doubt about that presumably ramsbottom would consider the loss of the bride of abydos as a small thing compared with the freeing of a continent it was necessary that all this should be confirmed without doubt however the cabinet would be anxious for early and firsthand information regarding the situation in venezuela sir thomas said hornblower i shall go ashore youll have an armed guard my lord as you will said hornblower a dozen seamen with muskets would hardly save him from the clutches of a conquering army but agreement saved him from argument and reproachful looks by the time hornblower set foot on the pier in the blinding sunlight the little harbour was deserted not a fishing boat was left nor was there a human being in sight he pressed on his guard tramping behind him and gerard at his side the long winding street was not quite deserted there were a few women a few old men a few children to be seen peering out of the houses then away to his right he heard a brief rattle of musketry the reports sounding flat in the heavy damp air now here came a ghastly column of sick and wounded halfnaked hobbling along the road some fell down to struggle to their feet again and some under hornblowers very eyes fell not to rise again and of these some managed to roll to the side of the road while others lay still while their staggering comrades stumbled over them wounded halfnaked barefooted crazy with fever or bending double with abdominal pains they came reeling along the road while behind them the rattle of musketry came nearer and nearer at the heels of the last of the wounded came the first of the rearguard soldiers whose rags were faintly reminiscent of the blue and white of the spanish royal army hornblower made a mental note that the royal forces still could provide a disciplined rearguard and so were not in total rout but the rearguard was woefully small a couple of hundred men perhaps they were not keeping good order but they were fighting a steady fight biting open their cartridges ramming home their charges spitting their bullets into their musket barrels and waiting in ones and twos behind cover to get a fair shot at their pursuers a dozen officers their drawn swords flashing in the sun were among them the mounted officerincommand caught sight of hornblower and his party and reined round his horse in astonishment who are you he shouted english replied hornblower but before another word could be exchanged the firing in the rear increased in intensity not only that but suddenly from out of a side lane level with the rearguard appeared a dozen horsemen lancers their spear points reflecting the sun and the rearguard broke in disorder running wildly down the road to escape being cut off hornblower saw a lance point enter between the shoulders of a running man saw him fall on his face sliding over the surface of the road for a yard before the lance point tore its way out again leaving him struggling like a brokenbacked animal over him swept the skirmishers of the insurgent advanced guard a swarm of men of every shade of colour running loading and firing there was a moment when the air was full of bullets my lord expostulated gerard thats all right its all over now said hornblower the fight had swept past them up the road no one had paid them any attention save for the single question of the mounted spanish officer the small column of infantry marching in regular order behind the skirmishers saw them however saw the glittering gold the epaulettes and the cocked hats again a mounted officer wheeled towards them with the same question to receive the same answer from hornblower ingleses repeated the officer english why youre a british admiral commanding the british squadron in west indian waters said hornblower a pleasure to see you sir william jones late captain twentythird foot now major commanding a battalion in the army of greater colombia delighted to make your acquaintance major pardon me but i must attend to my duties said jones wheeling his horse again hooray for england yelled someone in the marching ranks and he was answered by a thin cheer half of these ragged scarecrows must have been british mingled indiscriminately with negroes and south americans the cavalry followed them regiment after regiment a flood of men and horses filling the road like a river brimming its banks lancers and light horse sorebacked horses and lame horses most of the men had coiled ropes at their saddle bows and they were all ragged and drooping in their saddles with fatigue from the appearance of both men and beasts they had marched far and fought hard and now they were pressing on to the limit of their strength after their defeated foe a thousand men had passed estimated hornblower judging the column as well as he could when a new sound came to his ears through the monotonous trampling of the horses hoofs a thumping and a jingling loud and irregular here came the guns dragged along by weary horses at the heads of the horses walked men ragged and bearded they were wearing the remains of blue jumpers and white trousers it was the crew of the bride of abydos one of them lifted his weary head and recognised the party at the roadside good old horny he shouted his voice was thin with fatigue and sounded like an old mans in the mounted officer riding alongside hornblower recognised one of ramsbottoms lieutenants he sat his plodding horse like a sailor and raised his arm in a weary salute one gun clattered by and another followed it the guns of carabobo which had won the independence of a continent hornblower realised that he had not yet seen ramsbottom whom he would have expected to be at the head of the artillery column but as the realisation came to him he saw something now beside the second gun it was a horse litter extemporised from two poles and some sheets of canvas it was slung from two horses one fore and one aft the bight of canvas between the poles was shaded by an awning spread above it and lying in the trough was a man a smallish man blackbearded lying feebly against pillows behind his back a seaman walked at the head of each horse and with the plodding step of the animals the litter lurched and rolled and the blackbearded man lurched and rolled at the same time yet he was able to take note of the group by the roadside and he made an effort to sit up and he called an order to the seamen leading the horses which caused them to turn out of the road and stop by hornblower good morning my lord he said he spoke shrilly like someone hysterical hornblower had to look twice and more to recognise him the black beard the feverish eyes the shocking dead pallor upon which the tan looked like some unnatural coating all made identification difficult ramsbottom exclaimed hornblower the very same but a little different said ramsbottom with a cackling laugh are you wounded asked hornblower at the moment the words passed his lips he perceived that ramsbottoms left arm was concealed in a roll of rags hornblower had been looking so intently at the face that the arm had escaped his notice until then i have made my sacrifice in the cause of liberty said ramsbottom with the same laugh it might have been a laugh of derision or a laugh of mere hysteria what happened my left hand lies on the field of carabobo cackled ramsbottom i doubt if it has received christian burial good god do you see my guns my beautiful guns they tore the dons apart at carabobo but you what treatment have you received field surgery of course boiling pitch for the stump have you ever felt boiling pitch my lord my frigate is anchored in the roadstead the surgeon is on board no oh no i must go on with my guns i must clear el liberadors path to caracas the same laugh it was not derision it was something the opposite a man on the edge of delirium keeping a desperate hold on his sanity so as not to be diverted from his aim nor was it a case of a man laughing lest he weep he was laughing lest he should indulge in heroics oh you cant sir sir my lord hornblower swung round here was a midshipman from the frigate touching his hat agitated by the urgency of his message what is it message from the capn my lord shipsofwar in sight in the offing a spanish frigate an what looks like a dutch frigate my lord bearing down on us desperate news indeed he must have his flag flying in clorinda to meet these strangers but it was a maddening moment in which to be told about it he turned back to ramsbottom and back again to the midshipman his customary quickness of thought not as apparent as usual very well he rasped tell the captain im coming immediately aye aye my lord he turned again to ramsbottom i must go he said i must my lord said ramsbottom some of his feverish vitality had left him he was leaning back again on his pillows and it took him a second or two to gather his strength to speak again and when he did the words lagged as he uttered them did you capture the bride my lord yes he must end this he must get back to his ship my bonny bride my lord theres another keg of caviare in the after lazarette please enjoy it my lord the cackling laugh again ramsbottom was still laughing as he lay back with his eyes closed not hearing the hurried goodbye which hornblower uttered as he turned away it seemed to hornblower as if that laugh followed him while he hastened to the pier and down into the boat shove off put your backs into it there lay clorinda at anchor with the bride of abydos close to her and there undoubtedly were the topsails of two frigates heading in towards them he scrambled up the ships side with hardly a moment to spare for the compliments with which he was received he was too busy taking in the tactical situation the trend of the shore the position of the bride of abydos the approach of the strangers hoist my flag he ordered curtly and then recovering his poise with the customary elaborate politeness sir thomas id be obliged if youd get springs on the cable out of the after ports on both sides springs my lord aye aye my lord cables passed through the after ports to the anchor cable by hauling in on one or the other with the capstan he could turn the ship to bring her guns to bear in any direction it was only one of the many exercises hornblower had put his crews through during the recent manoeuvres it called for heavy closely coordinated labour on the part of the hands orders were bellowed warrant and petty officers ran at the heads of their different parties to rouse out the cables and drag them aft sir thomas please order the brig to kedge closer in i want her inshore of us aye aye my lord now it became apparent that there was some time in hand the approaching frigates hull up now when a glass was trained on them from the quarterdeck were shortening sail and then even while hornblower held them in the field of his telescope he saw their maintopsails suddenly broaden as they were swung round they were heavingto and a moment later he saw a boat lowered from the dutch frigate and pull to the spanish one that would mean a consultation presumably thanks to the difference of language they could hardly be expected to agree on a course of action by signal nor even by speaking trumpet the spaniards wearing a commodores broad pendant sir thomas will you please be ready to salute it as soon as he salutes my flag aye aye my lord the consultation took some little time the second half of one sandglass and the beginning of the next a monstrous creaking down below and a clanking of the capstan told that the springs were being tested clarinda swung a trifle to starboard and then a trifle to port springs are tested and ready my lord thank you sir thomas now will you be good enough to send the hands to quarters and clear for action clear for action aye aye my lord it was a detestable nuisance to take this precaution it meant that his bedding and books and personal equipment down below would be swept away in a horrible muddle that might take days to straighten but on the other hand if those frigates came down determined to fight his reputation would never survive being unready for them it would be chaos to try to clear away the guns and bring up cartridges while actually under fire the battle if there were to be a battle would be lost before it was begun and there was something of the old thrill about these preparations the pealing of the whistles the hoarse cries of the petty officers the orderly rush of the men to the guns the tramp of the marines to the quarterdeck and the sharp order of their officer as they dressed into a rigid line ship cleared for action my lord thank you sir thomas stand by if you please there would have been just time even if the strangers had come instantly down and gone into action without parley by a rapid use of his springs he would rake the firstcomer thoroughly enough to have made her captain wish he had never been born now he must wait and the ships company standing by their guns must wait with him the matches smouldering in their tubs the fire parties standing by with their buckets the powder boys cartridge carriers in hand waiting to start their race from powder magazine to guns and back again here they come my lord those topsails were narrowing again those masts were coming into line now the frigates bows were pointed straight at clorinda as they came towards her hornblower held them steady in his telescope no guns were run out he could see but it was impossible to tell if they were cleared for action nearer and nearer now they were almost within extreme random cannon shot at that moment there was a puff of smoke from the spaniards starboard bow and for the life of him hornblower could not check a gulp of excitement the breeze blew the puff away and then the puff was replaced by another as the second appeared the heavy thud of the first discharge came to hornblowers ears there was a momentary temptation to plunge into the luxury of mental arithmetic involving the speed of sound conveyed over water and the five seconds interval between saluting guns and the distance between the ships but it had to be foregone you may return the salute to the broad pendant sir thomas aye aye my lord thirteen guns for a rear admirals flag eleven for a commodore twentyfour guns one hundred and twenty seconds exactly two minutes those ships approaching at four miles in the hour would be a cables length closer at the end of the salutes within distant gunshot sir thomas i would be glad if you would take several turns upon the starboard spring aye aye my lord the violent creaking made itself heard again and clorinda turned herself to present her broadside towards the newcomers no harm whatever in letting them know that a hot reception was awaiting them if they intended mischief it might save much trouble later theyre taking in sail my lord so he could see for himself but there was nothing to be gained by saying so the two ships obviously had heavy crews judging by the rapidity with which sail was got in now round they went up into the wind hornblower believed he could hear the roar of the cables as they anchored it seemed like a decisive moment and hornblower was about to mark it by shutting up his telescope with a snap when he saw a boat lowering from the spaniard i fancy well be having a visitor shortly said hornblower the boat seemed to fly over the glittering water the men at the oars were pulling like madmen presumably the eternal desire of the men of one navy to show another navy what they could do boat ahoy hailed the officer of the watch the spanish officer in the sternsheets conspicuous by his epaulettes hailed back hornblower could not be sure of what he said but the letter that was waved at the same time told the story receive him on board if you please sir thomas the spanish lieutenant looked sharply round him as he came over the ships side no harm in his seeing the men at quarters and the preparations made he picked out hornblower at once and with a salute and a bow presented his letter su excellencia el almirante sir hornblower said the superscription hornblower broke the seal he could read the spanish of the letter easily enough the brigadier don luiz argote would be honoured if his excellency sir hornblower would accord him the opportunity of an interview the brigadier would be delighted if he could visit his excellencys ship and would be equally delighted if his excellency would visit his most catholic majestys ship in spanish naval usage hornblower knew brigadier was equivalent to commodore ill write a reply said hornblower sir thomas please make this gentleman welcome come with me gerard down below with the ship cleared for action it was a nuisance to hunt up writing paper and ink it was even more of a nuisance to have to compose a letter in spanish for in writing misspellings and bad grammar would be far more evident than in speech luckily the brigadiers letter itself supplied most of the spelling and the tricky conditional form rear admiral lord hornblower would be delighted to receive the brigadier don luiz argote in his flagship whenever the brigadier wishes sealing wax and seal and candle had to be discovered it would never do to appear careless about these formalities very well said hornblower giving grudging approval of the second impression after the failure of the first attempt take a boat to the bride of abydos as quick as lightning and see if theres any of that sherry left which ramsbottom served at his dinner party the brigadier when he came up clorindas side to be received with the appropriate compliments was followed by another figure in cocked hat and epaulettes hornblower bowed and saluted and introduced himself i took the liberty of asking captain van der maesen of the royal netherlands navy to accompany me said the brigadier it is with much pleasure that i welcome captain van der maesen on board said hornblower perhaps you gentlemen will accompany me below i regret very much that we will not be very comfortable but as you see i have been exercising my crew in their duties a screen had been hurriedly run across the after part of the frigate and the table and chairs replaced the brigadier sipped with increasing and astonished appreciation at the glass of wine offered him inevitably several minutes passed in desultory conversation spanish was the one language the three had in common before the brigadier began to discuss business you have a beautiful ship here milord he said i regret much to find you in company with a pirate you mean the bride of abydos seor naturally milord hornblower saw a trap opening before him you call her a pirate seor what do you call her milord i am waiting to hear your opinion seor it was important not to commit himself her actions call for explanation milord she has captured and plundered a dutch ship that can be interpreted as an act of piracy on the other hand it might be said she is operating under a socalled commission issued by the rebels in venezuela in the one case captain van der maesen will seize her as a pirate on the other if she is a privateer i will seize her as an enemy of my country in neither case seor has a court of law determined her status in the meanwhile gentlemen she is in my possession hats were in the ring now hornblower met the eyes of the others with the least expression he could manage of one thing he was certain that whatever might be eventually decided regarding the bride of abydos neither the british government nor the british public would approve of his tamely allowing her to be taken out of his hands milord i have assured captain van der maesen of my support in any action he may decide to take and he has given me the same assurance the dutch captain confirmed this with a nod and a halfintelligible sentence two to one in other words odds that clorinda could not hope to face then i hope gentlemen i hope very sincerely indeed that you decide upon approving of my course of action it was the politest way of defying them that he could think of i find it very hard to believe milord that you extend the i protection of his britannic majestys navy to pirates or to privateers in a war in which his majesty is neutral you may have noticed seor that the bride of abydos is flying his britannic majestys flag of course you understand that as a naval officer i cannot permit that flag to be hauled down there it was the ultimate defiance ten minutes from now and the guns might be firing ten minutes from now and this deck might be littered with dead and wounded he might be dead himself the spaniard looked at the dutchman and back to hornblower we would much regret taking strong action milord i am delighted to hear that seor that confirms me in my decision we can part the best of friends but the brigadier had not intended his last sentence to be interpreted as a sign of yielding he had been uttering he thought a further threat hornblowers interpretation of it left him speechless for a moment i am overjoyed to find that we are in agreement gentlemen perhaps we can drink the healths of our sovereigns in another glass of this wine seor and may i take this opportunity of acknowledging the debt the rest of the world owes to your country for such an exquisite production by taking their withdrawal for granted he was giving them a chance of withdrawing gracefully the bitter moment of admitting that they had been outfaced had come and gone before they had realised it once more the spaniard and the dutchman exchanged unavailing glances and hornblower seized the opportunity to pour more wine to his most catholic majesty seor to his majesty the king of the netherlands he held his glass high they could not refuse that toast even though the brigadiers mouth still opened and shut as he struggled to find words for his emotions common politeness forced the brigadier to complete the toast as hornblower waited glass in hand to his britannic majesty they drank together this has been a delightful visit gentlemen said hornblower another glass no it cannot be that you are leaving so soon but i expect you have many duties calling for your attention as the side boys whitegloved formed up at the entry port and the bosuns mates pealed upon their whistles and the ships company still at their guns stood to attention in compliment to the departing visitors hornblower could spare a moment to glance round those side boys and bosuns mates and guns crews might be facing imminent death at this moment if that interview had taken a more stormy course he deserved their gratitude but of course he would never receive it shaking hands with the brigadier he made the final clarification of the situation a prosperous voyage seor i hope i shall have the pleasure of meeting you again i shall be sailing for kingston as soon as the land breeze serves one of barbaras regular letters received months later helped to round off the incident my dearest husband last night the lord chancellor was my lefthand partner at dinner and he had much to say about the bride of abydos and in consequence to my great pleasure much to say about my dear husband the spanish and dutch governments through their ambassador and minister have naturally lodged protests with the foreign secretary who has only been able to acknowledge receipt of the notes and to promise a further reply when the legal aspects of the case are made clear and in all the history of admiralty law said the lord chancellor there never was a case as complicated as this one the insurers plead negligence on the part of the assured because the captain of the helmond took no steps to verify the bona fides of the bride of abydos and they further plead negligence on the part of the dutch government because the capture took place within dutch territorial waters off bonaire and the dutchmen deny hotly both that they were negligent and that the capture was really within their territorial waters further the actual plundering and detention took place in spanish territorial waters and there seem to be untold complications arising from the fact that you found the bride of abydos abandoned by her crew did you know dearest that it seems a matter of great legal importance as to whether her anchor was actually touching bottom or not in any case there has been no legal action in any court so far because no one seems to be able to decide which court has jurisdiction in the matter taking one thing with another and allowing four months on the average for each necessary round trip to the west indies to take evidence on commission and taking into account demurrers and rebuttals and surrebuttals the lord chancellor thinks that it will be thirtyseven years before any case reaches the house of lords and he went on to say cackling into his soup that our interest in the case will be greatly diminished by then this is by no means all the news dearest there is something further which would greatly distress me if it were not for the fact that i know my husband the admiral will be delighted taking tea today with lady exmouth i heard that their lordships take a most favourable view of your attitude towards the spanish and dutch naval authorities dearest i am so delighted even though i could never doubt it it has already been decided to extend your command for the extra year and my pleasure in knowing how pleased you will be at this compliment almost quite allays my sorrow at the thought of our further separation dearest there is no woman who could love you there is no woman on earth who could love any man as much as i love you the truest the bravest the boldest the cleverest i must not write like this because there is still further news to add this is that the government has always apparently looked with favour at the attempt of the spanish colonies to attain their independence and with the greatest disfavour upon the decision of the spanish government to attempt their reconquest with troops sent out from europe there have been hints that the other powers uneasy at the movement towards liberty have been meditating giving military assistance to spain in spanish america the victory at carabobo where poor mr ramsbottom and his guns played such a part had made this intervention more unlikely it is a great state secret so great that over the teacups it is mentioned only in whispers that the british government meditates making a declaration that it will not permit military intervention in spanish america and it appears that our government is in accord with the americans over this for it is believed that president monroe is planning to issue a declaration regarding a similar doctrine and discussions regarding it are taking place so that my dearest husband finds himself at the centre of world affairs as he has always been at the centre of his wifes fondest affections the hurricane hornblower came walking into his office at admiralty house at half past five oclock in the morning exactly now that the summer was come there was just enough daylight at that time to transact business and it was a fairly cool moment as well gerard and spendlove his flaglieutenant and secretary were waiting for him there it would have gone hard with them if they had not been and they pulled themselves erect without any clicking of heels and they said good morning my lord good morning my lord as if they were the two barrels of a shotgun morning said hornblower he had not had his breakfast coffee yet otherwise he would have put good in front of morning he sat down at his desk and spendlove came to hover over his shoulder with a sheaf of papers while gerard made the dawn report weather conditions normal my lord high water today at eleventhirty no arrivals during the night and nothing in sight this morning from the signal station no news of the packet my lord and no news of triton a negative report if ever there was one said hornblower the negatives in the last two phrases balanced each other hms triton was bringing out his successor to relieve him of his command at the end of his three years appointment and hornblower was not happy over the prospect of ceasing to be commanderinchief in the west indies but the west india packet was bringing out his wife whom he had not seen during all this time and to whose arrival he was eagerly looking forward she was coming out so as to make the return voyage to england with him the packets due any day my lord said gerard soothingly your business is to tell me things i dont know mr gerard snapped hornblower it annoyed him to be soothed like a child and it annoyed him still more that his personal staff should think him human enough to be anxious to see his wife he looked over his shoulder at his secretary what do you have there spendlove spendlove made a hasty rearrangement of the papers in his hand hornblowers morning coffee was due at any moment and spendlove had something he did not want to show his chief until it had come and was half drunk at least here are the dockyard returns to the thirtyfirst ultimo my lord he said cant you say to the end of last month demanded hornblower taking them from him aye aye my lord said spendlove passionately hoping the coffee would come soon anything in these asked hornblower glancing over them nothing for your special attention my lord then why trouble me with them next the warrants for the new gunner in clorinda my lord and for the dockyard cooper your coffee my lord said gerard at this moment the relief in his voice perfectly apparent better late than never snapped hornblower and for gods sake dont fuss round me ill pour it for myself spendlove and gerard were busily making room on his desk for the tray to be put down and spendlove hastily withdrew his hand from the coffeepot handle too damned hot said hornblower taking a sip its always too damned hot last week the new system had been begun whereby coffee was brought in to him after his arrival in his office instead of awaiting him there because he had complained then that it was always too cold but neither spendlove nor gerard saw fit to remind him of this ill sign those warrants said hornblower not that i think that coopers worth his salt his barrels open up into birdcages spendlove scattered sand from the caster over the wet ink of hornblowers signatures and put the warrants aside hornblower took another sip of coffee heres your refusal of the crichtons invitation my lord in the third person so your signature isnt necessary if that had been said to him a little while before hornblower would have demanded why in that case he was being bothered with it forgetful of his own standing order that nothing was to go out in his name without his seeing it but even two sips of coffee had done their work very well he said glancing over it and taking up his cup again spendlove watched the level of the liquid sink in the cup and judged the moment to be more propitious now he laid a letter on the desk from sir thomas my lord hornblower uttered a small groan as he picked it up captain sir thomas fell of hms clorinda was a fussy individual and a communication from him usually meant trouble unnecessary trouble and therefore to be grudged not in this case though hornblower read the official document and then craned over his shoulder at spendlove whats all this about he demanded its rather a curious case i hear my lord answered spendlove it was a circumstantial letter a formal request from captain fell for a court martial to be held on bandsman hudnutt of the royal marines for wilful and persistent disobedience to orders such a charge if substantiated meant death or else such a flogging that death would be preferable spendlove was perfectly well aware that his admiral detested hangings and floggings the charges are preferred by the drummajor commented hornblower to himself he knew the drummajor cobb perfectly well or at least as well as the peculiar circumstances permitted as admiral and commanderinchief hornblower had his own band which was under the command of cobb holding warrant rank previous to all official occasions where music had to be provided cobb reported to hornblower for orders and instructions and hornblower would go through the farce of agreeing with the suggestions put forward he had never publicly admitted that he could not tell one note from another he could actually distinguish one tune from another by the jigginess or otherwise of the time he was a little uneasy in case all this was more common knowledge than he hoped what dyou mean by a curious case spendlove he asked i believe an artistic conscience is involved my lord replied spendlove cautiously hornblower was pouring and tasting his second cup of coffee that might have a bearing on the breaking of bandsman hudnutts neck thought spendlove at the same time hornblower was feeling the inevitable irritation resulting from having to listen to gossip an admiral in his splendid isolation never or only rarely knew as much about what was going on as his most junior subordinate an artistic conscience he repeated ill see the drummajor this morning send for him now aye aye my lord he had received the one necessary clue and need not demean himself by prying further unless the interview with cobb should prove unfruitful now lets have that draught report until he comes drummajor cobb did not arrive for some time and his resplendent uniform when he did arrive hinted that he had taken care about his appearance tunic and pantaloons were freshly ironed his buttons glittered his sash was exactly draped his swordhilt shone like silver he was an enormous man with an enormous moustache and he made an enormous entrance into the room striding over the resounding floor as if he were twice as heavy as he actually was clashing his bootheels together as he halted before the desk and swept his hand upward in the salute fashionable at the moment among the royal marines good morning mr cobb said hornblower mildly the mr like the sword was an indication that cobb was a gentleman by virtue of his warrant even though he had risen from the ranks good morning my lord there was as much flourish in the phrase as there had been in the salute i want to hear about these charges against this bandsman hudnutt well my lord a sideways glance from cobb gave hornblower a hint get out of here said hornblower to his staff leave mr cobb alone with me when the door was shut hornblower was all good manners please sit down mr cobb then you can tell me at your ease what really happened thank you my lord well now that young udnutt my lord es a fool if ever there was one im sorry this as appened my lord but e deserves all es going to get yes hes a fool you say es a downright fool my lord im not saying e isnt a good musician cause e is there aint no one oo can play the cornet the way e does thats the truth my lord es a boy wonder at it the cornets a newfangled instrument my lord we aint ad it in our bands for moren a year blow it like a trumpet you do you ave to ave a lip for it although it as keys as well my lord an es a marvel at it or e was my lord that change to the past tense indicated that in cobbs positive opinion hudnutt through death or disablement would never play the cornet again hes young nineteen my lord and what did he do it was mutiny my lord flat mutiny although ive only charged him with disobedience to orders mutiny meant death by the articles of war disobedience to orders meant death or such less penalty how did it happen well my lord it was like this we was rehearsing the new march that come out in the last packet dondello its called my lord just the cornet an the drums an it sounded different an i had udnutt play it again i could ear what e was doin my lord theres a lot of b flat accidentals in that march an e wasnt flatting them i asked im what e meant by it an he said it sounded too sweet thats what e said my lord an its written on the music dolce it says and dolce means sweet my lord i know lied hornblower so i says you can play that again and you flat those bs an e says i cant an i says you mean you wont an then i says ill give you one more chance although by rights i shouldnt ave my lord an i says this is an order remember an i gives em the beat an they starts off and there was the b naturals so i says you eard me give you an order an e says yes so there wasnt nothing i could do after that my lord i calls the guard an i ad im marched to the guardouse an then i ad to prefer charges my lord this happened with the band present yes my lord the ole band sixteen of em wilful disobedience to an order before sixteen witnesses it hardly mattered if there were six or sixteen or sixty the point was that everyone in hornblowers command knew by now that discipline had been defied an order deliberately disobeyed the man must die or he must be flogged into a crippled wreck lest other men defy orders hornblower knew he had his command well in hand but he knew too of the turbulence that lay below the surface and yet if the order that had been disobeyed had been something different if there had been a refusal to lay out along a yard say however perilous the conditions hornblower would not have given all this thought to the matter despite his detestation of physical cruelty that sort of order must be instantly obeyed artistic conscience spendlove had said hornblower had no idea of any difference between b and b flat but he could dimly understand that it might be important to some people a man might be tempted to refuse to do something that offended his artistic sensibilities i suppose the man was sober he demanded suddenly as sober as you and me my lord another idea crossed homblowers mind whats the chances of a misprint in the music he asked he was struggling with things he did not understand well my lord there is such things but its for me to say if theres a misprint or not an although he can read music i dont know if e can read print my lord an if e can i dont expect e can read eyetalian but there it says dolce it says on the official music my lord in cobbs eyes this aggravated the offence if aggravation were possible not only had his order been disobeyed but hudnutt had not respected the written instructions sent by whoever was responsible in london for sending out music to marine bands cobb was a marine first and a musician second hudnutt might be a musician first and a marine second but hornblower pulled himself up sharply that made hudnutts condemnation all the more necessary a marine had to be a marine first foremost and all the time if marines started to choose whether they could be marines or not the royal regiment would cease to be a military body and it was his duty to maintain it as a military body hornblower studied cobbs expression intently the man was speaking the truth at least as far as the truth was apparent to him he was not wilfully distorting facts because of personal prejudice or as a result of some old feud if his action and his report on it had been influenced by jealousy or natural cruelty he was unaware of it a court martial would be impressed by his reliability as a witness and he remained unperturbed under hornblowers steady stare thank you mr cobb said hornblower at last i am glad to have had such a clear statement of the facts that will be all for the present thank you my lord answered cobb shooting his great bulk up out of the chair with an astonishing mixture of agility and military rigidity his heels clashed as his hand swept up in the salute he turned about with parade precision and marched out of the room with resounding steps as precise as if timed by his own metronome gerard and spendlove came back into the room to find hornblower staring at nothing but hornblower shook off his preoccupation instantly it would never do for his subordinates to guess that he was moved by human feelings over a mere administrative matter draft an answer to sir thomas for my signature if you please mr spendlove it can be a mere acknowledgement but then add that there is no possibility of immediate action because i cannot assemble the necessary number of captains at present with so many ships detached except in emergency a court where sentence of death might be passed could not be convened unless there were seven captains and commanders at least available as judges that gave him time to consider what action he should take this mans in the dockyard prison i suppose went on hornblower remind me to take a look at him on my way through the dockyard today aye aye my lord said gerard careful to betray no surprise at an admiral allotting time to visit a mutinous marine yet it was not far out of hornblowers way when the time came he strolled slowly down through the beautiful garden of admiralty house and evans the disabled sailor who was head gardener came in a jerky hurry to open the wicket gate in the fifteenfoot palisade that protected the dockyard from thieves in this portion of its course dividing the admiralty garden from the dockyard evans took off his hat and stood bobbing by the gate his pigtail bobbing at his back and his swarthy face split by a beaming smile thank you evans said hornblower passing through the prison stood isolated at the edge of the dockyard a small cubical building of mahogany logs set diagonally in a curious fashion possibly probably more than one layer it was roofed with palm thatch a yard or more thick which might at least help to keep it cool under the glaring sun gerard had run on ahead from the gate with hornblower grinning at the thought of the healthful sweat the exercise would produce to find the officerincharge and obtain the key to the prison and hornblower stood by while the padlock was unfastened and he could look into the darkness within hudnutt had risen to his feet at the sound of the key and when he stepped forward into the light he was revealed as a painfully young man his cheeks hardly showing a trace of his onedays beard he was naked except for a waistcloth and the officerincharge clucked with annoyance get some clothes on and be decent he growled but hornblower checked him no matter ive very little time i want this man to tell me why he is under charges you others keep out of earshot hudnutt had been taken by surprise by this sudden visit but he was a bewildered person in any case obviously he blinked big blue eyes in the sunlight and wriggled his gangling form with embarrassment what happened tell me said hornblower well sir hornblower had to coax the story out of him but bit by bit it confirmed all that cobb had said i couldnt play that music sir not for nothing the blue eyes looked over hornblowers head at infinity perhaps at some vision invisible to the rest of the world you were a fool to disobey an order yes sir mebbe so sir the broad yorkshire which hudnutt spoke sounded odd in this tropical setting how did you come to enlist for the music sir it called for more questions to extract the story a boy in a yorkshire village not infrequently hungry a cavalry regiment billeted there in the last years of the war the music of its band was like a miracle to this child who had heard no music save that of wandering pipers in the ten years of his life it made him conscious of it did not create for it already existed a frightful overwhelming need all the children of the village hung round the band but none so persistently as he the trumpeters noticed him soon enough laughed at his infantile comments about music but laughed with sympathy as time went on they let him try to blow their instruments showed him how to cultivate a lip and were impressed by the eventual results the regiment returned after waterloo and for two more years the boy went on learning even though those were the hungry years following the peace when he should have been birdscaring and stonepicking from dawn to dark and then the regiment was transferred and the hungry years went on and the boy labourer began to handle the plough still yearning for music while a trumpet cost more than a years full wages for a man then an interlude of pure bliss the disarming smile again when he joined a wandering theatrical troupe as oddjob boy and musician that was how he came to be able to read music although he could not read the printed word his belly was empty as often as before a stable yard meant a luxurious bed to him those months were months of fleabitten nights and footsore days and they ended in his being left behind sick that happened in portsmouth and then it was inevitable that hungry and weak he should be picked up by a marine recruitingsergeant marching through the streets with a band his enlistment coincided with the introduction of the cornet pistons into military music and the next thing that happened to him was that he was shipped off to the west indies to take his place in the commanderinchiefs band under the direction of drummajor cobb i see said hornblower and indeed he could dimly see six months with a travelling theatrical troupe would be poor preparation for the discipline of the royal marines that was obvious but he could guess at the rest at this sensitiveness about music which was the real cause of the trouble he eyed the boy again seeking for ideas regarding how to deal with this situation my lord my lord this was gerard hastening up to him the packets signalled my lord you can see the flag at the lookout station masthead the packet barbara would be on board it was three years since he had seen her last and for three weeks now he had been awaiting her from minute to minute call away my barge im coming he said a wave of excitement swept away his concern regarding the hudnutt affair he was about to hurry after gerard and then hesitated what could he say in two seconds to a man awaiting trial for his life what could he say when he himself was bubbling with happiness to this man caged like an animal like an ox helplessly awaiting the butcher goodbye hudnutt that was all he could say leaving him standing dumbly there he could hear the clash of keys and padlock as he hastened after gerard eight oars bit into the blue water but no speed that they could give the dancing barge could be fast enough to satisfy him there was the brig her sails trimmed to catch the first hesitant puffs of the sea breeze there was a white dot at her side a white figure barbara waving her handkerchief the barge surged alongside and hornblower swung himself up into the main chains and there was barbara in his arms there were her lips against his and then her grey eyes smiling at him and then her lips against his again and the afternoon sun blazing down on them both then they could stand at arms length and look at each other and barbara could raise her hands and twitch his neckcloth straight so that he could be sure they were really together for barbaras first gesture was always to straighten his neckcloth you look well my dear she said so do you her cheeks were golden with sunburn after a month at sea barbara never strove after the fashionable creaminess that distinguished the lady of leisure from the milkmaid or the goosegirl and they laughed in each others faces out of sheer happiness before they kissed again and then eventually drew apart dear this is captain knyvett who has looked after me so kindly on the voyage welcome aboard my lord knyvett was short and stocky and grizzled but i fancy youll not be staying with us long today well both be your passengers when you sail again said barbara if my relief has come said hornblower adding to barbara triton hasnt arrived yet twill be two full weeks before were ready to sail again my lord said knyvett i trust we shall have the pleasure of your company and her ladyships i sincerely hope so said hornblower meanwhile well leave you now i hope youll dine at admiralty house as soon as you have leisure can you get down into the barge my dear of course said barbara gerard youll stay on board and look after her ladyships baggage aye aye my lord no time even to say how dye do to you mr gerard said barbara as hornblower led her away to the main chains barbara had no hoops in her skirts she knew enough about shipboard breezes to dispense with those hornblower dropped down into the sternsheets of the barge and a growl from the coxswain at the tiller turned the eyes of the boats crew to seaward so that they would see nothing they should not see while knyvett and gerard swung barbara down into hornblowers arms in a flurry of petticoats give way the barge surged away from the ships side over the blue water towards the admiralty house pier with barbara and hornblower hand in hand in the sternsheets delightful dear said barbara looking about her when she landed a commanderinchiefs life is spent in pleasant places pleasant enough thought hornblower except for yellow fever and pirates and international crises and temperamental marines awaiting trial but this was not the time to mention such things evans hobbling on his wooden leg was at the pier to greet them and hornblower could see that he was barbaras slave from the first moment that he was presented to her you must take me round the gardens the first moment im free said barbara yes your ladyship of course your ladyship they walked slowly up to the house here it was a delicate business to show barbara round and to present the staff to her for admiralty house was run along lines laid down at the admiralty to alter a stick of furniture or to change the status of any of the naval ratings working there was something barbara would not be able to do she was only a tolerated visitor there and barely tolerated at that she would certainly itch to change the furniture about and to reorganise the staff but she was doomed to frustration it seems to be as well darling said barbara with a twinkle that my stay here is to be short how short until ransome arrives in triton answered hornblower you should know that dear considering how much gossip you picked up from lady exmouth and the others yes but its still confusing to me when does your appointment end it ended yesterday legally but my command continues until i am legally relieved of it by ransome when he comes triton has made a long passage and when ransome comes he takes over from me and of course moves into this house his excellency has invited us to be his guests at government house until we sail for home dear i see and if ransome is so late that we miss the packet then we wait for the next i hope not it would be uncomfortable is government house as bad as that its tolerable dear but i was thinking of ransome no new commanderinchief wants to have his predecessor staying on criticising all his actions of course is that what youd do dear i wouldnt be human if i did not and i know so well youre human dear said barbara putting out her hands to him they were in the bedroom now out of sight of servants and staff and they could be human for a few precious moments until a thunderous knock at the door heralded the arrival of gerard and the baggage and on his heels came spendlove with a note for barbara a note of welcome from her excellency dear explained barbara when she had read it we are commanded to dinner en famille no more than i expected said hornblower and then looking round to see that spendlove had withdrawn no more than i feared barbara smiled into his eyes conspiratorially a time will come she said there was so much to talk about so much news to be exchanged the long long letters that had passed between them during their three years separation needed amplification and explanation and in any case barbara had been five weeks at sea without news late on the second day while they were dining alone together a mention of hudnutt came into the conversation hornblower explained the situation briefly youre going to court martial him asked barbara likely enough when i can convene a court and what will the verdict be guilty of course theres no doubt about it i dont mean the verdict i mean the sentence what will that be barbara was entitled to ask questions like this and even to express an opinion regarding her husbands performance of his official duties now that he had let slip a mention of the subject to her hornblower quoted from the articles of war which had regulated his official life for nearly thirty years every person so offending being convicted thereof by the sentence of the court martial shall suffer death or such less punishment as from the nature and degree of the offence the court martial shall deem him to deserve you dont mean that dear barbaras grey eyes opened wide across the little table from him death but you said such less punishment what could that be flogging round the fleet five hundred lashes five hundred lashes for playing b natural instead of b flat that was exactly what one might expect a woman to say dear thats not the charge the charge is wilful disobedience to orders but its such a trifling matter dear disobedience to orders can never be a trifling matter would you flog a man to death because he wont play a b flat what a bloodthirsty way to balance the account theres no thought of balancing accounts dear punishment is inflicted to deter other men from disobeying orders its not revenge but womanlike barbara clung to her position however much her flank might be turned by cold logic but if you hang him or if you flog him i expect hell never play another b natural again what good does that do its the good of the service dear hornblower on his part was holding a position which he knew to be not quite tenable but barbaras vehemence was causing him to grow heated in defence of his beloved service theyll hear about this in england said barbara and then a new thought struck her he can appeal of course can he in home waters he could but i am a commanderinchief in a foreign station and from my decision there is no appeal it was a sobering speech barbara gazed across the table at this man changed suddenly from her tender loving sensitive husband into a potentate who held the power of life and death and she knew that she could not she must not exploit her privileged position as wife to influence his decision not because of the good of the service but for the sake of their married happiness and the trial will be soon she asked the change in her was apparent in her tone the moment i can convene a court delay in matters of discipline defeats its own object if a man were to mutiny on monday he should be tried on tuesday and hanged on wednesday but there are not enough captains available tritons captain when ransome arrives would give the necessary number but then i shall be relieved of command and the matter will be out of my hands but if flora should come in before that i detached her to the gulf coast i shall be responsible i see dear said barbara not taking her eyes from his face even before he spoke again she was aware that there was something which would modify the harshness of what he had said so far naturally i have not made up my mind yet dear he said but there is a further possibility which im considering yes she could hardly breathe the word the confirmation of the finding and the sentence would be the last act of my command that would present an excuse a reason i could commute the sentence as an act of clemency in recognition of the good behaviour of the squadron during the period i have commanded it i see dear and if ransome arrives before flora i can do nothing except except i could suggest to ransome that he might begin his command with an act of clemency and would he i know very little about ransome dear i simply cannot say barbara opened her mouth to speak she was going to say will he think a b flat more important than a mans life but she changed her speech in the nick of time instead she said the other thing that had also and longer been hovering on her lips i love you darling she said again their eyes met across the table and hornblower felt his passion flooding to meet hers like a union of two rushing rivers he knew perfectly well that all he had said about discipline and examples had been of no effect in changing barbaras mind a woman convinced against her will was of the same opinion still but barbara had not said so she had said something else and something more appropriate to the occasion and not by one single variation of tone not by a hairsbreadth raising of an eyebrow had she brought into the conversation the fact that he was tone deaf a lesser woman would have used that as if it were a relevant argument in this matter she knew of his tone deafness and he knew she knew and she knew that he knew and so on ad infinitum but there had never been any need for him to admit the defect or for her to admit her knowledge and he loved her next morning he had to tell himself that the commanderinchief in the west indies even if he were awaiting his relief still had duties to do even if his wife had newly joined him but it was delightful to have barbara walk down with him through the admiralty house gardens to see him on his way as far as the wicket gate in the lofty dockyard palisade it was a little unfortunate that at the moment when evans was unlocking the gate hudnutt should appear on the other side of the palisade taking his exercise he was marching up and down between a file of marines under command of a corporal the guard in parade uniform with bayonets fixed hudnutt hatless as a prisoner under charges had to be prisner an escort halt bellowed the corporal at sight of his admiral escort present arms hornblower formally acknowledged the salute before turning to say goodbye to his wife escort slooope arms bellowed the corporal in marine fashion as if the escort had been at the other side of the dockyard instead of two yards from him is that the bandsman hudnutt dear asked barabara yes said hornblower prisner an escort by the right quick march bellowed the corporal and the little group marched off barbara watched it go she could look now that hudnutt had his back to her and was unaware of it previously she had refrained from staring at the man who would soon be on trial for his life the trim marine uniform could not conceal the gangling undeveloped body and the sun shone on the fair hair hes nothing more than a boy said barbara that could be another irrelevant fact if she wanted to argue with her husband regarding his duty seventeen or seventy a man under orders must obey orders hes not very old dear agreed hornblower then he kissed the cheek that barbara held up to him he was not at all sure if an admiral in uniform should kiss his wife goodbye in the presence of his staff but barbara had no doubts about it he left her standing there by the gate chatting to evans looking round her at the lovely garden on the one side of the palisade and at the businesslike dockyard through the palings the presence of his wife was delightful even though it meant greatly increased activities for him the next two or three days involved considerable entertaining island society wished to make the most of the fleeting presence of an admirals wife a peeress and of the bluest of blood in her own right to hornblower regretfully contemplating the immediate end of his period in command it was a little like the aristocrats during the french revolution dancing before the summons to the guillotine but barbara seemed to enjoy it all perhaps because she had just endured five very dull weeks at sea and was facing the prospect of five more you danced a good deal with young bonner dear he remarked to her when they were home again after the governors party hes a very good dancer said barbara hes something of a villain i believe countered hornblower theres never been anything proved but much suspected smuggling slave running and all the rest of it hes invited to government house said barbara nothing proved as i said but in my official capacity ive often been interested in the activities of those fishing boats of his you may find youve been dancing with a jailbird one of these days dear jailbirds are more amusing than military secretaries smiled barbara barbaras activity was astonishing even after a nights gaiety she went riding during the day and hornblower was content that she should as long as there were young men available eager to act as lady hornblowers escort seeing that he had his duties to attend to and disliked horses in any case it was even amusing to observe the transparent adoration which she received from everyone from his excellency from the young men who rode with her from evans the gardener from everyone she had anything to do with barbara was out riding one morning before the heat of the day when a messenger was brought in to hornblower at admiralty house message from the capn my lord tritons signalled shes heading in with a fair wind hornblower stared for a moment although this was a message that might have come at any time during the last month he was not ready for its full impact very well my compliments to the captain and ill come down so this was the end of his three years as commanderinchief ransome would take over command possibly today but certainly tomorrow and he himself would be on half pay and due to go home a queer mixture of thoughts went through his mind as he made himself ready to meet ransome young richard about to enter eton the thought of a freezing winter in smallbridge the auditing of his final accounts it was not until he was on his way to his barge that he remembered that now he would be relieved of the necessity to come to a decision in the hudnutt case triton wore no admirals flag for ransome legally held no command until he had taken over the salutes at the moment merely acknowledged tritons joining the west indian command ransome was a burly man with the heavy fashionable sidewhiskers more grey than black he wore a small decoration of companion of the bath insignificant compared with hornblowers magnificent grand cross presumably if he survived this appointment without any great blunder he might hope for knighthood he presented his captain coleman with whom hornblower was quite unacquainted and then turned an attentive ear to hornblowers explanation of the arrangements made so far and of future plans ill assume command tomorrow decided ransome that will allow time to arrange the full ceremonial agreed hornblower in that case sir would you care to spend tonight at government house i understand a command there awaits you if you think it convenient no need to move twice said ransome ill spend tonight on board here admiralty house will be ready for you tomorrow of course sir perhaps you might like to give us the honour of your company at dinner today there might perhaps be information that i could give you regarding the situation here ransome shot a glance at hornblower charged with a certain amount of suspicion he did not wish to have any readymade policies thrust upon him by his predecessor yet the suggestion was obviously sensible it would be a great pleasure i must thank you my lord hornblower took a tactful step to allay that suspicion the packet in which my wife and i are taking passage to england is making ready for sea at present sir we sail in her in a matter of a few days only very well my lord said ransome then having repeated my welcome sir i shall take my leave shall we expect you at four oclock or would some other time be convenient four oclock will suit me well said ransome the king is dead long live the king thought hornblower on his way back tomorrow he would be supplanted and would become a mere halfpay officer the splendour and dignity of a commanderinchief would be transferred from him to ransome and he found the thought a little irksome he had found his polite pose of deference to ransome more than a little irksome and he really thought ransome could have been more polite in return he gave vent to a good deal of this feeling as he told barbara about the interview and he checked himself at sight of barbaras amused twinkle and raised eyebrow you are the sweetest simpleton my very dearest said barbara have you no idea at all of any possible explanation none im afraid said hornblower barbara came up close to him and looked into his face no wonder that i love you she said dont you understand that no man could find it easy to replace hornblower your period of command has been overwhelmingly successful youve set a standard ransome will find it hard to live up to one might say hes jealous envious and he showed it i cant really believe that said hornblower and i love you because you cant believe it said barbara i could tell you so in a hundred ways if i did not have to go and put on my finest gown to win admiral ransomes heart ransome was a man of fine presence bulk and sidewhiskers and all hornblower had not really appreciated the fact at their first meeting his manner was somewhat more cordial in barbaras presence which might have been the effect of barbaras personality but might also have been as hornblower realised the result of ransomes knowing that lady hornblower was a person of much influence in political circles hornblower did his best to exploit ransomes faint cordiality he passed the wine he let slip as casually as possible bits of useful information regarding west indian conditions casually so that ransome could not suspect him of trying to bring influence to bear on him regarding his future policy and yet useful information that ransome could snap up and treasure with a smile at hornblowers carelessness yet all the same dinner was not a tremendous success there was still a certain tenseness and as dinner was approaching its end hornblower was conscious of a glance darted at him by barbara it was only one glance and of the most fleeting nature ransome could not have been conscious of it but hornblower understood barbara was jogging his memory regarding a matter that was important to her he awaited a suitable turn in the conversation before mentioning the subject oh yes he said theres a court martial pending a marine bandsman he went on to tell ransome the circumstances of the case treating it lightly he was aware even if ransome was not of the closeness with which barbara was studying ransomes expression as the narrative continued repeated and deliberate disobedience to a lawful order ransome was repeating to himself hornblowers own words it could have been mutiny so it could agreed hornblower but its rather a curious case im glad you have the decision to make regarding it and not i it seems to me as if the evidence will be quite incontrovertible no doubt hornblower made himself smile telepathically conscious of the intensity of barbaras interest but the circumstances are a little unusual the stony expression on ransomes face was most discouraging hornblower knew the situation to be hopeless he would have abandoned any further effort if barbara had not been there but as it was he went on uselessly if the trial had been held during the period of my command i might have naturally i had not made up my mind commuted the sentence to mark my appreciation of the good behaviour of the squadron yes said ransome no monosyllable could have expressed greater disinterest but hornblower plunged on it had occurred to me that you might find this a favourable opportunity to display clemency as your first official act that will be a matter for my own decision of course agreed hornblower and i cannot imagine my taking any action of that sort naturally i cannot have the squadron believing that i shall be lenient as regards discipline i cannot have my command unsettled at the start of course said hornblower again he could see the uselessness of further argument and he might as well be graceful about it you are the best judge of all the circumstances as well as the only judge now i shall leave you gentlemen to your wine said barbara suddenly hornblower looked at her just in time to see her frozen expression melt into the smile he knew so well i shall say goodnight to you admiral i shall make every effort as far as the rules of the navy allow to see that this house is in good condition for you to take over tomorrow and i hope you will be comfortable in it thank you said ransome the two men were on their feet now goodnight dear said barbara to hornblower the latter was aware that the smile she gave him was not quite real and he knew her to be acutely upset she left them and hornblower passed the port and settled down again to what proved to be a long evening ransome having asserted himself and having made it perfectly clear that he would remain uninfluenced by any suggestion hornblower might put forward was by no means averse to acquiring any information that might come his way nor to finishing the bottle of port and starting on another so that it was very late before he went to bed and he used no light for fear of disturbing barbara he crept about the room as silently as he could in the darkness the glances that he directed at the other bed under its mosquito net revealed nothing to him and he was glad if barbara had been awake they could hardly have avoided discussing the hudnutt case nor was there any time next morning for the moment hornblower was called he had to hurry into the dressing room and array himself in his best uniform with his ribbon and star and hasten away to the ceremony of the change of command as the officer to be relieved he was first upon the quarterdeck of the clorinda and stationed himself on the starboard side his staff behind him captain sir thomas fell had received him and next busied himself with receiving the other captains as they came on board the marine band without hudnutt played selections on the poop the pipes of the bosuns mates twittered unceasingly to welcome the continuous arrivals the sun blazed down as if this were just some ordinary day then came a pause intense in its drama then the band burst into a march again there were ruffles of drums and flourishes of bugles as ransome came up the side with his staff behind him to take up his station on the port side fell came forward to hornblower with his hand at his hat brim ships company fallen in my lord thank you sir thomas spendlove pressed a paper into hornblowers hand hornblower stepped forward orders from the lords commissioners for the execution of the office of lord high admiral to me horatio lord hornblower knight grand cross of the most honourable order of the bath rearadmiral of the red squadron he really had trouble in preventing his voice from trembling forcing himself to read in a harsh and matteroffact tone he folded the paper and gave his last order sir thomas please have the goodness to haul down my flag aye aye my lord the first of the thirteen saluting guns went off as the red ensign came slowly down from the mizzen peak a long long descent sixty seconds for thirteen guns and when the flag completed its descent hornblower was the poorer by fortynine pounds three shillings and seven pence a month command pay a moment later ransome came forward paper in hand to read the orders of the lords commissioners to him henry ransome companion of the most honourable order of the bath rearadmiral of the blue squadron hoist my flag sir thomas aye aye sir up to the mizzen peak rose the blue ensign until it broke at the peak the ship was silent but then it unfolded itself in the breeze and the salute roared out and the band played when the last gun fired ransome was legally commanderinchief of his majestys ships and vessels in west indian waters more blaring from the band and in the midst of it hornblower stepped forward raising his hand in salute to the new commanderinchief permission to leave the ship sir permission granted ruffles of drums bugle calls pipes and he went down the ships side he might have been sentimental he might have felt agony of regret but there was instant distraction awaiting him my lord said spendlove beside him in the sternsheets well that prisoner hudnutt the marine bandsman what about him hes escaped my lord he broke prison during the night that settled hudnutts fate beyond all doubt nothing could save him he was as good as dead or soon perhaps he would be worse than dead no deserter no escaped prisoner ever succeeded in evading recapture in jamaica it was an island and not too large an island and there was a standing reward of ten pounds sterling for information resulting in the apprehension of a deserter and in jamaica far more than in england ten pounds was a fortune a journeymans wages for a year or more more money than any slave could hope to see in a lifetime no deserter stood a chance his white face to say nothing of his uniform would call attention to him wherever he might be in the island and the standing reward made it certain that he would be betrayed hudnutt was doomed to recapture and he was doomed beyond that there would be additional charges at his court martial prison breaking desertion damage to government property damage to his uniform he would probably be hanged the only other chance was that he would be flogged round the fleet to die for certain under the lash hudnutt was a dead man and this was the end of his talent for music it was a sombre enough thought to occupy his mind all the way to the pier and it kept him silent as he climbed into the governors carriage to be driven to government house he had no commanderinchiefs carriage now he was still silent as they drove away but they had hardly gone a mile when they met a lively cavalcade clattering down on horseback towards them first hornblower saw barbara he would have picked her out in any crowd even if she had not been conspicuous on a white horse his excellency rode on one side of her and lady hooper on the other chattering eagerly behind them came a mixed party of aidesdecamp and civilians at the rear rode the assistant provostmarshal and two troopers of his guard ha hornblower called the governor reining up your ceremonial seems to have finished earlier than i expected good morning sir said hornblower your servant maam then he smiled at barbara he could always smile at the sight of her despite any depression in her hunting veil the smile she gave him in return was hardly apparent you can join us in our hunt one of my aidesdecamp will give you his horse said hooper and then peering into the carriage no perhaps not in those silk stockings you can follow us in the carriage like a lady with certain expectations like the queen of france by gad turn that carriage coachman what are you hunting sir asked hornblower a little bewildered that deserter of yours he might show us some sport answered hooper they were hunting man the biggest game of all but hudnutt dreamy scatterbrained hudnutt would be poor game two coloured servants rode in the party each holding a leash of bloodhounds tawny and black grim horrible creatures he wanted to have nothing to do with this hunt nothing whatever he wanted to order the carriage to turn back again this was a nightmare and it was beyond his power to awaken himself from it it was horrible to see barbara taking part in it at the dockyard gate at the high palisade the cortege halted thats the prison said the assistant provostmarshal pointing you can see the hole in the roof sir an area of thatch had been torn away probably that prison was not very strongly built to escape from it meant that the fifteenfoot palisade had to be scaled next and even then certain recapture somewhere in the island awaited the man to achieve that feat come on said the assistant provostmarshal and he and his guard and the men with the bloodhounds trotted into the dockyard to the prison and dismounted they took the bloodhounds into the prison where presumably the hounds smelt at the prisoners bedding then they reappeared at the door smelling at the ground below the hole in the roof instantly they caught the scent throwing themselves against their leashes so that the coloured servants had a difficult task to remount and then they came pelting across the dockyard again they threw themselves against the palisade leaping up at it slavering with excitement bring em round to this side shouted the governor and then turning to hornblower your mans a marine isnt he even a sailor would find it hard to scale that palisade hudnutt might have done it in some exalted mood thought hornblower those dreamers were like madmen sometimes the bloodhounds were brought round through the dockyard gate again and led to the corresponding point on the outside of the palisade they caught the scent again in a flash throwing themselves against their leashes and galloping down the road gone away yelled the governor spurring his horse after them hudnutt had climbed that fifteenfoot palisade then he must have been insane the cavalcade had all gone on ahead the coachman was urging the carriage horses along as fast as their dignity and the inequalities of the road would permit the carriage lurched and leaped throwing hornblower against gerard beside him and sometimes even against spendlove opposite straight up the road they went heading for the open country and the blue mountains beyond the horsemen ahead reined back into a trot and the coachman followed their example so that the progress of the carriage became more sedate a hot enough scent my lord said gerard peering forward at the bloodhounds still straining at their leashes and yet this road must have been well travelled since he went along it said spendlove ah said gerard still peering forward theyre leaving the road as the carriage reached the corner they saw that the horsemen had turned up a broad lane through fields of cane the coachman nothing daunted swung up into the lane after them but after two more miles of rapid progress he pulled his horses to a halt a check here hornblower said the governor this lane fords the hope river here the halted cavalcade was breathing the horses barbara waved her gloved hand to him no scent the other side explained the governor and then calling to the men with the bloodhounds cast upstream as well as down and on both sides the assistant provostmarshal acknowledged the order with a salute your man knew wed have bloodhounds after him said the governor he waded along the river but he has to come out sooner or later and well pick up the scent again there barbara guided her horse to the side of the carriage and raised her veil to speak to him good morning dear she said good morning said hornblower it was hard to say more when the events of the last hour or two and all their implications were allowed for and barbara was hardly flushed with the heat and the exercise she looked drawn and tired her smile was positively wan it occurred to hornblower that she was participating in this hunt as unwillingly as he was and it seemed likely that she had allowed the move from admiralty house to government house this morning to trouble her womanlike she would not have been able to allow the navy to execute the task without her supervision even though the navy had made similar moves by the hundred thousand she had tried to order it all and was weary in consequence come and sit in the carriage dear he said gerard will take your horse mr gerard is wearing silk stockings the same as you are dear replied barbara smiling through her weariness and i have too much respect for his dignity to set him on a side saddle in any case my groom will lead your horse lady hornblower interposed the governor this hunt looks as if its going to turn out badly hornblower scrambled down from the carriage to help barbara from the sidesaddle and up into the carriage gerard and spendlove who had followed him out followed them back after a moments hesitation and sat with their backs to the horses we should have heard something from the bloodhounds by now said the governor the four bloodhounds had now cast up and down both banks for a considerable distance can he have climbed a tree a man could be more resourceful than any fox hornblower knew but it was an unexpected aspect of hudnutts character not a trace of scent your excellency said the assistant provostmarshal trotting up nothing at all oh well then well go home again a poor days sport after all well precede you lady hornblower with your permission well see you at the house dear lady hornblower echoed lady hooper the carriage turned again and followed the horsemen down the lane youve had a busy morning i fear my dear said hornblower with his staff sitting across the carriage from them he had to retain a certain formality of tone not busy at all answered barbara turning her head to meet his glance a very pleasant morning thank you dear and you your ceremonial went off without a hitch i hope well enough thank you ransome he changed what he was going to say abruptly what he would say about ransome to barbaras private ear was not the same as what he would say in the hearing of his staff the carriage trotted on and conversation proceeded only fitfully in the heat it was long before they swung through the gates of government house with hornblower acknowledging the salute of the sentry and drew up at the door aidesdecamp and butlers and maids awaited them but barbara had already dealt with the move and in the vast cavernous bedroom and dressing room allotted to principal guests hornblowers things were already disposed along with hers at last alone smiled barbara now we can look forward to smallbridge indeed that was so this was the beginning of one of those periods of transition which hornblower knew so well as did every sailor the strange days or weeks between one life and the next he had ceased to be a commanderinchief now he had to endure existence until he would at least be master in his own house the urgent need at the moment was for a bath his shirt was sticking to his ribs under his heavy uniform coat perhaps never again never in all his life would he take a bath under a washdeck pump somewhere out with the trade winds blowing upon him on the other hand he would not at least while he was in jamaica have to wear a uniform again it was later in the day that barbara made her request to him dear would you please give me some money of course said hornblower he felt a delicacy about this which most men would laugh at barbara had brought a good deal of money to their marriage which of course was now his property and he felt an absurd guilt that she should have to ask him for money that feeling of guilt was perfectly ridiculous of course women were not supposed to dispose of money in any way except small sums for housekeeping they could not legally sign a cheque they could enter into no business transaction at all which was perfectly right and proper seeing how incapable women were except perhaps barbara it was the husbands business to keep all moneys under his own hand and dole out under his own supervision what was needed how much would you like dear he asked two hundred pounds said barbara two hundred pounds two hundred pounds that was something entirely different it was a fortune what in the world would barbara want two hundred pounds for here in jamaica there could not be one single gown or pair of gloves in the whole island that barbara could possibly want to buy a few souvenirs perhaps the most elaborate tortoiseshell toilet set in jamaica would not cost five pounds two hundred pounds there would be a few maids to whom she would have to give vails on leaving but five shillings each half a guinea at most would settle those two hundred pounds he said it aloud this time yes dear if you please it will be my business to tip the butler and grooms of course he said still trying to find reasons why she should think she needed this stupendous sum yes no doubt dear said barbara patiently but i need some money for other purposes but its a lot of money i think we can afford it though please dear of course of course said hornblower hastily he could not bear it that barbara should have to plead to him all he had was hers it was always a pleasure to him to anticipate her wants to forestall any request so that it never need be uttered he felt shame that barbara exquisite barbara should ever have to abase herself so low as to ask a favour of him unworthy as he was ill write an order on summers he said hes couttss correspondent in kingston thank you dear said barbara yet as he handed the order over he could not refrain from further speech youll be careful dear wont you he said two hundred pounds whether in notes or gold his misgivings ceased to be voiced died away in incoherent mumblings he had no wish to pry he had no wish to exert over barbara the sort of parental authority that both law and custom gave a husband over his wife and then he thought of a possible explanation lady hooper was a keen and clever card player presumably barbara had lost heavily to her well in that case he need not worry barbara was a good player too and level headed and cool she would win it back in any case she was no gambler perhaps on the voyage home they would have a few hands of piquet if barbara had any fault at all it was a tendency to discard a little thoughtlessly when playing the younger hand and he could give a little unobtrusive advice and there was a smug pleasure and a tender pleasure in the thought of barbara not caring to admit to a husband who notoriously won that she had lost at cards the deep respect that he felt for her was accompanied by the knowledge that she was still human hornblower knew that there can be no love without respect and no love without a twinkle of amusement as well you are the dearest man in the world said barbara and he realised that her eyes had been fixed on his face for the last several seconds it is my greatest happiness to hear you say so he answered with a sincerity that no one could doubt and then a recollection of their position in this house as mere guests came to them both to modify the intensity of their feelings and we shall be the most unpopular people in jamaica if we keep their excellencies waiting for their dinner said hornblower they were only guests now mere hangerson their presence only tolerated by people who had their official lives still to live that was what hornblower thought at dinner time when the new commanderinchief sat in the place of honour he thought of the byzantine general blinded and disgraced begging in the marketplace and he nearly said spare a penny for belisarius when the governor turned to include him in the conversation your marine hasnt been apprehended yet said hooper not my marine any longer sir laughed hornblower admiral ransomes marine now i understand theres no doubt that he will be apprehended said ransome weve not lost a deserter yet during the time of my appointment here said hooper thats very reassuring was ransomes comment hornblower stole a glance at barbara across the table she was eating her dinner with apparent composure he had feared lest this reminder should upset her for he knew how strongly she felt about hudnutts fate a woman was liable to think that the inevitable should not be inevitable in matters in which she was interested barbaras mastery of her feelings was something more to admire about her lady hooper changed the subject and conversation became general and gay hornblower actually began to enjoy himself with a lightheaded feeling of irresponsibility there were no cares on his shoulders soon the moment the packet was ready to sail he would be on his way to england and he would be pleasantly settled in smallbridge while these people here went on dealing with unrewarding problems in tropical heat nothing here mattered to him any more if barbara were happy he had not a care in the world and barbara was seemingly happy chattering away to her neighbours on either hand it was pleasant too that there was not to be any heavy drinking for after dinner there was to be a reception in honour of the new commanderinchief to which all the island society not eligible for dinner had been invited he found himself looking at life with fresh eyes and actually approving of it after dinner when the men and the ladies met again in the drawing room and the first new guests were being announced he was able to exchange a word or two with barbara and to see that she was happy and not overtired her smile was bright and her eyes sparkling he had to turn away from her in the end to shake hands with mr hough just arrived with his wife other guests were streaming in a sudden influx of blue and gold and white marked the arrival of coleman tritons captain and a couple of his lieutenants ransome himself was presenting coleman to barbara and hornblower could not help but hear the conversation close behind him captain coleman is an old friend of mine said barbara you were perfecto coleman in those days werent you captain and you were lady leighton maam said coleman a harmless enough remark but enough to shatter hornblowers frail happiness to darken the brightlylit room to set the babble of conversation in the room roaring in hornblowers ears like a torrent through the din of which barbaras words pierced shrill like a whistle note captain coleman was my first husbands flaglieutenant said barbara she had had a first husband she had been lady leighton hornblower nearly always contrived to forget this rearadmiral sir percy leighton had died for his country of wounds received in the battle of rosas bay thirteen full years ago but barbara had been leightons wife leightons widow she had been leightons wife before she had been hornblowers hornblower hardly ever thought about it but when he did he still experienced a jealousy which he knew to be insane any reminder not only reawoke that jealousy but brought back to him with agonising clarity the recollection of the despair the envy the black selfderision he had known in those days he had been a desperately unhappy man then and this made him the same desperately unhappy man now he was no longer the successful sailor terminating a brilliant period of command he was the thwarted lover despised even by his own despicable self he knew again all the misery of limitless and yet unsatisfied desire to blend with the jealousies of the moment hough was awaiting a reply to some remark he had made hornblower forced himself to extemporise some casual sentence which may or may not have been relevant hough drifted away and hornblower found himself against his will looking over at barbara she had her ready smile for him and he had to smile back and he knew it to be a dreadful lopsided mirthless smile like a grin on the face of a dead man he saw a worried look come on her face he knew how instantly she was conscious of his moods and that made it worse than ever she was the heartless woman who had spoken of her first husband that jealousy of his was a mood she knew nothing of was not susceptible to he was a man who had stepped suddenly from firm ground into a morass of uncertainty that would engulf him captain knyvett had entered the room bluff and grizzled dressed in blue broadcloth with unpretentious brass buttons as he approached hornblower could only with an effort remember him as the captain of the jamaica packet we sail a week from today my lord he said the announcement for the mail will be made tomorrow excellent said hornblower and i can see from all this went on knyvett with a gesture indicating admiral ransomes presence that i shall have the pleasure of your lordships company and her ladyships yes yes quite so said hornblower you will be my only passengers said knyvett excellent repeated hornblower i trust your lordship will find the pretty jane a wellfound and comfortable ship i trust so said hornblower her ladyship of course is familiar with the deckhouse that will be your accommodation i shall ask her if she can suggest any addition that will add to your comfort my lord very well knyvett drifted away after this cold reception and it was only after he had gone that hornblower realised that knyvett must have received an impression of a toplofty peer with hardly bare politeness for a mere packetcaptain he regretted it and made a desperate effort to get himself under control again a glance at barbara revealed her chatting animatedly with young bonner the fishingboat owner and general merchant with the shady reputation against whom hornblower had already warned her that could have added to his misery if it were possible again he made the effort to control himself he knew the expression on his face to be frozen and blank and he tried to make it more pleasing as he forced himself to stroll through the crowd can we tempt you lord hornblower asked an old lady standing by the cardtable in an alcove she was a good whist player hornblower remembered why certainly with pleasure he made himself say he had something to think about now for the first few hands it was hard to concentrate especially as the noise of an orchestra was added to the din of the party but old habits reasserted themselves with the necessity to remember the distribution of fiftytwo cards by sheer willpower he achieved the transformation of himself into a thinking machine playing coldly and correctly and then when the rubber appeared to be lost he was carried away despite himself the next hand afforded an opportunity for brilliance for that injection into his sofar mechanical play of the human quality the flexibility the unpredictable cunning which marked the difference between a secondclass player and a firstclass one by the fourth lead he had made a fair estimate of the hands one particular lead might enable him to clear the board to win every trick and the rubber with orthodox play the hand would end with his making only twelve tricks and the rubber still in doubt it was worth trying but it was now or never without hesitation he led his queen of hearts to the ace that his partner was forced to play he took the next trick and along with it control of the situation cleared trumps led out his established winners saw with satisfaction his opponents discard first the knave and then the king of hearts and he finally laid down the three of hearts to take the last trick amid the dismay of his opponents why thats grand slam said the old lady who was his partner quite astonished i dont understand i dont see how weve won the rubber after all it had been a neat piece of work there was a perceptible glow of accomplishment within him that was a hand that he would be able to play over in his mind in future while composing himself to sleep when the card playing was finished and the guests beginning to leave he was able to meet barbaras eye with a more natural expression and barbara with a relieved sigh was able to tell herself that her husband was coming out of his unpredictable mood it was as well that he was for the next few days were bound to be difficult there was almost nothing for him to do as the pretty jane made ready for sea as a helpless spectator he had to stand by and watch ransome taking over the command he had held for three years the spanish question was likely to be difficult with the french invasion of spain to restore ferdinand vii there was the mexican question as well as the venezuela question he could not help fretting over the possibility of ransome mishandling them on the other hand there was the small comfort that hudnutt had so far succeeded in evading capture hornblower honestly feared that if he should be apprehended and sentenced while they were still in the island barbara might take action herself with personal appeals to ransome or even to the governor barbara actually seemed to have forgotten about the case which was more than hornblower had he was still profoundly disturbed about it and inclined to fret himself into a fever at his complete lack of power to exert any influence in the matter it was hard to be philosophic about it to tell himself that no individual not even hornblower could hold back the working of the inexorable machine of the articles for the regulating and better government of his majestys navies and hudnutt was a more capable person than he had ever imagined seeing that he had been able to maintain himself free from capture for a week now unless perhaps he was dead that might be best for hudnutt captain knyvett came in person with the news that the pretty jane was almost ready for sea the last of the cargos going on board now my lord he said the logwoods all in and the coir is on the quay if your lordship and her ladyship will come on board this evening well sail with the land breeze at dawn thank you captain i am greatly obliged to you said hornblower trying not to be fulsome to make up for his coldness at the governors party pretty jane was a flushdecked brig save that amidships she carried a small but substantial deckhouse for her passengers barbara had inhabited it for five weeks on the outward voyage now they entered it together with all the bustle of the ships getting ready for sea going on round them i used to look at that other bed dear she said to hornblower as they stood in the deckhouse and i used to tell myself that soon my husband would be sleeping there it seemed too good to be possible dear a noise outside distracted them this case maam asked the government house servant who was bringing their baggage on board under gerards supervision that oh ive asked the captain about that already its to go in the steerage yes maam delicacies in tin boxes explained barbara to hornblower i brought them all the way out for you to enjoy while going home dear you are too good to me said hornblower a case that size and weight would be a nuisance in the deckhouse in the steerage its contents would be readily accessible what is coir asked barbara looking out to see one of the final bales going down the hatchway the hairy husks of coconuts explained hornblower what in the world are we carrying those to england for asked barbara there are machines now which can weave it they make cocomatting by the mile in england now and logwood they extract a dye from it a bright red dye you are my unfailing source of information dear said barbara as well as everything else in life for me heres their excellencies coming my lord warned gerard arriving at the deckhouse door that meant the final goodbyes in the dying evening a painful sad moment much shaking of hands kisses on each cheek for barbara from lady hooper the word goodbye repeated over and over again overwhelming in its finality goodbye to friends and to acquaintances goodbye to jamaica and to the commandinchief goodbye to one life with the next still to disclose itself goodbye to the last shadowy figure disappearing in the darkness of the quay and then to turn again to barbara standing beside him permanent in these transitions in the first light of next morning hornblower could hardly be blamed for being on deck feeling oddly awkward with the necessity for keeping out of the way watching while knyvett warped the pretty jane away from the quay to catch the land breeze and head out of the harbour luckily knyvett was made of sturdy stuff and was not in the least discomposed at having to handle his ship under the eye of an admiral the land breeze filled the sails pretty jane gathered way they dipped the flag to fort augusta and then with the helm hard over came round to leave drunken cay and south cay on their port side before beginning the long reach to the eastward and hornblower could relax and contemplate the new prospect of breakfasting with his wife on shipboard he surprised himself at the ease with which he accustomed himself to being a passenger at first he was so anxious to give no indication of interference that he did not even dare to look into the binnacle to note their course he was content to sit with barbara in two hammock chairs in the shade of the deckhouse there were beckets to which the chairs could be hooked to prevent them sliding down the deck to leeward as pretty jane heeled over and think about nothing in particular watching the flying fish furrowing the surface and the patches of yellow sargasso weed drift by gold against the blue and an occasional turtle swimming manfully along far from land he could watch captain knyvett and his mate take their noon sights and assure himself that he had no interest at all in the figures they were obtaining and in truth he was really more interested in the punctuality of mealtimes he could crack an idle joke with barbara to the effect that pretty jane had made this run so often she could be trusted to find her way home without supervision and his mind was lazy enough to think that funny it was actually his first holiday after three years of strenuous work during much of that time he had frequently been under severe strain and during all of it he had been busy he sank into idleness as a man might sink into a warm bath with the difference that he had not expected to find this relaxation and ease in idleness and in the cessation of responsibility nothing mattered during those golden days he was the person least concerned in all the ship as pretty jane thrashed her way northward in the burning question as to whether the wind would hold steady to enable her to weather point maysi without having to go about and he did not care when they did not succeed he endured philosophically the long beat to windward back towards haiti and he smiled patronisinglv at the petty jubilation on board when they succeeded on the next tack and passed through the windward channel so that they might almost consider themselves out of the caribbean a persistent northward slant in the trades kept them from attempting the caicos passage and they had to hold away to the eastward for silver bank passage caicos or silver bank or for that matter turks island or mouchoir he did not care he did not care whether he arrived home in august or september yet his instincts were only dormant that evening when they were truly in the atlantic he felt restless and disturbed for the first time since leaving jamaica there was something heavy in the breathing of the air and something unusual about the swell that was rolling the pretty jane so heavily a gale before morning he decided a little unusual in these latitudes at this time of year but nothing really to worry about he did not trouble barbara with his notions but he woke several times in the night to find the ship still rolling heavily when the watch was called he noted that all hands were kept on deck to shorten sail and he was tempted to go out to see what was happening a clatter outside awoke barbara whats that she asked sleepily only the deadlights dear he answered someone had slammed the deadlights against the deckhouse windows and clamped them home knyvett must be expecting to ship some heavy seas barbara went back to sleep and hornblower actually followed her example but in half an hour he was awake again the gale was unceasing and the ship was working considerably in the swell so that everything was groaning and creaking he lay in the darkness to feel the ship heaving and lying over under him and he could both hear and actually feel the vibration of the taut standing rigging transmitted to his bunk via the deck he would like to go out and have a look at the weather but he did not wish to disturb barbara awake dear said a small voice the other side of the deckhouse yes he answered it seems to be getting rough a little he said theres nothing to worry about go to sleep again dear now he could not go out because barbara was awake and would know about it he made himself lie still it was pitch dark in the deckhouse with the deadlights in and perhaps because of the cessation of ventilation it was now overpoweringly hot despite the gale pretty jane was leaping about extravagantly and every now and then lying over so far that he feared lest barbara should be rolled out of her bunk then he was conscious of a change in the vessels behaviour of a difference in the thunderous creaking that filled the darkness knyvett had hove the pretty jane to she was not lying over but she was pitching fantastically indicating a really heavy sea outside he wanted so much to go out and see for himself he had no idea even of what the time was it was far too dark to look at his watch at the thought that it might be dawn he could restrain himself no longer awake dear he asked yes said barbara she did not add how could anyone sleep in this din for barbara lived up to the principle that no person of breeding should ever complain about things he was unable or unwilling to do anything to remedy i shall go out on deck if you do not mind my leaving you dear he said please go if you wish to of course dear answered barbara nor did she add that she wished she could go out too hornblower groped for his trousers and his shoes and felt his way to the door long experience warned him to brace himself as he unfastened it but even he was a little surprised at the raging wind that awaited him it was wild even though with pretty jane hoveto the door on the after side was in the lee of the deckhouse he stepped over the coaming and managed to slam the door the wind was tremendous but what was more surprising still was its warmth it seemed to be of brickkiln heat as it screamed round him he balanced himself on the heaving deck in the hot noisy darkness and timed his rush to the wheel and he was only just prepared for the extra violence of the wind when he emerged from the lee of the deckhouse out of that lee too the air was full of flying spray which drenched him and modified his impression of the heat of the air he was aware of all this by the time he reached the wheel there were shadowy figures there in the darkness a white shirtsleeve waved to him to acknowledge his presence indicating that knyvett was there hornblower looked into the binnacle it was really an effort to collect his faculties and make the correct deductions from what he could see of the swinging needle the wind was blowing from well out to the west of north looking up in the darkness he could just make out that the brig was hoveto under the maintopmast staysail of which only a corner was showing knyvett was shouting into his ear hurricane likely enough shouted hornblower in reply worse before its better a hurricane had no business to appear at this time of year a good two months earlier than one should be expected but that hot breath the indications of yesterday evening the direction of the wind at present all seemed to prove that that was what they were experiencing it remained to be seen whether they were right in the path of it or only on its fringe pretty jane shuddered and lurched drunkenly as a mass of water came in over her bow gleaming white almost phosphorescent as it raced aft at them hornblower hung on desperately as it surged past him waist deep a nasty warning of what might be still to come they were in very considerable danger pretty jane might not endure the pounding she would have to undergo and in any case with the considerable leeway she was making they might be cast ashore and utterly destroyed on san domingo or puerto rico or some intervening cay the wind shrieked at them and a combination of wind and wave laid pretty jane over over until the deck was almost vertical with hornblower hanging on as his feet could gain no hold on the planking a wave burst against her exposed bottom clean over her cascading round them and then she came slowly back again no ship would be expected to endure that sort of thing for long a muffled bang aloft followed by a series of sharper sounds attracted his attention to the topmast staysail just as it blew out from its gaskets and flew into ribbons which cracked like whips while they lasted one thundering small fragment remained whipping from the stay just enough to keep pretty janes starboard bow to the sea daylight was coming there was a yellow tinge all about them shut in by the low sky overhead as hornblower looked aloft he saw a hump a bubble appear on the main yard and the bubble promptly burst into fragments the wind was tearing the sail from its gaskets the process was repeated along the yard as the wind with fingers of steel pried into the solid roll of the sail to tear it loose rip it open split it into ribbons and then tear off the ribbons to whirl them away to leeward it was hard to believe that a wind could have such power it was hard to believe too that waves could be so high a glance at them explained at once the fantastic motion of the ship they were appalling in their immensity the one approaching the starboard bow was not as high as a mountain hornblower had used the expression mountain high himself and now trying to estimate the height had to admit to himself that it was an exaggeration but it was as high as a lofty church steeple it was a colossal ridge of water moving not with the speed of a racehorse but with the speed of a hurrying man straight upon them pretty jane lifted her bow to it lurching and then climbing rising ever more steeply as she lay upon the towering slope up up up she seemed to be almost vertical as she reached the crest where it was as if the end of the world awaited her at the crest the wind temporarily blanketed by the wave flung itself upon her with redoubled force over she lay over and over while at the same time her stern heaved itself up as the crest passed under her down down down the deck almost vertical bows down and almost vertical on her beam and as she wallowed down the slope minor waves awaited her to burst over her with the water surging round him waist deep chest deep hornblower felt his legs carried away from under him and he had to hang on with every ounce of his strength to save himself here was the ships carpenter trying to say something to the captain it was impossible to speak intelligently in that wind but he held up one hand with the fingers spread five feet of water in the hold then but the carpenter repeated the gesture then he tried again two spreadings of the fingers ten feet of water then it could hardly be the case but it was true the heavy heavings of the pretty jane showed she was waterlogged then hornblower remembered the cargo with which she was laden logwood and coir logwood floated only sluggishly but coir was one of the most buoyant substances known coconuts falling into the sea floated for weeks and months carried about by the currents so that the wide distribution of the coconut palm was readily accounted for it was coir that was keeping pretty jane afloat even though she was full of water it would keep her afloat for a long time it would outlast the pretty jane for that matter she would work herself to fragments before the coir allowed her to sink so perhaps they had another hour or two of life before them perhaps another wave cascading green over pretty janes upturned side brought a grim warning that it might not be as long as that and amid the rumble and the roar of the bursting wave even as he hung on desperately he was conscious of a succession of other sounds harder and sharper and of a jarring of the deck under his feet the deckhouse it was lifting on its bolts under the impact of the water it could not be expected to stand that battering long it was bound to be swept away soon and hornblowers visual imagination was feverishly at work before then its seams would be forced apart it would fill with water barbara would be drowned inside it before the weight of water within tore the deckhouse from its bolts for the waves to hurl it overside with barbaras drowned body inside clinging to the binnacle hornblower went through some seconds of mental agony the worst he had ever known in his life there had been times and times before when he had faced death for himself when he had weighed chances when he had staked his own life but now it was barbaras life that he was staking to leave her in the deckhouse meant her certain death soon the alternative was to bring her out upon the waveswept deck here tied to the mast she would live as long as she could endure the buffeting and the exposure until the pretty jane broke up into fragments possibly for himself he had played out a losing game to the bitter end more than once now he had to brace himself to do the same for barbara he made the decision on barbaras behalf he decided to struggle on as long as was possible forcing himself to think logically while the stupefying wind roared round him he made his plans he awaited a comparatively calm moment and then made the perilous brief journey to the foot of the mainmast now he worked with frantic rapidity two lengths of the maintopsail halliards he had to keep his head clear to prevent his fumbling fingers from entangling them then two desperate journeys first to the wheel and then to the deckhouse he tore open the door and stumbled in over the coaming the lines in his hands there were two feet of water in the deckhouse surging about with the motion of the ship barbara was there he saw her in the light from the door she had wedged herself as well as she might in her bunk dearest he said within the deckhouse it was just possible to be heard despite the frantic din all round im here dear she replied another wave burst over the pretty jane at that moment water came pouring in through the gaping seams of the deckhouse and he could feel the whole thing lift again on its bolts and he knew a moment of wild despair at the thought that he might already be too late that the deckhouse was going to be swept away at this moment with them in it but it held the surge of the water as pretty jane lay over the other way flung hornblower against the other bulkhead i must get you out of here dear said hornblower trying to keep his voice steady youll be safer tied to the mainmast as you wish of course dear said barbara calmly im going to put these lines round you said hornblower barbara had managed to dress herself in his absence at any rate she had some sort of dress or petticoat on hornblower made fast the lines about her while the ship rolled and swayed under their feet she held her arms up for him to do so he knotted the lines round her waist below her tender bosom listen carefully said hornblower and he told her while they were still in the comparative calm of the deckhouse what he wanted her to do how she had to watch her chance rush to the wheel and from there to the mainmast i understand dear said barbara kiss me once more my very dearest he kissed her hurriedly his lips against her dripping cheek it was only the most perfunctory kiss to hornblowers subconscious mind barbara in making her request was risking their lives for it staking ten thousand future kisses against one immediate one it was womanlike for her to do so but odds of ten thousand to one had no appeal for hornblower and still she lingered dearest ive always loved you she said she was speaking hurriedly and yet with no proper regard for the value of time ive loved no one but you in all my life i had another husband once i couldnt say this before because it would have been disloyal but now ive never loved anyone but you never only you darling yes dear said hornblower he heard the words but at that urgent moment he could not give them their rightful consideration stand here hold on to this hold on it was only a lesser wave that swept by them wait for my signal bellowed hornblower into barbaras ear and then he made the hurried dash to the binnacle one group of men had bound themselves to the wheel there was a frantic moment as he looked about him he waved and then barbara crossed the heaving deck as he took up on the line he had just time to fling a bight round her and pull it tight and seize hold himself as the next crest burst over the ship over over over sluggishly the pretty jane wallowed up again he had an idea that one man at least was missing from the group at the wheel but there was no time to think about that for there was the passage to the mainmast still to be accomplished at last that was done there were four men there already but he was able to make barbara as secure as possible and then himself pretty jane lay over again and again it was at some time shortly after this that a fresh monstrous wave swept away the deckhouse and half the ships rail hornblower saw the wreckage go off to leeward and noted the fact dully he had been right in taking barbara away from there it may have been the loss of the deckhouse that called his attention to the behaviour of the pretty jane she was lying in the trough of the sea not riding with her bows to the waves the loss of the windage of the deckhouse right aft perhaps made this more noticeable she was rolling wildly and deeply in consequence and was being swept by the waves more thoroughly she could not be expected to survive this for long nor could the miserable human beings on her deck of whom barbara was one and he was another the pretty jane would rack herself to pieces before long something was needed to keep her bows to the sea in the normal way a small area of canvas exposed right aft would bring this about but no canvas would stand against that wind as had been early demonstrated in the present circumstances the pressure of the wind against the foremast and bowsprit with their standing rigging balanced that against the mainmast keeping her lying broadside on to wind and wave if canvas could not be exposed aft then the windage forward must be reduced instead the foremast should be cut away then the pressure on the mainmast would bring her bows on to the sea increasing her chances while the loss of the mast would perhaps ease the roll as well there was no doubt about it the mast should be cut away instantly aft there was knyvett bound to the wheel no more than a few feet away it was his decision as captain as pretty jane wallowed to bring her deck horizontal for a moment with water no more than knee deep over it hornblower waved to him he pointed forward to the weather foremast shrouds he gesticulated he thought he conveyed his meaning clearly enough but knyvett showed no sign of understanding he certainly made no move to act upon the suggestion he merely gazed stupidly and then looked away hornblower felt a moment of fury the next roll and submergence made up his mind for him the discipline of the sea might be disregarded in the face of this indifference and incompetence but the other men beside him at the mainmast were as indifferent as knyvett he could not rouse them to join him in the effort they had a momentary safety here at the mast and they would not leave it probably they could not understand what he had in mind that outrageous wind was perfectly stupefying as it screamed round them and the constant deluges of water and the desperate need to struggle for a footing gave them no chance to collect their thoughts an axe would perhaps be best to cut those shrouds but there was no axe the man beside him had a knife in a sheath at his belt hornblower put his hand on the hilt and made himself think reasonably again he tested the edge found it sharp and then unbuckled belt and all and rebuckled it about his own waist the man offering no objection merely gazing stupidly at him as he did so again there was need to plan to think clearly in the howling wind and the driving spray and the solid water that surged round him he cut himself two lengths of line from the raffle about him and made each of them fast round his chest with an end hanging free then he looked over to the foremast shrouds planning again there would be no time to think things out when the moment for action began a length of the rail still survived its battering there presumably the weather shrouds had acted as some sort of breakwater to it he eyed and measured the distance he eased the knots that held him to the mast he spared a glance at barbara forcing himself to smile she was standing there in her bonds the hurricane was blowing her long hair wet though it was straight out horizontally from her head he put another line about her to make her secure there was nothing else he could do this was bedlam this was insanity this was a wet shrieking hell and yet a hell in which he had to keep his head clear he watched his moment first he almost misjudged it and had to draw back swallowing hard in the tense excitement before the next wave engulfed him as it surged away he watched pretty janes motion again set his teeth and cast off his bonds and made the rush up the steep deck wave and deck offering him a lee which saved him from being blown away by the wind he reached the rail with five seconds to spare five seconds in which to secure himself to knot himself to the shrouds as the crest burst over him in a torrent of water which first swept his legs from under him and next tore his grip loose so that for a second or two only the lines held him before an eddy enabled him to reestablish his grip pretty jane wallowed clear again it was awkward to fasten the lanyard of the sheath knife to his wrist but he had to consume precious moments in doing so otherwise all his efforts so far would be wasted in ridiculous failure now he was sawing desperately at the shroud the soaked fibres seemed like iron but he felt them part little by little a few fibres at a time he was glad he had made sure the knife was sharp he had halfsevered the rope before the next deluge burst over him the moment his shoulders were clear of the water he continued to saw at the rope he could feel as he cut a slight variation of tension as the ship rolled and the shroud faintly slackened he wondered if when the rope parted it would fly dangerously and he decided that as long as the other shrouds held the reaction would not be too violent so it proved the shroud simply vanished under his knife the wind caught its fiftyfoot length and whirled it away out of his world presumably blowing it out as a streamer from the masthead he set about the next sawing away in the intervals of being submerged under the crashing waves he cut and he hung on he struggled for air in the driving spray he choked and suffocated under the green water but one shroud after another parted under his knife the knife was losing its edge and now he was faced with an additional problem he had severed nearly every shroud the aftermost ones within reach and soon he would have to shift his position to reach the foremost ones but he did not have to solve that problem after all at the next roll and the next wave actually while he was struggling under water he was conscious of a series of shocks transmitted through the fabric of the ship through his clutching hands four minor ones and then a violent one as the wave fell away from him his swimming eyes could see what had happened the four remaining shrouds had parted under the strain one two three four and then the mast had snapped off looking back over his shoulder he could see the stump standing eight feet above the deck the difference it made to the pretty jane was instantly apparent the very next roll ended halfheartedly in a mere violent pitch as the shrieking wind acting upon her mainmast pushed her stern round and brought her bows to the sea while the loss of the leverage of the lofty foremast reduced the amplitude of the roll in any case the sea that broke over hornblowers head was almost negligible in violence and quantity hornblower could breathe he could look about him he observed something else the foremast still attached to the ship by the lee shrouds was now dragging ahead of her as she made stern way through the water under the impulse of the wind it was acting as a sea anchor a very slight restraint upon the extravagance of her motions moreover as the point of attachment was on the port side she was slightly turned so that she met the waves a trifle on her port bow so that she was riding at the best possible angle with a very slight roll and a long pitch waterlogged though she was she still had a chance and hornblower on the starboard bow was comparatively sheltered and able to contemplate his handiwork with some sort of pride he looked across at the pitiful groups of people clustering bound to the mainmast and the wheel and binnacle barbara was out of his sight in the group at the mainmast hidden from him by the men there and he was consumed with a sudden anxiety lest further mishap might have befallen her he began to cast himself loose to return to her and it was then with the cessation of the allconsuming preoccupation regarding the ship that a sudden recollection struck him so forcibly that he actually paused with his fingers on the knots barbara had kissed him in the lee of the vanished deckhouse and she had said hornblower remembered well what she had said it had lain stored in his memory until this moment awaiting his attention when there should be a lull in the need for violent action she had not merely said that she loved him she had said she had never loved anyone else hornblower huddled on the deck of a waterlogged ship with a hurricane shrieking round him was suddenly aware that an old hurt was healed that he would never again feel that dull ache of jealousy of barbaras first husband never as long as he lived that was enough to bring him back to the world of practical affairs the remaining length of his life might well be measured in hours he would more likely than not be dead by nightfall or by tomorrow at latest and so would barbara so would barbara the absurd tiny feeling of wellbeing that had sprung up within him was instantly destroyed and replaced by a frantic sorrow and a despair that was almost overwhelming he had to exert all his willpower to make himself master of his drooping body again and of his weary mind he had to act and to think as though he was not exhausted and as though he did not despair the discovery that the sheath knife still dangled at his wrist awoke the selfcontempt that invariably stimulated him he untied the lanyard and secured the knife in its sheath before setting himself to study the motion of the pretty jane he cast himself loose and dashed for the mainmast the tremendous wind might well have carried him clean aft and overboard but the upheaving of the stern checked his progress sufficiently for him to swing into the lee of the group at the mainmast and to clutch one of the lines there and hang on the men there hanging apathetic in their lashings spared him hardly a glance and made no move to help him barbara her wet hair streaming out sideways had a smile and a hand for him and he forced his way into the group beside her and bound himself next to her he took her hand in his again and was reassured by the return of the pressure he gave it then there was nothing to do except to remain alive part of the process of remaining alive was not to think about being thirsty as the day wore on and the yellow daylight was replaced by black night it was hard not to do so once he had realised how thirsty he was and now he had a new torment when he thought that barbara was suffering in that way too there was nothing he could do about that at all nothing except to stand in his bonds and endure along with her with the coming of night however the wind lost its brickkiln heat and blew almost chilly so that hornblower found himself shivering a little he turned in his bonds and put his arms round barbara holding her to him to conserve her bodily warmth it was during the night that he was troubled by the behaviour of the man next to him who persisted in leaning against him more and more heavily so that repeatedly hornblower had to take his arms from around barbara and thrust him fiercely away at the third or fourth of those thrusts he felt the man fall limply away from him and guessed he was dead that made a little more room about the mast and he could put barbara squarely against it where she could lean back with her shoulders supported hornblower could guess that she would find that a help judging by the agonising cramp in his legs and the utter weariness of every part of his body there was a temptation a terrible temptation to give up to let everything go to let himself fall to the deck and die like the man beside him but he would not that was for the sake of the wife in his arms more than for himself because of his love rather than because of his pride with the change in the temperature of the wind came a gradual moderation in its violence hornblower during those black hours would not allow himself to hope at first but he became more and more convinced of it as the night wore on at last there was no denying the fact the wind was dying away the hurricane was moving away from them most likely some time during the night it was only a strong gale and later on hornblower lifting his head made himself admit that it was nothing more than a fresh breeze which would call for only a single reef a topgallant breeze in fact the motion of the pretty jane continued to be violent as was only to be expected the sea would take much longer to die away than would the wind she was still pitching and plunging wildly heaving up and racing down but she was not being swept by the waves to nearly such a great extent even allowing for her improved behaviour bows to sea it was not great cataracts of water that came surging by them dragging them against their bonds to lacerate their skin the water ceased to be waist high later on it only surged past their knees and the spray had ceased to drive past them with that hornblower was able to notice something else it was raining raining in torrents if he turned his face to the sky a few precious drops fell into his parched open mouth rain he said into barbaras ear he released himself from her arms he did it actually roughly so anxious was he not to waste a single second of this rainstorm he took off his shirt it tore into rags as he dragged it from the lines that encompassed him and held it out in the invisible rain that lashed down on them in the darkness h must not waste a second the shirt was wet with sea water he wrung it out working over it feverishly alternately with spreading it in the rain he squeezed a fragment into his mouth it was still salt he tried again he had never wished for anything so much as now for the rainstorm to continue in this violence and for the sea spray not to be driving too thickly the water he wrung from the fragment of shirt could be considered fresh now he felt for barbaras face with the sopping wet object pressing it against her drink he croaked into her ear when she put up her hands to it he guessed from her movements that she understood that she was sucking the precious liquid from the fabric he wanted her to hurry to drink all she could while the rain persisted his hands were shaking with desire in the darkness she would not know that he was waiting so anxiously she yielded the shirt back to him at last and he spread it to the rain again hardly able to endure the delay then he could press it to his mouth head back and gulp and swallow half mad with pleasure the difference it made to squeeze that water into his mouth was beyond measure he felt strength and hope returning the strength came with the hope perhaps that shirt held five or six wineglassfuls of water it was sufficient to make this vast difference he spread the shirt again above his head to soak it again in the torrential rain and gave it to barbara and when she returned it to him in the darkness he repeated the process for himself and when he had squeezed it almost dry he realised that while he was doing so the rain had ceased and he felt a moments regret he should have saved that wet shirt as a reserve but he ceased to chide himself most of the water in it would have drained out and there was still enough spray in the air to have made the remainder undrinkable in a few minutes but now he could think better he could soberly decide that the wind was moderating fast the rainstorm itself was an indication that the hurricane had gone on its way leaving in its wake the prodigious rains that were not unusual then and there over the starboard bow was the faintest hint of pink in the sky not the threatening yellow of the hurricane but the dawn of a different day he felt for the knots that held him bound and by slow degrees he fumbled them undone as the last one released him he staggered back with the heave of the ship and sank back with a thump and a splash into a sitting position on the wet deck that was a fantastic pleasure to sit down hip deep in the water still washing over the deck just to sit and very slowly flex and straighten his knees to feel life returning into his dead thighs that was heaven and it would be a seventh heaven to put his head down and allow sleep to overcome him that was something he must not do all the same sleeplessness and physical fatigue were things that must be stoically ignored as long as there was a chance that they would survive and daylight increasing round them he heaved himself up to his feet and walked back to the mast on legs that would hardly obey him he released barbara and she at least could sit down deck awash or not he eased her until her back was to the mast and then passed a line around her again she could sleep in that fashion she was already so weary that she did not notice or she gave no sign of it if she did the doubledup corpse that lay within a yard of her he cut the corpse loose and dragged it with the heave of the ship out of the way before attending to the other three there they were already fumbling with the knots of their lashings and as hornblower began to cut the lines first one and then another opened their mouths and croaked at him water they said water they were as helpless and as dependent as nestlings it was apparent to hornblower that not one of them had had the sense during that roaring rainstorm in the dark to soak his shirt they could hardly have failed to have held up open mouths to the rain but what they would catch then would be a trifle he looked round the horizon one or two distant squalls were visible there but there was no predicting when or if they would pass over the pretty jane youll have to wait for that my lads he said he made his way aft to the other group around the wheel and binnacle there was a corpse here still hanging in its lashing knyvett hornblower took note of the fact with the terse requiem that perhaps with death overpowering him then might be some excuse for his not attempting to cut away the foremast another corpse lay on the deck among the feet of the six survivors here nine men had survived of the crew of sixteen and apparently four had disappeared entirely washed overboard during the night or perhaps during the night before hornblower recognised the second mate and the steward the group even the second mate were croaking for water just like the others and to them hornblower made the same grim reply get those dead men overboard he added he took stock of the situation looking over the side he could see that pretty jane had about three feet of freeboard remaining as close as he could judge while she was pitching extravagantly in the stillturbulent sea he was conscious now as he walked about right aft of dull thumpings under his feet corresponding to the heave and the roll that meant floating objects battering on the underside of the deck as they were flung up against it by the water inside surging about the wind was steady from the northeast the trade wind had reasserted itself after the temporary interruption of the hurricane the sky was still gloomy and overcast but hornblower could feel in his bones that the barometer must be rising rapidly somewhere down to leeward fifty miles away a hundred miles two hundred perhaps was the chain of the antilles he could not guess how far or in what direction pretty jane had drifted during the storm there was still a chance for them or there would be if he could solve the water problem he turned to the tottering crew get the hatches up he ordered you mr mate where are the water casks stowed amidships said the mate running a dry tongue over his dry lips at the thought of water aft of the main hatchway lets see said hornblower water casks constructed to keep fresh water in would also perhaps keep sea water out but no cask was ever quite tight every cask leaked to some extent and only a small amount of water percolating in would make the contents unfit to drink and casks that had been churned about for two nights and a day by the surging sea water below decks would probably he stove in every one of them its only a faint hope said hornblower anxious to minimise the almost certain disappointment ahead of them he looked round again to see what chance there was of a rainsquall coming when they looked down the open hatchway they could appreciate the difficulties the hatchway was jammed with a couple of bales of coir as they watched them they could see them move uneasily with the motion of the ship the water that had invaded the ship had floated up the cargo pretty jane was actually supported by the upward pressure of the cargo on the underside of the deck it was a miracle that she had not broken her back and there was not a chance of going down there it would be certain death to venture amid those surging bales there was a general groan of disappointment from the group round the hatchway but another possibility was present in hornblowers mind and he turned upon the steward there were green coconuts for the use of the cabin he said were there any left yes sir four or five dozen the man could hardly speak with thirst or weakness or excitement in the lazarette yes sir in a sack yes sir come along said hornblower coconuts floated as lightly as coir and were more watertight than any cask they pried up the afterhatch cover and looked down at the heaving water below there was no cargo there the bulkhead had stood the strain the distance down to the surface corresponded to the threefoot freeboard remaining to pretty jane there were things to be seen there almost at once a wooden piggin came floating into sight and the surface was nearly covered with fragments then something else floated into view a coconut apparently the sack had not been fastened hornblower had hoped he might find a whole sackful floating there he leaned far down and scooped it up as he rose to his feet again with the thing in his hand there was a simultaneous wordless croak from the whole group a dozen hands stretched out for it and hornblower realised that he must maintain order stand back he said and when the men still advanced on him he pulled out his sheath knife stand back ill kill the first man to lay a hand on me he said he knew himself to be snarling like a wild beast his teeth bared with the intensity of his feeling and he knew that he would stand no chance in fight one against nine come now lads he said well have to make these last well ration em out fair divs all round see how many more you can find the force of his personality asserted itself so did what remained of the common sense of the crew and they drew back soon three men were kneeling round the hatchway with the others leaning precariously over them to look over their shoulders theres one croaked a voice an arm went down and a coconut was scooped up give it here said hornblower and he was obeyed without question another was already visible and another after that they began to pile up at hornblowers feet a dozen fifteen twenty twentythree of the precious things before they ceased to appear further with luck well find some more later said hornblower he looked round the group and over at barbara huddled at the foot of the mainmast eleven of us half a one each for today another half each tomorrow and ill go without for today no one questioned his decision partly perhaps because they were all too anxious to wet their lips the first coconut was chopped open at the end with desperate care lest a drop be spilt and the first man took a drink there was no chance at all of his drinking more than his half with everyone grouped round him and the man destined for the other half snatching it from his lips at every sip to see how far down the surface had sunk the men forced to wait were wild with eagerness but they had to wait all the same hornblower could not trust them to make a division without fighting or waste unless he was supervising after the last man had drunk he took the remaining half over to barbara drink this dear he said as at the touch of his hand she blinked awake from her heavy doze she drank eagerly before she took the nut from her lips youve had some dear she asked yes dear ive had mine said hornblower steadily when he returned to the group they were scraping the thin jelly out from inside the nuts dont damage these shells lads he said well need em when we get a rainsquall and well put those nuts under her ladyships guard we can trust her they obeyed him again we got two more up while you was away sir volunteered one of the men hornblower peered down the hatchway at the littercovered water another idea came up into his mind and he turned to the steward again her ladyship sent a chest of food on board he said food in tin boxes it was put aft here somewhere do you know where it was right aft sir under the tiller ropes mm said hornblower as he thought about it a sudden motion of the ship tossed the water below up in a fountain through the hatchway but it ought to be possible to reach that chest break it open and bring up its contents a strong man able to stay submerged for long periods could do it if he did not mind being flung about by the send of the water below wed have something better to eat than coconut jelly if we got those boxes up he said ill have a go sir said a young seaman and hornblower was inexpressibly relieved he did not want to go down there himself good lad he said put a line round yourself before you go down then we can haul you out if we have to they were setting about their preparations when hornblower checked them wait look forrard he said there was a rainsquall a mile away they could see it a vast pillar of water to windward streaming down from the sky well defined the cloud was lower whence it fell and the surface of the sea which received it was a different grey from the rest it was moving down towards them no not quite the centre was heading for a point some distance on their beam as everyone could see after a moments study there was an explosion of blasphemy from the grouped hands as they watched well get the tail of it by god said the mate make the most of it when it comes said hornblower for three long minutes they watched it approach a cables length away it seemed to stand still even though they could feel the freshening breeze around them hornblower had run to barbaras side rain he said barbara turned her face to the mast and bent down and fumbled under her skirt a moments struggle brought down a petticoat and she stepped out of it and did her best to wring the salt damp out of it as they waited then came a few drops and then the full deluge precious rain ten shirts and a petticoat were extended to it wrung out reextended wrung out again until the wringings tasted fresh everyone could drink madly with the rain roaring about them after two minutes of it hornblower was shouting to the crew to fill the empty coconut shells and a few men had sense and public spirit enough to wring their shirts into them before returning to the ecstasy of drinking again no one wanted to waste a single second of this precious rain but it passed as quickly as it came they could see the squall going away over the quarter as far out of their reach as if it were raining in the sahara desert but the young hands of the crew were laughing and joking now there was an end to their care and their apathy there was not one man on board except hornblower who spared a thought for the possibility the probability that this might be the only rainsquall to touch the ship for the next week there was urgent need for action even though every joint and muscle in his body ached even though his mind was clouded with weariness he made himself think he made himself rally his strength he cut short the silly laughter and turned on the man who had volunteered to venture down into the steerage put two men to tend your line the steward had better be one of em he said mr mate come forrard with me we want to get sail on this ship as soon as may be that was the beginning of a voyage which was destined to become legendary just as did the hurricane which had just passed it was called hornblowers hurricane singled out not only because hornblower was involved in it but also because its unexpected arrival caused widespread damage hornblower never thought that the voyage itself was particularly notable even though it was made in a waterlogged hulk precariously balanced upon bales of coir it was only a matter of getting the hulk before the wind a spare jibboom made a jury mast when fished to the stump of the foremast and the sacking from coir bales provided sails spread on the jury foremast these enabled them to get the pretty jane before the trade wind to creep along at a mile an hour while they set to work on extemporising aftersails that doubled her speed there were no navigating instruments even the compass had been dashed from its gimbals during the storm and on the first two days they had no idea where they were except that somewhere to leeward lay the chain of the antilles but the third day proved fine and clear and dawn had hardly broken before a hand at the mainmasthead saw the faintest tiniest dark streak on the horizon far ahead it was land it might be the high mountains of san domingo far off or the low mountains of puerto rico somewhat nearer there was no knowing at present and even when the sun had set they were still ignorant and they were thirsty with small appetite for the meagre ration of corned beef that hornblower doled out to them from the recovered stores and despite fatigue they could sleep that night on their coir mattresses on the deck that an occasional small wave still swept next morning the land was nearer still a low profile that seemed to indicate it might be puerto rico and it was in the afternoon that they saw the fishing boat it headed for them puzzled at the strange vessel bearing down upon it and it was not long before it was alongside the mulatto fishermen staring at the group of strange figures waving to them hornblower had to urge his dazed mind stupid with lack of sleep and fatigue and hunger to remember his spanish as he hailed them they had a breaker of water on board and they had a jar of cold garbanzos as well there was a can of corned beef to add to the feast barbara caught even though she spoke no spanish two words of the excited conversation that went on puerto rico she asked yes dear said hornblower not very surprising and much more convenient for us than san domingo i wish i could remember the name of the captaingeneral there i had dealings with him in the affair of the estrella del sur he was a marquis the marques de de dearest why dont you lie down and close your eyes youre worn out he was shocked anew at her pallor and look of distress im well enough thank you dear replied barbara even though the strained tone of her voice denied her words it was one more proof of her indomitable spirit it was when they were discussing what to do next that the second mate showed the first sign of any spirit they could all desert the waterlogged hulk and sail into puerto rico in the fishing boat but he stoutly refused to do so he knew the law about salvage and there might be some value still in the poor hull and certainly in its cargo he would work the pretty jane in tomorrow himself and he insisted on staying on board with the hands hornblower faced a decision of a sort he had never yet encountered in a varied career to leave the ship now savoured of desertion but there was barbara to think of and his first reaction that he would not dream of deserting his men was promptly ended by his reminding himself that they were not his men at all youre only a passenger my lord said the mate it was odd how my lord seemed to come naturally again now that they were in touch with civilisation thats so agreed hornblower nor could he possibly condemn barbara to another night on the deck of this waterlogged hulk so they came sailing into san juan de puerto rico two years after hornblower had last visited the place in very different circumstances not unnaturally their arrival set the whole place in an uproar messengers sped to the fortaleza and it was only a few minutes later that a figure appeared on the quay which hornblowers swimming eyes contrived to recognise tall and thin with a thin moustache mendezcastillo he said saving hornblower any further trouble about remembering his name it grieves me greatly to see your excellencies in such distress even while i have much pleasure in welcoming your excellency again to puerto rico some sort of formalities had to be observed even in these conditions barbara my dear allow me to present seor major mendezcastillo aidedecamp to his excellency the captaingeneral then he continued in spanish my wife la baronesa hornblower mendezcastillo bowed deeply his eyes still busy estimating the extent of the weakness of the new arrivals then he reached the very important decision if your excellencies are agreeable i would suggest that your formal welcome by his excellency should be postponed until your excellencies are better prepared for it we are agreeable said hornblower in his exasperation he was about to burst out violently regarding barbaras need for rest and care but mendezcastillo now that the point of etiquette was settled was all consideration then if your excellencies will give yourselves the trouble of stepping down into my boat i shall have the pleasure of escorting you to make your informal entrance into the palace of santa catalina their excellencies will receive you but formal etiquette need not be observed and your excellencies will be able to recover from the dreadful experiences i fear your excellencies have undergone would your excellencies be so kind as to come this way one moment first if you please seor the men out there in the ship they need food and water they may need help i will give an order for the port authorities to send out to them what they need thank you so they went down into the boat for the brief trip across the harbour despite his mortal fatigue hornblower was able to note that every fishing boat and coasting craft there was hurriedly getting to sea presumably to examine the chances of salvaging or plundering the pretty jane the second mate had been perfectly right in refusing to leave her but he did not care now he put his arm about barbara as she drooped beside him then up through the watergate of the palace with attentive servants awaiting them here were his excellency and a dark beautiful woman his wife she took barbara under her protection instantly here were cool dark rooms and more servants scurrying about in obedience to the orders his excellency volleyed out valets and maids and body servants this is manuel my principal valet your excellency any orders your excellency may give him will be obeyed as if they came from me my physician has been sent for and will be here at any moment so now my wife and i will withdraw and leave your excellencies to rest assuring your excellencies that our sincerest hope is for your rapid recovery the crowd thinned away for one more moment hornblower had to keep his faculties alert for the doctor came bustling in to feel pulses and to look at tongues he produced a case of lancets and was making preparations to draw blood from barbara and it was only with difficulty that hornblower stopped him and with further difficulty prevented him from substituting leeches for venesection he could not believe that bleeding would hasten the cure of the lacerations barbara bore on her body he thanked the doctor and saw him out of the room again with a sigh of relief and mental reservations regarding the medicines he promised to send in the maids were waiting to relieve barbara of the few rags she wore do you think you will sleep darling is there anything more i can ask for i shall sleep dearest then the smile on barbaras weary face was replaced by something more like a grin perfectly unladylike and as nobody else but us here can speak english i am free to tell you that i love you dearest i love you i love you more than any words that i know can tell you servants or no servants he kissed her then before he left her to go into the adjoining room where the valets awaited him his body was crisscrossed with angry welts still raw where during the storm the force of the waves had flung him against the ropes that held him to the mast they were horribly painful as he was sponged with warm water he knew that barbaras sweet tender body must be marked in the same fashion but barbara was safe she would soon be well and she had said that she loved him and and she had said more than that what she had told him in that deckhouse had drawn out all the pain from a mental wound far far deeper than the physical hurts he now bore he was a happy man as he lay down in the silk nightshirt with the elaborate heraldic embroidery which the valet had ready for him his sleep was at first deep and untroubled but conscience awoke him before dawn and he went out on to the balcony in the first light to see the pretty jane creeping into the harbour escorted by a dozen small craft it irked him that he was not on board until he thought again of the wife sleeping in the next room there were happy hours still to come that balcony was deep and shaded looking out over harbour and sea and there he sat in his dressinggown an hour later rocking idly in his chair with barbara opposite him drinking sweet chocolate and eating sweet rolls it is good to be alive said hornblower there was a potency an inner meaning about those words now it was no hackneyed turn of speech it is good to be with you said barbara pretty jane came in this morning safely said hornblower i peeped out at her through my window said barbara mendezcastillo was announced presumably having been warned that his excellencys guests were awake and breakfasting he made enquiries on behalf of his excellency to receive every assurance of a rapid recovery and he announced that news of the recent events would be despatched at once to jamaica most kind of his excellency said hornblower now as regards the crew of the pretty jane are they being looked after they have been received into the military hospital the port authorities have stationed a guard on board the vessel that is very well indeed said hornblower telling himself that now he need feel no more responsibility the morning could be an idle one now only broken by a visit from the doctor to be dismissed after a new feeling of pulses and looking at tongues with grateful thanks for his untasted medicines there was dinner at two oclock a vast meal served ceremoniously but only sampled a siesta and then supper eaten with more appetite and a peaceful night next morning was busier for there was now the question of clothes to be dealt with dressmakers were sent in to barbara by her excellency so that hornblower found all the mental exercise he needed in acting as interpreter over matters demanding a vocabulary he did not possess and shirtmakers and tailors sent in to him by his excellency the tailor was somewhat disappointed on being told that hornblower did not wish him to make a complete uniform for a british rear admiral gold lace and all as a halfpay officer with no appointment hornblower did not need anything of the sort after the tailor came a deputation the mate and two members of the crew of pretty jane weve come to enquire after your lordships health and her ladyships said the mate thank you you can see her ladyship and i are quite recovered said hornblower and you are you being well looked after very well thank you youre master of the pretty jane now commented hornblower yes my lord it was a strange first command for a man to have what are you going to do with her im having her hauled out today my lord maybe she can be patched up but shell have lost all her copper very likely i expect ill have to sell her for what shell fetch hull and cargo said the mate with a note of bitterness in his voice that was to be expected in a man who had received his first command only to face losing it instantly i hope youre lucky said hornblower thank you my lord there was a moments hesitation before the next words came and i have to thank your lordship for all you did the little i did i did for my own sake and her ladyships said hornblower he could smile as he said it already in these blissful surroundings the memory of the howl of the hurricane and the crash of the waves sweeping pretty janes deck was losing its painful acuteness and the two seamen could grin back at him here in a viceregal palace it was hard to remember how he had stood with bared teeth and drawn knife disputing with them possession of a single green coconut it was pleasant that the interview could end with smiles and goodwill so that hornblower could lapse back into delightful idleness with barbara beside him seamstresses and tailors must have worked hard and long for next day some of the results of their efforts were ready to be tried on my spanish grandee said barbara eyeing her husband dressed in coat and breeches of puerto rican cut my lovely seora answered hornblower with a bow barbara was wearing comb and mantilla the seoras of puerto rico wear no stays fortunately said barbara i could bear nothing of the sort at present that was one of the few allusions barbara made regarding the lacerations and bruises that she bore all over her body she was of a spartan breed trained in a school which scorned to admit physical weakness even in making her mockformal curtsey to him as she spoke she was careful to betray none of the pain the movement cost her hornblower could hardly guess at it what am i to tell mendezcastillo today when he comes to make his enquiries asked hornblower i think dear that now we can safely be received by their excellencies said barbara here in little puerto rico was to be found all the magnificence and ceremonial of the court of spain the captaingeneral was the representative of a king in whose veins ran the blood of bourbons and habsburgs of ferdinand and isabella and his person had to be surrounded by the same ritual and etiquette lest the mystic sanctity of his master should be called into question even hornblower did not come to realise until he began to discuss the arrangements with mendezcastillo the enormous condescension the extreme strain put upon palace etiquette involved in the backstairs visit their excellencies had paid to the battered castaways who had claimed their hospitality now that was all to be forgotten in their formal reception there was amusement to be found in mendezcastillos apologetic and nervous mentioning of the fact that hornblower could not expect the same formalities as had welcomed him on his last visit then he had been a visiting commanderinchief now he was only a halfpay officer a distinguished visitor but an unofficial one it dawned upon him that mendezcastillo expected him to flare out and to be offended at being told that this time he would be received only by flourishes and not by a full band by the salutes of the sentries instead of by the turning out of the whole guard he was able to confirm his reputation for tact by declaring quite truthfully his candour was mistaken for the most diplomatic concealment of his own feelings that he did not care in the least so it turned out barbara and hornblower were smuggled unobtrusively out of the postern gate of the palace and escorted into a boat to be rowed round to the massive watergate where hornblower had made his previous entrance there with slow and solemn step they passed in through the gate barbara on hornblowers left arm on either hand the sentries presented arms and hornblower acknowledged the salute by taking off his hat as they came into the courtyard beyond they were welcomed by the flourishes that mendezcastillo had promised even hornblowers tonedeaf ear could assure him that there was no stinting of those flourishes long drawn out continued until hornblower wondered how the trumpeters breath could last so long and he could guess from the variation between squeakiness and dullness that the trumpeter was displaying a considerable virtuosity two more sentries stood at the foot of the steps beyond presenting arms the trumpeter stood at the top of the steps over to one side and he put his instrument to his lips for a further series of fanfares as hornblower removed his hat again and he and barbara began the climb tremendous those flourishes were even though hornblower was bracing himself to make his ceremonial entrance into the great hall he could not help but dart a glance at the trumpeter one glance called for a second glance pigtailed and powdered dressed in a glittering uniform what was there about that figure to demand his attention he felt barbara on his arm stiffen and miss her step the trumpeter took his instrument from his lips it was it was hudnutt hornblower almost dropped his hat with surprise but they were over the threshold of the great door and he must walk steadily forward with barbara if he were not to ruin all the precious ceremonial a voice bellowed their names ahead of them at the end of an avenue of halberdiers were two chairs of state backed by a semicircle of uniforms and court gowns with their excellencies sitting awaiting them on hornblowers last visit the captaingeneral had risen and taken seven steps forward to meet him but that had been when he was a commanderinchief now he and barbara were only private persons and their excellencies remained sitting as he and barbara went through the moves they had been instructed to make he bowed to his excellency having already been presented to him he waited while barbara was presented and made her two curtsies he bowed again as he was presented to her excellency then they drew a little to one side to await their excellencies words a great pleasure to welcome lord hornblower again said his excellency an equally great pleasure to make the acquaintance of lady hornblower said her excellency hornblower went through the form of consulting with barbara as to how he should reply my wife and i are deeply appreciative of the great honour done us by our reception said hornblower you are our welcome guests said his excellency with a finality in his tone that indicated the end of the conversation hornblower bowed again twice and barbara went down in two more curtsies and then they withdrew diagonally so as to allow their excellencies no glimpse of their backs mendezcastillo was on hand to present them to other guests but hornblower had first to pour out to barbara his astonishment at the recent encounter did you see the trumpeter dear he asked yes answered barbara in an expressionless tone it was hudnutt amazing went on hornblower extraordinary id never have believed he was capable of it he broke out of prison and he climbed that fence and he got himself out of jamaica over to puerto rico quite remarkable yes said barbara hornblower turned to mendezcastillo your your trompetero he said he was guessing at the spanish word for trumpeter and he put his hand up before his mouth in a gesture that indicated what he was trying to say you thought he was good asked mendezcastillo superb said hornblower who is he the best of the musicians in his excellencys orchestra answered mendezcastillo hornblower looked keenly at him but mendezcastillo preserved a diplomatic lack of expression a fellow countryman of yours sir persisted hornblower mendezcastillo spread his hands and elevated his shoulders why should i concern myself about him my lord he countered in any case art knows no frontiers no said hornblower i suppose not frontiers are elastic in these days for instance seor i cannot remember if a convention exists between your government and mine regarding the mutual return of deserters a strange coincidence said mendezcastillo i was investigating that very question a few days ago quite idly i assure you my lord and i found that no such convention exists there have been many occasions when as a matter of goodwill deserters have been handed back but most lamentably my lord his excellency has altered his views in that respect since a certain ship the estrella del sur whose name you may possibly recall my lord was seized as a slaver outside this very harbour in circumstances that his excellency found peculiarly irritating there was no hostility nor was there any hint of glee in mendezcastillos expression as he made this speech he might as well have been discussing the weather i appreciate his excellencys kindness and hospitality even more now said hornblower he hoped he was giving no indication that he was a man who had just been hoist by his own petard i will convey that information to his excellency said mendezcastillo meanwhile there are many guests who are anxious to make your lordships acquaintance and that of her ladyship later in the evening it was mendezcastillo who came to hornblower with a message from her excellency to the effect that the marquesa quite understood that barbara might be tired not having fully recovered yet from her recent experiences and suggesting that if her ladyship and his lordship chose to retire informally their excellencies would understand and it was mendezcastillo who guided them to the far end of the room and through an unobtrusive door to where a back stairs led to their suite the maid allotted to attend to barbara was waiting up ask the maid to go please said barbara i can look after myself her tone was still flat and expressionless and hornblowe looked at her anxiously in fear lest her fatigue should be too much for her but he did what she asked can i help in any way dear he asked as the maid withdrew you can stay and talk to me if you will answered barbara with pleasure of course said hornblower there was something strange about this situation he tried to think of some topic to relieve the tension i still can hardly believe it about hudnutt it is about hudnutt that i wanted to speak said barbara there was something positively harsh about her voice she was standing more stiffly and more rigidly than usual no back could ever be straighter and she was meeting hornblowers eyes with a kind of fixed stare like a soldier at attention awaiting sentence of death whatever is the matter dearest you are going to hate me said barbara never never you dont know what it is im going to tell you nothing you could tell me dont say that yet wait until you hear i set hudnutt free it was i who arranged for his escape the words came like sudden forked lightning or it was as if in a dead calm the maintopsail yard had fallen without warning from its slings on to the deck dearest said hornblower unbelieving youre tired why dont you do you think im delirious asked barbara her voice was still unlike anything hornblower had ever heard so was the brief bitter laugh that accompanied her words i could be this is the end of all my happiness dearest said hornblower oh said barbara there was a sudden overwhelming tenderness in that single sound and her rigid attitude relaxed but instantly she stiffened again and snatched back the hands she had held out to him please listen ive told you now i set hudnutt free i set him free there could be no doubting that she meant what she said truth or not and hornblower standing unable to move staring at her gradually reached the realisation that it was true after all the realisation seeped through the weak places in his unbelief and as he thought of each piece of evidence it was as if he were marking off a new height in arising tide that last night at admiralty house he said yes you took him out through the wicket gate into the gardens yes then evans helped you he had the key yes and that fellow in kingston bonner must have helped you too you said he was something of a villain he was ready for adventure at least but but the scent the bloodhounds followed someone dragged hudnutts shirt along the ground on a rope but but even so she did not need to tell him as he said those words he made the next deduction that two hundred pounds the money i asked you for said barbara sparing herself nothing a tenpound reward would not avail if someone were willing to spend two hundred pounds to help a prisoner escape hornblower knew all about it now his wife had flouted the law she had set at naught the authority of the navy she had the rising tide reached suddenly up to a new level its a felony he said you could be transported for life you could be sent to botany bay do i care exclaimed barbara botany bay does that matter now that you know now that youll never love me dearest those last words were so fantastically untrue that he had nothing else to say in reply his mind was hard at work thinking about the effect of all this on barbara that fellow bonner he could blackmail you hes as guilty as i am said barbara the unnatural harshness of her voice reached its climax there and a sudden softness came back into her voice with her next words an overwhelming tenderness which she could not help as she smiled her old quizzical smile at this husband of hers youre only thinking about me of course said hornblower surprised but you must think about yourself ive deceived you ive cheated you i took advantage of your kindness of your generosity oh the smile changed to tears it was horrible to see barbaras face distort itself she was still standing like a soldier at attention she would not allow her hands to cover her face she stood with the tears streaming down and her features working sparing herself nothing of her shame he would have taken her into his arms at that moment except that he was still immobilised by astonishment and barbaras last words had set a fresh torrent of thought pouring through his mind to hold him paralysed if any of this were to come out the consequences would be without limit half the world would believe that hornblower the legendary hornblower had connived at the escape and desertion of a petty criminal nobody would believe the truth but if the truth did find credence half the world would laugh at hornblower being outwitted by his wife there was a horrible gaping chasm opening right beside him but there was already this other chasm this awful distress that barbara was suffering i was going to tell you said barbara still erect blinded by her tears so that she could see nothing when we reached home i was going to tell you thats what i thought before the hurricane and there in the deckhouse i was going to tell you after after i told you the other but there wasnt time you had to leave me i had to tell you i loved you first i told you that and i should have told you this instead i should have she was advancing no excuse for herself she would not plead she would face the consequences of her act and there in the deckhouse she had told him she loved him that she had never loved any other man the last realisation came upon him now he could shake off the astonishment the bewilderment that had held him helpless up to that moment nothing counted in the world except barbara now he could move two steps forward and she was in his arms her tears wetted his lips my love my darling he said for unbelieving and blinded she had not responded and then she knew in the darkness that surrounded her and her arms went about him and there was no such happiness in all the world there had never been such perfection of harmony hornblower found himself smiling he could laugh out loud out of sheer happiness that was an old weakness of his to laugh to giggle in moments of crisis he could laugh now if he allowed himself he could laugh at the whole ridiculous incident he could laugh and laugh but his judgement told him that laughter might be misunderstood at this moment he could not help smiling though smiling as he kissed end
