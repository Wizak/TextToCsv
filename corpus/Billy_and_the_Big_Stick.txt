 billy and the big stick by richard harding davis had the wilmot electric light people remained content only to make light had they not as a byproduct attempted to make money they need not have left hayti when they flooded with radiance the unpaved streets of portauprince no one except the police who complained that the lights kept them awake made objection but when for this illumination the wilmot company demanded payment every one up to president hamilear poussevain was surprised and grieved so grieved was president ham as he was lovingly designated that he withdrew the wilmot concession surrounded the powerhouse with his barefooted army and in a proclamation announced that for the future the furnishing of electric light would be a monopoly of the government in hayti as soon as it begins to make money any industry native or foreign becomes a monopoly of the government the thing works automatically it is what in hayti is understood as baute finance the wilmot people should have known that because they did not as viceconsul law and order were as solidly established as the stone jetties and by contrast the eccentricities of the black republic baffled and distressed him it cant be that you blackmail the president said the consul because i understand he boasts he has committed all the known crimes and several he invented agreed billy and you cant do it with a gun because they tell me the president isnt afraid of anything except a voodoo priestess what is your secret coaxed the consul if youll only sell it i know several powers that would give you your price billy smiled modestly its very simple he said the first time my wages were shy i went to the palace and told him if he didnt come across id shut off the juice i think he was so stunned at anybody asking him for real money that while he was still stunned he opened his safe and handed me two thousand francs i think he did it more in admiration for my nerve than because he owed it the next time payday arrived and the pay did not i didnt go to the palace i just went to bed and the lights went to bed too you may remember the consul snorted indignantly i was holding three queens at the time he protested was it you did that it was said billy the police came for me to start the current going again but i said i was too ill then the presidents own doctor came old gautier and gautier examined me with a lantern and said that in hayti my disease frequently proved fatal but he thought if i turned on the lights i might recover i told him i was tired of life anyway but that if i could see three thousand francs it might give me an incentive he reported back to the president and the three thousand francs arrived almost instantly and a chicken broth from hams own chef with his excellencys best wishes for the recovery of the invalid my recovery was instantaneous and i switched on the lights i had just moved into the widow ducrots hotel that week and her daughter claire wouldnt let me eat the broth i thought it was because as shes a dandy cook herself she was professionally jealous she put the broth on the top shelf of the pantry and wrote on a piece of paper gare but the next morning a perfectly good cat who apparently couldnt read was lying beside it dead the consul frowned reprovingly you should not make such reckless charges he protested i would call it only a coincidence you can call it what you please said billy but it wont bring the cat back anyway the next time i went to the palace to collect the president was ready for me he said hed been taking out information and he found if i shut off the lights again he could hire another man in the states to turn them on i told him hed been deceived i told him the wilmot electric lights were produced by a secret process and that only a trained wilmot man could work them and i pointed out to him if he dismissed me it wasnt likely the wilmot people would loan him another expert not while they were fighting him through the courts and the state department that impressed the old man so i issued my ultimatum i said if he must have electric lights he must have me too whether he liked it or not mine was a life job what did he say to that gasped the new consul said it wasnt a life job because he was going to have me shot at sunset then you said i said if he did that there wouldnt be any electric lights and you would bring a warship and shoot hayti off the map the new consul was most indignant you had no right to say that he protested you did very ill my instructions are to avoid all serious complications that was what i was trying to avoid said billy dont you call being shot at sunset a serious complication or would that be just a coincidence too youre a hell of a consul since his talk with the representative of his country four months had passed and billy still held his job but each month the number of francs he was able to wrest from president hamilcar dwindled and were won only after verbal conflicts that each month increased in violence to the foreign colony it became evident that in the side of president ham billy was a thorn sharp irritating virulent and that at any moment ham might pluck that thorn and billy would leave hayti in haste and probably in handcuffs this was evident to billy also and the prospect was most disquieting not because he loved hayti but because since he went to lodge at the cafe of the widow ducrot he had learned to love her daughter claire and claire loved him on the two thousand dollars due him from ham they plotted to marry this was not as great an adventure as it might appear billy knew that from the wilmot people he always was sure of a salary and one which with such an excellent housekeeper as was claire would support them both but with his two thousand dollars as capital they could afford to plunge they could go upon a honeymoon they need not dread a rainy day and what was of greatest importance they need not delay there was good reason against delay for the hand of the beautiful claire was already promised the widow ducrot had promised it to paillard he of the prosperous commission business the prominent embonpoint and four children monsieur paillard possessed an establishment of his own but it was a villa in the suburbs and so each day at noon for his dejeune he left his office and crossed the street to the cafe ducrot for five years this had been his habit at first it was the widows cooking that attracted him then for a time the widow herself but when from the convent claire came to assist her mother in the cafe and when from a lanky bigeyed longlegged child she grew into a slim joyous and charming young woman she alone was the attraction and the widower paillard decided to make her his wife other men had made the same decision and when it was announced that between claire and the widower a marriage had been arranged the clerks in the foreign commission houses and the agents of the steamship lines drowned their sorrow in rum and ran the house flags to halfstaff paillard himself took the proposed alliance calmly he was not an impetuous suitor with widow ducrot he agreed that claire was still too young to marry and to himself kept the fact that to remarry he was in no haste in his mind doubts still lingered with a wife young enough to be one of his children disorganizing the routine of his villa would it be any more comfortable than he now found it would his eldest daughter and her stepmother dwell together in harmony the eldest daughter had assured him that so far as she was concerned they would not and after all in marrying a girl no matter how charming without a dot and the daughter of a boardinghouse keeper no matter how respectable was he not disposing of himself too cheaply these doubts assailed papa paillard these speculations were in his mind and while he speculated billy acted i know that in france billy assured claire marriages are arranged by the parents but in my country they are arranged in heaven and who are we to disregard the edicts of heaven ages and ages ago before the flood before napoleon even before old paillard with his four children it was arranged in heaven that you were to marry me so what little plans your good mother may make dont cut enough ice to cool a green mint now we cant try to get married here continued billy without your mother and paillard knowing it in this town as many people have to sign the marriage contract as signed our declaration of independence all the civil authorities all the clergy all the relatives if every man in the telephone book isnt a witness the marriage doesnt take so we must elope having been brought up in a convent where she was taught to obey her mother and forbidden to think of marriage claire was naturally delighted with the idea of an elopement to where will we elope to she demanded her english as she learned it from billy was sometimes confusing to new york said billy on the voyage there i will put you in charge of the stewardess and the captain and there isnt a captain on the royal dutch or the atlas that hasnt known you since you were a baby and as soon as we dock well drive straight to the city hall for a license and the mayor himself will marry us then ill get back my old job from the wilmot folks and well live happy ever after in new york also asked claire proudly are you directeur of the electric lights on broadway alone billy explained reprovingly there is one sign that uses more bulbs than there are in the whole of hayti new york is a large town exclaimed claire its a large sign corrected billy but he pointed out with no money well never see it so tomorrow im going to make a social call on grandpa ham and demand my ten thousand francs claire grasped his arm be careful she pleaded remember the chicken soup if he offers you the champagne refuse it he wont offer me the champagne billy assured her it wont be that kind of a call billy left the cafe ducrot and made his way to the waterfront he was expecting some electrical supplies by the prinz der nederlanden and she had already come to anchor he was late and save for a group of his countrymen who with the customs officials were having troubles of their own the customs shed was all but deserted billy saw his freight cleared and was going away when one of those in trouble signalled for assistance he was a goodlooking young man in a panama hat and his manner seemed to take it for granted that billy knew who he was they want us to pay duty on our trunks he explained and we want to leave them in bond well be here only until tonight when were going on down the coast to santo domingo but we dont speak french and we cant make them understand that you dont need to speak any language to give a man ten dollars said billy oh exclaimed the man in the panama i was afraid if i tried that they might arrest us they may arrest you if you dont said billy acting both as interpreter and disbursing agent billy satisfied the demands of his fellow employees of the government and his fellow countrymen he directed to the hotel ducrot as some one was sure to take their money he thought it might as well go to his motherinlaw elect the young man in the panama expressed the deepest gratitude and billy assuring him he would see him later continued to the powerhouse still wondering where he had seen him before at the powerhouse he found seated at his desk a large bearded stranger whose derby hat and readytowear clothes showed that he also had but just arrived on the prinz der nederlanden you william barlow demanded the stranger i understand you been threatening unless you get your pay raised to commit sabotage on these works who the devil are you inquired billy the stranger produced an impressivelooking document covered with seals contract with the president he said ive taken over your job you better get out quiet he advised as theyve given me a squad of nigger policemen to see that you do are you aware that these works are the property of the wilmot company asked billy and that if anything went wrong here theyd hold you responsible the stranger smiled complacently ive run plants he said that make these lights look like a stable lantern on a foggy night in that case assented billy should anything happen youll know exactly what to do and i can leave you in charge without feeling the least anxiety thats just what you can do the stranger agreed heartily and you cant do it too quick from the desk he took billys favorite pipe and loaded it from billys tobaccojar but when billy had reached the door he called to him before you go son he said you might give me a tip about this climate i never been in the tropics its kind of unhealthy aint it his expression was one of concern if you hope to keep alive began billy there are two things to avoid the stranger laughed knowingly i got you he interrupted youre going to tell me to cut out wine and women i was going to tell you said billy to cut out hoping to collect any wages and to avoid every kind of soup from the powerhouse billy went direct to the palace his anxiety was great now that claire had consented to leave hayti the loss of his position did not distress him but the possible loss of his back pay would be a catastrophe he had hardly enough money to take them both to new york and after they arrived none with which to keep them alive before the wilmot company could find a place for him a month might pass and during that month they might starve if he went alone and arranged for claire to follow he might lose her her mother might marry her to paillard claire might fall ill without him at her elbow to keep her to their purpose the voyage to an unknown land might require more courage than she possessed billy saw it was imperative they should depart together and to that end he must have his two thousand dollars the money was justly his for it he had sweated and slaved had given his best effort and so when he faced the president he was in no conciliatory mood neither was the president by what right he demanded did this foreigner affront his ears with demands for money how dared he force his way into his presence and to his face babble of back pay it was insolent incredible with indignation the president set forth the position of the government billy had been discharged and with the appointment of his successor the stranger in the derby hat had ceased to exist the government could not pay money to some one who did not exist all indebtedness to billy also had ceased to exist the account had been wiped out billy had been wiped out the big negro with the chest and head of a gorilla tossed his kinky white curls so violently that the ringlets danced billy he declared had been a pest a fly that buzzed and buzzed and disturbed his slumbers and now when the fly thought he slept he had caught and crushed itso president ham clinched his great fist convulsively and with delight in his pantomime opened his fingers one by one and held out his pink palm wrinkled and crossed like the hand of a washerwoman as though to show billy that in it lay the fly dead cest une chose jugee thundered the president he reached for his quill pen but billy with claire in his heart with the injustice of it rankling in his mind did not agree it is not an affair closed shouted billy in his best french it is an affair international diplomatic a cause for war believing he had gone mad president ham gazed at him speechless from here i go to the cable office shouted billy i cable for a warship if by tonight i am not paid my money marines will surround our powerhouse and the wilmot people will back me up and my government will back me up it was so billy thought even as he launched it a tirade satisfying and magnificent but in his turn the president did not agree he rose he was a large man billy wondered he had not previously noticed how very large he was tonight at nine oclock he said the german boat departs for new york as though aiming a pistol he raised his arm and at billy pointed a finger if after she departs you are found in portauprince you will be shot the audiencechamber was hung with great mirrors in frames of tarnished gilt in these billy saw himself reproduced in a wavering line of billies that like the ghost of banquo stretched to the disappearing point of such images there was an army but of the real billy as he was acutely conscious there was but one among the black faces scowling from the doorways he felt the odds were against him without making a reply he passed out between the racks of rusty muskets in the anteroom between the two gatling guns guarding the entrance and on the palace steps in indecision halted as billy hesitated an officer followed him from the palace and beckoned to the guard that sat in the bare dust of the champ de mars playing cards for cartridges two abandoned the game and having received their orders picked their muskets from the dust and stood looking expectantly at billy they were his escort and it was evident that until nine oclock when he sailed his movements would be spied upon his acts reported to the president such being the situation billy determined that his first act to be reported should be of a nature to cause the president active mental anguish with his guard at his heels he went directly to the cable station and to the secretary of state of the united states addressed this message president refuses my pay threatens shoot wireless nearest warship proceed here full speed william barlow billy and the director of telegraphs who out of office hours was a fieldmarshal and when not in his shirtsleeves always appeared in uniform went over each word of the cablegram together when billy was assured that the fieldmarshal had grasped the full significance of it he took it back and added love to aunt maria the extra words cost four dollars and eighty cents gold but as they suggested ties of blood between himself and the secretary of state they seemed advisable in the accountbook in which he recorded his daily expenditures billy credited the item to lifeinsurance the revised cablegram caused the fieldmarshal deep concern he frowned at billy ferociously i will forward this at once he promised but i warn you he added i deliver also a copy to my president billy sighed hopefully you might deliver the copy first he suggested from the cable station billy still accompanied by his faithful retainers returned to the powerhouse there he bade farewell to the black brothers who had been his assistants and upon one of them pressed a sum of money as they parted this one as though giving the password of a secret society chanted solemnly a buit beures juste and billy clasped his hand and nodded at the office of the royal dutch west india line billy purchased a ticket to new york and inquired were there many passengers the ship is empty said the agent i am glad said billy for one of my assistants may come with me he also is being deported you can have as many cabins as you want said the agent we are so sorry to see you go that we will try to make you feel you leave us on your private yacht the next two hours billy spent in seeking out those acquaintances from whom he could borrow money he found that by asking for it in homoeopathic doses he was able to shame the foreign colony into loaning him all of one hundred dollars this with what he had in hand would take claire and himself to new york and for a week keep them alive after that he must find work or they must starve the one whose features seemed familiar replied still we are leaving tonight he said not on a steamer but on a warship a warship cried billy his heart beat at high speed then he exclaimed you are a naval officer the young man shook his head and as though challenging billy to make another guess smiled then billy complied eagerly you are a diplomat are you our new minister one of the other young men exclaimed reproachfully you know him perfectly well he protested youve seen his picture thousands of times with awe and pride he placed his hand on billys arm and with the other pointed at the one in the panama hat its harry st clair he announced harry stclair the king of the movies the king of the movies repeated billy his disappointment was so keen as to be embarrassing oh he exclaimed i thought you then he remembered his manners glad to meet you he said seen you on the screen again his own troubles took precedence did you say he demanded one of our warships is coming here today coming to take me to santo domingo explained mr st clair he spoke airily as though to him as a means of locomotion battleships were as trolleycars the planters punch which was something he had never before encountered encouraged the great young man to unbend he explained further and fully and billy his mind intent upon his own affair pretended to listen the united states government mr st clair explained was assisting him and the apollo film company in producing the eightreel film entitled the man behind the gun with it the navy department plotted to advertise the navy and encourage recruiting in moving pictures in the form of a story with love interest villain comic relief and thrills it would show the life of american bluejackets afloat and ashore at home and abroad they would be seen at yokohama playing baseball with tokio university in the courtyard of the vatican receiving the blessing of the pope at waikiki riding the breakers on a scrubbingboard in the philippines eating cocoanuts in the shade of the sheltering palm and in brooklyn in the y m c a club in the shadow of the new york skyscrapers playing billiards and reading the sporting extras as it would be illustrated on the film the life of the man behind the gun was one of luxurious ease in it coalpassing standing watch in a blizzard and washing down decks cold and unsympathetic held no part but to prove that the life of jack was not all play he would be seen fighting for the flag that was where as lieutenant hardy u s a the king of the movies entered our company arrived in santo domingo last week he explained and theyre waiting for me now im to lead the attack on the fortress we land in shore boats under the guns of the ship and i take the fortress first we show the ship clearing for action and the men lowering the boats and pulling for shore then we cut back to show the guncrews serving the guns then we jump to the landingparty wading through the breakers i lead them the man who is carrying the flag gets shot and drops in the surf i pick him up put him on my shoulder and carry him and the flag to the beach where billy suddenly awoke his tone was one of excited interest you got a uniform he demanded three said st clair impressively made to order according to regulations on file in the quartermasters department each absolutely correct without too great a show of eagerness he inquired like to see them without too great a show of eagerness billy assured him that he would i got to telephone first he added but by the time you get your trunk open ill join you in your room in the cafe over the telephone billy addressed himself to the fieldmarshal in charge of the cable office when billy gave his name the voice of that dignitary became violently agitated monsieur barlow he demanded do you know that the warship for which you cabled your secretary of state makes herself to arrive at the other end of the phone although restrained by the confines of the booth billy danced joyously but his voice was stern naturally he replied where is she now an hour before so the fieldmarshal informed him the battleship louisiana had been sighted and by telegraph reported she was approaching under forced draft at any moment she might anchor in the outer harbor of this president ham had been informed he was grieved indignant he was also at a loss to understand it is very simple explained billy she probably was somewhere in the windward passage when the secretary got my message he cabled guantanamo and guantanamo wired the warship nearest portauprince president poussevain warned the field marshal is greatly disturbed tell him not to worry said billy tell him when the bombardment begins i will see that the palace is outside the zone of fire as billy entered the room of st clair his eyes shone with a strange light his manner which toward a man of his repute st clair had considered a little too casual was now enthusiastic almost affectionate my dear st clair cried billy ive fixed it but until i was sure i didnt want to raise your hopes hopes of what demanded the actor an audience with the president cried billy ive just called him up and he says im to bring you to the palace at once hes heard of you of course and hes very pleased to meet you i told him about the man behind the gun and he says you must come in your makeup as lieutenant hardy usa just as hell see you on the screen mr st clair stammered delightedly in uniform he protested wont that be white special full dress insisted billy medals sidearms fulldress belt and gloves what a press story the king of the movies meets the president of hayti of course hes only an ignorant negro but on broadway they dont know that and it will sound fine st clair coughed nervously dont forget he stammered i cant speak french or understand it either the eyes of billy became as innocent as those of a china doll then ill interpret he said and oh yes he added hes sending two of the palace soldiers to act as an escortsort of guard of honor the king of the movies chuckled excitedly fine he exclaimed you are a brick with trembling fingers he began to shed his outer garments to hide his own agitation billy walked to the window and turned his back night had fallen and the electric lights that once had been his care sprang into life billy looked at his watch it was seven oclock the window gave upon the harbor and a mile from shore he saw the cargo lights of the prinz der nederlanden and slowly approaching as though feeling for her berth a great battleship when billy turned from the window his voice was apparently undisturbed weve got to hurry he said the louisiana is standing in shell soon be sending a launch for you weve just time to drive to the palace and back before the launch gets here from his mind president ham had dismissed all thoughts of the warship that had been sighted and that now had come to anchor for the moment he was otherwise concerned fate could not harm him he was about to dine but for the first time in the history of his administration that solemn ceremony was rudely halted an excited aide trembling at his own temerity burst upon the presidents solitary state in the anteroom he announced an officer from the battleship louisiana demanded instant audience for a moment transfixed in amazement anger and alarm president ham remained seated such a visit uninvited was against all tradition it was an affront an insult but that it was against all precedent argued some serious necessity he decided it would be best to receive the officer besides to continue his dinner was now out of the question both appetite and digestion had fled from him in the anteroom billy was whispering final instructions to st clair whatever happens he begged dont laugh dont even smile politely hes very ignorant you see and hes sensitive when he meets foreigners and cant understand their language hes always afraid if they laugh that hes made a break and that theyre laughing at him so be solemn look grave look haughty i got you assented st clair im to register pride exactly said billy the more pride you register the better for us inwardly cold with alarm outwardly frigidly polite billy presented lieutenant hardy he had come billy explained in answer to the call for help sent by himself to the secretary of state which by wireless had been communicated to the louisiana lieutenant hardy begged him to say to the president that he was desolate at having to approach his excellency so unceremoniously but his excellency having threatened the life of an american citizen the captain of the louisiana was forced to act quickly and this officer demanded president ham what does he want he says billy translated to st clair that he is very glad to meet you and he wants to know how much you earn a week the actor suppressed his surprise and with pardonable pride said that his salary was six hundred dollars a week and royalties on each film billy bowed to the president he says translated billy he is here to see that i get my ten thousand francs and that if i dont get them in ten minutes he will return to the ship and land marines to st clair it seemed as though the president received his statement as to the amount of his salary with a disapproval that was hardly flattering with the heel of his giant fist the president beat upon the table his curls shook his gorillalike shoulders heaved in an explanatory aside billy made this clear he says he interpreted that you get more as an actor than he gets as president and it makes him mad i can see it does myself whispered st clair and i dont understand french either president ham was protesting violently it was outrageous he exclaimed it was inconceivable that a great republic should shake the big stick over the head of a small republic and for a contemptible ten thousand francs i will not believe he growled that this officer has authority to threaten me you have deceived him if he knew the truth he would apologize tell him he roared suddenly that i demand that he apologize billy felt like the man who after jauntily forcing the fighting unexpectedly gets a jolt on the chin that drops him to the canvas while the referee might have counted three billy remained upon the canvas then again he forced the fighting eagerly he turned to st clair he says he translated you must recite something st clair exclaimed incredulously recite he gasped than his indignant protest nothing could have been more appropriate wants to see you act out insisted billy go on he begged humor him do what he wants or hell put us in jail but what shall i he wants the curse of rome from richelieu explained billy he knows it in french and he wants you to recite it in english do you know it the actor smiled haughtily i wrote it he protested richelieus my middle name ive done it in stock then do it now commanded billy give it to him hot im julie de mortemar hes the villain barabas begin where barabas hands you the cue the country is the king in embarrassment st clair coughed tentatively whoever heard of cardinal richelieu he protested in a navy uniform begin begged billy whatll i do with my cap whispered st clair in an ecstasy of alarm billy danced from foot to foot ill hold your cap he cried go on st clair gave his cap of gold braid to billy and shifted his fulldress swordbelt not without concern did president ham observe these preparations for the fraction of a second in alarm his eyes glanced to the exits he found that the officers of his staff completely filled them their presence gave him confidence and his eyes returned to lieutenant hardy that gentleman heaved a deep sigh dejectedly his head fell forward until his chin rested upon his chest much to the relief of the president it appeared evident that lieutenant hardy was about to accede to his command and apologize st clair groaned heavily ay is it so he muttered his voice was deep resonant vibrating like a bell his eyes no longer suggested apology they were strange flashing the eyes of a religious fanatic and balefully they were fixed upon president ham then wakes the power the deep voice rumbled that in the age of iron burst forth to curb the great and raise the low he flung out his left arm and pointed it at billy mark where she stands he commanded with a sweeping protecting gesture he drew around billy an imaginary circle the pantomime was only too clear to the aged negro who feared neither god nor man but only voodoo there was in the voice and gesture that which caused his blood to chill around her form shrieked st clair i draw the awful circle of our solemn church set but one foot within that holy ground and on thy head like a semaphore the left arm dropped and the right arm with the forefinger pointed shot out at president ham yea though it wore a crown i launch the curse of rome no one moved no one spoke what terrible threat had hit him president ham could not guess he did not ask stiffly like a man in a trance he turned to the rusty iron safe behind his chair and spun the handle when again he faced them he held a long envelope which he presented to billy there are the ten thousand francs he said ask him if he is satisfied and demand that he go at once billy turned to st clair he says translated billy hes very much obliged and hopes we will come again now commanded billy bow low and go out facing him we dont want him to shoot us in the back bowing to the president the actor threw at billy a glance full of indignation was i as bad as that he demanded on schedule time billy drove up to the hotel ducrot and relinquished st clair to the ensign in charge of the launch from the louisiana at sight of st clair in the regalia of a superior officer that young gentleman showed his surprise ive been giving a command performance for the president explained the actor modestly i recited for him and though i spoke in english i think i made quite a hit you certainly billy assured him gratefully made a terrible hit with me as the movingpicture actors escorted by the ensign followed their trunks to the launch billy looked after them with a feeling of great loneliness he was aware that from the palace his carriage had been followed that drawn in a cordon around the hotel negro policemen covertly observed him that president ham still hoped to recover his lost prestige and his lost money was only too evident it was just five minutes to eight billy ran to his room and with his suitcase in his hand slipped down the back stairs and into the garden cautiously he made his way to the gate in the wall and in the street outside found claire awaiting him with a cry of relief she clasped his arm you are safe she cried i was so frightened for you that president ham he is a beast an ogre her voice sank to a whisper and for myself also i have been frightened the police they are at each corner they watch the hotel they watch me why what do they want they want something of mine said billy but i cant tell you what it is until im sure it is mine is the boat at the wharf all is arranged claire assured him the boatmen are our friends they will take us safely to the steamer with a sigh of relief billy lifted her valise and his own but he did not move forward anxiously claire pulled at his sleeve come she begged for what it is that you wait it was just eight oclock billy was looking up at the single electric light bulb that lit the narrow street and following the direction of his eyes claire saw the light grow dim saw the tiny wires grow red and disappear from over all the city came shouts and cries of consternation oaths and laughter and then darkness i was waiting for this cried billy with the delight of a mischievous child claire laughed aloud youyou did it she accused i did said billy and nowwe must run like the devil the prinz der nederlanden was drawing slowly out of the harbor shoulder to shoulder claire and billy leaned upon the rail on the wharfs of portauprince they saw lanterns tossing and candles twinkling saw the louisiana blazing like a christmastree steaming majestically south in each others eyes saw that all was well from his pocket billy drew a long envelope i can now with certainty said billy state that this is mineours he opened the envelope and while claire gazed upon many millefranc notes billy told how he had retrieved them but what danger cried claire in time ham would have paid your president at washington would have made him pay why take such risks you had but to wait billy smiled contentedly dear one he exclaimed the policy of watchful waiting is safer but the big stick acts quicker and gets results
