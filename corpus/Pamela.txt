pamela publishers note samuel richardson the first in order of time of the great english novelists was born in and died at london in he was a printer by trade and rose to be master of the stationers company that he also became a novelist was due to his skill as a letterwriter which brought him in his fiftieth year a commission to write a volume of model familiar letters as an aid to persons too illiterate to compose their own the notion of connecting these letters by a story which had interested him suggested the plot of pamela and determined its epistolary form a form which was retained in his later works this novel published created an epoch in the history of english fiction and with its successors exerted a wide influence upon continental literature it is appropriately included in a series which is designed to form a group of studies of english life by the masters of english fiction for it marked the transition from the novel of adventure to the novel of character from the narration of entertaining events to the study of men and of manners of motives and of sentiments in it the romantic interest of the story which is of the slightest is subordinated to the moral interest in the conduct of its characters in the various situations in which they are placed upon this aspect of the drama of human life richardson cast a most observant if not always a penetrating glance his works are an almost microscopically detailed picture of english domestic life in the early part of the eighteenth century pamela or virtue rewarded letter i dear father and mother i have great trouble and some comfort to acquaint you with the trouble is that my good lady died of the illness i mentioned to you and left us all much grieved for the loss of her for she was a dear good lady and kind to all us her servants much i feared that as i was taken by her ladyship to wait upon her person i should be quite destitute again and forced to return to you and my poor mother who have enough to do to maintain yourselves and as my ladys goodness had put me to write and cast accounts and made me a little expert at my needle and otherwise qualified above my degree it was not every family that could have found a place that your poor pamela was fit for but god whose graciousness to us we have so often experienced at a pinch put it into my good ladys heart on her deathbed just an hour before she expired to recommend to my young master all her servants one by one and when it came to my turn to be recommended for i was sobbing and crying at her pillow she could only say my dear son and so broke off a little and then recovering remember my poor pamela and these were some of her last words o how my eyes run dont wonder to see the paper so blotted well but gods will must be done and so comes the comfort that i shall not be obliged to return back to be a clog upon my dear parents for my master said i will take care of you all my good maidens and for you pamela and took me by the hand yes he took my hand before them all for my dear mothers sake i will be a friend to you and you shall take care of my linen god bless him and pray with me my dear father and mother for a blessing upon him for he has given mourning and a years wages to all my ladys servants and i having no wages as yet my lady having said she should do for me as i deserved ordered the housekeeper to give me mourning with the rest and gave me with his own hand four golden guineas and some silver which were in my old ladys pocket when she died and said if i was a good girl and faithful and diligent he would be a friend to me for his mothers sake and so i send you these four guineas for your comfort for providence will not let me want and so you may pay some old debt with part and keep the other part to comfort you both if i get more i am sure it is my duty and it shall be my care to love and cherish you both for you have loved and cherished me when i could do nothing for myself i send them by john our footman who goes your way but he does not know what he carries because i seal them up in one of the little pillboxes which my lady had wrapt close in paper that they maynt chink and be sure dont open it before him i know dear father and mother i must give you both grief and pleasure and so i will only say pray for your pamela who will ever be your most dutiful daughter i have been scared out of my senses for just now as i was folding up this letter in my late ladys dressingroom in comes my young master good sirs how was i frightened i went to hide the letter in my bosom and he seeing me tremble said smiling to whom have you been writing pamela i said in my confusion pray your honour forgive me only to my father and mother he said well then let me see how you are come on in your writing o how ashamed i was he took it without saying more and read it quite through and then gave it me again and i said pray your honour forgive me yet i know not for what for he was always dutiful to his parents and why should he be angry that i was so to mine and indeed he was not angry for he took me by the hand and said you are a good girl pamela to be kind to your aged father and mother i am not angry with you for writing such innocent matters as these though you ought to be wary what tales you send out of a family be faithful and diligent and do as you should do and i like you the better for this and then he said why pamela you write a very pretty hand and spell tolerably too i see my good mothers care in your learning has not been thrown away upon you she used to say you loved reading you may look into any of her books to improve yourself so you take care of them to be sure i did nothing but courtesy and cry and was all in confusion at his goodness indeed he is the best of gentlemen i think but i am making another long letter so will only add to it that i shall ever be your dutiful daughter pamela andrews letter ii in answer to the preceding dear pamela your letter was indeed a great trouble and some comfort to me and your poor mother we are troubled to be sure for your good ladys death who took such care of you and gave you learning and for three or four years past has always been giving you clothes and linen and every thing that a gentlewoman need not be ashamed to appear in but our chief trouble is and indeed a very great one for fear you should be brought to anything dishonest or wicked by being set so above yourself every body talks how you have come on and what a genteel girl you are and some say you are very pretty and indeed six months since when i saw you last i should have thought so myself if you was not our child but what avails all this if you are to be ruined and undone indeed my dear pamela we begin to be in great fear for you for what signify all the riches in the world with a bad conscience and to be dishonest we are tis true very poor and find it hard enough to live though once as you know it was better with us but we would sooner live upon the water and if possible the clay of the ditches i contentedly dig than live better at the price of our childs ruin i hope the good squire has no design but when he has given you so much money and speaks so kindly to you and praises your coming on and oh that fatal word that he would be kind to you if you would do as you should do almost kills us with fears i have spoken to good old widow mumford about it who you know has formerly lived in good families and she puts us in some comfort for she says it is not unusual when a lady dies to give what she has about her person to her waitingmaid and to such as sit up with her in her illness but then why should he smile so kindly upon you why should he take such a poor girl as you by the hand as your letter says he has done twice why should he stoop to read your letter to us and commend your writing and spelling and why should he give you leave to read his mothers books indeed indeed my dearest child our hearts ache for you and then you seem so full of joy at his goodness so taken with his kind expressions which truly are very great favours if he means well that we fear yes my dear child we fear you should be too grateful and reward him with that jewel your virtue which no riches nor favour nor any thing in this life can make up to you i too have written a long letter but will say one thing more and that is that in the midst of our poverty and misfortunes we have trusted in gods goodness and been honest and doubt not to be happy hereafter if we continue to be good though our lot is hard here but the loss of our dear childs virtue would be a grief that we could not bear and would bring our grey hairs to the grave at once if then you love us if you wish for gods blessing and your own future happiness we both charge you to stand upon your guard and if you find the least attempt made upon your virtue be sure you leave every thing behind you and come away to us for we had rather see you all covered with rags and even follow you to the churchyard than have it said a child of ours preferred any worldly conveniences to her virtue we accept kindly your dutiful present but till we are out of pain cannot make use of it for fear we should partake of the price of our poor daughters shame so have laid it up in a rag among the thatch over the window for a while lest we should be robbed with our blessings and our hearty prayers for you we remain your careful but loving father and mother john and elizabeth andrews letter iii dear father i must needs say your letter has filled me with trouble for it has made my heart which was overflowing with gratitude for my masters goodness suspicious and fearful and yet i hope i shall never find him to act unworthy of his character for what could he get by ruining such a poor young creature as me but that which gives me most trouble is that you seem to mistrust the honesty of your child no my dear father and mother be assured that by gods grace i never will do any thing that shall bring your grey hairs with sorrow to the grave i will die a thousand deaths rather than be dishonest any way of that be assured and set your hearts at rest for although i have lived above myself for some time past yet i can be content with rags and poverty and bread and water and will embrace them rather than forfeit my good name let who will be the tempter and of this pray rest satisfied and think better of your dutiful daughter till death my master continues to be very affable to me as yet i see no cause to fear any thing mrs jervis the housekeeper too is very civil to me and i have the love of every body sure they cant all have designs against me because they are civil i hope i shall always behave so as to be respected by every one and that nobody would do me more hurt than i am sure i would do them our john so often goes your way that i will always get him to call that you may hear from me either by writing for it brings my hand in or by word of mouth letter iv dear mother for the last was to my father in answer to his letter and so i will now write to you though i have nothing to say but what will make me look more like a vain hussy than any thing else however i hope i shant be so proud as to forget myself yet there is a secret pleasure one has to hear ones self praised you must know then that my lady davers who i need not tell you is my masters sister has been a month at our house and has taken great notice of me and given me good advice to keep myself to myself she told me i was a pretty wench and that every body gave me a very good character and loved me and bid me take care to keep the fellows at a distance and said that i might do and be more valued for it even by themselves but what pleased me much was what i am going to tell you for at table as mrs jervis says my master and her ladyship talking of me she told him she thought me the prettiest wench she ever saw in her life and that i was too pretty to live in a bachelors house since no lady he might marry would care to continue me with her he said i was vastly improved and had a good share of prudence and sense above my years and that it would be pity that what was my merit should be my misfortune no says my good lady pamela shall come and live with me i think he said with all his heart he should be glad to have me so well provided for well said she ill consult my lord about it she asked how old i was and mrs jervis said i was fifteen last february o says she if the wench for so she calls all us maiden servants takes care of herself shell improve yet more and more as well in her person as mind now my dear father and mother though this may look too vain to be repeated by me yet are you not rejoiced as well as i to see my master so willing to part with me this shews that he has nothing bad in his heart but john is just going away and so i have only to say that i am and will always be your honest as well as dutiful daughter pray make use of the money you may now do it safely letter v my dear father and mother john being to go your way i am willing to write because he is so willing to carry any thing for me he says it does him good at his heart to see you both and to hear you talk he says you are both so sensible and so honest that he always learns something from you to the purpose it is a thousand pities he says that such worthy hearts should not have better luck in the world and wonders that you my father who are so well able to teach and write so good a hand succeeded no better in the school you attempted to set up but was forced to go to such hard labour but this is more pride to me that i am come of such honest parents than if i had been born a lady i hear nothing yet of going to lady davers and i am very easy at present here for mrs jervis uses me as if i were her own daughter and is a very good woman and makes my masters interest her own she is always giving me good counsel and i love her next to you two i think best of any body she keeps so good rule and order she is mightily respected by us all and takes delight to hear me read to her and all she loves to hear read is good books which we read whenever we are alone so that i think i am at home with you she heard one of our men harry who is no better than he should be speak freely to me i think he called me his pretty pamela and took hold of me as if he would have kissed me for which you may be sure i was very angry and she took him to task and was as angry at him as could be and told me she was very well pleased to see my prudence and modesty and that i kept all the fellows at a distance and indeed i am sure i am not proud and carry it civilly to every body but yet methinks i cannot bear to be looked upon by these menservants for they seem as if they would look one through and as i generally breakfast dine and sup with mrs jervis so good she is to me i am very easy that i have so little to say to them not but they are civil to me in the main for mrs jerviss sake who they see loves me and they stand in awe of her knowing her to be a gentlewoman born though she has had misfortunes i am going on again with a long letter for i love writing and shall tire you but when i began i only intended to say that i am quite fearless of any danger now and indeed cannot but wonder at myself though your caution to me was your watchful love that i should be so foolish as to be so uneasy as i have been for i am sure my master would not demean himself so as to think upon such a poor girl as i for my harm for such a thing would ruin his credit as well as mine you know who to be sure may expect one of the best ladies in the land so no more at present but that i am your ever dutiful daughter letter vi dear father and mother my master has been very kind since my last for he has given me a suit of my late ladys clothes and half a dozen of her shifts and six fine handkerchiefs and three of her cambric aprons and four holland ones the clothes are fine silk and too rich and too good for me to be sure i wish it was no affront to him to make money of them and send it to you it would do me more good you will be full of fears i warrant now of some design upon me till i tell you that he was with mrs jervis when he gave them me and he gave her a mort of good things at the same time and bid her wear them in remembrance of her good friend my lady his mother and when he gave me these fine things he said these pamela are for you have them made fit for you when your mourning is laid by and wear them for your good mistresss sake mrs jervis gives you a very good word and i would have you continue to behave as prudently as you have done hitherto and every body will be your friend i was so surprised at his goodness that i could not tell what to say i courtesied to him and to mrs jervis for her good word and said i wished i might be deserving of his favour and her kindness and nothing should be wanting in me to the best of my knowledge o how amiable a thing is doing good it is all i envy great folks for i always thought my young master a fine gentleman as every body says he is but he gave these good things to us both with such a graciousness as i thought he looked like an angel mrs jervis says he asked her if i kept the men at a distance for he said i was very pretty and to be drawn in to have any of them might be my ruin and make me poor and miserable betimes she never is wanting to give me a good word and took occasion to lanch out in my praise she says but i hope she has said no more than i shall try to deserve though i maynt at present i am sure i will always love her next to you and my dear mother so i rest your ever dutiful daughter letter vii dear father since my last my master gave me more fine things he called me up to my late ladys closet and pulling out her drawers he gave me two suits of fine flanders laced headclothes three pair of fine silk shoes two hardly the worse and just fit for me for my lady had a very little foot and the other with wrought silver buckles in them and several ribands and topknots of all colours four pair of white fine cotton stockings and three pair of fine silk ones and two pair of rich stays i was quite astonished and unable to speak for a while but yet i was inwardly ashamed to take the stockings for mrs jervis was not there if she had it would have been nothing i believe i received them very awkwardly for he smiled at my awkwardness and said dont blush pamela dost think i dont know pretty maids should wear shoes and stockings i was so confounded at these words you might have beat me down with a feather for you must think there was no answer to be made to this so like a fool i was ready to cry and went away courtesying and blushing i am sure up to the ears for though there was no harm in what he said yet i did not know how to take it but i went and told all to mrs jervis who said god put it into his heart to be good to me and i must double my diligence it looked to her she said as if he would fit me in dress for a waitingmaids place on lady daverss own person but still your kind fatherly cautions came into my head and made all these gifts nothing near to me what they would have been but yet i hope there is no reason for what good could it do to him to harm such a simple maiden as me besides to be sure no lady would look upon him if he should so disgrace himself so i will make myself easy and indeed i should never have been otherwise if you had not put it into my head for my good i know very well but may be without these uneasinesses to mingle with these benefits i might be too much puffed up so i will conclude all that happens is for our good and god bless you my dear father and mother and i know you constantly pray for a blessing upon me who am and shall always be your dutiful daughter letter viii dear pamela i cannot but renew my cautions on your masters kindness and his free expression to you about the stockings yet there may not be and i hope there is not any thing in it but when i reflect that there possibly may and that if there should no less depends upon it than my childs everlasting happiness in this world and the next it is enough to make one fearful for you arm yourself my dear child for the worst and resolve to lose your life sooner than your virtue what though the doubts i filled you with lessen the pleasure you would have had in your masters kindness yet what signify the delights that arise from a few paltry fine clothes in comparison with a good conscience these are indeed very great favours that he heaps upon you but so much the more to be suspected and when you say he looked so amiably and like an angel how afraid i am that they should make too great an impression upon you for though you are blessed with sense and prudence above your years yet i tremble to think what a sad hazard a poor maiden of little more than fifteen years of age stands against the temptations of this world and a designing young gentleman if he should prove so who has so much power to oblige and has a kind of authority to command as your master i charge you my dear child on both our blessings poor as we are to be on your guard there can be no harm in that and since mrs jervis is so good a gentlewoman and so kind to you i am the easier a great deal and so is your mother and we hope you will hide nothing from her and take her counsel in every thing so with our blessings and assured prayers for you more than for ourselves we remain your loving father and mother be sure dont let peoples telling you you are pretty puff you up for you did not make yourself and so can have no praise due to you for it it is virtue and goodness only that make the true beauty remember that pamela letter ix dear father and mother i am sorry to write you word that the hopes i had of going to wait on lady davers are quite over my lady would have had me but my master as i heard by the by would not consent to it he said her nephew might be taken with me and i might draw him in or be drawn in by him and he thought as his mother loved me and committed me to his care he ought to continue me with him and mrs jervis would be a mother to me mrs jervis tells me the lady shook her head and said ah brother and that was all and as you have made me fearful by your cautions my heart at times misgives me but i say nothing yet of your caution or my own uneasiness to mrs jervis not that i mistrust her but for fear she should think me presumptuous and vain and conceited to have any fears about the matter from the great distance between such a gentleman and so poor a girl but yet mrs jervis seemed to build something upon lady daverss shaking her head and saying ah brother and no more god i hope will give me his grace and so i will not if i can help it make myself too uneasy for i hope there is no occasion but every little matter that happens i will acquaint you with that you may continue to me your good advice and pray for your sadhearted pamela letter x dear mother you and my good father may wonder you have not had a letter from me in so many weeks but a sad sad scene has been the occasion of it for to be sure now it is too plain that all your cautions were well grounded o my dear mother i am miserable truly miserable but yet dont be frightened i am honest god of his goodness keep me so o this angel of a master this fine gentleman this gracious benefactor to your poor pamela who was to take care of me at the prayer of his good dying mother who was so apprehensive for me lest i should be drawn in by lord daverss nephew that he would not let me go to lady daverss this very gentleman yes i must call him gentleman though he has fallen from the merit of that title has degraded himself to offer freedoms to his poor servant he has now shewed himself in his true colours and to me nothing appear so black and so frightful i have not been idle but had writ from time to time how he by sly mean degrees exposed his wicked views but somebody stole my letter and i know not what has become of it it was a very long one i fear he that was mean enough to do bad things in one respect did not stick at this but be it as it will all the use he can make of it will be that he may be ashamed of his part i not of mine for he will see i was resolved to be virtuous and gloried in the honesty of my poor parents i will tell you all the next opportunity for i am watched very narrowly and he says to mrs jervis this girl is always scribbling i think she may be better employed and yet i work all hours with my needle upon his linen and the fine linen of the family and am besides about flowering him a waistcoat but oh my hearts broke almost for what am i likely to have for my reward but shame and disgrace or else ill words and hard treatment ill tell you all soon and hope i shall find my long letter your most afflicted daughter maybe i he and him too much but it is his own fault if i do for why did he lose all his dignity with me letter xi dear mother well i cant find my letter and so ill try to recollect it all and be as brief as i can all went well enough in the main for some time after my letter but one at last i saw some reason to suspect for he would look upon me whenever he saw me in such a manner as shewed not well and one day he came to me as i was in the summerhouse in the little garden at work with my needle and mrs jervis was just gone from me and i would have gone out but he said no dont go pamela i have something to say to you and you always fly me when i come near you as if you were afraid of me i was much out of countenance you may well think but said at last it does not become your good servant to stay in your presence sir without your business required it and i hope i shall always know my place well says he my business does require it sometimes and i have a mind you should stay to hear what i have to say to you i stood still confounded and began to tremble and the more when he took me by the hand for now no soul was near us my sister davers said he and seemed i thought to be as much at a loss for words as i would have had you live with her but she would not do for you what i am resolved to do if you continue faithful and obliging what sayst thou my girl said he with some eagerness hadst thou not rather stay with me than go to my sister davers he looked so as filled me with affrightment i dont know how wildly i thought i said when i could speak your honour will forgive me but as you have no lady for me to wait upon and my good lady has been now dead this twelvemonth i had rather if it would not displease you wait upon lady davers because i was proceeding and he said a little hastily because you are a little fool and know not whats good for yourself i tell you i will make a gentlewoman of you if you be obliging and dont stand in your own light and so saying he put his arm about me and kissed me now you will say all his wickedness appeared plainly i struggled and trembled and was so benumbed with terror that i sunk down not in a fit and yet not myself and i found myself in his arms quite void of strength and he kissed me two or three times with frightful eagerness at last i burst from him and was getting out of the summerhouse but he held me back and shut the door i would have given my life for a farthing and he said ill do you no harm pamela dont be afraid of me i said i wont stay you wont hussy said he do you know whom you speak to i lost all fear and all respect and said yes i do sir too well well may i forget that i am your servant when you forget what belongs to a master i sobbed and cried most sadly what a foolish hussy you are said he have i done you any harm yes sir said i the greatest harm in the world you have taught me to forget myself and what belongs to me and have lessened the distance that fortune has made between us by demeaning yourself to be so free to a poor servant yet sir i will be bold to say i am honest though poor and if you was a prince i would not be otherwise he was angry and said who would have you otherwise you foolish slut cease your blubbering i own i have demeaned myself but it was only to try you if you can keep this matter secret youll give me the better opinion of your prudence and heres something said he putting some gold in my hand to make you amends for the fright i put you in go take a walk in the garden and dont go in till your blubbering is over and i charge you say nothing of what is past and all shall be well and ill forgive you i wont take the money indeed sir said i poor as i am i wont take it for to say truth i thought it looked like taking earnest and so i put it upon the bench and as he seemed vexed and confused at what he had done i took the opportunity to open the door and went out of the summerhouse he called to me and said be secret i charge you pamela and dont go in yet as i told you o how poor and mean must those actions be and how little must they make the best of gentlemen look when they offer such things as are unworthy of themselves and put it into the power of their inferiors to be greater than they i took a turn or two in the garden but in sight of the house for fear of the worst and breathed upon my hand to dry my eyes because i would not be too disobedient my next shall tell you more pray for me my dear father and mother and dont be angry i have not yet run away from this house so late my comfort and delight but now my terror and anguish i am forced to break off hastily your dutiful and honest daughter letter xii dear mother well i will now proceed with my sad story and so after i had dried my eyes i went in and began to ruminate with myself what i had best to do sometimes i thought i would leave the house and go to the next town and wait an opportunity to get to you but then i was at a loss to resolve whether to take away the things he had given me or no and how to take them away sometimes i thought to leave them behind me and only go with the clothes on my back but then i had two miles and a half and a byway to the town and being pretty well dressed i might come to some harm almost as bad as what i would run away from and then maybe thought i it will be reported i have stolen something and so was forced to run away and to carry a bad name back with me to my dear parents would be a sad thing indeed o how i wished for my grey russet again and my poor honest dress with which you fitted me out and hard enough too it was for you to do it for going to this place when i was not twelve years old in my good ladys days sometimes i thought of telling mrs jervis and taking her advice and only feared his command to be secret for thought i he may be ashamed of his actions and never attempt the like again and as poor mrs jervis depended upon him through misfortunes that had attended her i thought it would be a sad thing to bring his displeasure upon her for my sake in this quandary now considering now crying and not knowing what to do i passed the time in my chamber till evening when desiring to be excused going to supper mrs jervis came up to me and said why must i sup without you pamela come i see you are troubled at something tell me what is the matter i begged i might be permitted to be with her on nights for i was afraid of spirits and they would not hurt such a good person as she that was a silly excuse she said for why was not you afraid of spirits before indeed i did not think of that but you shall be my bedfellow with all my heart added she let your reason be what it will only come down to supper i begged to be excused for said i i have been crying so that it will be taken notice of by my fellowservants and i will hide nothing from you mrs jervis when we are alone she was so good to indulge me but made haste to come up to bed and told the servants that i should be with her because she could not rest well and would get me to read her to sleep for she knew i loved reading she said when we were alone i told her all that had passed for i thought though he had bid me not yet if he should come to know i had told it would be no worse for to keep a secret of such a nature would be as i apprehended to deprive myself of the good advice which i never wanted more and might encourage him to think i did not resent it as i ought and would keep worse secrets and so make him do worse by me was i right my dear mother mrs jervis could not help mingling tears with my tears for i cried all the time i was telling her the story and begged her to advise me what to do and i shewed her my dear fathers two letters and she praised the honesty and enditing of them and said pleasing things to me of you both but she begged i would not think of leaving my service for said she in all likelihood you behaved so virtuously that he will be ashamed of what he has done and never offer the like to you again though my dear pamela said she i fear more for your prettiness than for anything else because the best man in the land might love you so she was pleased to say she wished it was in her power to live independent then she would take a little private house and i should live with her like her daughter and so as you ordered me to take her advice i resolved to tarry to see how things went except he was to turn me away although in your first letter you ordered me to come away the moment i had any reason to be apprehensive so dear father and mother it is not disobedience i hope that i stay for i could not expect a blessing or the good fruits of your prayers for me if i was disobedient all the next day i was very sad and began my long letter he saw me writing and said as i mentioned to mrs jervis that girl is always scribbling methinks she might find something else to do or to that purpose and when i had finished my letter i put it under the toilet in my late ladys dressingroom whither nobody comes but myself and mrs jervis besides my master but when i came up again to seal it to my great concern it was gone and mrs jervis knew nothing of it and nobody knew of my masters having been near the place in the time so i have been sadly troubled about it but mrs jervis as well as i thinks he has it some how or other and he appears cross and angry and seems to shun me as much as he said i did him it had better be so than worse but he has ordered mrs jervis to bid me not pass so much time in writing which is a poor matter for such a gentleman as he to take notice of as i am not idle other ways if he did not resent what he thought i wrote upon and this has no very good look but i am a good deal easier since i lie with mrs jervis though after all the fears i live in on one side and his frowning and displeasure at what i do on the other make me more miserable than enough o that i had never left my little bed in the loft to be thus exposed to temptations on one hand or disgusts on the other how happy was i awhile ago how contrary now pity and pray for your afflicted pamela letter xiii my dearest child our hearts bleed for your distress and the temptations you are exposed to you have our hourly prayers and we would have you flee this evil great house and man if you find he renews his attempts you ought to have done it at first had you not had mrs jervis to advise with we can find no fault in your conduct hitherto but it makes our hearts ache for fear of the worst o my child temptations are sore things but yet without them we know not ourselves nor what we are able to do your danger is very great for you have riches youth and a fine gentleman as the world reckons him to withstand but how great will be your honour to withstand them and when we consider your past conduct and your virtuous education and that you have been bred to be more ashamed of dishonesty than poverty we trust in god that he will enable you to overcome yet as we cant see but your life must be a burthen to you through the great apprehensions always upon you and that it may be presumptuous to trust too much to our own strength and that you are but very young and the devil may put it into his heart to use some stratagem of which great men are full to decoy you i think you had better come home to share our poverty with safety than live with so much discontent in a plenty that itself may be dangerous god direct you for the best while you have mrs jervis for an adviser and bedfellow and o my dear child that was prudently done of you we are easier than we should be and so committing you to the divine protection remain your truly loving but careful father and mother letter xiv dear father and mother mrs jervis and i have lived very comfortably together for this fortnight past for my master was all that time at his lincolnshire estate and at his sisters the lady davers but he came home yesterday he had some talk with mrs jervis soon after and mostly about me he said to her it seems well mrs jervis i know pamela has your good word but do you think her of any use in the family she told me she was surprised at the question but said that i was one of the most virtuous and industrious young creatures that ever she knew why that word virtuous said he i pray you was there any reason to suppose her otherwise or has any body taken it into his head to try her i wonder sir says she you ask such a question who dare offer any thing to her in such an orderly and wellgoverned house as yours and under a master of so good a character for virtue and honour your servant mrs jervis says he for your good opinion but pray if any body did do you think pamela would let you know it why sir said she she is a poor innocent young creature and i believe has so much confidence in me that she would take my advice as soon as she would her mothers innocent again and virtuous i warrant well mrs jervis you abound with your epithets but i take her to be an artful young baggage and had i a young handsome butler or steward shed soon make her market of one of them if she thought it worth while to snap at him for a husband alackaday sir said she it is early days with pamela and she does not yet think of a husband i dare say and your steward and butler are both men in years and think nothing of the matter no said he if they were younger theyd have more wit than to think of such a girl ill tell you my mind of her mrs jervis i dont think this same favourite of yours so very artless a girl as you imagine i am not to dispute with your honour said mrs jervis but i dare say if the men will let her alone shell never trouble herself about them why mrs jervis said he are there any men that will not let her alone that you know of no indeed sir said she she keeps herself so much to herself and yet behaves so prudently that they all esteem her and shew her as great a respect as if she was a gentlewoman born ay says he thats her art that i was speaking of but let me tell you the girl has vanity and conceit and pride too or i am mistaken and perhaps i could give you an instance of it sir said she you can see farther than such a poor silly woman as i am but i never saw any thing but innocence in her and virtue too ill warrant ye said he but suppose i could give you an instance where she has talked a little too freely of the kindnesses that have been shewn her from a certain quarter and has had the vanity to impute a few kind words uttered in mere compassion to her youth and circumstances into a design upon her and even dared to make free with names that she ought never to mention but with reverence and gratitude what would you say to that say sir said she i cannot tell what to say but i hope pamela incapable of such ingratitude well no more of this silly girl says he you may only advise her as you are her friend not to give herself too much licence upon the favours she meets with and if she stays here that she will not write the affairs of my family purely for an exercise to her pen and her invention i tell you she is a subtle artful gipsy and time will shew it you was ever the like heard my dear father and mother it is plain he did not expect to meet with such a repulse and mistrusts that i have told mrs jervis and has my long letter too that i intended for you and so is vexed to the heart but i cant help it i had better be thought artful and subtle than be so in his sense and as light as he makes of the words virtue and innocence in me he would have made a less angry construction had i less deserved that he should do so for then may be my crime should have been my virtue with him naughty gentleman as he is i will soon write again but must now end with saying that i am and shall always be your honest daughter letter xv dear mother i broke off abruptly my last letter for i feared he was coming and so it happened i put the letter in my bosom and took up my work which lay by me but i had so little of the artful as he called it that i looked as confused as if i had been doing some great harm sit still pamela said he mind your work for all me you dont tell me i am welcome home after my journey to lincolnshire it would be hard sir said i if you was not always welcome to your honours own house i would have gone but he said dont run away i tell you i have a word or two to say to you good sirs how my heart went pitapat when i was a little kind to you said he in the summerhouse and you carried yourself so foolishly upon it as if i had intended to do you great harm did i not tell you you should take no notice of what passed to any creature and yet you have made a common talk of the matter not considering either my reputation or your own i made a common talk of it sir said i i have nobody to talk to hardly he interrupted me and said hardly you little equivocator what do you mean by hardly let me ask you have not you told mrs jervis for one pray your honour said i all in agitation let me go down for it is not for me to hold an argument with your honour equivocator again said he and took my hand what do you talk of an argument is it holding an argument with me to answer a plain question answer me what i asked o good sir said i let me beg you will not urge me farther for fear i forget myself again and be saucy answer me then i bid you says he have you not told mrs jervis it will be saucy in you if you dont answer me directly to what i ask sir said i and fain would have pulled my hand away perhaps i should be for answering you by another question and that would not become me what is it you would say replies he speak out then sir said i why should your honour be so angry i should tell mrs jervis or any body else what passed if you intended no harm well said pretty innocent and artless as mrs jervis calls you said he and is it thus you taunt and retort upon me insolent as you are but still i will be answered directly to my question why then sir said i i will not tell a lie for the world i did tell mrs jervis for my heart was almost broken but i opened not my mouth to any other very well boldface said he and equivocator again you did not open your mouth to any other but did not you write to some other why now and please your honour said i for i was quite courageous just then you could not have asked me this question if you had not taken from me my letter to my father and mother in which i own i had broken my mind freely to them and asked their advice and poured forth my griefs and so i am to be exposed am i said he in my own house and out of my house to the whole world by such a saucebox as you no good sir said i and i hope your honour wont be angry with me it is not i that expose you if i say nothing but the truth so taunting again assurance as you are said he i will not be thus talked to pray sir said i of whom can a poor girl take advice if it must not be of her father and mother and such a good woman as mrs jervis who for her sexsake should give it me when asked insolence said he and stamped with his foot am i to be questioned thus by such a one as you i fell down on my knees and said for heavens sake your honour pity a poor creature that knows nothing of her duty but how to cherish her virtue and good name i have nothing else to trust to and though poor and friendless here yet i have always been taught to value honesty above my life heres ado with your honesty said he foolish girl is it not one part of honesty to be dutiful and grateful to your master do you think indeed sir said i it is impossible i should be ungrateful to your honour or disobedient or deserve the names of boldface or insolent which you call me but when your commands are contrary to that first duty which shall ever be the principle of my life he seemed to be moved and rose up and walked into the great chamber two or three turns leaving me on my knees and i threw my apron over my face and laid my head on a chair and cried as if my heart would break having no power to stir at last he came in again but alas with mischief in his heart and raising me up he said rise pamela rise you are your own enemy your perverse folly will be your ruin i tell you this that i am very much displeased with the freedoms you have taken with my name to my housekeeper as also to your father and mother and you may as well have real cause to take these freedoms with me as to make my name suffer for imaginary ones and saying so he offered to take me on his knee with some force o how i was terrified i said like as i had read in a book a night or two before angels and saints and all the host of heaven defend me and may i never survive one moment that fatal one in which i shall forfeit my innocence pretty fool said he how will you forfeit your innocence if you are obliged to yield to a force you cannot withstand be easy said he for let the worst happen that can you will have the merit and i the blame and it will be a good subject for letters to your father and mother and a tale into the bargain for mrs jervis he by force kissed my neck and lips and said whoever blamed lucretia all the shame lay on the ravisher only and i am content to take all the blame upon me as i have already borne too great a share for what i have not deserved may i said i lucretia like justify myself with my death if i am used barbarously o my good girl said he tauntingly you are well read i see and we shall make out between us before we have done a pretty story in romance i warrant ye he then put his hand in my bosom and indignation gave me double strength and i got loose from him by a sudden spring and ran out of the room and the next chamber being open i made shift to get into it and threw to the door and it locked after me but he followed me so close he got hold of my gown and tore a piece off which hung without the door for the key was on the inside i just remember i got into the room for i knew nothing further of the matter till afterwards for i fell into a fit with my terror and there i lay till he as i suppose looking through the keyhole spyed me upon the floor stretched out at length on my face and then he called mrs jervis to me who by his assistance bursting open the door he went away seeing me coming to myself and bid her say nothing of the matter if she was wise poor mrs jervis thought it was worse and cried over me like as if she was my mother and i was two hours before i came to myself and just as i got a little up on my feet he coming in i fainted away again with the terror and so he withdrew but he staid in the next room to let nobody come near us that his foul proceedings might not be known mrs jervis gave me her smellingbottle and had cut my laces and set me in a great chair and he called her to him how is the girl said he i never saw such a fool in my life i did nothing at all to her mrs jervis could not speak for crying so he said she has told you it seems that i was kind to her in the summerhouse though ill assure you i was quite innocent then as well as now and i desire you to keep this matter to yourself and let me not be named in it o sir said she for your honours sake and for christs sake but he would not hear her and said for your own sake i tell you mrs jervis say not a word more i have done her no harm and i wont have her stay in my house prating perverse fool as she is but since she is so apt to fall into fits or at least pretend to do so prepare her to see me tomorrow after dinner in my mothers closet and do you be with her and you shall hear what passes between us and so he went out in a pet and ordered his chariot and four to be got ready and went a visiting somewhere mrs jervis then came to me and i told her all that had happened and said i was resolved not to stay in the house and she replying he seemed to threaten as much i said i am glad of that then i shall be easy so she told me all he had said to her as above mrs jervis is very loath i should go and yet poor woman she begins to be afraid for herself but would not have me ruined for the world she says to be sure he means no good but may be now he sees me so resolute he will give over all attempts and that i shall better know what to do after tomorrow when i am to appear before a very bad judge i doubt o how i dread this tomorrows appearance but be as assured my dear parents of the honesty of your poor child as i am of your prayers for your dutiful daughter o this frightful tomorrow how i dread it letter xvi my dear parents i know you longed to hear from me soon and i send you as soon as i could well you may believe how uneasily i passed the time till his appointed hour came every minute as it grew nearer my terrors increased and sometimes i had great courage and sometimes none at all and i thought i should faint when it came to the time my master had dined i could neither eat nor drink for my part and do what i could my eyes were swelled with crying at last he went up to the closet which was my good ladys dressingroom a room i once loved but then as much hated dont your heart ache for me i am sure mine fluttered about like a new caught bird in a cage o pamela said i to myself why art thou so foolish and fearful thou hast done no harm what if thou fearest an unjust judge when thou art innocent wouldst thou do before a just one if thou wert guilty have courage pamela thou knowest the worst and how easy a choice poverty and honesty is rather than plenty and wickedness so i cheered myself but yet my poor heart sunk and my spirits were quite broken everything that stirred i thought was to call me to my account i dreaded it and yet i wished it to come well at last he rung the bell o thought i that it was my passing bell mrs jervis went up with a full heart enough poor good woman he said wheres pamela let her come up and do you come with her she came to me i was ready to go with my feet but my heart was with my dear father and mother wishing to share your poverty and happiness i went up however o how can wicked men seem so steady and untouched with such black hearts while poor innocents stand like malefactors before them he looked so stern that my heart failed me and i wished myself any where but there though i had before been summoning up all my courage good heaven said i to myself give me courage to stand before this naughty master o soften him or harden me come in fool said he angrily as soon as he saw me and snatched my hand with a pull you may well be ashamed to see me after your noise and nonsense and exposing me as you have done i ashamed to see you thought i very pretty indeed but i said nothing mrs jervis said he here you are both together do you sit down but let her stand if she will ay thought i if i can for my knees beat one against the other did you not think when you saw the girl in the way you found her in that i had given her the greatest occasion for complaint that could possibly be given to a woman and that i had actually ruined her as she calls it tell me could you think any thing less indeed said she i feared so at first has she told you what i did to her and all i did to her to occasion all this folly by which my reputation might have suffered in your opinion and in that of all the family inform me what she has told you she was a little too much frightened as she owned afterwards at his sternness and said indeed she told me you only pulled her on your knee and kissed her then i plucked up my spirits a little only mrs jervis said i and was not that enough to shew me what i had to fear when a master of his honours degree demeans himself to be so free as that to such a poor servant as me what is the next to be expected but your honour went farther so you did and threatened me what you would do and talked of lucretia and her hard fate your honour knows you went too far for a master to a servant or even to his equal and i cannot bear it so i fell a crying most sadly mrs jervis began to excuse me and to beg he would pity a poor maiden that had such a value for her reputation he said i speak it to her face i think her very pretty and i thought her humble and one that would not grow upon my favours or the notice i took of her but i abhor the thoughts of forcing her to any thing i know myself better said he and what belongs to me and to be sure i have enough demeaned myself to take notice of such a one as she but i was bewitched by her i think to be freer than became me though i had no intention to carry the jest farther what poor stuff was all this my dear mother from a man of his sense but see how a bad cause and bad actions confound the greatest wits it gave me a little more courage then for innocence i find in a low fortune and weak mind has many advantages over guilt with all its riches and wisdom so i said your honour may call this jest or sport or what you please but indeed sir it is not a jest that becomes the distance between a master and a servant do you hear mrs jervis said he do you hear the pertness of the creature i had a good deal of this sort before in the summerhouse and yesterday too which made me rougher with her than perhaps i had otherwise been says mrs jervis pamela dont be so pert to his honour you should know your distance you see his honour was only in jest o dear mrs jervis said i dont you blame me too it is very difficult to keep ones distance to the greatest of men when they wont keep it themselves to their meanest servants see again said he could you believe this of the young baggage if you had not heard it good your honour said the wellmeaning gentlewoman pity and forgive the poor girl she is but a girl and her virtue is very dear to her and i will pawn my life for her she will never be pert to your honour if youll be so good as to molest her no more nor frighten her again you saw sir by her fit she was in terror she could not help it and though your honour intended her no harm yet the apprehension was almost death to her and i had much ado to bring her to herself again o the little hypocrite said he she has all the arts of her sex they were born with her and i told you awhile ago you did not know her but this was not the reason principally of my calling you before me together i find i am likely to suffer in my reputation by the perverseness and folly of this girl she has told you all and perhaps more than all nay i make no doubt of it and she has written letters for i find she is a mighty letterwriter to her father and mother and others as far as i know in which representing herself as an angel of light she makes her kind master and benefactor a devil incarnate o how people will sometimes thought i call themselves by their right names and all this added he i wont hear and so i am resolved she shall return to the distresses and poverty she was taken from and let her be careful how she uses my name with freedom when she is gone from me i was brightened up at once with these welcome words and i threw myself upon my knees at his feet with a most sincere glad heart and i said may your honour be for ever blessed for your resolution now i shall be happy and permit me on my bended knees to thank you for all the benefits and favours you have heaped upon me for the opportunities i have had of improvement and learning through my good ladys means and yours i will now forget all your honour has offered me and i promise you that i will never let your name pass my lips but with reverence and gratitude and so god almighty bless your honour for ever and ever amen then rising from my knees i went away with anotherguise sort of heart than i came into his presence with and so i fell to writing this letter and thus all is happily over and now my dearest father and mother expect to see soon your poor daughter with an humble and dutiful mind returned to you and dont fear but i know how to be as happy with you as ever for i will be in the loft as i used to do and pray let my little bed be got ready and i have a small matter of money which will buy me a suit of clothes fitter for my condition than what i have and i will get mrs mumford to help me to some needlework and fear not that i shall be a burden to you if my health continues i know i shall be blessed if not for my own sake for both your sakes who have in all your trials and misfortunes preserved so much integrity as makes every body speak well of you both but i hope he will let good mrs jervis give me a character for fear it should be thought that i was turned away for dishonesty and so my dear parents may you be blest for me and i for you and i will always pray for my master and mrs jervis so good night for it is late and i shall be soon called to bed i hope mrs jervis is not angry with me she has not called me to supper though i could eat nothing if she had but i make no doubt i shall sleep purely tonight and dream that i am with you in my dear dear happy loft once more so good night again my dear father and mother says your poor honest daughter perhaps i maynt come this week because i must get up the linen and leave in order every thing belonging to my place so send me a line if you can to let me know if i shall be welcome by john who will call for it as he returns but say nothing of my coming away to him as yet for it will be said i blab every thing letter xvii my dearest daughter welcome welcome ten times welcome shall you be to us for you come to us innocent and happy and honest and you are the staff of our old age and our comfort and though we cannot do for you as we would yet fear not we shall live happily together and what with my diligent labour and your poor mothers spinning and your needlework i make no doubt we shall do better and better only your poor mothers eyes begin to fail her though i bless god i am as strong and able and willing to labour as ever and o my dear child your virtue has made me i think stronger and better than i was before what blessed things are trials and temptations when we have the strength to resist and subdue them but i am uneasy about those same four guineas i think you should give them back again to your master and yet i have broken them alas i have only three left but i will borrow the fourth if i can part upon my wages and part of mrs mumford and send the whole sum back to you that you may return it against john comes next if he comes again before you i want to know how you come i fancy honest john will be glad to bear you company part of the way if your master is not so cross as to forbid him and if i know time enough your mother will go one five miles and i will go ten on the way or till i meet you as far as one holiday will go for that i can get leave to make on such an occasion and we shall receive you with more pleasure than we had at your birth when all the worst was over or than we ever had in our lives and so god bless you till the happy time comes say both your mother and i which is all at present from your truly loving parents letter xviii dear father and mother i thank you a thousand tines for your goodness to me expressed in your last letter i now long to get my business done and come to my new old lot again as i may call it i have been quite another thing since my master has turned me off and as i shall come to you an honest daughter what pleasure it is to what i should have had if i could not have seen you but as a guilty one well my writingtime will soon be over and so i will make use of it now and tell you all that has happened since my last letter i wondered mrs jervis did not call me to sup with her and feared she was angry and when i had finished my letter i longed for her coming to bed at last she came up but seemed shy and reserved and i said my dear mrs jervis i am glad to see you you are not angry with me i hope she said she was sorry things had gone so far and that she had a great deal of talk with my master after i was gone that he seemed moved at what i said and at my falling on my knees to him and my prayer for him at my going away he said i was a strange girl he knew not what to make of me and is she gone said he i intended to say something else to her but she behaved so oddly that i had not power to stop her she asked if she should call me again he said yes and then no let her go it is best for her and me too and she shall go now i have given her warning where she had it i cant tell but i never met with the fellow of her in any life at any age she said he had ordered her not to tell me all but she believed he would never offer any thing to me again and i might stay she fancied if i would beg it as a favour though she was not sure neither i stay dear mrs jervis said i why it is the best news that could have come to me that he will let me go i do nothing but long to go back again to my poverty and distress as he threatened i should for though i am sure of the poverty i shall not have half the distress i have had for some months past ill assure you mrs jervis dear good soul wept over me and said well well pamela i did not think i had shewn so little love to you as that you should express so much joy upon leaving me i am sure i never had a child half so dear to me as you are i went to hear her so good to me as indeed she has always been and said what would you have me to do dear mrs jervis i love you next to my own father and mother and to leave you is the chief concern i have at quitting this place but i am sure it is certain ruin if i stay after such offers and such threatenings and his comparing himself to a wicked ravisher in the very time of his last offer and turning it into a jest that we should make a pretty story in a romance can i stay and be safe has he not demeaned himself twice and it behoves me to beware of the third time for fear he should lay his snares surer for perhaps he did not expect a poor servant would resist her master so much and must it not be looked upon as a sort of warrant for such actions if i stay after this for i think when one of our sex finds she is attempted it is an encouragement to the attempter to proceed if one puts ones self in the way of it when one can help it tis neither more nor less than inviting him to think that one forgives what in short ought not to be forgiven which is no small countenance to foul actions ill assure you she hugged me to her and said ill assure you prettyface where gottest thou all thy knowledge and thy good notions at these years thou art a miracle for thy age and i shall always love thee but do you resolve to leave us pamela yes my dear mrs jervis said i for as matters stand how can i do otherwise but ill finish the duties of my place first if i may and hope youll give me a character as to my honesty that it may not he thought i was turned away for any harm ay that i will said she i will give thee such a character as never girl at thy years deserved and i am sure said i i will always love and honour you as my thirdbest friend wherever i go or whatever becomes of me and so we went to bed and i never waked till twas time to rise which i did as blithe as a bird and went about my business with great pleasure but i believe my master is fearfully angry with me for he passed by me two or three times and would not speak to me and towards evening he met me in the passage going into the garden and said such a word to me as i never heard in my life from him to man woman or child for he first said this creatures always in the way i think i said standing up as close as i could and the entry was wide enough for a coach too i hope i shant be long in your honours way d mn you said he that was the hard word for a little witch i have no patience with you i profess i trembled to hear him say so but i saw he was vexed and as i am going away i minded it the less well i see my dear parents that when a person will do wicked things it is no wonder he will speak wicked words may god keep me out of the way of them both your dutiful daughter letter xix dear father and mother our john having an opportunity to go your way i write again and send both letters at once i cant say yet when i shall get away nor how i shall come because mrs jervis shewed my master the waistcoat i am flowering for him and he said it looks well enough i think the creature had best stay till she has finished it there is some private talk carried on betwixt him and mrs jervis that she dont tell me of but yet she is very kind to me and i dont mistrust her at all i should be very base if i did but to be sure she must oblige him and keep all his lawful commands and other i dare say she wont keep she is too good and loves me too well but she must stay when i am gone and so must get no ill will she has been at me again to ask to stay and humble myself but what have i done mrs jervis said i if i have been a saucebox and a bold face and a pert and a creature as he calls me have i not had reason do you think i should ever have forgot myself if he had not forgot to act as my master tell me from your own heart dear mrs jervis said i if you think i could stay and be safe what would you think or how would you act in my case my dear pamela said she and kissed me i dont know how i should act or what i should think i hope i should act as you do but i know nobody else that would my master is a fine gentleman he has a great deal of wit and sense and is admired as i know by half a dozen ladies who would think themselves happy in his addresses he has a noble estate and yet i believe he loves my good maiden though his servant better than all the ladies in the land and he has tried to overcome it because you are so much his inferior and tis my opinion he finds he cant and that vexes his proud heart and makes him resolve you shant stay and so he speaks so cross to you when he sees you by accident well but mrs jervis said i let me ask you if he can stoop to like such a poor girl as me as perhaps he may for i have read of things almost as strange from great men to poor damsels what can it be for he may condescend perhaps to think i may be good enough for his harlot and those things dont disgrace men that ruin poor women as the world goes and so if i was wicked enough he would keep me till i was undone and till his mind changed for even wicked men i have read soon grow weary of wickedness with the same person and love variety well then poor pamela must be turned off and looked upon as a vile abandoned creature and every body would despise her ay and justly too mrs jervis for she that cant keep her virtue ought to live in disgrace but mrs jervis i continued let me tell you that i hope if i was sure he would always be kind to me and never turn me off at all that i shall have so much grace as to hate and withstand his temptations were he not only my master but my king and that for the sins sake this my poor dear parents have always taught me and i should be a sad wicked creature indeed if for the sake of riches or favour i should forfeit my good name yea and worse than any other young body of my sex because i can so contentedly return to my poverty again and think it a less disgrace to be obliged to wear rags and live upon ryebread and water as i used to do than to be a harlot to the greatest man in the world mrs jervis lifted up her hands and had her eyes full of tears god bless you my dear love said she you are my admiration and delight how shall i do to part with you well good mrs jervis said i let me ask you now you and he have had some talk and you maynt be suffered to tell me all but do you think if i was to ask to stay that he is sorry for what he has done ay and ashamed of it too for i am sure he ought considering his high degree and my low degree and how i have nothing in the world to trust to but my honesty do you think in your own conscience now pray answer me truly that he would never offer any thing to me again and that i could be safe alas my dear child said she dont put thy home questions to me with that pretty becoming earnestness in thy look i know this that he is vexed at what he has done he was vexed the first time more vexed the second time yes said i and so he will be vexed i suppose the third and the fourth time too till he has quite ruined your poor maiden and who will have cause to be vexed then nay pamela said she dont imagine that i would be accessory to your ruin for the world i only can say that he has yet done you no hurt and it is no wonder he should love you you are so pretty though so much beneath him but i dare swear for him he never will offer you any force you say said i that he was sorry for his first offer in the summer house well and how long did his sorrow last only till he found me by myself and then he was worse than before and so became sorry again and if he has deigned to love me and you say cant help it why he cant help it neither if he should have an opportunity a third time to distress me and i have read that many a man has been ashamed of his wicked attempts when he has been repulsed that would never have been ashamed of them had he succeeded besides mrs jervis if he really intends to offer no force what does that mean while you say he cant help liking me for love it cannot be does it not imply that he hopes to ruin me by my own consent i think said i and hope i should have grace to do so that i should not give way to his temptations on any account but it would be very presumptuous in me to rely upon my own strength against a gentleman of his qualifications and estate and who is my waster and thinks himself entitled to call me boldface and what not only for standing on my necessary defence and that too where the good of my soul and body and my duty to god and my parents are all concerned how then mrs jervis said i can i ask or wish to stay well well says she as he seems very desirous you should not stay i hope it is from a good motive for fear he should be tempted to disgrace himself as well as you no no mrs jervis said i i have thought of that too for i would be glad to consider him with that duty that becomes me but then he would have let me go to lady davers and not have hindered my preferment and he would not have said i should return to my poverty and distress when by his mothers goodness i had been lifted out of it but that he intended to fright me and punish me as he thought for not complying with his wickedness and this shews me well enough what i have to expect from his future goodness except i will deserve it at his own dear price she was silent and i added well theres no more to be said i must go thats certain all my concern will be how to part with you and indeed after you with every body for all my fellowservants have loved me and you and they will cost me a sigh and a tear too now and then i am sure and so i fell a crying i could not help it for it is a pleasant thing to one to be in a house among a great many fellowservants and be beloved by them all nay i should have told you before now how kind and civil mr longman our steward is vastly courteous indeed on all occasions and he said once to mrs jervis he wished he was a young man for my sake i should be his wife and he would settle all he had upon me on marriage and you must know he is reckoned worth a power of money i take no pride in this but bless god and your good examples my dear parents that i have been enabled so to carry myself as to have every bodys good word not but our cook one day who is a little snappish and cross sometimes said once to me why this pamela of ours goes as fine as a lady see what it is to have a fine face i wonder what the girl will come to at last she was hot with her work and i sneaked away for i seldom go down into the kitchen and i heard the butler say why jane nobody has your good word what has mrs pamela done to you i am sure she offends nobody and what said the peevish wench have i said to her foolatum but that she was pretty they quarrelled afterwards i heard i was sorry for it but troubled myself no more about it forgive this silly prattle from your dutiful daughter oh i forgot to say that i would stay to finish the waistcoat if i might with safety mrs jervis tells me i certainly may i never did a prettier piece of work and i am up early and late to get it over for i long to be with you letter xx dear father and mother i did not send my last letters so soon as i hoped because john whether my master mistrusts or no i cant say had been sent to lady daverss instead of isaac who used to go and i could not be so free with nor so well trust isaac though he is very civil to me too so i was forced to stay till john returned as i may not have opportunity to send again soon and yet as i know you keep my letters and read them over and over so john told me when you have done work so much does your kindness make you love all that comes from your poor daughter and as it may be some little pleasure to me perhaps to read them myself when i am come to you to remind me of what i have gone through and how great gods goodness has been to me which i hope will further strengthen my good resolutions that i may not hereafter from my bad conduct have reason to condemn myself from my own hand as it were for all these reasons i say i will write as i have time and as matters happen and send the scribble to you as i have opportunity and if i dont every time in form subscribe as i ought i am sure you will always believe that it is not for want of duty so i will begin where i left off about the talk between mrs jervis and me for me to ask to stay unknown to mrs jervis i put a project as i may call it in practice i thought with myself some days ago here i shall go home to my poor father and mother and have nothing on my back that will be fit for my condition for how should your poor daughter look with a silk nightgown silken petticoats cambric headclothes fine holland linen laced shoes that were my ladys and fine stockings and how in a little while must these have looked like old castoffs indeed and i looked so for wearing them and people would have said for poor folks are envious as well as rich see there goody andrewss daughter turned home from her fine place what a tawdry figure she makes and how well that garb becomes her poor parents circumstances and how would they look upon me thought i to myself when they should come to be threadbare and worn out and how should i look even if i could purchase homespun clothes to dwindle into them one by one as i got them may be an old silk gown and a linseywoolsey petticoat and the like so thought i i had better get myself at once equipped in the dress that will become my condition and though it may look but poor to what i have been used to wear of late days yet it will serve me when i am with you for a good holiday and sunday suit and what by a blessing on my industry i may perhaps make shift to keep up to so as i was saying unknown to any body i bought of farmer nicholss wife and daughters a good sadcoloured stuff of their own spinning enough to make me a gown and two petticoats and i made robings and facings of a pretty bit of printed calico i had by me i had a pretty good camblet quilted coat that i thought might do tolerably well and i bought two flannel undercoats not so good as my swanskin and fine linen ones but what will keep me warm if any neighbour should get me to go out to help em to milk now and then as sometimes i used to do formerly for i am resolved to do all your good neighbours what kindness i can and hope to make myself as much beloved about you as i am here i got some pretty good scotch cloth and made me of mornings and nights when nobody saw me two shifts and i have enough left for two shirts and two shifts for you my dear father and mother when i come home ill make them for you and desire your acceptance then i bought of a pedlar two pretty enough roundeared caps a little strawhat and a pair of knit mittens turned up with white calico and two pair of ordinary blue worsted hose that make a smartish appearance with white clocks ill assure you and two yards of black riband for my shift sleeves and to serve as a necklace and when i had em all come home i went and looked upon them once in two hours for two days together for you must know though i be with mrs jervis i keep my own little apartment still for my clothes and nobody goes thither but myself youll say i was no bad housewife to have saved so much money but my dear good lady was always giving me something i believed myself the more obliged to do this because as i was turned away for what my good master thought want of duty and as he expected other returns for his presents than i intended to make him so i thought it was but just to leave his presents behind me when i went away for you know if i would not earn his wages why should i have them dont trouble yourself about the four guineas nor borrow to make them up for they were given me with some silver as i told you as a perquisite being what my lady had about her when she died and as i hope for no wages i am so vain as to think i have deserved all that money in the fourteen months since my ladys death for she good soul overpaid me before in learning and other kindnesses had she lived none of these things might have happened but i ought to be thankful tis no worse every thing will turn about for the best thats my confidence so as i was saying i have provided a new and more suitable dress and i long to appear in it more than ever i did in any new clothes in my life for then i shall be soon after with you and at ease in my mind but mum here he comes i believe i am etc letter xxi my dear father and mother i was forced to break off for i feared my master was coming but it proved to be only mrs jervis she said i cant endure you should be so much by yourself pamela and i said i dread nothing so much as company for my heart was up at my mouth now for fear my master was coming but i always rejoice to see dear mrs jervis said she i have had a world of talk with my master about you i am sorry for it said i that i am made of so much consequence as to be talked of by him o said she i must not tell you all but you are of more consequence to him than you think for or wish for said i for the fruits of being of consequence to him would make me of none to myself or any body else said she thou art as witty as any lady in the land i wonder where thou gottest it but they must be poor ladies with such great opportunities i am sure if they have no more wit than i but let that pass i suppose said i that i am of so much consequence however as to vex him if it be but to think he cant make a fool of such a one as i and that is nothing at all but a rebuke to the pride of his high condition which he did not expect and knows not how to put up with there is something in that may be said she but indeed pamela he is very angry with you too and calls you twenty perverse things wonders at his own folly to have shewn you so much favour as he calls it which he was first inclined to he says for his mothers sake and would have persisted to shew you for your own if you was not your own enemy nay now i shant love you mrs jervis said i you are going to persuade me to ask to stay though you know the hazards i run no said she he says you shall go for he thinks it wont be for his reputation to keep you but he wished dont speak of it for the world pamela that he knew a lady of birth just such another as yourself in person and mind and he would marry her tomorrow i coloured up to the ears at this word but said yet if i was the lady of birth and he would offer to be rude first as he has twice done to poor me i dont know whether i would have him for she that can bear an insult of that kind i should think not worthy to be a gentlemans wife any more than he would be a gentleman that would offer it nay now pamela said she thou carriest thy notions a great way well dear mrs jervis said i very seriously for i could not help it i am more full of fears than ever i have only to beg of you as one of the best friends i have in the world to say nothing of my asking to stay to say my master likes me when i know what end he aims at is abomination to my ears and i shant think myself safe till i am at my poor fathers and mothers she was a little angry with me till i assured her that i had not the least uneasiness on her account but thought myself safe under her protection and friendship and so we dropt the discourse for that time i hope to have finished this ugly waistcoat in two days after which i have only some linen to get up and shall then let you know how i contrive as to my passage for the heavy rains will make it sad travelling on foot but may be i may get a place to which is ten miles of the way in farmer nicholss close cart for i cant sit a horse well at all and may be nobody will be suffered to see me on upon the way but i hope to let you know more from etc letter xxii my dear father and mother all my fellowservants have now some notion that i am to go away but cant imagine for what mrs jervis tells them that my father and mother growing in years cannot live without me and so i go home to them to help to comfort their old age but they seem not to believe it what they found it out by was the butler heard him say to me as i passed by him in the entry leading to the hall whos that pamela sir said i pamela said he how long are you to stay here only please your honour said i till i have done the waistcoat and it is almost finished you might says he very roughly indeed have finished that long enough ago i should have thought indeed and please your honour said i i have worked early and late upon it there is a great deal of work in it work in it said he you mind your pen more than your needle i dont want such idle sluts to stay in my house he seemed startled when he saw the butler as he entered the hall where mr jonathan stood what do you here said he the butler was as much confounded as i for never having been taxed so roughly i could not help crying sadly and got out of both their ways to mrs jervis and told my complaint this love said she is the d in how many strange shapes does it make people shew themselves and in some the farthest from their hearts so one and then another has been since whispering pray mrs jervis are we to lose mrs pamela as they always call me what has she done and she tells them as above about going home to you she said afterwards to me well pamela you have made our master from the sweetest tempered gentleman in the world one of the most peevish but you have it in your power to make him as sweettempered as ever though i hope youll never do it on his terms this was very good in mrs jervis but it intimated that she thought as ill of his designs as i and as she knew his mind more than i it convinced me that i ought to get away as fast as i could my master came in just now to speak to mrs jervis about household matters having some company to dine with him tomorrow and i stood up and having been crying at his roughness in the entry i turned away my face you may well said he turn away your cursed face i wish i had never seen it mrs jervis how long is she to be about this waistcoat sir said i if your honour had pleased i would have taken it with me and though it would be now finished in a few hours i will do so still and remove this hated poor pamela out of your house and sight for ever mrs jervis said he not speaking to me i believe this little slut has the power of witchcraft if ever there was a witch for she enchants all that come near her she makes even you who should know better what the world is think her an angel of light i offered to go away for i believe he wanted me to ask to stay in my place for all this his great wrath and he said stay here stay here when i bid you and snatched my hand i trembled and said i will i will for he hurt my fingers he grasped me so hard he seemed to have a mind to say something to me but broke off abruptly and said begone and away i tripped as fast as i could and he and mrs jervis had a deal of talk as she told me and among the rest he expressed himself vexed to have spoken in mr jonathans hearing now you must know that mr jonathan our butler is a very grave good sort of old man with his hair as white as silver and an honest worthy man he is i was hurrying out with a flea in my ear as the saying is and going down stairs into the parlour met him he took hold of my hand in a gentler manner though than my master with both his and he said ah sweet sweet mrs pamela what is it i heard but just now i am sorry at my heart but i am sure i will sooner believe any body in fault than you thank you mr jonathan said i but as you value your place dont be seen speaking to such a one as me i cried too and slipt away as fast as i could from him for his own sake lest he should be seen to pity me and now i will give you an instance how much i am in mr longmans esteem also i had lost my pen some how and my paper being written out i stepped to mr longmans our stewards office to beg him to give me a pen or two and a sheet or two of paper he said ay that i will my sweet maiden and gave me three pens some wafers a stick of wax and twelve sheets of paper and coming from his desk where he was writing he said let me have a word or two with you my sweet little mistress for so these two good old gentlemen often call me for i believe they love me dearly i hear bad news that we are going to lose you i hope it is not true yes it is sir said i but i was in hopes it would not be known till i went away what a d l said he ails our master of late i never saw such an alteration in any man in my life he is pleased with nobody as i see and by what mr jonathan tells me just now he was quite out of the way with you what could you have done to him tro only mrs jervis is a very good woman or i should have feared she had been your enemy no said i nothing like it mrs jervis is a just good woman and next to my father and mother the best friend i have in the world well then said he it must be worse shall i guess you are too pretty my sweet mistress and may be too virtuous ah have i not hit it no good mr longman said i dont think any thing amiss of my master he is cross and angry with me indeed thats true but i may have given occasion for it possibly and because i am desirous to go to my father and mother rather than stay here perhaps he may think me ungrateful but you know sir said i that a father and mothers comfort is the dearest thing to a good child that can be sweet excellence said he this becomes you but i know the world and mankind too well though i must hear and see and say nothing and so a blessing attend my little sweeting said he wherever you go and away went i with a courtesy and thanks now this pleases one my dear father and mother to be so beloved how much better by good fame and integrity is it to get every ones good word but one than by pleasing that one to make every one else ones enemy and be an execrable creature besides i am etc letter xxiii my dear father and mother we had a great many neighbouring gentlemen and their ladies this day at dinner and my master made a fine entertainment for them and isaac and mr jonathan and benjamin waited at table and isaac tells mrs jervis that the ladies will by and by come to see the house and have the curiosity to see me for it seems they said to my master when the jokes flew about well mr b we understand you have a servantmaid who is the greatest beauty in the county and we promise ourselves to see her before we go the wench is well enough said he but no such beauty as you talk of ill assure ye she was my mothers waitingmaid who on her deathbed engaged me to be kind to her she is young and every thing is pretty that is young ay ay said one of the ladies thats true but if your mother had not recommended her so strongly there is so much merit in beauty that i make no doubt such a fine gentleman would have wanted no inducement to be kind to it they all laughed at my master and he it seems laughed for company but said i dont know how it is but i see with different eyes from other people for i have heard much more talk of her prettiness than i think it deserves she is well enough as i said but her greatest excellence is that she is humble and courteous and faithful and makes all her fellowservants love her my housekeeper in particular doats upon her and you know ladies she is a woman of discernment and as for mr longman and jonathan here if they thought themselves young enough i am told they would fight for her is it not true jonathan troth sir said he ant please your honour i never knew her peer and all your honours family are of the same mind do you hear now said my master well said the ladies we will make a visit to mrs jervis by and by and hope to see this paragon i believe they are coming and will tell you the rest by and by i wish they had come and were gone why cant they make their game without me well these fine ladies have been here and are gone back again i would have been absent if i could and did step into the closet so they saw me when they came in there were four of them lady arthur at the great white house on the hill lady brooks lady towers and the other it seems a countess of some hard name i forget what so mrs jervis says one of the ladies how do you do we are all come to inquire after your health i am much obliged to your ladyships said mrs jervis will your ladyships please to sit down but said the countess we are not only come to ask after mrs jerviss health neither but we are come to see a rarity besides ah says lady arthur i have not seen your pamela these two years and they tell me she is grown wondrous pretty in that time then i wished i had not been in the closet for when i came out they must needs know i heard them but i have often found that bashful bodies owe themselves a spite and frequently confound themselves more by endeavouring to avoid confusion why yes says mrs jervis pamela is very pretty indeed shes but in the closet there pamela pray step hither i came out all covered with blushes and they smiled at one another the countess took me by the hand why indeed she was pleased to say report has not been too lavish ill assure you dont be ashamed child and stared full in my face i wish i had just such a face to be ashamed of o how like a fool i looked lady arthur said ay my good pamela i say as her ladyship says dont be so confused though indeed it becomes you too i think your good lady departed made a sweet choice of such a pretty attendant she would have been mighty proud of you as she always was praising you had she lived till now ah madam said lady brooks do you think that so dutiful a son as our neighbour who always admired what his mother loved does not pride himself for all what he said at table in such a pretty maiden she looked with such a malicious sneering countenance i cant abide her lady towers said with a free air for it seems she is called a wit well mrs pamela i cant say i like you so well as these ladies do for i should never care if you were my servant to have you and your master in the same house together then they all set up a great laugh i know what i could have said if i durst but they are ladies and ladies may say any thing says lady towers can the pretty image speak mrs jervis i vow she has speaking eyes o you little rogue said she and tapped me on the cheek you seem born to undo or to be undone god forbid and please your ladyship said i it should be either i beg said i to withdraw for the sense i have of my unworthiness renders me unfit for such a presence i then went away with one of my best courtesies and lady towers said as i went out prettily said i vow and lady brooks said see that shape i never saw such a face and shape in my life why she must be better descended than you have told me and so they run on for half an hour more in my praises as i was told and glad was i when i got out of the hearing of them but it seems they went down with such a story to my master and so full of me that he had much ado to stand it but as it was very little to my reputation i am sure i could take no pride in it and i feared it would make no better for me this gives me another cause for wishing myself out of this house this is thursday morning and next thursday i hope to set out for i have finished my task and my master is horrid cross and i am vexed his crossness affects me so if ever he had any kindness towards me i believe he now hates me heartily is it not strange that love borders so much upon hate but this wicked love is not like the true virtuous love to be sure that and hatred must be as far off as light and darkness and how must this hate have been increased if he had met with such a base compliance after his wicked will had been gratified well one may see by a little what a great deal means for if innocence cannot attract common civility what must guilt expect when novelty has ceased to have its charms and changeableness had taken place of it thus we read in holy writ that wicked amnon when he had ruined poor tamar hated her more than he ever loved her and would have turned her out of door how happy am i to be turned out of door with that sweet companion my innocence o may that be always my companion and while i presume not upon my own strength and am willing to avoid the tempter i hope the divine grace will assist me forgive me that i repeat in my letter part of my hourly prayer i owe every thing next to gods goodness to your piety and good examples my dear parents my dear poor parents i say that word with pleasure for your poverty is my pride as your integrity shall he my imitation as soon as i have dined i will put on my new clothes i long to have them on i know i shall surprise mrs jervis with them for she shant see me till i am full dressed john is come back and ill soon send you some of what i have written i find he is going early in the morning and so ill close here that i am your most dutiful daughter dont lose your time in meeting me because i am so uncertain it is hard if some how or other i cant get a passage to you but may be my master wont refuse to let john bring me i can ride behind him i believe well enough for he is very careful and very honest and you know john as well as i for he loves you both besides may be mrs jervis can put me in some way letter xxiv dear father and mother i shall write on as long as i stay though i should have nothing but silliness to write for i know you divert yourselves on nights with what i write because it is mine john tells me how much you long for my coming but he says he told you he hoped something would happen to hinder it i am glad you did not tell him the occasion of my coming away for if my fellowservants should guess it were better so than to have it from you or me besides i really am concerned that my master should cast away a thought upon such a poor creature as me for besides the disgrace it has quite turned his temper and i begin to believe what mrs jervis told me that he likes me and cant help it and yet strives to conquer it and so finds no way but to be cross to me dont think me presumptuous and conceited for it is more my concern than my pride to see such a gentleman so demean himself and lessen the regard he used to have in the eyes of all his servants on my account but i am to tell you of my new dress to day and so when i had dined up stairs i went and locked myself into my little room there i tricked myself up as well as i could in my new garb and put on my roundeared ordinary cap but with a green knot however and my homespun gown and petticoat and plain leather shoes but yet they are what they call spanish leather and my ordinary hose ordinary i mean to what i have been lately used to though i shall think good yarn may do very well for every day when i come home a plain muslin tucker i put on and my black silk necklace instead of the french necklace my lady gave me and put the earrings out of my ears and when i was quite equipped i took my straw hat in my hand with its two blue strings and looked about me in the glass as proud as any thing to say truth i never liked myself so well in my life o the pleasure of descending with ease innocence and resignation indeed there is nothing like it an humble mind i plainly see cannot meet with any very shocking disappointment let fortunes wheel turn round as it will so i went down to look for mrs jervis to see how she liked me i met as i was upon the stairs our rachel who is the housemaid and she made me a low courtesy and i found did not know me so i smiled and went to the housekeepers parlour and there sat good mrs jervis at work making a shift and would you believe it she did not know me at first but rose up and pulled off her spectacles and said do you want me forsooth i could not help laughing and said heyday mrs jervis what dont you know me she stood all in amaze and looked at me from top to toe why you surprise me said she what pamela thus metamorphosed how came this about as it happened in stept my master and my back being to him he thought it was a stranger speaking to mrs jervis and withdrew again and did not hear her ask if his honour had any commands for her she turned me about and about and i shewed her all my dress to my underpetticoat and she said sitting down why i am all in amaze i must sit down what can all this mean i told her i had no clothes suitable to my condition when i returned to my fathers and so it was better to begin here as i was soon to go away that all my fellowservants might see i knew how to suit myself to the state i was returning to well said she i never knew the like of thee but this sad preparation for going away for now i see you are quite in earnest is what i know not how to get over o my dear pamela how can i part with you my master rung in the backparlour and so i withdrew and mrs jervis went to attend him it seems he said to her i was coming in to let you know that i shall go to lincolnshire and possibly to my sister daverss and be absent some weeks but pray what pretty neat damsel was with you she says she smiled and asked if his honour did not know who it was no said he i never saw her before farmer nichols or farmer brady have neither of them such a tight prim lass for a daughter have they though i did not see her face neither said he if your honour wont be angry said she i will introduce her into your presence for i think says she she outdoes our pamela now i did not thank her for this as i told her afterwards for it brought a great deal of trouble upon me as well as crossness as you shall hear that cant be he was pleased to say but if you can find an excuse for it let her come in at that she stept to me and told me i must go in with her to her master but said she for goodness sake let him find you out for he dont know you o fie mrs jervis said i how could you serve me so besides it looks too free both in me and to him i tell you said she you shall come in and pray dont reveal yourself till he finds you out so i went in foolish as i was though i must have been seen by him another time if i had not then and she would make me take my straw hat in my hand i dropt a low courtesy but said never a word i dare say he knew me as soon as he saw my face but was as cunning as lucifer he came up to me and took me by the hand and said whose pretty maiden are you i dare say you are pamelas sister you are so like her so neat so clean so pretty why child you far surpass your sister pamela i was all confusion and would have spoken but he took me about the neck why said he you are very pretty child i would not be so free with your sister you may believe but i must kiss you o sir said i i am pamela indeed i am indeed i am pamela her own self he kissed me for all i could do and said impossible you are a lovelier girl by half than pamela and sure i may be innocently free with you though i would not do her so much favour this was a sad trick upon me indeed and what i could not expect and mrs jervis looked like a fool as much as i for her officiousness at last i got away and ran out of the parlour most sadly vexed as you may well think he talked a good deal to mrs jervis and at last ordered me to come in to him come in said he you little villain for so he called me good sirs what a name was there who is it you put your tricks upon i was resolved never to honour your unworthiness said he with so much notice again and so you must disguise yourself to attract me and yet pretend like an hypocrite as you are i was out of patience then hold good sir said i dont impute disguise and hypocrisy to me above all things for i hate them both mean as i am i have put on no disguise what a plague said he for that was his word do you mean then by this dress why and please your honour said i i mean one of the honestest things in the world i have been in disguise indeed ever since my good lady your mother took me from my poor parents i came to her ladyship so poor and mean that these clothes i have on are a princely suit to those i had then and her goodness heaped upon me rich clothes and other bounties and as i am now returning to my poor parents again so soon i cannot wear those good things without being hooted at and so have bought what will be more suitable to my degree and be a good holidaysuit too when i get home he then took me in his arms and presently pushed me from him mrs jervis said he take the little witch from me i can neither bear nor forbear her strange words these but stay you shant go yet begone no come back again i thought he was mad for my share for he knew not what he would have i was going however but he stept after me and took hold of my arm and brought me in again i am sure he made my arm black and blue for the marks are upon it still sir sir said i pray have mercy i will i will come in he sat down and looked at me and as i thought afterwards as sillily as such a poor girl as i at last he said well mrs jervis as i was telling you you may permit her to stay a little longer till i see if my sister davers will have her if mean time she humble herself and ask this as a favour and is sorry for her pertness and the liberty she has taken with my character out of the house and in the house your honour indeed told me so said mrs jervis but i never found her inclinable to think herself in a fault pride and perverseness said he with a vengeance yet this is your doatingpiece well for once ill submit myself to tell you hussy said he to me you may stay a fortnight longer till i see my sister davers do you hear what i say to you statue can you neither speak nor be thankful your honour frights me so said i that i can hardly speak but i will venture to say that i have only to beg as a favour that i may go to my father and mother why fool said he wont you like to go to wait on my sister davers sir said i i was once fond of that honour but you were pleased to say i might be in danger from her ladyships nephew or he from me dd impertinence said he do you hear mrs jervis do you hear how she retorts upon me was ever such matchless assurance i then fell a weeping for mrs jervis said fie pamela fie and i said my lot is very hard indeed i am sure i would hurt nobody and i have been it seems guilty of indiscretions which have cost me my place and my masters favour and so have been turned her away and when the time is come that i should return to my poor parents i am not suffered to go quietly good your honour what have i done that i must be used worse than if i had robbed you robbed me said he why so you have hussy you have robbed me who i sir said i have i robbed you why then you are a justice of peace and may send me to gaol if you please and bring me to a trial for my life if you can prove that i have robbed you i am sure i ought to die now i was quite ignorant of his meaning though i did not like it when it was afterwards explained neither and well thought i what will this come to at last if poor pamela is esteemed a thief then i thought in an instant how i should shew my face to my honest poor parents if i was but suspected but sir said i let me ask you but one question and pray dont let me be called names for it for i dont mean disrespectfully why if i have done amiss am i not left to be discharged by your housekeeper as the other maids have been and if jane or rachel or hannah were to offend would your honour stoop to take notice of them and why should you so demean yourself to take notice of me pray sir if i have not been worse than others why should i suffer more than others and why should i not be turned away and theres an end of it for indeed i am not of consequence enough for my master to concern himself and be angry about such a creature as me do you hear mrs jervis cried he again how pertly i am interrogated by this saucy slut why saucebox says he did not my good mother desire me to take care of you and have you not been always distinguished by me above a common servant and does your ingratitude upbraid me for this i said something mutteringly and he vowed he would hear it i begged excuse but he insisted upon it why then said i if your honour must know i said that my good lady did not desire your care to extend to the summerhouse and her dressingroom well this was a little saucy youll say and he flew into such a passion that i was forced to run for it and mrs jervis said it was happy i got out of the way why what makes him provoke one so then im almost sorry for it but i would be glad to get away at any rate for i begin to be more fearful now just now mr jonathan sent me these lines bless me what shall i do dear mrs pamela take care of yourself for rachel heard my master say to mrs jervis who she believes was pleading for you say no more mrs jervis for by g d i will have her burn this instantly o pray for your poor daughter i am called to go to bed by mrs jervis for it is past eleven and i am sure she shall hear of it for all this is owing to her though she did not mean any harm but i have been and am in a strange fluster and i suppose too shell say i have been full pert o my dear father and mother power and riches never want advocates but poor gentlewoman she cannot live without him and he has been very good to her so good night may be i shall send this in the morning but may be not so wont conclude though i cant say too often that i am though with great apprehension your most dutiful daughter letter xxv my dear parents o let me take up my complaint and say never was poor creature so unhappy and so barbarously used as poor pamela indeed my dear father and mother my hearts just broke i can neither write as i should do nor let it alone for to whom but you can i vent my griefs and keep my poor heart from bursting wicked wicked man i have no patience when i think of him but yet dont be frightened for i hope i hope i am honest but if my head and my hand will let me you shall hear all is there no constable nor headborough though to take me out of his house for i am sure i can safely swear the peace against him but alas he is greater than any constable he is a justice himself such a justice deliver me from but god almighty i hope in time will right me for he knows the innocence of my heart john went your way in the morning but i have been too much distracted to send by him and have seen nobody but mrs jervis or rachel and one i hate to see or be seen by and indeed i hate now to see any body strange things i have to tell you that happened since last night that good mr jonathans letter and my masters harshness put me into such a fluster but i will not keep you in suspense i went to mrs jerviss chamber and o dreadful my wicked master had hid himself base gentleman as he is in her closet where she has a few books and chest of drawers and such like i little suspected it though i used till this sad night always to look into that closet and another in the room and under the bed ever since the summerhouse trick but never found any thing and so i did not do it then being fully resolved to be angry with mrs jervis for what had happened in the day and so thought of nothing else i sat myself down on one side of the bed and she on the other and we began to undress ourselves but she on that side next the wicked closet that held the worst heart in the world so said mrs jervis you wont speak to me pamela i find you are angry with me why mrs jervis said i so i am a little tis a folly to deny it you see what i have suffered by your forcing me in to my master and a gentlewoman of your years and experience must needs know that it was not fit for me to pretend to be any body else for my own sake nor with regard to my master but said she who would have thought it would have turned out so ay said i little thinking who heard me lucifer always is ready to promote his own work and workmen you see presently what use he made of it pretending not to know me on purpose to be free with me and when he took upon himself to know me to quarrel with me and use me hardly and you too said i to cry fie fie pamela cut me to the heart for that encouraged him do you think my dear said she that i would encourage him i never said so to you before but since you have forced it from me i must tell you that ever since you consulted me i have used my utmost endeavours to divert him from his wicked purposes and he has promised fair but to say all in a word he doats upon you and i begin to see it is not in his power to help it i luckily said nothing of the note from mr jonathan for i began to suspect all the world almost but i said to try mrs jervis well then what would you have me do you see he is for having me wait on lady davers now why ill tell you freely my dear pamela said she and i trust to your discretion to conceal what i say my master has been often desiring me to put you upon asking him to let you stay yes said i mrs jervis let me interrupt you i will tell you why i could not think of that it was not the pride of my heart but the pride of my honesty for what must have been the case here my master has been very rude to me once and twice and you say he cannot help it though he pretends to be sorry for it well he has given me warning to leave my place and uses me very harshly perhaps to frighten me to his purposes as he supposes i would be fond of staying as indeed i should if i could be safe for i love you and all the house and value him if he would act as my master well then as i know his designs and that he owns he cannot help it must i have asked to stay knowing he would attempt me again for all you could assure me of was he would do nothing by force so i a poor weak girl was to be left to my own strength and was not this to allow him to tempt me as one may say and to encourage him to go on in his wicked devices how then mrs jervis could i ask or wish to stay you say well my dear child says she and you have a justness of thought above your years and for all these considerations and for what i have heard this day after you ran away and i am glad you went as you did i cannot persuade you to stay and i shall be glad which is what i never thought i could have said that you were well at your fathers for if lady davers will entertain you she may as well have you from thence as here theres my good mrs jervis said i god will bless you for your good counsel to a poor maiden that is hard beset but pray what did he say when i was gone why says she he was very angry with you but he would hear it said i i think it was a little bold but then he provoked me to it and had not my honesty been in the case i would not by any means have been so saucy besides mrs jervis consider it was the truth if he does not love to hear of the summer house and the dressingroom why should he not be ashamed to continue in the same mind but said she when you had muttered this to yourself you might have told him any thing else well said i i cannot tell a wilful lie and so theres an end of it but i find you now give him up and think theres danger in staying lord bless me i wish i was well out of the house so it was at the bottom of a wet ditch on the wildest common in england why said she it signifies nothing to tell you all he said but it was enough to make me fear you would not be so safe as i could wish and upon my word pamela i dont wonder he loves you for without flattery you are a charming girl and i never saw you look more lovely in your life than in that same new dress of yours and then it was such a surprise upon us all i believe truly you owe some of your danger to the lovely appearance you made then said i i wish the clothes in the fire i expected no effect from them but if any a quite contrary one hush said i mrs jervis did you not hear something stir in the closet no silly girl said she your fears are always awake but indeed said i i think i heard something rustle may be says she the cat may be got there but i hear nothing i was hush but she said prythee my good girl make haste to bed see if the door be fast so i did and was thinking to look into the closet but hearing no more noise thought it needless and so went again and sat myself down on the bedside and went on undressing myself and mrs jervis being by this time undressed stepped into bed and bid me hasten for she was sleepy i dont know what was the matter but my heart sadly misgave me indeed mr jonathans note was enough to make it do so with what mrs jervis had said i pulled off my stays and my stockings and all my clothes to an underpetticoat and then hearing a rustling again in the closet i said heaven protect us but before i say my prayers i must look into this closet and so was going to it slipshod when o dreadful out rushed my master in a rich silk and silver morning gown i screamed and ran to the bed and mrs jervis screamed too and he said ill do you no harm if you forbear this noise but otherwise take what follows instantly he came to the bed for i had crept into it to mrs jervis with my coat on and my shoes and taking me in his arms said mrs jervis rise and just step up stairs to keep the maids from coming down at this noise ill do no harm to this rebel o for heavens sake for pitys sake mrs jervis said i if i am not betrayed dont leave me and i beseech you raise all the house no said mrs jervis i will not stir my dear lamb i will not leave you i wonder at you sir said she and kindly threw herself upon my coat clasping me round the waist you shall not hurt this innocent said she for i will lose my life in her defence are there not said she enough wicked ones in the world for your base purpose but you must attempt such a lamb as this he was desperate angry and threatened to throw her out of the window and to turn her out of the house the next morning you need not sir said she for i will not stay in it god defend my poor pamela till to morrow and we will both go together says he let me but expostulate a word or two with you pamela pray pamela said mrs jervis dont hear a word except he leaves the bed and goes to the other end of the room ay out of the room said i expostulate tomorrow if you must expostulate i found his hand in my bosom and when my fright let me know it i was ready to die and i sighed and screamed and fainted away and still he had his arms about my neck and mrs jervis was about my feet and upon my coat and all in a cold dewy sweat was i pamela pamela said mrs jervis as she tells me since o h and gave another shriek my poor pamela is dead for certain and so to be sure i was for a time for i knew nothing more of the matter one fit following another till about three hours after as it proved to be i found myself in bed and mrs jervis sitting upon one side with her wrapper about her and rachel on the other and no master for the wicked wretch was gone but i was so overjoyed that i hardly could believe myself and i said which were my first words mrs jervis mrs rachel can i be sure it is you tell me can i where have i been hush my dear said mrs jervis you have been in fit after fit i never saw any body so frightful in my life by this i judged rachel knew nothing of the matter and it seems my wicked master had upon mrs jerviss second noise on my fainting away slipt out and as if he had come from his own chamber disturbed by the screaming went up to the maids room who hearing the noise lay trembling and afraid to stir and bid them go down and see what was the matter with mrs jervis and me and he charged mrs jervis and promised to forgive her for what she had said and done if she would conceal the matter so the maids came down and all went up again when i came to myself a little except rachel who staid to sit up with me and bear mrs jervis company i believe they all guess the matter to be bad enough though they dare not say any thing when i think of my danger and the freedoms he actually took though i believe mrs jervis saved me from worse and she said she did though what can i think who was in a fit and knew nothing of the matter i am almost distracted at first i was afraid of mrs jervis but i am fully satisfied she is very good and i should have been lost but for her and she takes on grievously about it what would have become of me had she gone out of the room to still the maids as he bid her hed certainly have shut her out and then mercy on me what would have become of your poor pamela i must leave off a little for my eyes and my head are sadly bad this was a dreadful trial this was the worst of all oh that i was out of the power of this dreadfully wicked man pray for your distressed daughter letter xxvi my dear father and mother i did not rise till ten oclock and i had all the concerns and wishes of the family and multitudes of inquiries about me my wicked master went out early to hunt but left word he would be in to breakfast and so he was he came up to our chamber about eleven and had nothing to do to be sorry for he was our master and so put on sharp anger at first i had great emotions at his entering the room and threw my apron over my head and fell a crying as if my heart would break mrs jervis said he since i know you and you me so well i dont know how we shall live together for the future sir said she i will take the liberty to say what i think is best for both i have so much grief that you should attempt to do any injury to this poor girl and especially in my chamber that i should think myself accessary to the mischief if i was not to take notice of it though my ruin therefore may depend upon it i desire not to stay but pray let poor pamela and me go together with all my heart said he and the sooner the better she fell a crying i find says he this girl has made a party of the whole house in her favour against me her innocence deserves it of us all said she very kindly and i never could have thought that the son of my dear good lady departed could have so forfeited his honour as to endeavour to destroy a virtue he ought to protect no more of this mrs jervis said he i will not hear it as for pamela she has a lucky knack of falling into fits when she pleases but the cursed yellings of you both made me not myself i intended no harm to her as i told you both if youd have left your squallings and i did no harm neither but to myself for i raised a hornets nest about my ears that as far as i know may have stung to death my reputation sir said mrs jervis then i beg mr longman may take my accounts and i will go away as soon as i can as for pamela she is at her liberty i hope to go away next thursday as she intends i sat still for i could not speak nor look up and his presence discomposed me extremely but i was sorry to hear myself the unhappy occasion of mrs jerviss losing her place and hope that may be still made up well said he let mr longman make up your accounts as soon as you will and mrs jewkes who is his housekeeper in lincolnshire shall come hither in your place and wont be less obliging i dare say than you have been said she i have never disobliged you till now and let me tell you sir if you knew what belonged to your own reputation or honour no more no more said he of these antiquated topics i have been no bad friend to you and i shall always esteem you though you have not been so faithful to my secrets as i could have wished and have laid me open to this girl which has made her more afraid of me than she had occasion well sir said she after what passed yesterday and last night i think i went rather too far in favour of your injunctions than otherwise and i should have deserved every bodys censure as the basest of creatures had i been capable of contributing to your lawless attempts still mrs jervis still reflecting upon me and all for imaginary faults for what harm have i done the girl i wont bear it ill assure you but yet in respect to my mother i am willing to part friendly with you though you ought both of you to reflect on the freedom of your conversation in relation to me which i should have resented more than i do but that i am conscious i had no business to demean myself so as to be in your closet where i might have expected to hear a multitude of impertinence between you well sir said she you have no objection i hope to pamelas going away on thursday next you are mighty solicitous said he about pamela but no not i let her go as soon as she will she is a naughty girl and has brought all this upon herself and upon me more trouble than she can have had from me but i have overcome it all and will never concern myself about her i have a proposal made me added he since i have been out this morning that i shall go near to embrace and so wish only that a discreet use may be made of what is past and theres an end of every thing with me as to pamela ill assure you i clasped my hands together through my apron overjoyed at this though i was soon to go away for naughty as he has been to me i wish his prosperity with all my heart for my good old ladys sake well pamela said he you need not now be afraid to speak to me tell me what you lifted up your hands at i said not a word says he if you like what i have said give me your hand upon it i held my hand up through my apron for i could not speak to him and he took hold of it and pressed it though less hard than he did my arm the day before what does the little fool cover her face for said he pull your apron away and let me see how you look after your freedom of speech of me last night no wonder you are ashamed to see me you know you were very free with my character i could not stand this barbarous insult as i took it to be considering his behaviour to me and i then spoke and said o the difference between the minds of thy creatures good god how shall some be cast down in their innocence while others can triumph in their guilt and so saying i went up stairs to my chamber and wrote all this for though he vexed me at his taunting yet i was pleased to hear he was likely to be married and that his wicked intentions were so happily overcome as to me and this made me a little easier and i hope i have passed the worst or else it is very hard and yet i shant think myself at ease quite till i am with you for methinks after all his repentance and amendment are mighty suddenly resolved upon but the divine grace is not confined to space and remorse may and i hope has smitten him to the heart at once for his injuries to poor me yet i wont be too secure neither having opportunity i send now what i know will grieve you to the heart but i hope i shall bring my next scribble myself and so conclude though half brokenhearted your ever dutiful daughter letter xxvii dear father and mother i am glad i desired you not to meet me and john says you wont for he told you he is sure i shall get a passage well enough either behind some one of my fellowservants on horseback or by farmer nicholss means but as to the chariot he talked to you of i cant expect that favour to be sure and i should not care for it because it would look so much above me but farmer brady they say has a chaise with one horse and we hope to borrow that or hire it rather than fail though money runs a little lowish after what i have laid out but i dont care to say so here though i warrant i might have what i would of mrs jervis or mr jonathan or mr longman but then how shall i pay it youll say and besides i dont love to be beholden but the chief reason im glad you dont set out to meet me is the uncertainty for it seems i must stay another week still and hope certainly to go thursday after for poor mrs jervis will go at the same time she says and cant be ready before oh that i was once well with you though he is very civil too at present and not so cross as he was and yet he is as vexatious another way as you shall hear for yesterday he had a rich suit of clothes brought home which they call a birthday suit for he intends to go to london against next birthday to see the court and our folks will have it he is to be made a lord i wish they may make him an honest man as he was always thought but i have not found it so alas for me and so as i was saying he had these clothes come home and he tried them on and before he pulled them off he sent for me when nobody else was in the parlour with him pamela said he you are so neat and so nice in your own dress alackaday i didnt know i was that you must be a judge of ours how are these clothes made do they fit me i am no judge said i and please your honour but i think they look very fine his waistcoat stood on end with silver lace and he looked very grand but what he did last has made me very serious and i could make him no compliments said he why dont you wear your usual clothes though i think every thing looks well upon you for i still continue in my new dress i said i have no clothes sir i ought to call my own but these and it is no matter what such an one as i wears said he why you look very serious pamela i see you can bear malice yes so i can sir said i according to the occasion why said he your eyes always look red i think are you not a fool to take my last freedom so much to heart i am sure you and that fool mrs jervis frightened me by your hideous squalling as much as i could frighten you that is all we had for it said i and if you could be so afraid of your own servants knowing of your attempts upon a poor unworthy creature that is under your protection while i stay surely your honour ought to be more afraid of god almighty in whose presence we all stand in every action of our lives and to whom the greatest as well as the least must be accountable let them think what they list he took my hand in a kind of goodhumoured mockery and said well urged my pretty preacher when my lincolnshire chaplain dies ill put thee on a gown and cassock and thoult make a good figure in his place i wish said i a little vexed at his jeer your honours conscience would be your preacher and then you would need no other chaplain well well pamela said he no more of this unfashionable jargon i did not send for you so much for your opinion of my new suit as to tell you you are welcome to stay since mrs jervis desires it till she goes i welcome said i i am sure i shall rejoice when i am out of the house well said he you are an ungrateful baggage but i am thinking it would be pity with these fair soft hands and that lovely skin as he called it and took hold of my hand that you should return again to hard work as you must if you go to your fathers and so i would advise her to take a house in london and let lodgings to us members of parliament when we come to town and such a pretty daughter as you may pass for will always fill her house and shell get a great deal of money i was sadly vexed at this barbarous joke but being ready to cry before the tears gushed out and endeavouring to get my hand from him but in vain i said i can expect no better your behaviour sir to me has been just of a piece with these words nay i will say it though you were to be ever so angry i angry pamela no no said he i have overcome all that and as you are to go away i look upon you now as mrs jerviss guest while you both stay and not as my servant and so you may say what you will but ill tell you pamela why you need not take this matter in such high disdain you have a very pretty romantic turn for virtue and all that and i dont suppose but youll hold it still and nobody will be able to prevail upon you but my child sneeringly he spoke it do but consider what a fine opportunity you will then have for a tale every day to good mother jervis and what subjects for letter writing to your father and mother and what pretty preachments you may hold forth to the young gentlemen ads my heart i think it would be the best thing you and she could do you do well sir said i to even your wit to such a poor maiden as me but permit me to say that if you was not rich and great and i poor and little you would not insult me thus let me ask you sir if you think this becomes your fine clothes and a masters station why so serious my pretty pamela said he why so grave and would kiss me but my heart was full and i said let me alone i will tell you if you was a king and insulted me as you have done that you have forgotten to act like a gentleman and i wont stay to be used thus i will go to the next farmers and there wait for mrs jervis if she must go and id have you know sir that i can stoop to the ordinariest work of your scullions for all these nasty soft hands sooner than bear such ungentlemanly imputations i sent for you said he in high good humour but it is impossible to hold it with such an impertinent however ill keep my temper but while i see you here pray dont put on those dismal grave looks why girl you should forbear them if it were but for your pridesake for the family will think you are grieving to leave the house then sir said i i will try to convince them of the contrary as well as your honour for i will endeavour to be more cheerful while i stay for that very reason well replied he i will set this down by itself as the first time that ever what i had advised had any weight with you and i will add said i as the first advice you have given me of late that was fit to be followed i wish said he i am almost ashamed to write it impudent gentleman as he is i wish i had thee as quick another way as thou art in thy repartees and he laughed and i snatched my hand from him and i tripped away as fast as i could ah thought i married i am sure it is time you were married or at this rate no honest maiden ought to live with you why dear father and mother to be sure he grows quite a rake how easy it is to go from bad to worse when once people give way to vice how would my poor lady had she lived have grieved to see it but may be he would have been better then though it seems he told mrs jervis he had an eye upon me in his mothers lifetime and he intended to let me know as much by the bye he told her here is shamelessness for you sure the world must be near at an end for all the gentlemen about are as bad as he almost as far as i can hear and see the fruits of such bad examples there is squire martin in the grove has had three lyingsin it seems in his house in three months past one by himself and one by his coachman and one by his woodman and yet he has turned none of them away indeed how can he when they but follow his own vile example there is he and two or three more such as he within ten miles of us who keep company and hunt with our fine master truly and i suppose he is never the better for their examples but heaven bless me say i and send me out of this wicked house but dear father and mother what sort of creatures must the womenkind be do you think to give way to such wickedness why this it is that makes every one be thought of alike and alackaday what a world we live in for it is grown more a wonder that the men are resisted than that the women comply this i suppose makes me such a saucebox and boldface and a creature and all because i wont be a saucebox and boldface indeed but i am sorry for these things one dont know what arts and stratagems men may devise to gain their vile ends and so i will think as well as i can of these poor undone creatures and pity them for you see by my sad story and narrow escapes what hardships poor maidens go through whose lot it is to go out to service especially to houses where there is not the fear of god and good rule kept by the heads of the family you see i am quite grown grave and serious indeed it becomes the present condition of your dutiful daughter letter xxviii dear father and mother john says you wept when you read my last letter that he carried i am sorry you let him see that for they all mistrust already how matters are and as it is no credit that i have been attempted though it is that i have resisted yet i am sorry they have cause to think so evil of my master from any of us mrs jervis has made up her accounts with mr longman and will stay in her place i am glad of it for her own sake and for my masters for she has a good master of him so indeed all have but poor me and he has a good housekeeper in her mr longman it seems took upon him to talk to my master how faithful and careful of his interests she was and how exact in her accounts and he told him there was no comparison between her accounts and mrs jewkess at the lincolnshire estate he said so many fine things it seems of mrs jervis that my master sent for her in mr longmans presence and said pamela might come along with her i suppose to mortify me that i must go while she was to stay but as when i go away i am not to go with her nor was she to go with me so i did not matter it much only it would have been creditable to such a poor girl that the housekeeper would bear me company if i went said he to her well mrs jervis longman says you have made up your accounts with him with your usual fidelity and exactness i had a good mind to make you an offer of continuing with me if you can be a little sorry for your hasty words which indeed were not so respectful as i have deserved at your hands she seemed at a sad loss what to say because mr longman was there and she could not speak of the occasion of those words which was me indeed said mr longman i must needs say before your face that since i have known my masters family i have never found such good management in it nor so much love and harmony neither i wish the lincolnshire estate was as well served no more of that said my master but mrs jervis may stay if she will and here mrs jervis pray accept of this which at the close of every years accounts i will present you with besides your salary as long as i find your care so useful and agreeable and he gave her five guineas she made him a low courtesy and thanking him looked to me as if she would have spoken to me he took her meaning i believe for he said indeed i love to encourage merit and obligingness longman but i can never be equally kind to those who dont deserve it at my hands as to those who do and then he looked full on me longman continued he i said that girl might come in with mrs jervis because they love to be always together for mrs jervis is very good to her and loves her as well as if she was her daughter but else mr longman interrupting him said good to mrs pamela ay sir and so she is to be sure but every body must be good to her for he was going on but my master said no more no more mr longman i see old men are taken with pretty young girls as well as other folks and fair looks hide many a fault where a person has the art to behave obligingly why and please your honour said mr longman every body and was going on i believe to say something more in my praise but he interrupted him and said not a word more of this pamela i cant let her stay ill assure you not only for her own freedom of speech but her letterwriting of all the secrets of my family ay said the good old man i am sorry for that too but sir no more i say said my master for my reputation is so well known mighty fine thought i that i care not what any body writes or says of me but to tell you the truth not that it need go further i think of changing my condition soon and you know young ladies of birth and fortune will choose their own servants and thats my chief reason why pamela cant stay as for the rest said he the girl is a good sort of body take her altogether though i must needs say a little pert since my mothers death in her answers and gives me two words for one which i cant bear nor is there reason i should you know longman no to be sure sir said he but tis strange methinks she should be so mild and meek to every one of us in the house and forget herself so where she should shew most respect very true mr longman said he but so it is ill assure you and it was from her pertness that mrs jervis and i had the words and i should mind it the less but that the girl there she stands i say it to her face has wit and sense above her years and knows better i was in great pain to say something but yet i knew not what before mr longman and mrs jervis looked at me and walked to the window to hide her concern for me at last i said it is for you sir to say what you please and for me only to say god bless your honour poor mr longman faltered in his speech and was ready to cry said my insulting master to me why prythee pamela now shew thyself as thou art before longman canst not give him a specimen of that pertness which thou hast exercised upon me sometimes did he not my dear father and mother deserve all the truth to be told yet i overcame myself so far as to say well your honour may play upon a poor girl that you know call answer you but dare not why prythee now insinuator said he say the worst you can before longman and mrs jervis i challenge the utmost of thy impertinence and as you are going away and have the love of every body i would be a little justified to my family that you have no reason to complain of hardships from me as i have pert saucy answers from you besides exposing me by your letters surely sir said i i am of no consequence equal to this in your honours family that such a great gentleman as you should need to justify yourself about me i am glad mrs jervis stays with your honour and i know i have not deserved to stay and more than that i dont desire to stay adsbobbers said mr longman and ran to me dont say so dont say so dear mrs pamela we all love you dearly and pray down of your knees and ask his honour pardon and we will all become pleaders in a body and i and mrs jervis too at the head of it to beg his honours pardon and to continue you at least till his honour marries no mr longman said i i cannot ask nor will i stay if i might all i desire is to return to my poor father and mother and though i love you all i wont stay o welladay welladay said the good old man i did not expect this when i had got matters thus far and had made all up for mrs jervis i was in hopes to have got a double holiday of joy for all the family in your pardon too well said my master this is a little specimen of what i told you longman you see theres a spirit you did not expect mrs jervis told me after that she could stay no longer to hear me so hardly used and must have spoken had she staid what would never have been forgiven her so she went out i looked after her to go too but my master said come pamela give another specimen i desire you to longman i am sure you must if you will but speak well sir said i since it seems your greatness wants to be justified by my lowness and i have no desire you should suffer in the sight of your family i will say on my bended knees and so i kneeled down that i have been a very faulty and a very ungrateful creature to the best of masters i have been very perverse and saucy and have deserved nothing at your hands but to be turned out of your family with shame and disgrace i therefore have nothing to say for myself but that i am not worthy to stay and so cannot wish to stay and will not stay and so god almighty bless you and you mr longman and good mrs jervis and every living soul of the family and i will pray for you as long as i live and so i rose up and was forced to lean upon my masters elbowchair or i should have sunk down the poor old man wept more than i and said adsbobbers was ever the like heard tis too much too much i cant bear it as i hope to live i am quite melted dear sir forgive her the poor thing prays for you she prays for us all she owns her fault yet wont be forgiven i profess i know not what to make of it my master himself hardened wretch as he was seemed a little moved and took his handkerchief out of his pocket and walked to the window what sort of a day is it said he and then getting a little more hard heartedness he said well you may be gone from my presence thou strange medley of inconsistence but you shant stay after your time in the house nay pray sir pray sir said the good old man relent a little ads heartikins you young gentlemen are made of iron and steel i think im sure said he my hearts turned into butter and is running away at my eyes i never felt the like before said my master with an imperious tone get out of my presence hussy i cant bear you in my sight sir said i im going as fast as i can but indeed my dear father and mother my head was so giddy and my limbs trembled so that i was forced to go holding by the wainscot all the way with both my hands and thought i should not have got to the door but when i did as i hoped this would be my last interview with this terrible hardhearted master i turned about and made a low courtesy and said god bless you sir god bless you mr longman and i went into the lobby leading to the great hall and dropt into the first chair for i could get no farther a good while i leave all these things to your reflection my dear parents but i can write no more my poor hearts almost broken indeed it is o when shall i get away send me good god in safety once more to my poor fathers peaceful cot and there the worst that can happen will be joy in perfection to what i now bear o pity your distressed daughter letter xxix my dear father and mother i must write on though i shall come so soon for now i have hardly any thing else to do i have finished all that lay upon me and only wait the good time of setting out mrs jervis said i must be low in pocket for what i had laid out and so would have presented me with two guineas of her five but i could not take them of her because poor gentlewoman she pays old debts for her children that were extravagant and wants them herself this though was very good in her i am sorry i shall have but little to bring with me but i know you wont you are so good and i will work the harder when i come home if i can get a little plainwork or any thing to do but all your neighbourhood is so poor that i fear i shall want work except may be dame mumford can help me to something from any good family she is acquainted with here what a sad thing it is i have been brought up wrong as matters stand for you know my good lady now in heaven loved singing and dancing and as she would have it i had a voice she made me learn both and often and often has she made me sing her an innocent song and a good psalm too and dance before her and i must learn to flower and draw too and to work fine work with my needle why all this too i have got pretty tolerably at my fingers end as they say and she used to praise me and was a good judge of such matters well now what is all this to the purpose as things have turned about why no more nor less than that i am like the grasshopper in the fable which i have read of in my ladys book as follows see the aesops fables which have lately been selected and reformed from those of sir r lestrange and the most eminent mythologists as the ants were airing their provisions one winter a hungry grasshopper as suppose it was poor i begged a charity of them they told him that he should have wrought in summer if he would not have wanted in winter well says the grasshopper but i was not idle neither for i sung out the whole season nay then said they youll een do well to make a merry year of it and dance in winter to the time you sung in summer so i shall make a fine figure with my singing and my dancing when i come home to you nay i shall be unfit even for a mayday holidaytime for these minuets rigadoons and french dances that i have been practising will make me but ill company for my milkmaid companions that are to be to be sure i had better as things stand have learned to wash and scour and brew and bake and such like put i hope if i cant get work and can meet with a place to learn these soon if any body will have the goodness to bear with me till i am able for notwithstanding what my master says i hope i have an humble and teachable mind and next to gods grace thats all my comfort for i shall think nothing too mean that is honest it may be a little hard at first but woe to my proud heart if i find it so on trial for i will make it bend to its condition or break it i have read of a good bishop that was to be burnt for his religion and he tried how he could bear it by putting his fingers into the lighted candle so i tother day tried when rachels back was turned if i could not scour a pewter plate she had begun i see i could dot by degrees it only blistered my hand in two places all the matter is if i could get plainwork enough i need not spoil my fingers but if i cant i hope to make my hands as red as a blood pudding and as hard as a beechen trencher to accommodate them to my condition but i must break off heres somebody coming tis only our hannah with a message from mrs jervis but hold heres somebody else well it is only rachel i am as much frighted as were the city mouse and the country mouse in the same book of fables at every thing that stirs o i have a power of these things to entertain you with in winter evenings when i come home if i can but get work with a little time for reading i hope we shall be very happy over our peat fires what made me hint to you that i should bring but little with me is this you must know i did intend to do as i have this afternoon and that is i took all my clothes and all my linen and i divided them into three parcels as i had before told mrs jervis i intended to do and i said it is now monday mrs jervis and i am to go away on thursday morning betimes so though i know you dont doubt my honesty i beg you will look over my poor matters and let every one have what belongs to them for said i you know i am resolved to take with me only what i can properly call my own said she i did not know her drift then to be sure she meant well but i did not thank her for it when i did know it let your things be brought down in the greenroom and i will do any thing you will have me do with all my heart said i greenroom or any where but i think you might step up and see em as they lie however i fetched em down and laid them in three parcels as before and when i had done i went down to call her up to look at them now it seems she had prepared my master for this scene unknown to me and in this greenroom was a closet with a sashdoor and a curtain before it for there she puts her sweetmeats and such things and she did it it seems to turn his heart as knowing what i intended i suppose that he should make me take the things for if he had i should have made money of them to help us when we got together for to be sure i could never have appeared in them well as i was saying he had got unknown to me into this closet i suppose while i went to call mrs jervis and she since owned to me it was at his desire when she told him something of what i intended or else she would not have done it though i have reason i am sure to remember the last closetwork so i said when she came up here mrs jervis is the first parcel i will spread it all abroad these are the things my good lady gave me in the first place said i and so i went on describing the clothes and linen my lady had given me mingling blessings as i proceeded for her goodness to me and when i had turned over that parcel i said well so much for the first parcel mrs jervis that was my ladys gifts now i come to the presents of my dear virtuous master hey you know closet for that mrs jervis she laughed and said i never saw such a comical girl in my life but go on i will mrs jervis said i as soon as i have opened the bundle for i was as brisk and as pert as could be little thinking who heard me now here mrs jervis said i are my ever worthy masters presents and then i particularised all those in the second bundle after which i turned to my own and said now mrs jervis comes poor pamelas bundle and a little one it is to the others first here is a calico nightgown that i used to wear o mornings twill be rather too good for me when i get home but i must have something then there is a quilted calamanco coat and a pair of stockings i bought of the pedlar and my strawhat with blue strings and a remnant of scots cloth which will make two shirts and two shifts the same i have on for my poor father and mother and here are four other shifts one the fellow to that i have on another pretty good one and the other two old fine ones that will serve me to turn and wind with at home for they are not worth leaving behind me and here are two pair of shoes i have taken the lace off which i will burn and may be will fetch me some little matter at a pinch with an old silver buckle or two what do you laugh for mrs jervis said i why you are like an april day you cry and laugh in a breath well let me see ay here is a cotton handkerchief i bought of the pedlar there should be another somewhere o here it is and here too are my newbought knit mittens and this is my new flannel coat the fellow to that i have on and in this parcel pinned together are several pieces of printed calico remnants of silks and such like that if good luck should happen and i should get work would serve for robins and facings and such like uses and here too are a pair of pockets they are too fine for me but i have no worse bless me said i i did not think i had so many good things well mrs jervis said i you have seen all my store and i will now sit down and tell you a piece of my mind be brief then said she my good girl for she was afraid she said afterwards that i should say too much why then the case is this i am to enter upon a point of equity and conscience mrs jervis and i must beg if you love me youd let me have my own way those things there of my ladys i can have no claim to so as to take them away for she gave them me supposing i was to wear them in her service and to do credit to her bountiful heart but since i am to be turned away you know i cannot wear them at my poor fathers for i should bring all the little village upon my back and so i resolve not to have them then mrs jervis said i i have far less right to these of my worthy masters for you see what was his intention in giving them to me so they were to be the price of my shame and if i could make use of them i should think i should never prosper with them and besides you know mrs jervis if i would not do the good gentlemans work why should i take his wages so in conscience in honour in every thing i have nothing to say to thee thou second wicked bundle but said i cone to my arms my dear third parcel the companion of my poverty and the witness of my honesty and may i never deserve the least rag that is contained in thee when i forfeit a title to that innocence that i hope will ever be the pride of my life and then i am sure it will be my highest comfort at my death when all the riches and pomps of the world will be worse than the vilest rags that can be worn by beggars and so i hugged my third bundle but said i mrs jervis and she wept to hear me one thing more i have to trouble you with and thats all there are four guineas you know that came out of my good ladys pocket when she died that with some silver my master gave me now these same four guineas i sent to my poor father and mother and they have broken them but would make them up if i would and if you think it should be so it shall but pray tell me honestly your mind as to the three years before my ladys death do you think as i had no wages i may be supposed to be quits by quits i cannot mean that my poor services should be equal to my ladys goodness for thats impossible but as all her learning and education of me as matters have turned will be of little service to me now for it had been better for me to have been brought up to hard labour to be sure for that i must turn to at last if i cant get a place and you know in places too one is subject to such temptations as are dreadful to think of so i say by quits i only mean as i return all the good things she gave me whether i may not set my little services against my keeping because as i said my learning is not now in the question and i am sure my dear good lady would have thought so had she lived but that too is now out of the question well then if so i would ask whether in above this year that i have lived with my master as i am resolved to leave all his gifts behind me i may not have earned besides my keeping these four guineas and these poor clothes here upon my back and in my third bundle now tell me your mind freely without favour or affection alas my dear girl says she you make me unable to speak to you at all to be sure it will be the highest affront that can be offered for you to leave any of these things behind you and you must take all your bundles with you or my master will never forgive you well well mrs jervis said i i dont care i have been too much used to be snubbed and hardly treated by my master of late i have done him no harm and i shall always pray for him and wish him happy but i dont deserve these things i know i dont then i cant wear them if i should take them so they can be of no use to me and i trust i shall not want the poor pittance that is all i desire to keep life and soul together bread and water i can live upon mrs jervis with content water i shall get any where and if i cant get me bread i will live like a bird in winter upon hips and haws and at other times upon pig nuts and potatoes or turnips or any thing so what occasion have i for these things but all i ask is about these four guineas and if you think i need not return them that is all i want to know to be sure my dear you need not said she you have well earned them by that waistcoat only no i think not so in that only but in the linen and other things do you think i have yes yes said she and more and my keeping allowed for i mean said i and these poor clothes on my back besides remember that mrs jervis yes my dear oddone no doubt you have well then said i i am as happy as a princess i am quite as rich as i wish to be and once more my dear third bundle i will hug thee to my bosom and i beg youll say nothing of all this till i am gone that my master maynt be so angry but that i may go in peace for my heart without other matters will he ready to break to part with you all now mrs jervis said i as to one matter more and that is my masters last usage of me before mr longman said she prythee dear pamela step to my chamber and fetch me a paper i left on my table i have something to shew you in it i will said i and stepped down but that was only a fetch to take the orders of my master i found it seems he said he thought two or three times to have burst out upon me but he could not stand it and wished i might not know he was there but i tripped up again so nimbly for there was no paper that i just saw his back as if coming out of that greenroom and going into the next to it the first door that was open i whipped in and shut the door and bolted it o mrs jervis said i what have you done by me i see i cant confide in any body i am beset on all hands wretched wretched pamela where shalt thou expect a friend if mrs jervis joins to betray thee thus she made so many protestations telling me all and that he owned i had made him wipe his eyes two or three times and said she hoped it would have a good effect and remembered me that i had said nothing but what would rather move compassion than resentment that i forgave her but o that i was safe from this house for never poor creature sure was so flustered as i have been so many months together i am called down from this most tedious scribble i wonder what will next befall your dutiful daughter mrs jervis says she is sure i shall have the chariot to carry me home to you though this will look too great for me yet it will shew as if i was not turned away quite in disgrace the travelling chariot is come from lincolnshire and i fancy i shall go in that for the other is quite grand letter xxx my dear father and mother i write again though may be i shall bring it to you in my pocket for i shall have no writing nor writingtime i hope when i come to you this is wednesday morning and i shall i hope set out to you tomorrow morning but i have had more trials and more vexations but of another complexion too a little though all from the same quarter yesterday my master after he came from hunting sent for me i went with great terror for i expected he would storm and be in a fine passion with me for my freedom of speech before so i was resolved to begin first with submission to disarm his anger and i fell upon my knees as soon as i saw him and said good sir let me beseech you as you hope to be forgiven yourself and for the sake of my dear good lady your mother who recommended me to you with her last words to forgive me all my faults and only grant me this favour the last i shall ask you that you will let me depart your house with peace and quietness of mind that i may take such a leave of my dear fellowservants as befits me and that my heart be not quite broken he took me up in a kinder manner than ever i had known and he said shut the door pamela and come to me in my closet i want to have a little serious talk with you how can i sir said i how can i and wrung my hands o pray sir let me go out of your presence i beseech you by the god that made me said he ill do you no harm shut the parlour door and come to me in my library he then went into his closet which is his library and full of rich pictures besides a noble apartment though called a closet and next the private garden into which it has a door that opens i shut the parlour door as he bid me but stood at it irresolute place some confidence in me said he surely you may when i have spoken thus solemnly so i crept towards him with trembling feet and my heart throbbing through my handkerchief come in said he when i bid you i did so pray sir said i pity and spare me i will said he as i hope to be saved he sat down upon a rich settee and took hold of my hand and said dont doubt me pamela from this moment i will no more consider you as my servant and i desire youll not use me with ingratitude for the kindness i am going to express towards you this a little emboldened me and he said holding both my hands between his you have too much wit and good sense not to discover that i in spite of my heart and all the pride of it cannot but love you yes look up to me my sweetfaced girl i must say i love you and have put on a behaviour to you that was much against my heart in hopes to frighten you from your reservedness you see i own it ingenuously and dont play your sex upon me for it i was unable to speak and he seeing me too much oppressed with confusion to go on in that strain said well pamela let me know in what situation of life is your father i know he is a poor man but is he as low and as honest as he was when my mother took you then i could speak a little and with a down look and i felt my face glow like fire i said yes sir as poor and as honest too and that is my pride says he i will do something for him if it be not your fault and make all your family happy all sir said i he is happier already than ever he can be if his daughters innocence is to be the price of your favour and i beg you will not speak to me on the only side that can wound me i have no design of that sort said he o sir said i tell me not so tell me not so tis easy said he for me to be the making of your father without injuring you well sir said i if this can be done let me know how and all i can do with innocence shall be the study and practice of my life but o what can such a poor creature as i do and do my duty said he i would have you stay a week or fortnight only and behave yourself with kindness to me i stoop to beg it of you and you shall see all shall turn out beyond your expectation i see said he you are going to answer otherwise than i would have you and i begin to be vexed i should thus meanly sue and so i will say that your behaviour before honest longman when i used you as i did and you could so well have vindicated yourself has quite charmed me and though i am not pleased with all you said yesterday while i was in the closet yet you have moved me more to admire you than before and i am awakened to see more worthiness in you than ever i saw in any lady in the world all the servants from the highest to the lowest doat upon you instead of envying you and look upon you in so superior a light as speaks what you ought to be i have seen more of your letters than you imagine this surprised me and am quite overcome with your charming manner of writing so free so easy and many of your sentiments so much above your years and your sex and all put together makes me as i tell you love you to extravagance now pamela when i have stooped to acknowledge all this oblige me only to stay another week or fortnight to give me time to bring about some certain affairs and you shall see how much you may find your account in it i trembled to find my poor heart giving way o good sir said i spare a poor girl that cannot look up to you and speak my heart is full and why should you wish to undo me only oblige me said he to stay a fortnight longer and john shall carry word to your father that i will see him in the time either here or at the swan in his village o sir said i my heart will burst but on my bended knees i beg you to let me go tomorrow as i designed and dont offer to tempt a poor creature whose whole will would be to do yours if my virtue would permit i shall permit it said he for i intend no injury to you god is my witness impossible said i i cannot sir believe you after what has passed how many ways are there to undo poor creatures good god protect me this one time and send me but to my dear fathers cot in safety strange dd fate said he that when i speak so solemnly i cant be believed what should i believe sir said i what can i believe what have you said but that i am to stay a fortnight longer and what then is to become of me my pride of birth and fortune d n them both said he since they cannot obtain credit with you but must add to your suspicions will not let me descend all at once and i ask you but a fortnights stay that after this declaration i may pacify those proud demands upon me o how my heart throbbed and i began for i did not know what i did to say the lords prayer none of your beads to me pamela said he thou art a perfect nun i think but i said aloud with my eyes lifted up to heaven lead me not into temptation but deliver me from evil o my good god he hugged me in his arms and said well my dear girl then you stay this fortnight and you shall see what i will do for you ill leave you a moment and walk into the next room to give you time to think of it and to shew you i have no design upon you well this i thought did not look amiss he went out and i was tortured with twenty different doubts in a minute sometimes i thought that to stay a week or fortnight longer in this house to obey him while mrs jervis was with me could do no great harm but then thought i how do i know what i may be able to do i have withstood his anger but may i not relent at his kindness how shall i stand that well i hope thought i by the same protecting grace in which i will always confide but then what has he promised why he will make my poor father and mothers life comfortable o said i to myself that is a rich thought but let me not dwell upon it for fear i should indulge it to my ruin what can he do for me poor girl as i am what can his greatness stoop to he talks thought i of his pride of heart and pride of condition o these are in his head and in his heart too or he would not confess them to me at such an instant well then thought i this can be only to seduce me he has promised nothing but i am to see what he will do if i stay a fortnight and this fortnight thought i again is no such great matter and i shall see in a few days how he carries it but then when i again reflected upon this distance between him and me and his now open declaration of love as he called it and that after this he would talk with me on that subject more plainly than ever and i shall be less armed may be to withstand him and then i bethought myself why if he meant no dishonour he should not speak before mrs jervis and the odious frightful closet came again into my head and my narrow escape upon it and how easy it might be for him to send mrs jervis and the maids out of the way and so that all the mischief he designed me might be brought about in less than that time i resolved to go away and trust all to providence and nothing to myself and how ought i to be thankful for this resolution as you shall hear but just as i have writ to this place john sends me word that he is going this minute your way and so i will send you so far as i have written and hope by tomorrow night to ask your blessings at your own poor but happy abode and tell you the rest by word of mouth and so i rest till then and for ever your dutiful daughter letter xxxi dear father and mother i will continue my writing still because may be i shall like to read it when i am with you to see what dangers i have been enabled to escape and though i bring it along with me i told you my resolution my happy resolution as i have reason to think it and just then he came in again with great kindness in his looks and said i make no doubt pamela you will stay this fortnight to oblige me i knew not how to frame my words so as to deny and yet not make him storm but said i forgive sir your poor distressed servant i know i cannot possibly deserve any favour at your hands consistent with virtue and i beg you will let me go to my poor father why said he thou art the veriest fool that i ever knew i tell you i will see your father ill send for him hither tomorrow in my travelling chariot if you will and ill let him know what i intend to do for him and you what sir may i ask you can that be your honours noble estate may easily make him happy and not unuseful perhaps to you in some respect or other but what price am i to pay for all this yon shall be happy as you can wish said he i do assure you and here i will now give you this purse in which are fifty guineas which i will allow your father yearly and find an employ suitable to his liking to deserve that and more pamela he shall never want depend upon it i would have given you still more for him but that perhaps youd suspect i intended it as a design upon you o sir said i take back your guineas i will not touch one nor will my father i am sure till he knows what is to be done for them and particularly what is to become of me why then pamela said he suppose i find a man of probity and genteel calling for a husband for you that shall make you a gentlewoman as long as you live i want no husband sir said i for now i began to see him in all his black colours yet being so much in his power i thought i would a little dissemble but said he you are so pretty that go where you will you can never be free from the designs of some or other of our sex and i shall think i dont answer the care of my dying mother for you who committed you to me if i dont provide you a husband to protect your virtue and your innocence and a worthy one i have thought of for you o black perfidious creature thought i what an implement art thou in the hands of lucifer to ruin the innocent heart yet still i dissembled for i feared much both him and the place i was in but whom pray sir have you thought of why said he young mr williams my chaplain in lincolnshire who will make you happy does he know sir said i any thing of your honours intentions no my girl said he and kissed me much against my will for his very breath was now poison to me but his dependance upon my favour and your beauty and merit will make him rejoice at my kindness to him well sir said i then it is time enough to consider of this matter and it cannot hinder me from going to my fathers for what will staying a fortnight longer signify to this your honours care and goodness may extend to me there as well as here and mr williams and all the world shall know that i am not ashamed of my fathers poverty he would kiss me again and i said if i am to think of mr williams or any body i beg youll not be so free with me that is not pretty im sure well said he but you stay this next fortnight and in that time ill have both williams and your father here for i will have the match concluded in my house and when i have brought it on you shall settle it as you please together meantime take and send only these fifty pieces to your father as an earnest of my favour and ill make you all happy sir said i i beg at least two hours to consider of this i shall said he be gone out in one hour and i would have you write to your father what i propose and john shall carry it on purpose and he shall take the purse with him for the good old man if you approve it sir said i i will then let you know in one hour my resolution do so said he and gave me another kiss and let nee go o how i rejoiced i had got out of his clutches so i write you this that you may see how matters stand for i am resolved to come away if possible base wicked treacherous gentleman as he is so here was a trap laid for your poor pamela i tremble to think of it o what a scene of wickedness was here laid down for all my wretched life blackhearted wretch how i hate him for at first as youll see by what i have written he would have made me believe other things and this of mr williams i suppose came into his head after he walked out from his closet to give himself time to think how to delude me better but the covering was now too thin and easy to be seen through i went to my chamber and the first thing i did was to write to him for i thought it was best not to see him again if i could help it and i put it under his parlour door after i had copied it as follows honoured sir your last proposal to me convinces me that i ought not to stay but to go to my father if it were but to ask his advice about mr williams and i am so set upon it that i am not to be persuaded so honoured sir with a thousand thanks for all favours i will set out tomorrow early and the honour you designed me as mrs jervis tells me of your chariot there will be no occasion for because i can hire i believe farmer bradys chaise so begging you will not take it amiss i shall ever be your dutiful servant as to the purse sir my poor father to be sure wont forgive me if i take it till he can know how to deserve it which is impossible so he has just now sent mrs jervis to tell me that since i am resolved to go go i may and the travelling chariot shall be ready but it shall be worse for me for that he will never trouble himself about me as long as he lives well so i get out of the house i care not only i should have been glad i could with innocence have made you my dear parents happy i cannot imagine the reason of it but john who i thought was gone with my last is but now going and he sends to know if i have any thing else to carry so i break off to send you this with the former i am now preparing for my journey and about taking leave of my good fellowservants and if i have not time to write i must tell you the rest when i am so happy as to be with you one word more i slip in a paper of verses on my going sad poor stuff but as they come from me youll not dislike them may be i shewed them to mrs jervis and she liked them and took a copy and made one sing them to her and in the greenroom too but i looked into the closet first i will only add that i am your dutiful daughter let me just say that he has this moment sent me five guineas by mrs jervis as a present for my pocket so i shall be very rich for as she brought them i thought i might take them he says he wont see me and i may go when i will in the morning and lincolnshire robin shall drive me but he is so angry he orders that nobody shall go out at the door with me not so much as into the coachyard well i cant help it not i but does not this expose himself more than me but john waits and i would have brought this and the other myself but he says he has put it up among other things and so can take both as well as one john is very good and very honest i am under great obligations to him id give him a guinea now im so rich if i thought hed take it i hear nothing of my ladys clothes and those my master gave me for i told mrs jervis i would not take them but i fancy by a word or two that was dropped they will be sent after me dear sirs what a rich pamela youll have if they should but as i cant wear them if they do i dont desire them and if i have them will turn them into money as i can have opportunity well no more im in a fearful hurry verses on my going away i my fellowservants dear attend to these few lines which i have pennd im sure theyre from your honest friend and wisherwell poor pamela ii i from a state of low degree was placd in this good family too high a fate for humble me the helpless hopeless pamela iii yet though my happy lot was so joyful i homeward from it go no less content when poor and low than here you find your pamela iv for what indeed is happiness but conscience innocence and peace and thats a treasure i possess thank heaven that gave it pamela v my future lot i cannot know but this im sure whereer i go whateer i am whateer i do ill be the grateful pamela vi no sad regrets my heart annoy ill pray for all your peace and joy from master high to scullion boy for all your loves to pamela vii one thing or two ive more to say gods holy will be sure obey and for our master always pray as ever shall poor pamela viii for oh we pity should the great instead of envying their estate temptations always on em wait exempt from which are such as we ix their riches gay deceitful snares enlarge their fears increase their cares their servants joy surpasses theirs at least so judges pamela x your parents and relations love let them your duty ever prove and youll be blessd by heavn above as will i hope poor pamela xi for if ashamd i eer could be of my dear parents low degree what lot had been too mean for me unblessd unvirtuous pamela xii thrice happy may you ever be each one in his and her degree and sirs wheneer you think of me pray for content to pamela xiii pray for her wishd content and peace and rest assurd shell never cease to pray for all your joys increase while life is lent to pamela xiv on god all future good depends serve him and so my sonnet ends with thank ye thank ye honest friends for all your loves to pamela here it is necessary the reader should know that the fair pamelas trials were not yet over but the worst were to come at a time when she thought them at an end and that she was returning to her father for when her master found her virtue was not to be subdued and he had in vain tried to conquer his passion for her being a gentleman of pleasure and intrigue he had ordered his lincolnshire coachman to bring his travelling chariot from thence not caring to trust his bedfordshire coachman who with the rest of the servants so greatly loved and honoured the fair damsel and having given him instructions accordingly and prohibited the other servants on pretence of resenting pamelas behaviour from accompanying her any part of the road he drove her five miles on the way to her fathers and then turning off crossed the country and carried her onwards toward his lincolnshire estate it is also to be observed that the messenger of her letters to her father who so often pretended business that way was an implement in his masters hands and employed by him for that purpose and always gave her letters first to him and his master used to open and read them and then send them on by which means as he hints to her as she observes in her letter xxx he was no stranger to what she wrote thus every way was the poor virgin beset and the whole will shew the base arts of designing men to gain their wicked ends and how much it behoves the fair sex to stand upon their guard against artful contrivances especially when riches and power conspire against innocence and a low estate a few words more will be necessary to make the sequel better understood the intriguing gentleman thought fit however to keep back from her father her three last letters in which she mentions his concealing himself to hear her partitioning out her clothes his last effort to induce her to stay a fortnight his pretended proposal of the chaplain and her hopes of speedily seeing them as also her verses and to send himself a letter to her father which is as follows goodman andrews you will wonder to receive a letter from me but i think i am obliged to let you know that i have discovered the strange correspondence carried on between you and your daughter so injurious to my honour and reputation and which i think you should not have encouraged till you knew there were sufficient grounds for those aspersions which she so plentifully casts upon me something possibly there might be in what she has written from time to time but believe me with all her pretended simplicity and innocence i never knew so much romantic invention as she is mistress of in short the girls heads turned by romances and such idle stuff to which she has given herself up ever since her kind ladys death and she assumes airs as if she was a mirror of perfection and every body had a design upon her dont mistake me however i believe her very honest and very virtuous but i have found out also that she is carrying on a sort of correspondence or love affair with a young clergyman that i hope in time to provide for but who at present is destitute of any subsistence but my favour and what would be the consequence can you think of two young folks who have nothing in the world to trust to of their own to come together with a family multiplying upon them before they have bread to eat for my part i have too much kindness to them both not to endeavour to prevent it if i can and for this reason i have sent her out of his way for a little while till i can bring them both to better consideration and i would not therefore have you be surprised you dont see your daughter so soon as you might possibly expect yet i do assure you upon my honour that she shall be safe and inviolate and i hope you dont doubt me notwithstanding any airs she may have given herself upon my jocular pleasantry to her and perhaps a little innocent romping with her so usual with young folks of the two sexes when they have been long acquainted and grown up together for pride is not my talent as she is a mighty letterwriter i hope she has had the duty to apprise you of her intrigue with the young clergyman and i know not whether it meets with your countenance but now she is absent for a little while for i know he would have followed her to your village if she had gone home and there perhaps they would have ruined one another by marrying i doubt not i shall bring him to see his interest and that he engages not before he knows how to provide for a wife and when that can be done let them come together in gods name for me i expect not to be answered on this head but by your good opinion and the confidence you may repose in my honour being your hearty friend to serve you p s i find my man john has been the manager of the correspondence in which such liberties have been taken with me i shall soon in a manner that becomes me let the saucy fellow know how much i resent his part of the affair it is hard thing that a man of my character in the world should be used thus freely by his own servants it is easy to guess at the poor old mans concern upon reading this letter from a gentleman of so much consideration he knew not what course to take and had no manner of doubt of his poor daughters innocence and that foul play was designed her yet he sometimes hoped the best and was ready to believe the surmised correspondence between the clergyman and her having not received the letters she wrote which would have cleared up that affair but after all he resolved as well to quiet his own as her mothers uneasiness to undertake a journey to the squires and leaving his poor wife to excuse him to the farmer who employed him he set out that very evening late as it was and travelling all night found himself soon after daylight at the gate of the gentleman before the family was up and there he sat down to rest himself till he should see somebody stirring the grooms were the first he saw coming out to water their horses and he asked in so distressful a manner what was become of pamela that they thought him crazy and said why what have you to do with pamela old fellow get out of the horses way where is your master said the poor man pray gentlemen dont be angry my hearts almost broken he never gives any thing at the door i assure you says one of the grooms so you lose your labour i am not a beggar yet said the poor old man i want nothing of him but my pamela o my child my child ill be hanged says one of them if this is not mrs pamelas father indeed indeed said he wringing his hands i am and weeping where is my child where is my pamela why father said one of them we beg your pardon but she is gone home to you how long have you been come from home o but last night said he i have travelled all night is the squire at home or is he not yes but he is not stirring though said the groom as yet thank god for that said he thank god for that then i hope i may be permitted to speak to him anon they asked him to go in and he stepped into the stable and sat down on the stairs there wiping his eyes and sighing so sadly that it grieved the servants to hear him the family was soon raised with a report of pamelas father coming to inquire after his daughter and the maids would fain have had him go into the kitchen but mrs jervis having been told of his coming arose and hastened down to her parlour and took him in with her and there heard all his sad story and read the letter she wept bitterly but yet endeavoured before him to hide her concern and said well goodman andrews i cannot help weeping at your grief but i hope there is no occasion let nobody see this letter whatever you do i dare say your daughter is safe well but said he i see you madam know nothing about her if all was right so good a gentlewoman as you are would not have been a stranger to this to be sure you thought she was with me said she my master does not always inform his servants of his proceedings but you need not doubt his honour you have his hand for it and you may see he can have no design upon her because he is not from hence and does not talk of going hence o that is all i have to hope for said he that is all indeed but said he and was going on when the report of his coming had reached the squire who came down in his morninggown and slippers into the parlour where he and mrs jervis were talking whats the matter goodman andrews said he whats the matter oh my child said the good old man give me my child i beseech you why i thought says the squire that i had satisfied you about her sure you have not the letter i sent you written with my own hand yes yes but i have sir said he and that brought me hither and i have walked all night poor man returned he with great seeming compassion i am sorry for it truly why your daughter has made a strange racket in my family and if i thought it would have disturbed you so much i would have een let her go home but what i did was to serve her and you too she is very safe i do assure you goodman andrews and you may take my honour for it i would not injure her for the world do you think i would mrs jervis no i hope not sir said she hope not said the poor man so do i but pray sir give me my child that is all i desire and ill take care no clergyman shall come near her why london is a great way off said the squire and i cant send for her back presently what then said he have you sent my poor pamela to london i would not have said it so replied the squire but i assure you upon my honour she is quite safe and satisfied and will quickly inform you of it by letter she is in a reputable family no less than a bishops and is to wait on his lady till i get the matter over that i mentioned to you o how shall i know this replied he what said the squire pretending anger am i to be doubted do you believe i can have any view upon your daughter and if i had do you think i would take such methods as these to effect it why surely man thou forgettest whom thou talkest to o sir said he i beg your pardon but consider my dear child is in the case let me but know what bishop and where and i will travel to london on foot to see my daughter and then be satisfied why goodman andrews i think thou hast read romances as well as thy daughter and thy heads turned with them may i have not my word taken do you think once more i would offer any thing dishonourable to your daughter is there any thing looks like it prythee man recollect a little who i am and if i am not to be believed what signifies talking why sir said he pray forgive me but there is no harm to say what bishops or whereabouts what and so youd go troubling his lordship with your impertinent fears and stories will you be satisfied if you have a letter from her within a week it may be less if she be not negligent to assure you all is well with her why that said the poor man will be some comfort well then said the gentleman i cant answer for her negligence if she dont write and if she should send a letter to you mrs jervis for i desire not to see it i have had trouble enough about her already be sure you send it by a man and horse the moment you receive it to be sure i will answered she thank your honour said the good man and then i must wait with as much patience as i can for a week which will be a year to me i tell you said the gentleman it must be her own fault if she dont write for tis what i insisted upon for my own reputation and i shant stir from this house i assure you till she is heard from and that to your satisfaction god bless your honour said the poor man as you say and mean truth amen amen goodman andrews said he you see i am not afraid to say amen so mrs jervis make the good man as welcome as you can and let me have no uproar about the matter he then whispering her bid her give him a couple of guineas to bear his charges home telling him he should be welcome to stay there till the letter came if he would and be a witness that he intended honourably and not to stir from his house for one while the poor old man staid and dined with mrs jervis with some tolerable ease of mind in hopes to hear from his beloved daughter in a few days and then accepting the present returned for his own house and resolved to be as patient as possible meantime mrs jervis and all the family were in the utmost grief for the trick put upon the poor pamela and she and the steward represented it to their master in as moving terms as they durst but were forced to rest satisfied with his general assurances of intending her no harm which however mrs jervis little believed from the pretence he had made in his letter of the correspondence between pamela and the young parson which she knew to be all mere invention though she durst not say so but the week after they were made a little more easy by the following letter brought by an unknown hand and left for mrs jervis which how procured will be shewn in the sequel dear mrs jervis i have been vilely tricked and instead of being driven by robin to my dear fathers i am carried off to where i have no liberty to tell however i am at present not used hardly in the main and write to beg of you to let my dear father and mother whose hearts must be well nigh broken know that i am well and that i am and by the grace of god ever will he their honest as well as dutiful daughter and your obliged friend pamela andrews i must neither send date nor place but have most solemn assurances of honourable usage this is the only time my low estate has been troublesome to me since it has subjected me to the frights i have undergone love to your good self and all my dear fellowservants adieu adieu but pray for poor pamela this though it quieted not entirely their apprehensions was shewn to the whole family and to the gentleman himself who pretended not to know how it came and mrs jervis sent it away to the good old folks who at first suspected it was forged and not their daughters hand but finding the contrary they were a little easier to hear she was alive and honest and having inquired of all their acquaintance what could be done and no one being able to put them in a way how to proceed with effect on so extraordinary an occasion against so rich and so resolute a gentleman and being afraid to make matters worse though they saw plainly enough that she was in no bishops family and so mistrusted all the rest of his story they applied themselves to prayers for their poor daughter and for an happy issue to an affair that almost distracted them we shall now leave the honest old pair praying for their dear pamela and return to the account she herself gives of all this having written it journalwise to amuse and employ her time in hopes some opportunity might offer to send it to her friends and as was her constant view that she might afterwards thankfully look back upon the dangers she had escaped when they should be happily overblown as in time she hoped they would be and that then she might examine and either approve or repent of her own conduct in them letter xxxii o my dearest father and mother let me write and bewail my miserable hard fate though i have no hope how what i write can be conveyed to your hands i have now nothing to do but write and weep and fear and pray but yet what can i hope for when i seem to be devoted as a victim to the will of a wicked violator of all the laws of god and man but gracious heaven forgive me my rashness and despondency o let me not sin against thee for thou best knowest what is fittest for thy poor handmaid and as thou sufferest not thy poor creatures to be tempted above what they can bear i will resign myself to thy good pleasure and still i hope desperate as my condition seems that as these trials are not of my own seeking nor the effects of my presumption and vanity i shall be enabled to overcome them and in gods own good time be delivered from them thus do i pray imperfectly as i am forced by my distracting fears and apprehensions and o join with me my dear parents but alas how can you know how can i reveal to you the dreadful situation of your poor daughter the unhappy pamela may be undone which god forbid and sooner deprive me of life before you can know her hard lot o the unparalleled wickedness stratagems and devices of those who call themselves gentlemen yet pervert the design of providence in giving them ample means to do good to their own everlasting perdition and the ruin of poor oppressed innocence but now i will tell you what has befallen me and yet how shall you receive it here is no honest john to carry my letters to you and besides i am watched in all my steps and no doubt shall be till my hard fate may ripen his wicked projects for my ruin i will every day however write my sad state and some way perhaps may be opened to send the melancholy scribble to you but alas when you know it what will it do but aggravate your troubles for o what can the abject poor do against the mighty rich when they are determined to oppress well but i must proceed to write what i had hoped to tell you in a few hours when i believed i should receive your grateful blessings on my return to you from so many hardships i will begin with my account from the last letter i wrote you in which i enclosed my poor stuff of verses and continue it at times as i have opportunity though as i said i know not how it can reach you the longhoped for thursday morning came when i was to set out i had taken my leave of my fellowservants overnight and a mournful leave it was to us all for men as well as women servants wept much to part with me and for my part i was overwhelmed with tears and the affecting instances of their esteem they all would have made me little presents as tokens of their love but i would not take any thing from the lower servants to be sure but mr longman would have me accept of several yards of holland and a silver snuffbox and a gold ring which he desired me to keep for his sake and he wept over me but said i am sure so good a maiden god will bless and though you return to your poor father again and his low estate yet providence will find you out remember i tell you so and one day though i maynt live to see it you will be rewarded i said o dear mr longman you make me too rich and too mody and yet i must be a beggar before my time for i shall want often to be scribbling little thinking it would be my only employment so soon and i will beg you sir to favour me with some paper and as soon as i get home i will write you a letter to thank you for all your kindness to me and a letter to good mrs jervis too this was lucky for i should have had none else but at the pleasure of my roughnatured governess as i may call her but now i can write to ease my mind though i cant send it to you and write what i please for she knows not how well i am provided for good mr longman gave me above forty sheets of paper and a dozen pens and a little phial of ink which last i wrapped in paper and put in my pocket and some wax and wafers o dear sir said i you have set me up how shall i requite you he said by a kiss my fair mistress and i gave it very willingly for he is a good old man rachel and hannah cried sadly when i took my leave and jane who sometimes used to be a little crossish and cicely too wept sadly and said they would pray for me but poor jane i doubt will forget that for she seldom says her prayers for herself mores the pity then arthur the gardener our robin the coachman and lincolnshire robin too who was to carry me were very civil and both had tears in their eyes which i thought then very goodnatured in lincolnshire robin because he knew but little of me but since i find he might well be concerned for he had then his instructions it seems and knew how he was to be a means to entrap me then our other three footmen harry isaac and benjamin and grooms and helpers were very much affected likewise and the poor little scullion boy tommy was ready to run over for grief they had got all together overnight expecting to be differently employed in the morning and they all begged to shake hands with me and i kissed the maidens and prayed to god to bless them all and thanked them for all their love and kindness to me and indeed i was forced to leave them sooner than i would because i could not stand it indeed i could not harry i could not have thought it for he is a little wildish they say cried till he sobbed again john poor honest john was not then come back from you but as for the butler mr jonathan he could not stay in company i thought to have told you a deal about this but i have worse things to employ my thoughts mrs jervis good mrs jervis cried all night long and i comforted her all i could and she made me promise that if my master went to london to attend parliament or to lincolnshire i would come and stay a week with her and she would have given me money but i would not take it well next morning came and i wondered i saw nothing of poor honest john for i waited to take leave of him and thank him for all his civilities to me and to you but i suppose he was sent farther by my master and so could not return and i desired to be remembered to him and when mrs jervis told me with a sad heart the chariot was ready with four horses to it i was just upon sinking into the ground though i wanted to be with you my master was above stairs and never asked to see me i was glad of it in the main but he knew false heart as he is that i was not to be out of his reach o preserve me heaven from his power and from his wickedness well they were not suffered to go with me one step as i writ to you before for he stood at the window to see me go and in the passage to the gate out of his sight there they stood all of them in two rows and we could say nothing on both sides but god bless you and god bless you but harry carried my own bundle my third bundle as i was used to call it to the coach with some plumbcake and dietbread made for me overnight and some sweetmeats and six bottles of canary wine which mrs jervis would make me take in a basket to cheer our hearts now and then when we got together as she said and i kissed all the maids again and shook hands with the men again but mr jonathan and mr longman were not there and then i tripped down the steps to the chariot mrs jervis crying most sadly i looked up when i got to the chariot and i saw my master at the window in his gown and i courtesied three times to him very low and prayed for him with my hands lifted up for i could not speak indeed i was not able and he bowed his head to me which made me then very glad he would take such notice of me and in i stepped and was ready to burst with grief and could only till robin began to drive wave my white handkerchief to them wet with my tears and at last away he drove jehulike as they say out of the courtyard and i too soon found i had cause for greater and deeper grief well said i to myself at this rate i shall soon be with my dear father and mother and till i had got as i supposed halfway i thought of the good friends i had left and when on stopping for a little bait to the horses robin told me i was near halfway i thought it was high time to wipe my eyes and think to whom i was going as then alack for me i thought so i began to ponder what a meeting i should have with you how glad youd both be to see me come safe and innocent to you after all my dangers and so i began to comfort myself and to banish the other gloomy side from my mind though too it returned now and then for i should be ungrateful not to love them for their love well i believe i set out about eight oclock in the morning and i wondered and wondered when it was about two as i saw by a church dial in a little village as we passed through that i was still more and more out of my knowledge heyday thought i to drive this strange pace and to be so long a going a little more than twenty miles is very odd but to be sure thought i robin knows the way at last he stopped and looked about him as if he was at a loss for the road and i said mr robert sure you are out of the way im afraid i am said he but it cant be much ill ask the first person i see pray do said i and he gave his horses a mouthful of bay and i gave him some cake and two glasses of canary wine and stopt about half an hour in all then he drove on very fast again i had so much to think of of the dangers i now doubted not i had escaped of the loving friends i had left and my best friends i was going to and the many things i had to relate to you that i the less thought of the way till i was startled out of my meditations by the sun beginning to set and still the man driving on and his horses sweating and foaming and then i began to be alarmed all at once and called to him and he said he had horrid ill luck for he had come several miles out of the way but was now right and should get in still before it was quite dark my heart began then to misgive me a little and i was very much fatigued for i had no sleep for several nights before to signify and at last i said pray mr robert there is a town before us what do you call it if we are so much out of the way we had better put up there for the night comes on apace and lord protect me thought i i shall have new dangers mayhap to encounter with the man who have escaped the master little thinking of the base contrivance of the latter says he i am just there tis but a mile on one side of the town before us nay said i i may be mistaken for it is a good while since i was this way but i am sure the face of the country here is nothing like what i remember it he pretended to be much out of humour with himself for mistaking the way and at last stopped at a farmhouse about two miles beyond the village i had seen and it was then almost dark and he alighted and said we must make shift here for i am quite out lord thought i be good to the poor pamela more trials still what will befall me next the farmers wife and maid and daughter came out and the wife said what brings you this way at this time of night mr robert and with a lady too then i began to be frightened out of my wits and laying middle and both ends together i fell a crying and said god give me patience i am undone for certain pray mistress said i do you know squire b of bedfordshire the wicked coachman would have prevented the answering me but the simple daughter said know his worship yes surely why he is my fathers landlord well said i then i am undone undone for ever o wicked wretch what have i done to you said i to the coachman to serve me thus vile tool of a wicked master faith said the fellow i am sorry this task was put upon me but i could not help it but make the best of it now here are very civil reputable folks and youll be safe here ill assure you let me get out said i and ill walk back to the town we came through late as it is for i will not enter here said the farmers wife youll be very well used here ill assure you young gentlewoman and have better conveniences than any where in the village i matter not conveniences said i i am betrayed and undone as you have a daughter of your own pity me and let me know if your landlord as you call him be here no ill assure you he is not said she and then came the farmer a goodlike sort of man grave and well behaved and spoke to me in such sort as made me a little pacified and seeing no help for it i went in and the wife immediately conducted me up stairs to the best apartment and told me that was mine as long as i staid and nobody should come near me but when i called i threw myself on the bed in the room tired and frightened to death almost and gave way to the most excessive fit of grief that i ever had the daughter came up and said mr robert had given her a letter to give me and there it was i raised myself and saw it was the hand and seal of the wicked wretch my master directed to mrs pamela andrews this was a little better than to have him here though if he had he must have been brought through the air for i thought i was the good woman for i began to see things about a little reputable and no guile appearing in them but rather a face of grief for my grief offered me a glass of some cordial water which i accepted for i was ready to sink and then i sat up in a chair a little though very faintish and they brought me two candles and lighted a brushwood fire and said if i called i should be waited on instantly and so left me to ruminate on my sad condition and to read my letter which i was not able to do presently after i had a little come to myself i found it to contain these words dear pamela the passion i have for you and your obstinacy have constrained me to act by you in a manner that i know will occasion you great trouble and fatigue both of mind and body yet forgive me my dear girl for although i have taken this step i will by all thats good and holy use you honourably suffer not your fears to transport you to a behaviour that will be disreputable to us both for the place where youll receive this is a farm that belongs to me and the people civil honest and obliging you will by this time be far on your way to the place i have allotted for your abode for a few weeks till i have managed some affairs that will make me shew myself to you in a much different light than you may possibly apprehend from this rash action and to convince you that i mean no harm i do assure you that the house you are going to shall be so much at your command that even i myself will not approach it without leave from you so make yourself easy be discreet and prudent and a happier turn shall reward these your troubles than you may at present apprehend meantime i pity the fatigue you will have if this come to your hand in the place i have directed and will write to your father to satisfy him that nothing but what is honourable shall be offered to you by your passionate admirer so i must style myself dont think hardly of poor robin you have so possessed all my servants in your favour that i find they had rather serve you than me and tis reluctantly the poor fellow undertook this task and i was forced to submit to assure him of my honourable intentions to you which i am fully resolved to make good if you compel me not to a contrary conduct i but too well apprehended that the letter was only to pacify me for the present but as my danger was not so immediate as i had reason to dread and he had promised to forbear coming to me and to write to you my dear parents to quiet your concern i was a little more easy than before and i made shift to eat a little bit of boiled chicken they had got for me and drank a glass of my sack and made each of them do so too but after i had so done i was again a little flustered for in came the coachman with the look of a hangman i thought and madamed me up strangely telling me he would beg me to get ready to pursue my journey by five in the morning or else he should be late in i was quite grieved at this for i began not to dislike my company considering how things stood and was in hopes to get a party among them and so to put myself into any worthy protection in the neighbourhood rather than go forward when he withdrew i began to tamper with the farmer and his wife but alas they had had a letter delivered them at the same time i had so securely had lucifer put it into his head to do his work and they only shook their heads and seemed to pity me and so i was forced to give over that hope however the good farmer shewed me his letter which i copied as follows for it discovers the deep arts of this wicked master and how resolved he seems to be on my ruin by the pains he took to deprive me of all hopes of freeing myself from his power farmer norton i send to your house for one night only a young gentlewoman much against her will who has deeply embarked in a love affair which will be her ruin as well as the persons to whom she wants to betroth herself i have to oblige her father ordered her to be carried to one of my houses where she will be well used to try if by absence and expostulation with both they can be brought to know their own interest and i am sure you will use her kindly for my sake for excepting this matter which she will not own she does not want prudence and discretion i will acknowledge any trouble you shall be at in this matter the first opportunity and am your friend and servant he had said too cunningly for me that i would not own this pretended love affair so that he had provided them not to believe me say what i would and as they were his tenants who all love him for he has some amiable qualities and so he had need i saw all my plot cut out and so was forced to say the less i wept bitterly however for i found he was too hard for me as well in his contrivances as riches and so had recourse again to my only refuge comforting myself that god never fails to take the innocent heart into his protection and is alone able to baffle and confound the devices of the mighty nay the farmer was so prepossessed with the contents of his letter that he began to praise his care and concern for me and to advise me against entertaining addresses without my friends advice and consent and made me the subject of a lesson for his daughters improvement so i was glad to shut up this discourse for i saw i was not likely to be believed i sent however to tell my driver that i was so fatigued i could not get out so soon the next morning but he insisted upon it and said it would make my days journey the lighter and i found he was a more faithful servant to his master notwithstanding what he wrote of his reluctance than i could have wished i saw still more and more that all was deep dissimulation and contrivance worse and worse indeed i might have shewn them his letter to me as a full confutation of his to them but i saw no probability of engaging them in my behalf and so thought it signified little as i was to go away so soon to enter more particularly into the matter with them and besides i saw they were not inclinable to let me stay longer for fear of disobliging him so i went to bed but had very little rest and they would make their servant maid bear me company in the chariot five miles early in the morning and she was to walk hack i had contrived in my thoughts when i was on my way in the chariot on friday morning that when we came into some town to bait as he must do for the horses sake i would at the inn apply myself if i saw i any way could to the mistress of the inn and tell her the case and to refuse to go farther having nobody but this wicked coachman to contend with well i was very full of this project and in great hopes some how or other to extricate myself in this way but oh the artful wretch had provided for even this last refuge of mine for when we came to put up at a large town on the way to eat a morsel for dinner and i was fully resolved to execute my project who should be at the inn that he put up at but the wicked mrs jewkes expecting me and her sisterinlaw was the mistress of it and she had provided a little entertainment for me and this i found when i desired as soon as i came in to speak with the mistress of the house she came to me and i said i am a poor unhappy young body that want your advice and assistance and you seem to be a good sort of a gentlewoman that would assist an oppressed innocent person yes madam said she i hope you guess right and i have the happiness to know something of the matter before you speak pray call my sister jewkes jewkes jewkes thought i i have heard of that name i dont like it then the wicked creature appeared whom i had never seen but once before and i was terrified out of my wits no stratagem thought i not one for a poor innocent girl but every thing to turn out against me that is hard indeed so i began to pull in my horns as they say for i saw i was now worse off than at the farmers the naughty woman came up to me with an air of confidence and kissed me see sister said she heres a charming creature would she not tempt the best lord in the land to run away with her o frightful thought i heres an avowal of the matter at once i am now gone thats certain and so was quite silent and confounded and seeing no help for it for she would not part with me out of her sight i was forced to set out with her in the chariot for she came thither on horseback with a manservant who rode by us the rest of the way leading her horse and now i gave over all thoughts of redemption and was in a desponding condition indeed well thought i here are strange pains taken to ruin a poor innocent helpless and even worthless young body this plot is laid too deep and has been too long hatching to be baffled i fear but then i put my trust in god who i knew was able to do every thing for me when all other possible means should fail and in him i was resolved to confide you may see yet oh that kills me for i know not whether ever you can see what i now write or no else you will see what sort of woman that mrs jewkes is compared to good mrs jervis by this every now and then she would be staring in my face in the chariot and squeezing my hand and saying why you are very pretty my silent dear and once she offered to kiss me but i said i dont like this sort of carriage mrs jewkes it is not like two persons of one sex she fell a laughing very confidently and said thats prettily said i vow then thou hadst rather be kissed by the other sex i fackins i commend thee for that i was sadly teased with her impertinence and bold way but no wonder she was innkeepers housekeeper before she came to my master and those sort of creatures dont want confidence you know and indeed she made nothing to talk boldly on twenty occasions and said two or three times when she saw the tears every now and then as we rid trickle down my cheeks i was sorely hurt truly to have the handsomest and finest young gentleman in five counties in love with me so i find i am got into the hands of a wicked procuress and if i was not safe with good mrs jervis and where every body loved me what a dreadful prospect have i now before me in the hands of a woman that seems to delight in filthiness o dear sirs what shall i do what shall i do surely i shall never be equal to all these things about eight at night we entered the courtyard of this handsome large old and lonely mansion that looks made for solitude and mischief as i thought by its appearance with all its brown nodding horrors of lofty elms and pines about it and here said i to myself i fear is to be the scene of my ruin unless god protect me who is allsufficient i was very sick at entering it partly from fatigue and partly from dejection of spirits and mrs jewkes got me some mulled wine and seemed mighty officious to welcome me thither and while she was absent ordering the wine the wicked robin came in to me and said i beg a thousand pardons for my part in this affair since i see your grief and your distress and i do assure you that i am sorry it fell to my task mighty well mr robert said i i never saw an execution but once and then the hangman asked the poor creatures pardon and wiped his mouth as you do and pleaded his duty and then calmly tucked up the criminal but i am no criminal as you all know and if i could have thought it my duty to obey a wicked master in his unlawful command i had saved you all the merit of this vile service i am sorry said he you take it so but every body dont think alike well said i you have done your part mr robert towards my ruin very faithfully and will have cause to be sorry may be at the long run when you shall see the mischief that comes of it your eyes were open and you knew i was to be carried to my fathers and that i was barbarously tricked and betrayed and i can only once more thank you for your part of it god forgive you so he went away a little sad what have you said to robin madam said mrs jewkes who came in as he went out the poor fellows ready to cry i need not be afraid of your following his example mrs jewkes said i i have been telling him that he has done his part to my ruin and he now cant help it so his repentance does me no good i wish it may him ill assure you madam said she i should be as ready to cry as he if i should do you any harm it is not in his power to help it now said i but your part is to come and you may choose whether youll contribute to my ruin or not why look ye madam said she i have a great notion of doing my duty to my master and therefore you may depend upon it if i can do that and serve you i will but you must think if your desire and his will come to clash once i shall do as he bids me let it be what it will pray mrs jewkes said i dont madam me so i am but a silly poor girl set up by the gambol of fortune for a maygame and now am to be something and now nothing just as that thinks fit to sport with me and let you and me talk upon a foot together for i am a servant inferior to you and so much the more as i am turned out of place ay ay says she i understand something of the matter you have so great power over my master that you may soon be mistress of us all and so i would oblige you if i could and i must and will call you madam for i am instructed to shew you all respect ill assure you who instructed you so to do said i who my master to be sure said she why said i how can that be you have not seen him lately no thats true said she but i have been expecting you here some time o the deep laid wickedness thought i and besides i have a letter of instructions by robin but may be i should not have said so much if you would shew them to me said i i should be able to judge how far i could or could not expect favour from you consistent with your duty to our master i beg your pardon fair mistress for that said she i am sufficiently instructed and you may depend upon it i will observe my orders and so far as they will let me so far will i oblige you and theres an end of it well said i you will not i hope do an unlawful or wicked thing for any master in the world look ye said she he is my master and if he bids me do any thing that i can do i think i ought to do it and let him who has his power to command me look to the lawfulness of it why said i suppose he should bid you cut my throat would you do it theres no danger of that said she but to be sure i would not for then i should be hanged for that would be murder well said i and suppose he should resolve to ensnare a poor young creature and ruin her would you assist him in that for to rob a person of her virtue is worse than cutting her throat why now says she how strangely you talk are not the two sexes made for one another and is it not natural for a gentleman to love a pretty woman and suppose he can obtain his desires is that so bad as cutting her throat and then the wretch fell a laughing and talked most impertinently and shewed me that i had nothing to expect from her virtue or conscience and this gave me great mortification for i was in hopes of working upon her by degrees so we ended our discourse here and i bid her shew me where i must lie why said she lie where you list madam i can tell you i must lie with you for the present for the present said i and torture then wrung my heart but is it in your instructions that you must lie with me yes indeed said she i am sorry for it said i why said she i am wholesome and cleanly too ill assure you yes said i i dont doubt that but i love to lie by myself how so said she was not mrs jervis your bedfellow at tother house well said i quite sick of her and my condition you must do as you are instructed i think i cant help myself and am a most miserable creature she repeated her insufferable nonsense mighty miserable indeed to be so well beloved by one of the finest gentlemen in england i am now come down in my writing to this present saturday and a deal i have written my wicked bedfellow has very punctual orders it seems for she locks me and herself in and ties the two keys for there is a double door to the room about her wrist when she goes to bed she talks of the house having been attempted to be broken open two or three times whether to fright me i cant tell but it makes me fearful though not so much as i should be if i had not other and greater fears i slept but little last night and got up and pretended to sit by the window which looks into the spacious gardens but i was writing all the time from break of day to her getting up and after when she was absent at breakfast she presented the two maids to me the cook and housemaid poor awkward souls that i can see no hopes of they seem so devoted to her and ignorance yet i am resolved if possible to find some way to escape before this wicked master comes there are besides of servants the coachman robert a groom a helper a footman all but robert and he is accessary to my ruin strange creatures that promise nothing and all likewise devoted to this woman the gardener looks like a good honest man but he is kept at a distance and seems reserved i wondered i saw not mr williams the clergyman but would not ask after him apprehending it might give some jealousy but when i had beheld the rest he was the only one i had hopes of for i thought his cloth would set him above assisting in my ruin but in the afternoon he came for it seems he has a little latin school in the neighbouring village which he attends and this brings him in a little matter additional to my masters favour till something better falls of which he has hopes he is a sensible sober young gentleman and when i saw him i confirmed myself in my hopes of him for he seemed to take great notice of my distress and grief for i could not hide it though he appeared fearful of mrs jewkes who watched all our motions and words he has an apartment in the house but is mostly at a lodging in the town for a conveniency of his little school only on saturday afternoon and sundays and he preaches sometimes for the minister of the village which is about three miles off i hope to go to church with him tomorrow sure it is not in her instructions to deny me he cant have thought of every thing and something may strike out for me there i have asked her for a feint because she shant think i am so well provided to indulge me with pen and ink though i have been using my own so freely when her absence would let me for i begged to be left to myself as much as possible she says she will let me have it but then i must promise not to send any writing out of the house without her seeing it i said it was only to divert my grief when i was by myself as i desired to be for i loved writing as well as reading but i had nobody to send to she knew well enough no not at present may be said she but i am told you are a great writer and it is in my instructions to see all you write so look you here said she i will let you have a pen and ink and two sheets of paper for this employment will keep you out of worse thoughts but i must see them always when i ask written or not written thats very hard said i but may i not have to myself the closet in the room where we lie with the key to lock up my things i believe i may consent to that said she and i will set it in order for you and leave the key in the door and there is a spinnet too said she if it be in tune you may play to divert you now and then for i know my old lady learnt you and below is my masters library you may take out what books you will and indeed these and my writing will be all my amusement for i have no work given me to do and the spinnet if in tune will not find my mind i am sure in tune to play upon it but i went directly and picked out some books from the library with which i filled a shelf in the closet she gave me possession of and from these i hope to receive improvement as well as amusement but no sooner was her back turned than i set about hiding a pen of my own here and another there for fear i should come to be denied and a little of my ink in a broken china cup and a little in another cup and a sheet of paper here and there among my linen with a little of the wax and a few wafers in several places lest i should be searched and something i thought might happen to open a way for my deliverance by these or some other means o the pride thought i i shall have if i can secure my innocence and escape the artful wiles of this wicked master for if he comes hither i am undone to be sure for this naughty woman will assist him rather than fail in the worst of his attempts and hell have no occasion to send her out of the way as he would have done mrs jervis once so i must set all my little wits at work it is a grief to me to write and not to be able to send to you what i write but now it is all the diversion i have and if god will favour my escape with my innocence as i trust he graciously will for all these black prospects with what pleasure shall i read them afterwards i was going to say pray for your dutiful daughter as i used but alas you cannot know my distress though i am sure i have your prayers and i will write on as things happen that if a way should open my scribble may be ready to be sent for what i do must be at a jerk to be sure o how i want such an obliging honesthearted man as john i am now come to sunday well here is a sad thing i am denied by this barbarous woman to go to church as i had built upon i might and she has huffed poor mr williams all to pieces for pleading for me i find he is to be forbid the house if she pleases poor gentleman all his dependance is upon my master who has a very good living for him if the incumbent die and he has kept his bed these four months of old age and dropsy he pays me great respect and i see pities me and would perhaps assist my escape from these dangers but i have nobody to plead for me and why should i wish to ruin a poor gentleman by engaging him against his interest yet one would do any thing to preserve ones innocence and providence would perhaps make it up to him o judge but how shall you see what i write of my distracted condition to be reduced to such a pass as to a desire to lay traps for mankind but he wants sadly to say something to me as he whisperingly hinted the wretch i think i will always call her the wretch henceforth abuses me more and more i was but talking to one of the maids just now indeed a little to tamper with her by degrees and she popt upon us and said nay madam dont offer to tempt poor innocent country maidens from doing their duty you wanted i hear she should take a walk with you but i charge you nan never stir with her nor obey her without letting me know it in the smallest trifles i say walk with you and where would you go i tro why barbarous mrs jewkes said i only to look a little up the elmwalk since you would not let me go to church nan said she to shew me how much they were all in her power pull off madams shoes and bring them to me i have taken care of her others indeed she shant said i nay said nan but i must if my mistress bids me so pray madam dont hinder me and so indeed would you believe it she took my shoes off and left me barefoot and for my share i have been so frighted at this that i have not power even to relieve my mind by my tears i am quite stupefied to be sure here i was forced to leave off now i will give you a picture of this wretch she is a broad squat pursy fat thing quite ugly if any thing human can be so called about forty years old she has a huge hand and an arm as thick as my waist i believe her nose is flat and crooked and her brows grow down over her eyes a dead spiteful grey goggling eye to be sure she has and her face is flat and broad and as to colour looks like as if it had been pickled a month in saltpetre i dare say she drinks she has a hoarse manlike voice and is as thick as she is long and yet looks so deadly strong that i am afraid she would dash me at her foot in an instant if i was to vex her so that with a heart more ugly than her face she frightens me sadly and i am undone to be sure if god does not protect me for she is very very wicked indeed she is this is poor helpless spite in me but the picture is too near the truth notwithstanding she sends me a message just now that i shall have my shoes again if i will accept of her company to walk with me in the garden to waddle with me rather thought i well tis not my business to quarrel with her downright i shall be watched the narrower if i do and so i will go with the hated wretch o for my dear mrs jervis or rather to be safe with my dear father and mother oh i am out of my wits for joy just as i have got my shoes on i am told john honest john is come on horseback a blessing on his faithful heart what joy is this but ill tell you more by and by i must not let her know i am so glad to see this dear blessed john to be sure alas but he looks sad as i see him out of the window what can be the matter i hope my dear parents are well and mrs jervis and mr longman and every body my naughty master not excepted for i wish him to live and repent of all his wickedness to poor me o dear heart what a world do we live in i am now come to take up my pen again but i am in a sad taking truly another puzzling trial to be sure here was john as i said and the poor man came to me with mrs jewkes who whispered that i would say nothing about the shoes for my own sake as she said the poor man saw my distress by my red eyes and my hagged looks i suppose for i have had a sad time of it you must needs think and though he would have hid it if he could yet his own eyes ran over oh mrs pamela said he oh mrs pamela well honest fellowservant said i i cannot help it at present i am obliged to your honesty and kindness to be sure and then he wept more said i for my heart was ready to break to see his grief for it is a touching thing to see a man cry tell me the worst is my master coming no no said he and sobbed well said i is there any news of my poor father and mother how do they do i hope well said he i know nothing to the contrary there is no mishap i hope to mrs jervis or to mr longman or my fellowservants no said he poor man with a long n o as if his heart would burst well thank god then said i the mans a fool said mrs jewkes i think what ado is here why sure thourt in love john dost thou not see young madam is well what ails thee man nothing at all said he but i am such a fool as to cry for joy to see good mrs pamela but i have a letter for you i took it and saw it was from my master so i put it in my pocket mrs jewkes said i you need not i hope see this no no said she i see whose it is well enough or else may be i must have insisted on reading it and here is one for you mrs jewkes said he but yours said he to me requires an answer which i must carry back early in the morning or to night if i can you have no more john said mrs jewkes for mrs pamela have you no said he i have not but every bodys kind love and service ay to us both to be sure said she john said i i will read the letter and pray take care of yourself for you are a good man god bless you and i rejoice to see you and hear from you all but i longed to say more only that nasty mrs jewkes so i went up and locked myself in my closet and opened the letter and this is a copy of it my dearest pamela i send purposely to you on an affair that concerns you very much and me somewhat but chiefly for your sake i am conscious that i have proceeded by you in such a manner as may justly alarm your fears and give concern to your honest friends and all my pleasure is that i can and will make you amends for the disturbance i have given you as i promised i sent to your father the day after your departure that he might not be too much concerned for you and assured him of my honour to you and made an excuse such an one as ought to have satisfied him for your not coming to him but this was not sufficient it seems for he poor man came to me next morning and set my family almost in an uproar about you o my dear girl what trouble has not your obstinacy given me and yourself too i had no way to pacify him but to promise that he should see a letter written from you to mrs jervis to satisfy him you are well now all my care in this case is for your aged parents lest they should be touched with too fatal a grief and for you whose duty and affection for them i know to be so strong and laudable for this reason i beg you will write a few lines to them and let me prescribe the form which i have done putting myself as near as i can in your place and expressing your sense with a warmth that i doubt will have too much possessed you after what is done and which cannot now be helped but which i assure you shall turn out honourably for you i expect not to be refused because i cannot possibly have any view in it but to satisfy your parents which is more your concern than mine and so i must beg you will not alter one tittle of the underneath if you do it will be impossible for me to send it or that it should answer the good end i propose by it i have promised that i will not approach you without your leave if i find you easy and not attempting to dispute or avoid your present lot i will keep to my word although it is a difficulty upon me nor shall your restraint last long for i will assure you that i am resolved very soon to convince you of my good intentions and with what ardour i am yours etc the letter he prescribed for me was as this dear mrs jervis i have instead of being driven by robin to my dear fathers been carried off where i have no liberty to tell however at present i am not used hardly and i write to beg you to let my dear father and mother whose hearts must be well nigh broken know that i am well and that i am and by the grace of god ever will be their honest as well as dutiful daughter and your obliged friend i must neither send date nor place but have most solemn assurances of honourable usage i knew not what to do on this most strange request and occasion but my heart bled so much for you my dear father who had taken the pains to go yourself and inquire after your poor daughter as well as for my dear mother that i resolved to write and pretty much in the above form that it might be sent to pacify you till i could let you somehow or other know the true state of the matter and i wrote thus to my strange wicked master himself sir if you knew but the anguish of my mind and how much i suffer by your dreadful usage of me you would surely pity me and consent to my deliverance what have i done that i should be the only mark of your cruelty i can have no hope no desire of living left me because i cannot have the least dependence after what has passed upon your solemn assurances it is impossible they should be consistent with the dishonourable methods you take nothing but your promise of not seeing me here in my deplorable bondage can give me the least ray of hope dont i beseech you drive the poor distressed pamela upon a rock that may be the destruction both of her soul and body you dont know sir how dreadfully i dare weak as i am of mind and intellect when my virtue is in danger and o hasten my deliverance that a poor unworthy creature below the notice of such a gentleman as you may not be made the sport of a high condition for no reason in the world but because she is not able to defend herself nor has a friend that can right her i have sir in part to shew my obedience to you but indeed i own more to give ease to the minds of my poor distressed parents whose poverty one would think should screen them from violences of this sort as well as their poor daughter followed pretty much the form you have prescribed for me in the letter to mrs jervis and the alterations i have made for i could not help a few are of such a nature as though they shew my concern a little yet must answer the end you are pleased to say you propose by this letter for gods sake good sir pity my lowly condition and my present great misery and let me join with all the rest of your servants to bless that goodness which you have extended to every one but the poor afflicted heartbroken pamela i thought when i had written this letter and that which he had prescribed it would look like placing a confidence in mrs jewkes to shew them to her and i shewed her at the same time my masters letter to me for i believed the value he expressed for me would give me credit with one who professed in every thing to serve him right or wrong though i had so little reason i fear to pride myself in it and i was not mistaken for it has seemed to influence her not a little and she is at present mighty obliging and runs over in my praises but is the less to be minded because she praises as much the author of my miseries and his honourable intentions as she calls them for i see that she is capable of thinking as i fear he does that every thing that makes for his wicked will is honourable though to the ruin of the innocent pray god i may find it otherwise though i hope whatever the wicked gentleman may intend that i shall be at last rid of her impertinent bold way of talk when she seems to think from his letter that he means honourably i am now come to monday the th day of my bondage and misery i was in hope to have an opportunity to see john and have a little private talk with him before he went away but it could not be the poor mans excessive sorrow made mrs jewkes take it into her head to think he loved me and so she brought up a message to me from him this morning that he was going i desired he might come up to my closet as i called it and she came with him the honest man as i thought him was as full of concern as before at taking leave and i gave him two letters the one for mrs jervis enclosed in another for my master but mrs jewkes would see me seal them up lest i should enclose any thing else i was surprised at the mans going away to see him drop a bit of paper just at the head of the stairs which i took up without being observed by mrs jewkes but i was a thousand times more surprised when i returned to my closet and opening it read as follows good mrs pamela i am grieved to tell you how much you have been deceived and betrayed and that by such a vile dog as i little did i think it would come to this but i must say if ever there was a rogue in the world it is me i have all along shewed your letters to my master he employed me for that purpose and he saw every one before i carried them to your father and mother and then scaled them up and sent me with them i had some business that way but not half so often as i pretended and as soon as i heard how it was i was ready to hang myself you may well think i could not stand in your presence o vile vile wretch to bring you to this if you are ruined i am the rogue that caused it all the justice i can do you is to tell you you are in vile hands and i am afraid will be undone in spite of all your sweet innocence and i believe i shall never live after i know it if you can forgive me you are exceeding good but i shall never forgive myself thats certain howsomever it will do you no good to make this known and mayhap i may live to do you service if i can i will i am sure i ought master kept your last two or three letters and did not send them at all i am the most abandoned wretch of wretches j arnold you see your undoing has been long hatching pray take care of your sweet self mrs jewkes is a devil but in my masters tother house you have not one false heart but myself out upon me for a villain my dear father and mother when you come to this place i make no doubt your hair will stand on end as mine does o the deceitfulness of the heart of man this john that i took to be the honestest of men that you took for the same that was always praising you to me and me to you and for nothing so much as for our honest hearts this very fellow was all the while a vile hypocrite and a perfidious wretch and helping to carry on my ruin but he says so much of himself that i will only sit down with this sad reflection that power and riches never want tools to promote their vilest ends and there is nothing so hard to be known as the heart of man i can but pity the poor wretch since he seems to have great remorse and i believe it best to keep his wickedness secret if it lies in my way i will encourage his penitence for i may possibly make some discoveries by it one thing i should mention in this place he brought down in a portmanteau all the clothes and things my lady and master had given me and moreover two velvet hoods and a velvet scarf that used to be worn by my lady but i have no comfort in them or any thing else mrs jewkes had the portmanteau brought into my closet and she shewed me what was in it but then locked it up and said she would let me have what i would out of it when i asked but if i had the key it might make me want to go abroad may be and so the confident woman put it in her pocket i gave myself over to sad reflections upon this strange and surprising discovery of johns and wept much for him and for myself too for now i see as he says my ruin has been long hatching that i can make no doubt what my masters honourable professions will end in what a heap of hard names does the poor fellow call himself but what must they deserve then who set him to work o what has this wicked master to answer for to be so corrupt himself and to corrupt others who would have been all innocent and to carry on a poor plot i am sure for a gentleman to ruin a poor creature who never did him harm nor wished him any and who can still pray for his happiness and his repentance i cant but wonder what these gentlemen as they are called can think of themselves for these vile doings john had some inducement for he hoped to please his master who rewarded him and was bountiful to him and the same may be said bad as she is for this same odious mrs jewkes but what inducement has my master for taking so much pains to do the devils work for him if he loves me as tis falsely called must he therefore lay traps for me to ruin me and make me as bad as himself i cannot imagine what good the undoing of such a poor creature as i can procure him to be sure i am a very worthless body people indeed say i am handsome but if i was so should not a gentleman prefer an honest servant to a guilty harlot and must he be more earnest to seduce me because i dread of all things to be seduced and would rather lose my life than my honesty well these are strange things to me i cannot account for them for my share but sure nobody will say that these fine gentlemen have any tempter but their own wicked wills his naughty master could run away from me when he apprehended his servants might discover his vile attempts upon me in that sad closet affair but is it not strange that he should not be afraid of the allseeing eye from which even that base plotting heart of his in its most secret motions could not be hid but what avail me these sorrowful reflections he is and will be wicked and designs me a victim to his lawless attempts if the god in whom i trust and to whom i hourly pray prevent it not tuesday and wednesday i have been hindered by this wicked womans watching me so close from writing on tuesday and so i will put both these days together i have been a little turn with her for an airing in the chariot and walked several times in the garden but have always her at my heels mr williams came to see us and took a walk with us once and while her back was just turned encouraged by the hint he had before given me i said sir i see two tiles upon that parsleybed might not one cover them with mould with a note between them on occasion a good hint said he let that sunflower by the backdoor of the garden be the place i have a key to the door for it is my nearest way to the town so i was forced to begin o what inventions will necessity push us upon i hugged myself at the thought and she coming to us he said as if he was continuing a discourse we were in no not extraordinary pleasant whats that whats that said mrs jewkes only said he the town im saying is not very pleasant no indeed said she it is not it is a poor town to my thinking are there any gentry in it said i and so we chatted on about the town to deceive her but my deceit intended no hurt to any body we then talked of the garden how large and pleasant and the like and sat down on the tufted slope of the fine fishpond to see the fishes play upon the surface of the water and she said i should angle if i would i wish said i youd be so kind to fetch me a rod and baits pretty mistress said she i know better than that ill assure you at this time i mean no harm said i indeed let me tell you said she i know none who have their thoughts more about them than you a body ought to look to it where you are but well angle a little tomorrow mr williams who is much afraid of her turned the discourse to a general subject i sauntered in and left them to talk by themselves but he went away to town and she was soon after me i had got to my pen and ink and i said i want some paper mrs jewkes putting what i was about in my bosom you know i have written two letters and sent them by john o how his name poor guilty fellow grieves me well said she you have some left one sheet did for those two letters yes said i but i used half another for a cover you know and see how i have scribbled the other half and so i shewed her a parcel of broken scraps of verses which i had tried to recollect and had written purposely that she might see and think me usually employed to such idle purposes ay said she so you have well ill give you two sheets more but let me see how you dispose of them either written or blank well thought i i hope still argus to be too hard for thee now argus the poets say had a hundred eyes and was set to watch with them all as she does she brought me the paper and said now madam let me see you write something i will said i and took the pen and wrote i wish mrs jewkes would be so good to me as i would be to her if i had it in my power thats pretty now said she well i hope i am but what then why then wrote i she would do me the favour to let me know what i have done to be made her prisoner and what she thinks is to become of me well and what then said she why then of consequence scribbled i she would let me see her instructions that i may know how far to blame or to acquit her thus i fooled on to shew her my fondness for scribbling for i had no expectation of any good from her that so she might suppose i employed myself as i said to no better purpose at other times for she will have it that i am upon some plot i am so silent and love so much to be by myself she would have made me write on a little further no said i you have not answered me why said she what can you doubt when my master himself assures you of his honour ay said i but lay your hand to your heart mrs jewkes and tell me if you yourself believe him yes said she to be sure i do but said i what do you call honour why said she what does he call honour think you ruin shame disgrace said i i fear pho pho said she if you have any doubt about it he can best explain his own meaning ill send him word to come and satisfy you if you will horrid creature said i all in a fright canst thou not stab me to the heart id rather thou wouldst than say such another word but i hope there is no such thought of his coming she had the wickedness to say no no he dont intend to come as i know of but if i was he i would not be long away what means the woman said i mean said she turning it off why i mean i would come if i was he and put an end to all your fears by making you as happy as you wish it is out of his power said i to make me happy great and rich as he is but by leaving me innocent and giving me liberty to go to my dear father and mother she went away soon after and i ended my letter in hopes to have an opportunity to lay it in the appointed place so i went to her and said i suppose as it is not dark i may take another turn in the garden it is too late said she but if you will go dont stay and nan see and attend madam as she called me so i went towards the pond the maid following me and dropt purposely my hussy and when i came near the tiles i said mrs anne i have dropt my hussy be so kind as to look for it i had it by the pond side she went back to look and i slipt the note between the tiles and covered them as quick as i could with the light mould quite unperceived and the maid finding the hussy i took it and sauntered in again and met mrs jewkes coming to see after me what i wrote was this reverend sir the want of an opportunity to speak my mind to you i am sure will excuse this boldness in a poor creature that is betrayed hither i have reason to think for the worst of purposes you know something to be sure of my story my native poverty which i am not ashamed of my late ladys goodness and my masters designs upon me it is true he promises honour and all that but the honour of the wicked is disgrace and shame to the virtuous and he may think he keeps his promises according to the notions he may allow himself to hold and yet according to nine and every good bodys basely ruin me i am so wretched and illtreated by this mrs jewkes and she is so illprincipled a woman that as i may soon want the opportunity which the happy hint of this day affords to my hopes i throw myself at once upon your goodness without the least reserve for i cannot be worse than i am should that fail me which i dare say to your power it will not for i see it sir in your looks i hope it from your cloth and i doubt it not from your inclination in a case circumstanced as my unhappy one is for sir in helping me out of my present distress you perform all the acts of religion in one and the highest mercy and charity both to the body and soul of a poor wretch that believe me sir has at present not so much as in thought swerved from her innocence is there not some way to be found out for my escape without danger to yourself is there no gentleman or lady of virtue in this neighbourhood to whom i may fly only till l can find a way to get to my poor father and mother cannot lady davers be made acquainted with my sad story by your conveying a letter to her my poor parents are so low in the world they can do nothing but break their hearts for me and that i fear will be the end of it my master promises if i will be easy as he calls it in my present lot he will not come down without my consent alas sir this is nothing for whats the promise of a person who thinks himself at liberty to act as he has done by me if he comes it must be to ruin me and come to be sure he will when he thinks he has silenced the clamours of my friends and lulled me as no doubt he hopes into a fatal security now therefore sir is all the time i have to work and struggle for the preservation of my honesty if i stay till he comes i am undone you have a key to the back garden door i have great hopes from that study good sir and contrive for me i will faithfully keep your secret yet i should be loath to have you suffer for me i say no more but commit this to the happy tiles in the bosom of that earth where i hope my deliverance will take root and bring forth such fruit as may turn to my inexpressible joy and your eternal reward both here and hereafter as shall ever pray your oppressed humble servant thursday this completes a terrible week since my setting out as i hoped to see you my dear father and mother o how different were my hopes then from what they are now yet who knows what these happy tiles may produce but i must tell you first how i have been beaten by mrs jewkes it is very true and thus it came about my impatience was great to walk in the garden to see if any thing had offered answerable to my hopes but this wicked mrs jewkes would not let me go without her and said she was not at leisure we had a great many words about it for i told her it was very hard i could not be trusted to walk by myself in the garden for a little air but must be dogged and watched worse than a thief she still pleaded her instructions and said she was not to trust me out of her sight and you had better said she be easy and contented i assure you for i have worse orders than you have yet found i remember added she your asking mr williams if there were any gentry in the neighbourhood this makes me suspect you want to get away to them to tell your sad dismal story as you call it my heart was at my mouth for i feared by that hint she had seen my letter under the tiles o how uneasy i was at last she said well since you take on so you may take a turn and i will be with you in a minute when i was out of sight of her window i speeded towards the hopeful place but was soon forced to slacken my pace by her odious voice hey day why so nimble and whither so fast said she what are you upon a wager i stopt for her till her pursy sides were waddled up to me and she held by my arm half out of breath so i was forced to pass by the dear place without daring to look at it the gardener was at work a little farther and so we looked upon him and i began to talk about his art but she said softly my instructions are not to let you be so familiar with the servants why said i are you afraid i should confederate with them to commit a robbery upon my master may be i am said the odious wretch for to rob him of yourself would be the worst that could happen to him in his opinion and pray said i walking on how came i to be his property what right has he in me but such as a thief may plead to stolen goods why was ever the like heard says she this is downright rebellion i protest well well lambkin which the foolish often calls me if i was in his place he should not have his property in you long questionable why what would you do said i if you were he not stand shillishalli as he does but put you and himself both out of your pain why jezebel said i i could not help it would you ruin me by force upon this she gave me a deadly slap upon my shoulder take that said she whom do you call jezebel i was so surprised for you never beat me my dear father and mother in your lives that i was like one thunderstruck and looked round as if i wanted somebody to help me but alas i had nobody and said at last rubbing my shoulder is this also in your instructions alas for me am i to be beaten too and so fell a crying and threw myself upon the grasswalk we were upon said she in a great pet i wont be called such names ill assure you marry come up i see you have a spirit you must and shall be kept under ill manage such little provoking things as you i warrant ye come come well go in adoors and ill lock you up and you shall have no shoes nor any thing else if this be the case i did not know what to do this was a cruel thing to me and i blamed myself for my free speech for now i have given her some pretence and o thought i here i have by my malapertness ruined the only project i had left the gardener saw this scene but she called to him well jacob what do you stare at pray mind what youre upon and away he walked to another quarter out of sight well thought i i must put on the dissembler a little i see she took my hand roughly come get up said she and come in adoors ill jezebel you i will so why dear mrs jewkes said i none of your dears and your coaxing said she why not jezebel again she was in a fearful passion i saw and i was out of my wits thought i i have often heard women blamed for their tongues i wish mine had been shorter but i cant go in said i indeed i cant why said she cant you ill warrant i can take such a thin body as you under my arm and carry you in if you wont walk you dont know my strength yes but i do said i too well and will you not use me worse when i come in so i arose and she muttered to herself all the way she to be a jezebel with me that had used me so well and such like when i came near the house i said sitting down upon a settlebench well i will not go in till you say you forgive me mrs jewkes if you will forgive my calling you that name i will forgive your beating me she sat down by me and seemed in a great pucker and said well come i will forgive you for this time and so kissed me as a mark of reconciliation but pray said i tell me where i am to walk and go and give me what liberty you can and when i know the most you can favour me with you shall see i will be as content as i can and not ask you for more ay said she this is something like i wish i could give you all the liberty you desire for you must think it is no pleasure to me to tie you to my petticoat as it were and not let you stir without me but people that will do their duties must have some trouble and what i do is to serve as good a master to be sure as lives yes said i to every body but me he loves you too well to be sure returned she and thats the reason so you ought to bear it i say love replied i come said she dont let the wench see you have been crying nor tell her any tales for you wont tell them fairly i am sure and ill send her and you shall take another walk in the garden if you will may be it will get you a stomach to your dinner for you dont eat enough to keep life and soul together you are beauty to the bone added the strange wretch or you could not look so well as you do with so little stomach so little rest and so much pining and whining for nothing at all well thought i say what thou wilt so i can be rid of thy bad tongue and company and i hope to find some opportunity now to come at my sunflower but i walked the other way to take that in my return to avoid suspicion i forced my discourse to the maid but it was all upon general things for i find she is asked after every thing i say and do when i came near the place as i had been devising i said pray step to the gardener and ask him to gather a sallad for me to dinner she called out jacob said i he cant hear you so far off and pray tell him i should like a cucumber too if he has one when she had stept about a bowshot from me i popt down and whipt my fingers under the upper tile and pulled out a letter without direction and thrust it in my bosom trembling for joy she was with me before i could well secure it and i was in such a taking that i feared i should discover myself you seem frightened madam said she why said i with a lucky thought alas your poor daughter will make an intriguer by and by but i hope an innocent one i stooped to smell at the sunflower and a great nasty worm ran into the ground that startled me for i cant abide worms said she sunflowers dont smell so i find replied i and then we walked in and mrs jewkes said well you have made haste now you shall go another time i went up to my closet locked myself in and opening my letter found in it these words i am infinitely concerned for your distress i most heartily wish it may be in my power to serve and save so much innocence beauty and merit my whole dependance is upon mr b and i have a near view of being provided for by his favour to me but yet i would sooner forfeit all my hopes in him trusting in god for the rest than not assist you if possible i never looked upon mr b in the light he now appears in to me in your case to be sure he is no professed debauchee but i am entirely of opinion you should if possible get out of his hands and especially as you are in very bad ones in mrs jewkess we have here the widow lady jones mistress of a good fortune and a woman of virtue i believe we have also old sir simon darnford and his lady who is a good woman and they have two daughters virtuous young ladies all the rest are but middling people and traders at best i will try if you please either lady jones or lady darnford if theyll permit you to take refuge with them i see no probability of keeping myself concealed in this matter but will as i said risk all things to serve you for i never saw a sweetness and innocence like yours and your hard case has attached me entirely to you for i know as you so happily express if i can serve you in this case i shall thereby perform all the acts of religion in one as to lady davers i will convey a letter if you please to her but it must not be from our posthouse i give you caution for the man owes all his bread to mr b and his place too and i believe by something that dropt from him over a can of ale has his instructions you dont know how you are surrounded all which confirms me in your opinion that no honour is meant you let what will be professed and i am glad you want no caution on that head give me leave to say that i had heard much in your praise but i think greatly short of what you deserve both as to person and mind my eyes convince me of the one your letter of the other for fear of losing the present lucky opportunity i am longer than otherwise i should be but i will not enlarge any further than to assure you that i am to the best of my power your faithful friend and servant arthur williams i will come once every morning and once every evening after school time to look for your letters ill come in and return without going into the house if i see the coast clear otherwise to avoid suspicion ill come in i instantly in answer to this pleasing letter wrote as follows reverend sir o how suited to your function and your character is your kind letter god bless you for it i now think i am beginning to be happy i should be sorry to have you suffer on my account but i hope it will be made up to you an hundredfold by that god whom you so faithfully serve i should be too happy could i ever have it in my power to contribute in the least to it but alas to serve me must be for gods sake only for i am poor and lowly in fortune though in mind i hope too high to do a mean or unworthy deed to gain a kingdom but i lose time any way you think best i should be pleased with for i know not the persons nor in what manner it is best to apply to them i am glad of the hint you so kindly give me of the man at the posthouse i was thinking of opening a way for myself by letter when i could have opportunity but i see more and more that i am indeed strangely surrounded with dangers and that there is no dependance to be made on my masters honour i should think sir if either of those ladies would give leave i might some way get out by favour of your key and as it is impossible watched as i am to know when it can be suppose sir you get one made by it and put it the next opportunity under the sunflower i am sure no time is to be lost because it is rather my wonder that she is not thoughtful about this key than otherwise for she forgets not the minutest thing but sir if i had this key i could if these ladies would not shelter me run away any where and if i was once out of the house they could have no pretence to force me again for i have done no harm and hope to make my story good to any compassionate body and by this way you need not to be known torture should not wring it from me i assure you one thing more good sir have you no correspondence with my masters bedfordshire family by that means may be i could be informed of his intention of coming hither and when i enclose you a letter of a deceitful wretch for i can trust you with any thing poor john arnold its contents will tell why i enclose it perhaps by his means something may be discovered for he seems willing to atone for his treachery to me by the intimation of future service i leave the hint to you to improve upon and am reverend sir your for ever obliged and thankful servant i hope sir by your favour i could send a little packet now and then some how to my poor father and mother i have a little stock of money about five or six guineas shall i put half in your hands to defray the charge of a man and horse or any other incidents i had but just time to transcribe this before i was called to dinner and i put that for mr williams with a wafer in it in my bosom to get an opportunity to lay it in the dear place o good sirs of all the flowers in the garden the sunflower sure is the loveliest it is a propitious one to me how nobly my plot succeeds but i begin to be afraid my writings may be discovered for they grow large i stitch them hitherto in my undercoat next my linen but if this brute should search me i must try to please her and then she wont well i am but just come off from a walk in the garden and have deposited my letter by a simple wile i got some horsebeans and we took a turn in the garden to angle as mrs jewkes had promised me she baited the hook and i held it and soon hooked a lovely carp play it play it said she i did and brought it to the bank a sad thought just then came into my head and i took it and threw it in again and o the pleasure it seemed to have to flounce in when at liberty why this says she o mrs jewkes said i i was thinking this poor carp was the unhappy pamela i was likening you and myself to my naughty master as we hooked and deceived the poor carp so was i betrayed by false baits and when you said play it play it it went to my heart to think i should sport with the destruction of the poor fish i had betrayed and i could not but fling it in again and did you not see the joy with which the happy carp flounced from us o said i may some good merciful body procure me my liberty in the same manner for to be sure i think my danger equal lord bless thee said she what a thought is there well i can angle no more added i ill try my fortune said she and took the rod do answered i and i will plant life if i can while you are destroying it i have some horsebeans here and will go and stick them in one of the borders to see how long they will be coming up and i will call them my garden so you see dear father and mother i hope now you will soon see for may be if i cant get away so soon myself i may send my papers some how i say you will see that this furnishes me with a good excuse to look after my garden another time and if the mould should look a little freshish it wont be so much suspected she mistrusted nothing of this and i went and stuck in here and there my beans for about the length of five ells of each side of the sunflower and easily deposited my letter and not a little proud am i of this contrivance sure something will do at last friday saturday i have just now told you a trick of mine now ill tell you a trick of this wicked womans she comes up to me says she i have a bill i cannot change till tomorrow and a tradesman wants his money most sadly and i dont love to turn poor tradesfolks away without their money have you any about you i have a little replied i how much will do oh said she i want eight pounds alack said i i have but between five and six lend me that said she till tomorrow i did so and she went down stairs and when she came up she laughed and said well i have paid the tradesman said i i hope youll give it me again tomorrow at that the assurance laughing loud said why what occasion have you for money to tell you the truth lambkin i didnt want it i only feared you might make a bad use of it and now i can trust nan with you a little oftener especially as i have got the key of your portmanteau so that you can neither corrupt her with money nor fine things never did any body look more silly than i o how i fretted to be so foolishly outwitted and the more as i had hinted to mr williams that i would put some in his hands to defray the charges of my sending to you i cried for vexation and now i have not five shillings left to support me if i can get away was ever such a fool as i i must be priding myself in my contrivances indeed said i was this your instructions wolfkin for she called me lambkin jezebel you mean child said she well i now forgive you heartily lets buss and be friends out upon you said i i cannot bear you but i durst not call her names again for i dread her huge paw most sadly the more i think of this thing the more do i regret it and blame myself this night the man from the posthouse brought a letter for mrs jewkes in which was one enclosed for me she brought it me up said she well my good master dont forget us he has sent you a letter and see what he writes to me so she read that he hoped her fair charge was well happy and contented ay to be sure said i i cant choose that he did not doubt her care and kindness to me that i was very dear to him and she could not use me too well and the like theres a master for you said she sure you will love and pray for him i desired her to read the rest no no said she but i wont said i are there any orders for taking my shoes away and for beating me no said she nor about jezebel neither well returned i i cry truce for i have no mind to be beat again i thought said she we had forgiven one another my letter is as follows my dear pamela i begin to repent already that i have bound myself by promise not to see you till you give me leave for i think the time very tedious can you place so much confidence in me as to invite me down assure yourself that your generosity shall not be thrown away upon me i the rather would press this as i am uneasy for your uneasiness for mrs jewkes acquaints me that you take your restraint very heavily and neither eat drink nor rest well and i have too great interest in your health not to wish to shorten the time of this trial which will be the consequence of my coming down to you john too has intimated to me your concern with a grief that hardly gave him leave for utterance a grief that a little alarmed my tenderness for you not that i fear any thing but that your disregard to me which yet my proud heart will hardly permit me to own may throw you upon some rashness that might encourage a daring hope but how poorly do i descend to be anxious about such a menial as he i will only say one thing that if you will give me leave to attend you at the hall consider who it is that requests this from you as a favour i solemnly declare that you shall have cause to be pleased with this obliging mark of your confidence in me and consideration for me and if i find mrs jewkes has not behaved to you with the respect due to one i so dearly love i will put it entirely into your power to discharge her the house if you think proper and mrs jervis or who else you please shall attend you in her place this i say on a hint john gave me as if you resented something from that quarter dearest pamela answer favourably this earnest request of one that cannot live without you and on whose honour to you you may absolutely depend and so much the more as you place a confidence in it i am and assuredly ever will be your faithful and affectionate etc you will be glad i know to hear your father and mother are well and easy upon your last letter that gave me a pleasure that i am resolved you shall not repent mrs jewkes will convey to me your answer i but slightly read this letter for the present to give way to one i had hopes of finding by this time from mr williams i took an evening turn as i called it in mrs jewkess company and walking by the place i said do you think mrs jewkes any of my beans can have struck since yesterday she laughed and said you are a poor gardener but i love to see you divert yourself she passing on i found my good friend had provided for me and slipping it in my bosom for her back was towards me here said i having a bean in my hand is one of them but it has not stirred no to be sure said she and turned upon me a most wicked jest unbecoming the mouth of a woman about planting etc when i came in i hied to my closet and read as follows i am sorry to tell you that i have had a repulse from lady jones she is concerned at your case she says but dont care to make herself enemies i applied to lady darnford and told her in the most pathetic manner i could your sad story and shewed her your more pathetic letter i found her well disposed but she would advise with sir simon who by the by is not a man of an extraordinary character for virtue but he said to his lady in my presence why what is all this my dear but that our neighbour has a mind to his mothers waitingmaid and if he takes care she wants for nothing i dont see any great injury will be done her he hurts no family by this so my dear father and mother it seems that poor peoples honesty is to go for nothing and i think mr williams you of all men should not engage in this affair against your friend and patron he spoke this in so determined a manner that the lady had done and i had only to beg no notice should be taken of the matter as from me i have hinted your case to mr peters the minister of this parish but i am concerned to say that he imputed selfish views to me as if i would make an interest in your affections by my zeal and when i represented the duties of our function and the like and protested my disinterestedness he coldly said i was very good but was a young man and knew little of the world and though it was a thing to be lamented yet when he and i should set about to reform mankind in this respect we should have enough upon our hands for he said it was too common and fashionable a case to be withstood by a private clergyman or two and then he uttered some reflections upon the conduct of the present fathers of the church in regard to the first personages of the realm as a justification of his coldness on this score i represented the different circumstances of your affair that other women lived evilly by their own consent but to serve you was to save an innocence that had but few examples and then i shewed him your letter he said it was prettily written and he was sorry for you and that your good intentions ought to be encouraged but what said he would you have me do mr williams why suppose sir said i you give her shelter in your house with your spouse and niece till she can get to her friends what and embroil myself with a man of mr bs power and fortune no not i ill assure you and i would have you consider what you are about besides she owns continued he that he promises to do honourably by her and her shyness will procure her good terns enough for he is no covetous nor wicked gentleman except in this case and tis what all young gentlemen will do i am greatly concerned for him i assure you but i am not discouraged by this ill success let what will come of it if i can serve you i dont hear as yet that mr b is coming i am glad of your hint as to that unhappy fellow john arnold something perhaps will strike out from that which may be useful as to your packets if you seal them up and lay them in the usual place if you find it not suspected i will watch an opportunity to convey them but if they are large you had best be very cautious this evil woman i find mistrusts me much i just hear that the gentleman is dying whose living mr b has promised me i have almost a scruple to take it as i am acting so contrary to his desires but i hope he will one day thank me for it as to money dont think of it at present be assured you may command all in my power to do for you without reserve i believe when we hear he is coming it will be best to make use of the key which i shall soon procure you and i can borrow a horse for you i believe to wait within half a mile of the backdoor over the pasture and will contrive by myself or somebody to have you conducted some miles distant to one of the villages thereabouts so dont be discomforted i beseech you i am excellent mrs pamela your faithful friend etc i made a thousand sad reflections upon the former part of this honest gentlemans kind letter and but for the hope he gave me at last should have given up my case as quite desperate i then wrote to thank him most gratefully for his kind endeavours to lament the little concern the gentry had for my deplorable case the wickedness of the world first to give way to such iniquitous fashions and then plead the frequency of them against the attempt to amend them and how unaffected people were with the distresses of others i recalled my former hint as to writing to lady davers which i feared i said would only serve to apprise her brother that she knew his wicked scheme and more harden him in it and make him come down the sooner and to be the more determined on my ruin besides that it might make mr williams guessed at as a means of conveying my letter and being very fearful that if that good lady would interest herself in my behalf which was a doubt because she both loved and feared her brother it would have no effect upon him and that therefore i would wait the happy event i might hope for from his kind assistance in the key and the horse i intimated my masters letter begging to be permitted to come down was fearful it might be sudden and that i was of opinion no time was to be lost for we might let slip all our opportunities telling him the money trick of this vile woman etc i had not time to take a copy of this letter i was so watched and when i had it ready in my bosom i was easy and so i went to seek out mrs jewkes and told her i would have her advice upon the letter i had received from my master which point of confidence in her pleased her not a little ay said she now this is something like and well take a turn in the garden or where you please i pretended it was indifferent to me and so we walked into the garden i began to talk to her of the letter but was far from acquainting her with all the contents only that he wanted my consent to come down and hoped she used me kindly and the like and i said now mrs jewkes let me have your advice as to this why then said she i will give it you freely een send to him to come down it will highly oblige him and i dare say youll fare the better for it how the better said i i dare say you think yourself that he intends my ruin i hate said she that foolish word your ruin why neer a lady in the land may live happier than you if you will or be more honourably used well mrs jewkes said i i shall not at this time dispute with you about the words ruin and honourable for i find we have quite different notions of both but now i will speak plainer than ever i did do you think he intends to make proposals to me as to a kept mistress or kept slave rather or do you not why lambkin said she what dost thou think thyself i fear said i he does well said she but if he does for i know nothing of the matter i assure you you may have your own terms i see that for you may do any thing with him i could not bear this to be spoken though it was all i feared of a long time and began to exclaim most sadly nay said she he may marry you as far as i know no no said i that cannot be i neither desire nor expect it his condition dont permit me to have such a thought and that and the whole series of his conduct convinces me of the contrary and you would have me invite him to come down would you is not this to invite my ruin tis what i would do said she in your place and if it was to be as you think i should rather be out of my pain than live in continual frights and apprehensions as you do no replied i an hour of innocence is worth an age of guilt and were my life to be made ever so miserable by it i should never forgive myself if i were not to lengthen out to the longest minute my happy time of honesty who knows what providence may do for me why may be said she as he loves you so well you may prevail upon him by your prayers and tears and for that reason i should think youd better let him come down well said i i will write him a letter because he expects an answer or may be he will make a pretence to come down how can it go ill take care of that said she it is in my instructions ay thought i so i doubt by the hint mr williams gave me about the posthouse the gardener coming by i said mr jacob i have planted a few beans and i call the place my garden it is just by the door out yonder ill shew it you pray dont dig them up so i went on with him and when we had turned the alley out of her sight and were near the place said i pray step to mrs jewkes and ask her if she has any more beans for me to plant he smiled i suppose at my foolishness and i popped the letter under the mould and stepped back as if waiting for his return which being near was immediate and she followed him what should i do with beans said she and sadly scared me for she whispered me i am afraid of some fetch you dont use to send on such simple errands what fetch said i it is hard i can neither stir nor speak but i must be suspected why said she my master writes that i must have all my eyes about me for though you are as innocent as a dove yet you are as cunning as a serpent but ill forgive you if you cheat me then i thought of my money and could have called her names had i dared and i said pray mrs jewkes now you talk of forgiving me if i cheat you be so kind as to pay me my money for though i have no occasion for it yet i know you was but in jest and intended to give it me again you shall have it in a proper time said she but indeed i was in earnest to get it out of your hands for fear you should make an ill use of it and so we cavilled upon this subject as we walked in and i went up to write my letter to my master and as i intended to shew it her i resolved to write accordingly as to her part of it for i made little account of his offer of mrs jervis to me instead of this wicked woman though the most agreeable thing that could have befallen me except my escape from hence nor indeed any thing he said for to be honourable in the just sense of the word he need not have caused me to be run away with and confined as i am i wrote as follows honoured sir when i consider how easily you might make me happy since all i desire is to be permitted to go to my poor father and mother when i reflect upon your former proposal to me in relation to a certain person not one word of which is now mentioned and upon my being in that strange manner run away with and still kept here a miserable prisoner do you think sir pardon your poor servants freedom my fears make me bold do you think i say that your general assurances of honour to me can have the effect upon me that were it not for these things all your words ought to have o good sir i too much apprehend that your notions of honour and mine are very different from one another and i have no other hopes but in your continued absence if you have any proposals to make me that are consistent with your honourable professions in my humble sense of the word a few lines will communicate them to me and i will return such an answer as befits me but oh what proposals can one in your high station have to make to one in my low one i know what belongs to your degree too well to imagine that any thing can be expected but sad temptations and utter distress if you come down and you know not sir when i am made desperate what the wretched pamela dares to do whatever rashness you may impute to me i cannot help it but i wish i may not be forced upon any that otherwise would never enter into my thoughts forgive me sir my plainness i should be loath to behave to my master unbecomingly but i must needs say sir my innocence is so dear to me that all other considerations are and i hope shall ever be treated by me as niceties that ought for that to be dispensed with if you mean honourably why sir should you not let me know it plainly why is it necessary to imprison me to convince me of it and why must i be close watched and attended hindered from stirring out from speaking to any body from going so much as to church to pray for you who have been till of late so generous a benefactor to me why sir i humbly ask why all this if you mean honourably it is not for me to expostulate so freely but in a case so near to me with you sir so greatly my superior pardon me i hope you will but as to seeing you i cannot bear the dreadful apprehension whatever you have to propose whatever you intend by me let my assent be that of a free person mean as i am and not of a sordid slave who is to be threatened and frightened into a compliance with measures which your conduct to her seems to imply would be otherwise abhorred by her my restraint is indeed hard upon me i am very uneasy under it shorten it i beseech you or but i will not dare to say more than that i am your greatly oppressed unhappy servant after i had taken a copy of this i folded it up and mrs jewkes coming just as i had done sat down by me and said when she saw me direct it i wish you would tell me if you have taken my advice and consented to my masters coming down if it will oblige you said i i will read it to you thats good said she then ill love you dearly said i then you must not offer to alter one word i wont replied she so i read it to her and she praised me much for my wording it but said she thought i pushed the matter very close and it would better bear talking of than writing about she wanted an explanation or two as about the proposal to a certain person but i said she must take it as she heard it well well said she i make no doubt you understand one another and will do so more and more i sealed up the letter and she undertook to convey it sunday for my part i knew it in vain to expect to have leave to go to church now and so i did not ask and i was the more indifferent because if i might have had permission the sight of the neighbouring gentry who had despised my sufferings would have given me great regret and sorrow and it was impossible i should have edified under any doctrine preached by mr peters so i applied myself to my private devotions mr williams came yesterday and this day as usual and took my letter but having no good opportunity we avoided one anothers conversation and kept at a distance but i was concerned i had not the key for i would not have lost a moment in that case had i been he and he i when i was at my devotion mrs jewkes came up and wanted me sadly to sing her a psalm as she had often on common days importuned me for a song upon the spinnet but i declined it because my spirits were so low i could hardly speak nor cared to be spoken to but when she was gone i remembering the cxxxviith psalm to be a little touching turned to it and took the liberty to alter it somewhat nearer to my case i hope i did not sin in it but thus i turned it i when sad i sat in bn hall all guarded round about and thought of evry absent friend the tears for grief burst out ii my joys and hopes all overthrown my heartstrings almost broke unfit my mind for melody much more to bear a joke iii then she to whom i prisner was said to me tauntingly now cheer your heart and sing a song and tune your mind to joy iv alas said i how can i frame my heavy heart to sing or tune my mind while thus enthralld by such a wicked thing v but yet if from my innocence i evn in thought should slide then let my fingers quite forget the sweet spinnet to guide vi and let my tongue within my mouth be lockd for ever fast if i rejoice before i see my full delivrance past vii and thou almighty recompense the evils i endure from those who seek my sad disgrace so causeless to procure viii remember lord this mrs jewkes when with a mighty sound she cries down with her chastity down to the very ground ix evn so shalt thou o wicked one at length to shame be brought and happy shall all those be calld that my delivrance wrought x yea blessed shall the man be called that shames thee of thy evil and saves me from thy vile attempts and thee too from the d l monday tuesday wednesday i write now with a little more liking though less opportunity because mr williams has got a large parcel of my papers safe in his hands to send them to you as he has opportunity so i am not quite uselessly employed and i am delivered besides from the fear of their being found if i should be searched or discovered i have been permitted to take an airing five or six miles with mrs jewkes but though i know not the reason she watches me more closely than ever so that we have discontinued by consent for these three days the sunflower correspondence the poor cookmaid has had a bad mischance for she has been hurt much by a bull in the pasture by the side of the garden not far from the back door now this pasture i am to cross which is about half a mile and then is a common and near that a private horseroad where i hope to find an opportunity for escaping as soon as mr williams can get me a horse and has made all ready for me for he has got me the key which he put under the mould just by the door as he found an opportunity to hint to me he just now has signified that the gentleman is dead whose living he has had hope of and he came pretendedly to tell mrs jewkes of it and so could speak this to her before me she wished him joy see what the world is one mans death is another mans joy thus we thrust out one another my hard case makes me serious he found means to slide a letter into my hands and is gone away he looked at me with such respect and solemness at parting that mrs jewkes said why madam i believe our young parson is half in love with you ah mrs jewkes said i he knows better said she i believe to sound me why i cant see you can either of you do better and i have lately been so touched for you seeing how heavily you apprehend dishonour from my master that i think it is pity you should not have mr williams i knew this must be a fetch of hers because instead of being troubled for me as she pretended she watched me closer and him too and so i said there is not the man living that i desire to marry if i can but keep myself honest it is all my desire and to be a comfort and assistance to my poor parents if it should be my happy lot to be so is the very top of my ambition well but said she i have been thinking very seriously that mr williams would make you a good husband and as he will owe all his fortune to my master he will be very glad to be sure to be obliged to him for a wife of his choosing especially said she such a pretty one and one so ingenious and genteelly educated this gave me a doubt whether she knew of my masters intimation of that sort formerly and i asked her if she had reason to surmise that that was in view no she said it was only her own thought but it was very likely that my master had either that in view or something better for me but if i approved of it she would propose such a thing to her master directly and gave a detestable hint that i might take resolutions upon it of bringing such an affair to effect i told her i abhorred her vile insinuation and as to mr williams i thought him a civil good sort of man but as on one side he was above me so on the other i said of all things i did not love a parson so finding she could make nothing of me she quitted the subject i will open his letter by and by and give you the contents of it for she is up and down so much that i am afraid of her surprising me well i see providence has not abandoned me i shall be under no necessity to make advances to mr williams if i was as i am sure i am not disposed to it this is his letter i know not how to express myself lest i should appear to you to have a selfish view in the service i would do you but i really know but one effectual and honourable way to disengage yourself from the dangerous situation you are in it is that of marriage with some person that you could make happy in your approbation as for my own part it would be as things stand my apparent ruin and worse still i should involve you in misery too but yet so great is my veneration for you and so entire my reliance on providence upon so just an occasion that i should think myself but too happy if i might be accepted i would in this case forego all my expectations and be your conductor to some safe distance but why do i say in this case that i will do whether you think fit to reward me so eminently or not and i will the moment i hear of mr bs setting out and i think now i have settled a very good method of intelligence of all his motions get a horse ready and myself to conduct you i refer myself wholly to your goodness and direction and am with the highest respect your most faithful humble servant dont think this a sudden resolution i always admired your hearsay character and the moment i saw you wished to serve so much excellence what shall i say my dear father and mother to this unexpected declaration i want now more than ever your blessing and direction but after all i have no mind to marry i had rather live with you but yet i would marry a man who begs from door to door and has no home nor being rather than endanger my honesty yet i cannot methinks hear of being a wife after a thousand different thoughts i wrote as follows reverend sir i am greatly confused at the contents of your last you are much too generous and i cant bear you should risk all your future prospects for so unworthy a creature i cannot think of your offer without equal concern and gratitude for nothing but to avoid my utter ruin can make me think of a change of condition and so sir you ought not to accept of such an involuntary compliance as mine would be were i upon the last necessity to yield to your very generous proposal i will rely wholly upon your goodness to me in assisting my escape but shall not on your account principally think of the honour you propose for me at present and never but at the pleasure of my parents who poor as they are in such a weighty point are as much entitled to my obedience and duty as if they were ever so rich i beg you therefore sir not to think of any thing from me but everlasting gratitude which shall always bind me to be your most obliged servant thursday friday saturday the th th and th of my bondage mrs jewkes has received a letter and is much civiller to me and mr williams too than she used to be i wonder i have not one in answer to mine to my master i suppose i put the matter too home to him and he is angry i am not the more pleased with her civility for she is horrid cunning and is not a whit less watchful i laid a trap to get at her instructions which she carries in the bosom of her stays but it has not succeeded my last letter is come safe to mr williams by the old conveyance so that he is not suspected he has intimated that though i have not come so readily as he hoped into his scheme yet his diligence shall not be slackened and he will leave it to providence and himself to dispose of him as he shall be found to deserve he has signified to me that he shall soon send a special messenger with the packet to you and i have added to it what has occurred since sunday i am just now quite astonished i hope all is right but i have a strange turn to acquaint you with mr williams and mrs jewkes came to me both together he in ecstacies she with a strange fluttering sort of air well said she mrs pamela i give you joy i give you joy let nobody speak but me then she sat down as out of breath puffing and blowing why every thing turns as i said it would said she why there is to be a match between you and mr williams well i always thought it never was so good a master go to go to naughty mistrustful mrs pamela nay mrs williams said the forward creature i may as good call you you ought on your knees to beg his pardon a thousand times for mistrusting him she was going on but i said dont torture me thus i beseech you mrs jewkes let me know all ah mr williams said i take care take care mistrustful again said she why mr williams shew her your letter and i will shew her mine they were brought by the same hand i trembled at the thoughts of what this might mean and said you have so surprised me that i cannot stand nor hear nor read why did you come up in such a manner to attack such weak spirits said he to mrs jewkes shall we leave our letters with mrs pamela and let her recover from her surprise ay said she with all my heart here is nothing but flaming honour and good will and so saying they left me their letters and withdrew my heart was quite sick with the surprise so that i could not presently read them notwithstanding my impatience but after a while recovering i found the contents thus strange and unexpected mr williams the death of mr fownes has now given me the opportunity i have long wanted to make you happy and that in a double respect for i shall soon put you in possession of his living and if you have the art of making yourself well received of one of the loveliest wives in england she has not been used as she has reason to think according to her merit but when she finds herself under the protection of a man of virtue and probity and a happy competency to support life in the manner to which she has been of late years accustomed i am persuaded she will forgive those seeming hardships which have paved the way to so happy a lot as i hope it will be to you both i have only to account for and excuse the odd conduct i have been guilty of which i shall do when i see you but as i shall soon set out for london i believe it will not be yet this month mean time if you can prevail with pamela you need not suspend for that your mutual happiness only let me have notice of it first and that she approves of it which ought to be in so material a point entirely at her option as i assure you on the other hand i would have it at yours that nothing may be wanting to complete your happiness i am your humble servant was ever the like heard lie still my throbbing heart divided as thou art between thy hopes and thy fears but this is the letter mrs jewkes left with me mrs jewkes you have been very careful and diligent in the task which for reasons i shall hereafter explain i had imposed upon you your trouble is now almost at an end for i have written my intentions to mr williams so particularly that i need say the less here because he will not scruple i believe to let you know the contents of my letter i have only one thing to mention that if you find what i have hinted to him in the least measure disagreeable to either you assure them both that they are at entire liberty to pursue their own inclinations i hope you continue your civilities to the mistrustful uneasy pamela who now will begin to think better of hers and your friend etc i had hardly time to transcribe these letters though writing so much i write pretty fast before they both came up again in high spirits and mr williams said i am glad at my heart madam that i was beforehand in my declarations to you this generous letter has made me the happiest man on earth and mrs jewkes you may be sure that if i can procure this fair ones consent i shall think myself i interrupted the good man and said ah mr williams take care take care dont let there i stopt and mrs jewkes said still mistrustful i never saw the like in my life but i see said she i was not wrong while my old orders lasted to be wary of you both i should have had a hard task to prevent you i find for as the saying is nought can restrain consent of twain i doubted not her taking hold of his joyful indiscretion i took her letter and said here mrs jewkes is yours i thank you for it but i have been so long in a maze that i can say nothing of this for the present time will bring all to light sir said i here is yours may every thing turn to your happiness i give you joy of my masters goodness in the living it will be dying said he not a living without you forbear sir said i while i have a father and mother i am not my own mistress poor as they are and ill see myself quite at liberty before i shall think myself fit to make a choice mrs jewkes held up her eyes and hands and said such art such caution such cunning for thy years well why said i that he might be more on his guard though i hope there cannot be deceit in this twould be strange villany and that is a hard word if there should i have been so used to be made a fool of by fortune that i hardly can tell how to govern myself and am almost an infidel as to mankind but i hope i may be wrong henceforth mrs jewkes you shall regulate my opinions as you please and i will consult you in every thing that i think proper said i to myself for to be sure though i may forgive her i can never love her she left mr williams and me a few minutes together and i said consider sir consider what you have done tis impossible said he there can be deceit i hope so said i but what necessity was there for you to talk of your former declaration let this be as it will that could do no good especially before this woman forgive me sir they talk of womens promptness of speech but indeed i see an honest heart is not always to be trusted with itself in bad company he was going to reply but though her task is said to be almost i took notice of that word at an end she came up to us again and said well i had a good mind to show you the way to church tomorrow i was glad of this because though in my present doubtful situation i should not have chosen it yet i would have encouraged her proposal to be able to judge by her being in earnest or otherwise whether one might depend upon the rest but mr williams again indiscreetly helped her to an excuse by saying that it was now best to defer it one sunday and till matters were riper for my appearance and she readily took hold of it and confirmed his opinion after all i hope the best but if this should turn out to be a plot i fear nothing but a miracle can save me but sure the heart of man is not capable of such black deceit besides mr williams has it under his own hand and he dare not but be in earnest and then again though to be sure he has been very wrong to me yet his education and parents example have neither of them taught him such very black contrivances so i will hope for the best mr williams mrs jewkes and i have been all three walking together in the garden and she pulled out her key and we walked a little in the pasture to look at the bull an ugly grim surly creature that hurt the poor cookmaid who is got pretty well again mr williams pointed at the sunflower but i was forced to be very reserved to him for the poor gentleman has no guard no caution at all we have just supped together all three and i cannot yet think that all must be right only i am resolved not to marry if i can help it and i will give no encouragement i am resolved at least till i am with you mr williams said before mrs jewkes he would send a messenger with a letter to my father and mother i think the man has no discretion in the world but l desire you will send no answer till i have the pleasure and happiness which now i hope for soon of seeing you he will in sending my packet send a most tedious parcel of stuff of my oppressions my distresses my fears and so i will send this with it for mrs jewkes gives me leave to send a letter to my father which looks well and i am glad i can conclude after all my sufferings with my hopes to be soon with you which i know will give you comfort and so i rest begging the continuance of your prayers and blessings your ever dutiful daughter my dear father and mother i have so much time upon my hands that i must write on to employ myself the sunday evening where i left off mrs jewkes asked me if i chose to be by myself i said yes with all my heart if she pleased well said she after tonight you shall i asked her for more paper and she gave me a bottle of ink eight sheets of paper which she said was all her store for now she would get me to write for her to our master if she had occasion and six pens with a piece of sealing wax this looks mighty well she pressed me when she came to bed very much to give encouragement to mr williams and said many things in his behalf and blamed my shyness to him i told her i was resolved to give no encouragement till i had talked to my father and mother she said he fancied i thought of somebody else or i could never be so insensible i assured her as i could do very safely that there was not a man on earth i wished to have and as to mr williams he might do better by far and i had proposed so much happiness in living with my poor father and mother that i could not think of any scheme of life with pleasure till i had tried that i asked her for my money and she said it was above in her strong box but that i should have it tomorrow all these things look well as i said mr williams would go home this night though late because he would despatch a messenger to you with a letter he had proposed from himself and my packet but pray dont encourage him as i said for he is much too heady and precipitate as to this matter in my way of thinking though to be sure he is a very good man and i am much obliged to him monday morning alasaday we have bad news from poor mr williams he has had a sad mischance fallen among rogues in his way home last night but by good chance has saved my papers this is the account he gives of it to mrs jewkes good mrs jewkes i have had a sore misfortune in going from you when i had got as near the town as the dam and was going to cross the wooden bridge two fellows got hold of me and swore bitterly they would kill me if i did not give them what i had they rummaged my pockets and took from me my snuffbox my sealring and half a guinea and some silver and halfpence also my handkerchief and two or three letters i had in my pockets by good fortune the letter mrs pamela gave me was in my bosom and so that escaped but they bruised my head and face and cursing me for having no more money tipped me into the dam crying be there parson till tomorrow my shins and knees were bruised much in the fall against one of the stumps and i had like to have been suffocated in water and mud to be sure i shant be able to stir out this day or two for i am a frightful spectacle my hat and wig i was forced to leave behind me and go home a mile and a half without but they were found next morning and brought me with my snuffbox which the rogues must have dropped my cassock is sadly torn as is my band to be sure i was much frightened for a robbery in these parts has not been known many years diligent search is making after the rogues my humble respects to good mrs pamela if she pities my misfortunes i shall be the sooner well and fit to wait on her and you this did not hinder me in writing a letter though with great pain as i do this to be sure this good man can keep no secret and sending it away by a man and horse this morning i am good mrs jewkes your most obliged humble servant god be praised it is no worse and i find i have got no cold though miserably wet from top to toe my fright i believe prevented me from catching cold for i was not rightly myself for some hours and know not how i got home i will write a letter of thanks this night if i am able to my kind patron for his inestimable goodness to me i wish i was enabled to say all i hope with regard to the better part of his bounty to me incomparable mrs pamela the wicked brute fell a laughing when she had read this letter till her fat sides shook said she i can but think how the poor parson looked after parting with his pretty mistress in such high spirits when he found himself at the bottom of the dam and what a figure he must cut in his tattered band and cassock and without a hat and wig when he got home i warrant added she he was in a sweet pickle i said i thought it was very barbarous to laugh at such a misfortune but she replied as he was safe she laughed otherwise she would have been sorry and she was glad to see me so concerned for him it looked promising she said i heeded not her reflections but as i have been used to causes for mistrusts i cannot help saying that i dont like this thing and their taking his letters most alarms me how happy it was they missed my packet i knew not what to think of it but why should i let every accident break my peace yet it will do so while i stay here mrs jewkes is mightily at me to go with her in the chariot to visit mr williams she is so officious to bring on the affair between us that being a cunning artful woman i know not what to make of it i have refused her absolutely urging that except i intended to encourage his suit i ought not to do it and she is gone without me i have strange temptations to get away in her absence for all these fine appearances tis sad to have nobody to advise with i know not what to do but alas for me i have no money if i should to buy any bodys civilities or to pay for necessaries or lodgings but ill go into the garden and resolve afterwards i have been in the garden and to the backdoor and there i stood my heart up at my mouth i could not see i was watched so this looks well but if any thing should go bad afterwards i should never forgive myself for not taking this opportunity well i will go down again and see if all is clear and how it looks out at the backdoor in the pasture to be sure there is witchcraft in this house and i believe lucifer is bribed as well as all about me and is got into the shape of that nasty grim bull to watch me for i have been again and ventured to open the door and went out about a bowshot into the pasture but there stood that horrid bull staring me full in the face with fiery saucer eyes as i thought so i got in again for fear he should come at me nobody saw me however do you think there are such things as witches and spirits if there be i believe in my heart mrs jewkes has got this bull of her side but yet what could i do without money or a friend o this wicked woman to trick me so every thing man woman and beast is in a plot against your poor pamela i think then i know not one step of the way nor how far to any house or cottage and whether i could gain protection if i got to a house and now the robbers are abroad too i may run into as great danger as i want to escape nay greater much if these promising appearances hold and sure my master cannot be so black as that they should not what can i do i have a good mind to try for it once more but then i may be pursued and taken and it will be worse for me and this wicked woman will beat me and take my shoes away and lock me up but after all if my master should mean well he cant be angry at my fears if i should escape and nobody can blame me and i can more easily be induced with you when all my apprehensions are over to consider his proposal of mr williams than i could here and he pretends as you have read in his letter he will leave me to my choice why then should i be afraid i will go down again i think but yet my heart misgives me because of the difficulties before me in escaping and being so poor and so friendless o good god the preserver of the innocent direct me what to do well i have just now a sort of strange persuasion upon me that i ought to try to get way and leave the issue to providence so once more ill see at least if this bull be still there alackaday what a fate is this i have not the courage to go neither can i think to stay but i must resolve the gardener was in sight last time so made me come up again but ill contrive to send him out of the way if i can for if i never should have such another opportunity i could not forgive myself once more ill venture god direct my footsteps and make smooth my path and my way to safety well here i am come back again frightened like a fool out of all my purposes o how terrible every thing appears to me i had got twice as far again as i was before out of the backdoor and i looked and saw the bull as i thought between me and the door and another bull coming towards me the other way well thought i here is double witchcraft to be sure here is the spirit of my master in one bull and mrs jewkess in the other and now i am gone to be sure o help cried i like a fool and ran back to the door as swift as if i flew when i had got the door in my hand i ventured to look back to see if these supposed bulls were coming and i saw they were only two poor cows a grazing in distant places that my fears had made all this rout about but as every thing is so frightful to me i find i am not fit to think of my escape for i shall be as much frightened at the first strange man that i meet with and i am persuaded that fear brings one into more dangers than the caution that goes along with it delivers one from i then locked the door and put the key in my pocket and was in a sad quandary but i was soon determined for the maid nan came in sight and asked if any thing was the matter that i was so often up and down stairs god forgive me but i had a sad lie at my tongues end said i though mrs jewkes is sometimes a little hard upon me yet i know not where i am without her i go up and i come down to walk about in the garden and not having her know scarcely what to do with myself ay said the ideot she is main good company madam no wonder you miss her so here i am again and here likely to be for i have no courage to help myself any where else o why are poor foolish maidens tried with such dangers when they have such weak minds to grapple with them i will since it is so hope the best but yet i cannot but observe how grievously every thing makes against me for here are the robbers though i fell not into their hands myself yet they gave me as much terror and had as great an effect upon my fears as if i had and here is the bull it has as effectually frightened me as if i had been hurt by it instead of the cookmaid and so these joined together as i may say to make a very dastard of me but my folly was the worst of all because that deprived me of my money for had i had that i believe i should have ventured both the bull and the robbers monday afternoon so mrs jewkes is returned from her visit well said she i would have you set your heart at rest for mr williams will do very well again he is not half so bad as he fancied o these scholars said she they have not the hearts of mice he has only a few scratches on his face which said she i suppose he got by grappling among the gravel at the bottom of the dam to try to find a hole in the ground to hide himself from the robbers his shin and his knee are hardly to be seen to ail any thing he says in his letter he was a frightful spectacle he might be so indeed when he first came in a doors but he looks well enough now and only for a few groans now and then when he thinks of his danger i see nothing is the matter with him so mrs pamela said she i would have you be very easy about it i am glad of it said i for all your jokes to mrs jewkes well said she he talks of nothing but you and when i told him i would fain have persuaded you to come with me the man was out of his wits with his gratitude to me and so has laid open all his heart to me and told me all that has passed and was contriving between you two this alarmed me prodigiously and the rather as i saw by two or three instances that his honest heart could keep nothing believing every one as undesigning as himself i said but yet with a heavy heart ah mrs jewkes mrs jewkes this might have done with me had he had any thing that he could have told you of but you know well enough that had we been disposed we had no opportunity for it from your watchful care and circumspection no said she thats very true mrs pamela not so much as for that declaration that he owned before me he had found opportunity for all my watchfulness to make you come come said she no more of these shams with me you have an excellent headpiece for your years but may be i am as cunning as you however said she all is well now because my watchments are now over by my masters direction how have you employed yourself in my absence i was so troubled at what might have passed between mr williams and her that i could not hide it and she said well mrs pamela since all matters are likely to be so soon and so happily ended let me advise you to be a little less concerned at his discoveries and make me your confidant as he has done and i shall think you have some favour for me and reliance upon me and perhaps you might not repent it she was so earnest that i mistrusted she did this to pump me and i knew how now to account for her kindness to mr williams in her visit to him which was only to get out of him what she could why mrs jewkes said i is all this fishing about for something where there is nothing if there be an end of your watchments as you call them nothing said she but womanish curiosity ill assure you for one is naturally led to find out matters where there is such privacy intended well said i pray let me know what he has said and then ill give you an answer to your curiosity i dont care said she whether you do or not for i have as much as i wanted from him and i despair of getting out of you any thing you hant a mind i should know my little cunning dear well said i let him have said what he would i care not for i am sure he can say no harm of me and so let us change the talk i was the easier indeed because for all her pumps she gave no hints of the key and the door etc which had he communicated to her she would not have forborne giving me a touch of and so we gave up one another as despairing to gain our ends of each other but i am sure he must have said more than he should and i am the more apprehensive all is not right because she has now been actually these two hours shut up a writing though she pretended she had given me up all her stores of papers etc and that i should write for her i begin to wish i had ventured every thing and gone off when i might o when will this state of doubt and uneasiness end she has just been with me and says she shall send a messenger to bedfordshire and he shall carry a letter of thanks for me if i will write it for my masters favour to me indeed said i i have no thanks to give till i am with my father and mother and besides i sent a letter as you know but have had no answer to it she said she thought that his letter to mr williams was sufficient and the least i could do was to thank him if but in two lines no need of it said i for i dont intend to have mr williams what then is that letter to me well said she i see thou art quite unfathomable i dont like all this o my foolish fears of bulls and robbers for now all my uneasiness begins to double upon me o what has this incautious man said that no doubt is the subject of her long letter i will close this days writing with just saying that she is mighty silent and reserved to what she was and says nothing but no or yes to what i ask something must be hatching i doubt i the rather think so because i find she does not keep her word with me about lying by myself and my money to both which points she returned suspicious answers saying as to the one why you are mighty earnest for your money i shant run away with it and to the other goodlack you need not be so willing as i know of to part with me for a bedfellow till you are sure of one you like better this cut me to the heart and at the same time stopped my mouth tuesday wednesday mr williams has been here but we have had no opportunity to talk together he seemed confounded at mrs jewkess change of temper and reservedness after her kind visit and their freedom with one another and much more at what i am going to tell you he asked if i would take a turn in the garden with mrs jewkes and him no said she i cant go said he may not mrs pamela take a walk no said she i desire she wont why mrs jewkes said he i am afraid i have somehow disobliged you not at all replied she but i suppose you will soon be at liberty to walk together as much as you please and i have sent a messenger for my last instructions about this and more weighty matters and when they come i shall leave you to do as you both will but till then it is no matter how little you are together this alarmed us both and he seemed quite struck of a heap and put on as i thought a selfaccusing countenance so i went behind her back and held my two hands together flat with a bit of paper i had between them and looked at him and he seemed to take me as i intended intimating the renewing of the correspondence by the tiles i left them both together and retired to my closet to write a letter for the tiles but having no time for a copy i will give you the substance only i expostulated with him on his too great openness and easiness to fall into mrs jewkess snares told him my apprehensions of foul play and gave briefly the reasons which moved me begged to know what he had said and intimated that i thought there was the highest reason to resume our prospect of the escape by the backdoor i put this in the usual place in the evening and now wait with impatience for an answer thursday i have the following answer dearest madam i am utterly confounded and must plead guilty to all your just reproaches i wish i were master of all but half your caution and discretion i hope after all this is only a touch of this ill womans temper to shew her power and importance for i think mr b neither can nor dare deceive me in so black a manner i would expose him all the world over if he did but it is not cannot be in him i have received a letter from john arnold in which he tells me that his master is preparing for his london journey and believes afterwards he will come into these parts but he says lady davers is at their house and is to accompany her brother to london or meet him there he knows not which he professes great zeal and affection to your service and i find he refers to a letter he sent me before but which is not come to my hand i think there can be no treachery for it is a particular friend at gainsborough that i have ordered him to direct to and this is come safe to my hands by this means for well i know i durst trust nothing to brett at the posthouse here this gives me a little pain but i hope all will end well and we shall soon hear if it be necessary to pursue our former intentions if it be i will lose no time to provide a horse for you and another for myself for i can never do either god or myself better service though i were to forego all my expectations for it here i am your most faithful humble servant i was too free indeed with mrs jewkes led to it by her dissimulation and by her pretended concern to make me happy with you i hinted that i would not have scrupled to have procured your deliverance by any means and that i had proposed to you as the only honourable one marriage with me but i assured her though she would hardly believe me that you discouraged my application which is too true but not a word of the backdoor key etc mrs jewkes continues still sullen and illnatured and i am almost afraid to speak to her she watches me as close as ever and pretends to wonder why i shun her company as i do i have just put under the tiles these lines inspired by my fears which are indeed very strong and i doubt not without reason sir every thing gives me additional disturbance the missed letter of john arnolds makes me suspect a plot yet am i loath to think myself of so much importance as to suppose every one in a plot against me are you sure however the london journey is not to be a lincolnshire one may not john who has been once a traitor be so again why need i be thus in doubt if i could have this horse i would turn the reins on his neck and trust to providence to guide him for my safeguard for i would not endanger you now just upon the edge of your preferment yet sir i fear your fatal openness will make you suspected as accessary let us be ever so cautious were my life in question instead of my honesty i would not wish to involve you or any body in the least difficulty for so worthless a poor creature but o sir my soul is of equal importance with the soul of a princess though my quality is inferior to that of the meanest slave save then my innocence good heaven and preserve my mind spotless and happy shall i be to lay down my worthless life and see an end to all my troubles and anxieties forgive my impatience but my presaging mind bodes horrid mischiefs every thing looks dark around me and this womans impenetrable sullenness and silence without any apparent reason from a conduct so very contrary bid me fear the worst blame me sir if you think me wrong and let me have your advice what to do which will oblige your most afflicted servant friday i have this halfangry answer but what is more to me than all the letters in the world could be yours my dear father enclosed madam i think you are too apprehensive by much i am sorry for your uneasiness you may depend upon me and all i can do but i make no doubt of the london journey nor of johns contrition and fidelity i have just received from my gainsborough friend this letter as i suppose from your good father in a cover directed for me as i had desired i hope it contains nothing to add to your uneasiness pray dearest madam lay aside your fears and wait a few days for the issue of mrs jewkess letter and mine of thanks to mr b things i hope must be better than you expect providence will not desert such piety and innocence and be this your comfort and reliance which is the best advice that can at present be given by your most faithful humble servant n b the fathers letter was as follows my dearest daughter our prayers are at length heard and we are overwhelmed with joy o what sufferings what trials hast thou gone through blessed be the divine goodness which has enabled thee to withstand so many temptations we have not yet had leisure to read through your long accounts of all your hardships i say long because i wonder how you could find time and opportunity for them but otherwise they are the delight of our spare hours and we shall read them over and over as long as we live with thankfulness to god who has given us so virtuous and so discreet a daughter how happy is our lot in the midst of our poverty o let none ever think children a burden to them when the poorest circumstances can produce so much riches in a pamela persist my dear daughter in the same excellent course and we shall not envy the highest estate but defy them to produce such a daughter as ours i said we had not read through all yours in course we were too impatient and so turned to the end where we find your virtue within view of its reward and your masters heart turned to see the folly of his ways and the injury he had intended to our dear child for to be sure my dear he would have ruined you if he could but seeing your virtue his heart is touched and he has no doubt been awakened by your good example we dont see that you can do any way so well as to come into the present proposal and make mr williams the worthy mr williams god bless him happy and though we are poor and can add no merit no reputation no fortune to our dear child but rather must be a disgrace to her as the world will think yet i hope i do not sin in my pride to say that there is no good man of a common degree especially as your late ladys kindness gave you such good opportunities which you have had the grace to improve but may think himself happy in you but as you say you had rather not marry at present far be it from us to offer violence to your inclination so much prudence as you have shewn in all your conduct would make it very wrong in us to mistrust it in this or to offer to direct you in your choice rut alas my child what can we do for you to partake our hard lot and involve yourself into as hard a life would not help us but add to your afflictions but it will be time enough to talk of these things when we have the pleasure you now put us in hope of of seeing you with us which god grant amen amen say your most indulgent parents amen our humblest service and thanks to the worthy mr williams again we say god bless him for ever o what a deal we have to say to you god give us a happy meeting we understand the squire is setting out for london he is a fine gentleman and has wit at will i wish he was as good but i hope he will now reform o what inexpressible comfort my dear father has your letter given me you ask what can you do for me what is it you cannot do for your child you can give her the advice she has so much wanted and still wants and will always want you can confirm her in the paths of virtue into which you first initiated her and you can pray for her with hearts so sincere and pure that are not to be met with in palaces oh how i long to throw myself at your feet and receive from your own lips the blessings of such good parents but alas how are my prospects again overclouded to what they were when i closed my last parcel more trials more dangers i fear must your poor pamela be engaged in but through the divine goodness and your prayers i hope at last to get well out of all my difficulties and the rather as they are not the effect of my own vanity or presumption but i will proceed with my hopeless story i saw mr williams was a little nettled at my impatience and so i wrote to assure him i would be as easy as i could and wholly directed by him especially as my father whose respects i mentioned had assured me my master was setting out for london which he must have somehow from his own family or he would not have written me word of it saturday sunday mr williams has been here both these days as usual but is very indifferently received still by mrs jewkes and to avoid suspicion i left them together and went up to my closet most of the time he was here he and she i found by her had a quarrel and she seems quite out of humour with him but i thought it best not to say any thing and he said he would very little trouble the house till he had an answer to his letter from mr b and she returned the less the better poor man he has got but little by his openness making mrs jewkes his confidant as she bragged and would have had me to do likewise i am more and more satisfied there is mischief brewing and shall begin to hide my papers and be circumspect she seems mighty impatient for an answer to her letter to my master monday tuesday the th and th days of my heavy restraint still more and more strange things to write a messenger is returned and now all is out o wretched wretched pamela what at last will become of me such strange turns and trials sure never poor creature of my years experienced he brought two letters one to mrs jewkes and one to me but as the greatest wits may be sometimes mistaken they being folded and sealed alike that for me was directed to mrs jewkes and that for her was directed to me but both are stark naught abominably bad she brought me up that directed for me and said heres a letter for you longlookedfor is come at last i will ask the messenger a few questions and then i will read mine so she went down and i broke it open in my closet and found it directed to mrs pamela andrews but when i opened it it began mrs jewkes i was quite confounded but thought i this may be a lucky mistake i may discover something and so i read on these horrid contents mrs jewkes what you write me has given me no small disturbance this wretched fools plaything no doubt is ready to leap at any thing that offers rather than express the least sense of gratitude for all the benefits she has received from my family and which i was determined more and more to heap upon her i reserve her for my future resentment and i charge you double your diligence in watching her to prevent her escape i send this by an honest swiss who attended me in my travels a man i can trust and so let him be your assistant for the artful creature is enough to corrupt a nation by her seeming innocence and simplicity and she may have got a party perhaps among my servants with you as she has here even john arnold whom i confided in and favoured more than any has proved an execrable villain and shall meet his reward for it as to that college novice williams i need not bid you take care he sees not this painted bauble for i have ordered mr shorter my attorney to throw him instantly into gaol on an action of debt for money he has had of me which i had intended never to carry to account against him for i know all his rascally practices besides what you write me of his perfidious intrigue with that girl and his acknowledged contrivances for her escape when he knew not for certain that i designed her any mischief and when if he had been guided by a sense of piety or compassion for injured innocence as he pretends he would have expostulated with me as his function and my friendship for him might have allowed him but to enter into a vile intrigue with the amiable gewgaw to favour her escape in so base a manner to say nothing of his disgraceful practices against me in sir simon darnfords family of which sir simon himself has informed me is a conduct that instead of preferring the ungrateful wretch as i had intended shall pull down upon him utter ruin monsieur colbrand my trusty swiss will obey you without reserve if my other servants refuse as for her denying that she encouraged his declaration i believe it not it is certain the speaking picture with all that pretended innocence and bashfulness would have run away with him yes she would run away with a fellow that she had been acquainted with and that not intimately if you were as careful as you ought to be but a few days at a time when she had the strongest assurances of my honour to her well i think i now hate her perfectly and though i will do nothing to her myself yet i can bear for the sake of my revenge and my injured honour and slighted love to see any thing even what she most fears be done to her and then she may be turned loose to her evil destiny and echo to the woods and groves her piteous lamentations for the loss of her fantastical innocence which the romantic ideot makes such a work about i shall go to london with my sister davers and the moment i can disengage myself which perhaps may be in three weeks from this time i will be with you and decide her fate and put an end to your trouble mean time be doubly careful for this innocent as i have warned you is full of contrivances i am your friend i had but just read this dreadful letter through when mrs jewkes came up in a great fright guessing at the mistake and that i had her letter and she found me with it open in my hand just sinking away what business said she had you to read my letter and snatched it from me you see said she looking upon it it says mrs jewkes at top you ought in manners to have read no further o add not said i to my afflictions i shall be soon out of all your ways this is too much too much i never can support this and threw myself upon the couch in my closet and wept most bitterly she read it in the next room and came in again afterwards why this said she is a sad letter indeed i am sorry for it but i feared you would carry your niceties too far leave me leave me mrs jewkes said i for a while i cannot speak nor talk poor heart said she well ill come up again presently and hope to find you better but here take your own letter i wish you well but this is a sad mistake and so she put down by me that which was intended for me but i have no spirit to read it at present o man man hard hearted cruel man what mischiefs art thou not capable of unrelenting persecutor as thou art i sat ruminating when i had a little come to myself upon the terms of this wicked letter and had no inclination to look into my own the bad names fools plaything artful creature painted bauble gewgaw speaking picture are hard words for your poor pamela and i began to think whether i was not indeed a very naughty body and had not done vile things but when i thought of his having discovered poor john and of sir simons base officiousness in telling him of mr williams with what he had resolved against him in revenge for his goodness to me i was quite dispirited and yet still more about that fearful colbrand and what he could see done to me for then i was ready to gasp for breath and my heart quite failed me then how dreadful are the words that he will decide my fate in three weeks gracious heaven said i strike me dead before that time with a thunderbolt or provide some way for my escaping these threatened mischiefs god forgive me if i sinned at last i took up the letter directed for mrs jewkes but designed for me and i find that little better than the other these are the hard terms it contains well have you done perverse forward artful yet foolish pamela to convince me before it was too late how ill i had done to place my affections on so unworthy an object i had vowed honour and love to your unworthiness believing you a mirror of bashful modesty and unspotted innocence and that no perfidious designs lurked in so fair a bosom but now i have found you out you specious hypocrite and i see that though you could not repose the least confidence in one you had known for years and who under my good mothers misplaced favour for you had grown up in a manner with you when my passion in spite of my pride and the difference of our condition made me stoop to a meanness that now i despise myself for yet you could enter into an intrigue with a man you never knew till within these few days past and resolve to run away with a stranger whom your fair face and insinuating arts had bewitched to break through all the ties of honour and gratitude to me even at a time when the happiness of his future life depended upon my favour henceforth for pamelas sake whenever i see a lovely face will i mistrust a deceitful heart and whenever i hear of the greatest pretences to innocence will i suspect some deeplaid mischief you were determined to place no confidence in me though i have solemnly over and over engaged my honour to you what though i had alarmed your fears in sending you one way when you hoped to go another yet had i not to convince you of my resolution to do justly by you although with great reluctance such then was my love for you engaged not to come near you without your own consent was not this a voluntary demonstration of the generosity of my intention to you yet how have you requited me the very first fellow that your charming face and insinuating address could influence you have practised upon corrupted too i may say and even ruined as the ungrateful wretch shall find and thrown your forward self upon him as therefore you would place no confidence in me my honour owes you nothing and in a little time you shall find how much you have erred in treating as you have done a man who was once your affectionate and kind friend mrs jewkes has directions concerning you and if your lot is now harder than you might wish you will bear it the easier because your own rash folly has brought it upon you alas for me what a fate is mine to be thus thought artful and forward and ungrateful when all i intended was to preserve my innocence and when all the poor little shifts which his superior wicked wit and cunning have rendered ineffectual were forced upon me in my own necessary defence when mrs jewkes came up to me again she found me bathed in tears she seemed as i thought to be moved to some compassion and finding myself now entirely in her power and that it is not for me to provoke her i said it is now i see in vain for me to contend against my evil destiny and the superior arts of my barbarous master i will resign myself to the divine will and prepare to expect the worst but you see how this poor mr williams is drawn in and undone i am sorry i am made the cause of his ruin poor poor man to be thus involved and for my sake too but if youll believe me said i i gave no encouragement to what he proposed as to marriage nor would he have proposed it i believe but as the only honourable way he thought was left to save me and his principal motive to it at all was virtue and compassion to one in distress what other view could he have you know i am poor and friendless all i beg of you is to let the poor gentleman have notice of my masters resentment and let him fly the country and not be thrown into gaol this will answer my masters end as well for it will as effectually hinder him from assisting me as if he was in a prison ask me said she to do any thing that is in my power consistent with my duty and trust and i will do it for i am sorry for you both but to be sure i shall keep no correspondence with him nor let you i offered to talk of a duty superior to that she mentioned which would oblige her to help distressed innocence and not permit her to go the lengths enjoined by lawless tyranny but she plainly bid me be silent on that head for it was in vain to attempt to persuade her to betray her trust all i have to advise you said she is to be easy lay aside all your contrivances and arts to get away and make me your friend by giving me no reason to suspect you for i glory in my fidelity to my master and you have both practised some strange sly arts to make such a progress as he has owned there was between you so seldom as i thought you saw one another and i must be more circumspect than i have been this doubled my concern for i now apprehended i should be much closer watched than before well said i since i have by this strange accident discovered my hard destiny let me read over again that fearful letter of yours that i may get it by heart and with it feed my distress and make calamity familiar to me then said she let me read yours again i gave her mine and she lent me hers and so i took a copy of it with her leave because as i said i would by it prepare myself for the worst and when i had done i pinned it on the head of the couch this said i is the use i shall make of this wretched copy of your letter and here you shall always find it wet with my tears she said she would go down to order supper and insisted upon my company to it i would have excused myself but she began to put on a commanding air that i durst not oppose and when i went down she took me by the hand and presented me to the most hideous monster i ever saw in my life here monsieur colbrand said she here is your pretty ward and mine let us try to make her time with us easy he bowed and put on his foreign grimaces and seemed to bless himself and in broken english told me i was happy in de affections of de finest gentleman in de varld i was quite frightened and ready to drop down and i will describe him to you my dear father and mother if now you will ever see this and you shall judge if i had not reason especially not knowing he was to be there and being apprised as i was of his hated employment to watch me closer he is a giant of a man for stature taller by a good deal than harry mowlidge in your neighbourhood and large boned and scraggy and has a hand i never saw such an one in my life he has great staring eyes like the bulls that frightened me so vast jawbones sticking out eyebrows hanging over his eyes two great scars upon his forehead and one on his left cheek and two large whiskers and a monstrous wide mouth blubber lips long yellow teeth and a hideous grin he wears his own frightful long hair tied up in a great black bag a black crape neckcloth about a long ugly neck and his throat sticking out like a wen as to the rest he was dressed well enough and had a sword on with a nasty red knot to it leather garters buckled below his knees and a foot near as long as my arm i verily think he said he fright de lady and offered to withdraw but she bid him not and i told mrs jewkes that as she knew i had been crying she should not have called me to the gentleman without letting me know he was there i soon went up to my closet for my heart ached all the time i was at table not being able to look upon him without horror and this brute of a woman though she saw my distress before this addition to it no doubt did it on purpose to strike more terror into me and indeed it had its effect for when i went to bed i could think of nothing but his hideous person and my masters more hideous actions and thought them too well paired and when i dropt asleep i dreamed they were both coming to my bedside with the worst designs and i jumped out of my bed in my sleep and frightened mrs jewkes till waking with the terror i told her my dream and the wicked creature only laughed and said all i feared was but a dream as well as that and when it was over and i was well awake i should laugh at it as such and now i am come to the close of wednesday the th day of my distress poor mr williams is actually arrested and carried away to stamford so there is an end of all my hopes from him poor gentleman his over security and openness have ruined us both i was but too well convinced that we ought not to have lost a moments time but he was half angry and thought me too impatient and then his fatal confessions and the detestable artifice of my master but one might well think that he who had so cunningly and so wickedly contrived all his stratagems hitherto that it was impossible to avoid them would stick at nothing to complete them i fear i shall soon find it so but one stratagem i have just invented though a very discouraging one to think of because i have neither friends nor money nor know one step of the way if i was out of the house but let bulls and bears and lions and tigers and what is worse false treacherous deceitful men stand in my way i cannot be in more danger than i am and i depend nothing upon his three weeks for how do i know now he is in such a passion and has already begun his vengeance on poor mr williams that he will not change his mind and come down to lincolnshire before he goes to london my stratagem is this i will endeavour to get mrs jewkes to go to bed without me as she often does while i sit locked up in my closet and as she sleeps very sound in her first sleep of which she never fails to give notice by snoring if i can but then get out between the two bars of the window for you know i am very slender and i find i can get my head through then i can drop upon the leads underneath which are little more than my height and which leads are over a little summerparlour that juts out towards the garden and as i am light i can easily drop from them for they are not high from the ground then i shall be in the garden and then as i have the key of the backdoor i will get out but i have another piece of cunning still good heaven succeed to me my dangerous but innocent devices i have read of a great captain who being in danger leaped overboard into the sea and his enemies as he swam shooting at him with bows and arrows he unloosed his upper garment and took another course while they stuck that full of their darts and arrows and so he escaped and lived to triumph over them all so what will i do but strip off my upper petticoat and throw it into the pond with my neckhandkerchief for to be sure when they miss me they will go to the pond first thinking i have drowned myself and so when they see some of my clothes floating there they will be all employed in dragging the pond which is a very large one and as i shall not perhaps be missed till the morning this will give me opportunity to get a great way off and i am sure i will run for it when i am out and so i trust that providence will direct my steps to some good place of safety and make some worthy body my friend for sure if i suffer ever so i cannot be in more danger nor in worse hands than where i am and with such avowed bad designs o my dear parents dont be frightened when you come to read this but all will be over before you can see it and so god direct me for the best my writings for fear i should not escape i will bury in the garden for to be sure i shall be searched and used dreadfully if i cant get off and so i will close here for the present to prepare for my plot prosper thou o gracious protector of oppressed innocence this last effort of thy poor handmaid that i may escape the crafty devices and snares that have begun to entangle my virtue and from which but by this one trial i see no way of escaping and oh whatever becomes of me bless my dear parents and protect poor mr williams from ruin for he was happy before he knew me just now just now i heard mrs jewkes who is in her cups own to the horrid colbrand that the robbing of poor mr williams was a contrivance of hers and executed by the groom and a helper in order to seize my letters upon him which they missed they are now both laughing at the dismal story which they little think i overheard o how my heart aches for what are not such wretches capable of can you blame me for endeavouring through any danger to get out of such clutches past eleven oclock mrs jewkes is come up and gone to bed and bids me not stay long in my closet but come to bed o for a dead sleep for the treacherous brute i never saw her so tipsy and that gives me hopes i have tried again and find i can get my head through the iron bars i am now all prepared as soon as i hear her fast and now ill seal up these and my other papers my last work and to thy providence o my gracious god commit the rest once more god bless you both and send us a happy meeting if not here in his heavenly kingdom amen thursday friday saturday sunday the th th th and st days of my distress and distress indeed for here i am still and every thing has been worse and worse oh the poor unhappy pamela without any hope left and ruined in all my contrivances but oh my dear parents rejoice with me even in this low plunge of my distress for your poor pamela has escaped from an enemy worse than any she ever met with an enemy she never thought of before and was hardly able to stand against i mean the weakness and presumption both in one of her own mind which had well nigh had not the divine grace interposed sunk her into the lowest last abyss of misery and perdition i will proceed as i have opportunity with my sad relation for my pen and ink in my now doublysecured closet are all i have to employ myself with and indeed i have been so weak that till yesterday evening i have not been able to hold a pen i took with me but one shift besides what i had on and two handkerchiefs and two caps which my pocket held for it was not for me to encumber myself and all my stock of money which was but five or six shillings to set out for i knew not where and got out of the window not without some difficulty sticking a little at my shoulders and hips but i was resolved to get out if possible and it was farther from the leads than i thought and i was afraid i had sprained my ancle and when i had dropt from the leads to the ground it was still farther off but i did pretty well there at least i got no hurt to hinder me from pursuing my intentions so being now on the ground i hid my papers under a rosebush and covered them with mould and there they still lie as i hope then i hied away to the pond the clock struck twelve just as i got out and it was a dark misty night and very cold but i felt it not then when i came to the pondside i flung in my uppercoat as i had designed and my neckhandkerchief and a roundeared cap with a knot and then with great speed ran to the door and took the key out of my pocket my poor heart beating all the time against my bosom as if it would have forced its way through it and beat it well might for i then too late found that i was most miserably disappointed for the wicked woman had taken off that lock and put another on so that my key would not open it i tried and tried and feeling about i found a padlock besides on another part of the door o then how my heart sunk i dropt down with grief and confusion unable to stir or support myself for a while but my fears awakening my resolution and knowing that my attempt would be as terrible for me as any other danger i could then encounter i clambered up upon the ledges of the door and upon the lock which was a great wooden one and reached the top of the door with my hands then little thinking i could climb so well i made shift to lay hold on the top of the wall with my hands but alas for me nothing but ill luck no escape for poor pamela the wall being old the bricks i held by gave way just as i was taking a spring to get up and down came i and received such a blow upon my head with one of the bricks that it quite stunned me and i broke my shins and my ancle besides and beat off the heel of one of my shoes in this dreadful way flat upon the ground lay poor i for i believe five or six minutes and then trying to get up i sunk down again two or three times and my left hip and shoulder were very stiff and full of pain with bruises and besides my head bled and ached grievously with the blow i had with the brick yet these hurts i valued not but crept a good way upon my feet and hands in search of a ladder i just recollected to have seen against the wall two days before on which the gardener was nailing a nectarine branch that was loosened from the wall but no ladder could i find and the wall was very high what now thought i must become of the miserable pamela then i began to wish myself most heartily again in my closet and to repent of my attempt which i now censured as rash because it did not succeed god forgive me but a sad thought came just then into my head i tremble to think of it indeed my apprehensions of the usage i should meet with had like to have made me miserable for ever o my dear dear parents forgive your poor child but being then quite desperate i crept along till i could raise myself on my staggering feet and away limped i what to do but to throw myself into the pond and so put a period to all my griefs in this world but o to find them infinitely aggravated had i not by the divine grace been withheld in a miserable eternity as i have escaped this temptation blessed be god for it i will tell you my conflicts on this dreadful occasion that the divine mercies may be magnified in my deliverance that i am yet on this side the dreadful gulf from which there could have been no return it was well for me as i have since thought that i was so maimed as made me the longer before i got to the water for this gave me time to consider and abated the impetuousness of my passions which possibly might otherwise have hurried me in my first transport of grief on my seeing no way to escape and the hard usage i had reason to expect from my dreadful keepers to throw myself in but my weakness of body made me move so slowly that it gave time as i said for a little reflection a ray of grace to dart in upon my benighted mind and so when i came to the pondside i sat myself down on the sloping bank and began to ponder my wretched condition and thus i reasoned with myself pause here a little pamela on what thou art about before thou takest the dreadful leap and consider whether there be no way yet left no hope if not to escape from this wicked house yet from the mischiefs threatened thee in it i then considered and after i had cast about in my mind every thing that could make me hope and saw no probability a wicked woman devoid of all compassion a horrid helper just arrived in this dreadful colbrand an angry and resenting master who now hated me and threatened the most afflicting evils and that i should in all probability be deprived even of the opportunity i now had before me to free myself from all their persecutions what hast thou to do distressed creature said i to myself but throw thyself upon a merciful god who knows how innocently i suffer to avoid the merciless wickedness of those who are determined on my ruin and then thought i and oh that thought was surely of the devils instigation for it was very soothing and powerful with me these wicked wretches who now have no remorse no pity on me will then be moved to lament their misdoings and when they see the dead corpse of the unhappy pamela dragged out to these dewy banks and lying breathless at their feet they will find that remorse to soften their obdurate heart which now has no place there and my master my angry master will then forget his resentments and say o this is the unhappy pamela that i have so causelessly persecuted and destroyed now do i see she preferred her honesty to her life will he say and is no hypocrite nor deceiver but really was the innocent creature she pretended to be then thought i will he perhaps shed a few tears over the poor corpse of his persecuted servant and though he may give out it was love and disappointment and that perhaps in order to hide his own guilt for the unfortunate mr williams yet will he be inwardly grieved and order me a decent funeral and save me or rather this part of me from the dreadful stake and the highway interment and the young men and maidens all around my dear fathers will pity poor pamela but o i hope i shall not be the subject of their ballads and elegies but that my memory for the sake of my dear father and mother may quickly slide into oblivion i was once rising so indulgent was i to this sad way of thinking to throw myself in but again my bruises made me slow and i thought what art thou about to do wretched pamela how knowest thou though the prospect be all dark to thy shortsighted eye what god may do for thee even when all human means fail god almighty would not lay me under these sore afflictions if he had not given me strength to grapple with them if i will exert it as i ought and who knows but that the very presence i so much dread of my angry and designing master for he has had me in his power before and yet i have escaped may be better for me than these persecuting emissaries of his who for his money are true to their wicked trust and are hardened by that and a long habit of wickedness against compunction of heart god can touch his heart in an instant and if this should not be done i can then but put an end to my life by some other means if i am so resolved but how do i know thought i that even these bruises and maims that i have gotten while i pursued only the laudable escape i had meditated may not kindly have furnished me with the opportunity i am now tempted with to precipitate myself and of surrendering up my life spotless and unguilty to that merciful being who gave it then thought i who gave thee presumptuous as thou art a power over thy life who authorised thee to put an end to it when the weakness of thy mind suggests not to thee a way to preserve it with honour how knowest thou what purposes god may have to serve by the trials with which thou art now exercised art thou to put a bound to the divine will and to say thus much will i bear and no more and wilt thou dare to say that if the trial be augmented and continued thou wilt sooner die than bear it this act of despondency thought i is a sin that if i pursue it admits of no repentance and can therefore hope no forgiveness and wilt thou to shorten thy transitory griefs heavy as they are and weak as thou fanciest thyself plunge both body and soul into everlasting misery hitherto pamela thought i thou art the innocent the suffering pamela and wilt thou to avoid thy sufferings be the guilty aggressor and because wicked men persecute thee wilt thou fly in the face of the almighty and distrust his grace and goodness who can still turn all these sufferings to benefits and how do i know but that god who sees all the lurking vileness of my heart may have permitted these sufferings on that very score and to make me rely solely on his grace and assistance who perhaps have too much prided myself in a vain dependence on my own foolish contrivances then again thought i wilt thou suffer in one moment all the good lessons of thy poor honest parents and the benefit of their example who have persisted in doing their duty with resignation to the divine will amidst the extreme degrees of disappointment poverty and distress and the persecutions of an ungrateful world and merciless creditors to be thrown away upon thee and bring down as in all probability this thy rashness will their grey hairs with sorrow to the grave when they shall understand that their beloved daughter slighting the tenders of divine grace despairing of the mercies of a protecting god has blemished in this last act a whole life which they had hitherto approved and delighted in what then presumptuous pamela dost thou here thought i quit with speed these perilous banks and fly from these curling waters that seem in their meaning murmurs this still night to reproach thy rashness tempt not gods goodness on the mossy banks that have been witnesses of thy guilty purpose and while thou hast power left thee avoid the tempting evil lest thy grand enemy now repulsed by divine grace and due reflection return to the assault with a force that thy weakness may not be able to resist and let one rash moment destroy all the convictions which now have awed thy rebellious mind into duty and resignation to the divine will and so saying i arose but was so stiff with my hurts so cold with the moist dew of the night and the wet grass on which i had sat as also with the damps arising from so large a piece of water that with great pain i got from this pond which now i think of with terror and bending my limping steps towards the house took refuge in the corner of an outhouse where wood and coals are laid up for family use till i should be found by my cruel keepers and consigned to a more wretched confinement and worse usage than i had hitherto experienced and there behind a pile of firewood i crept and lay down as you may imagine with a mind just broken and a heart sensible to nothing but the extremest woe and dejection this my dear father and mother is the issue of your poor pamelas fruitless enterprise and who knows if i had got out at the backdoor whether i had been at all in a better case moneyless friendless as i am and in a strange place but blame not your poor daughter too much nay if ever you see this miserable scribble all bathed and blotted with my tears let your pity get the better of your reprehension but i know it will and i must leave off for the present for oh my strength and my will are at this time very far unequal to one another but yet i will add that though i should have praised god for my deliverance had i been freed from my wicked keepers and my designing master yet i have more abundant reason to praise him that i have been delivered from a worse enemy myself i will conclude my sad relation it seems mrs jewkes awaked not till daybreak and not finding me in bed she called me and no answer being returned she relates that she got out of bed and ran to my closet and missing me searched under the bed and in another closet finding the chamberdoor as she had left it quite fast and the key as usual about her wrist for if i could have got out of the chamberdoor there were two or three passages and doors to them all doublelocked and barred to go through into the great garden so that to escape there was no way but out of the window and of that window because of the summerparlour under it for the other windows are a great way from the ground she says she was excessively frightened and instantly raised the swiss and the two maids who lay not far off and finding every door fast she said i must be carried away as st peter was out of prison by some angel it is a wonder she had not a worse thought she says she wept and wrung her hands and took on sadly running about like a mad woman little thinking i could have got out of the closet window between the iron bars and indeed i dont know whether i could do so again but at last finding that casement open they concluded it must be so and ran out into the garden and found my footsteps in the mould of the bed which i dropt down upon from the leads and so speeded away all of them that is to say mrs jewkes colbrand and nan towards the backdoor to see if that was fast while the cook was sent to the outoffices to raise the men and make them get horses ready to take each a several way to pursue me but it seems finding that door doublelocked and padlocked and the heel of my shoe and the broken bricks they verily concluded i was got away by some means over the wall and then they say mrs jewkes seemed like a distracted woman till at last nan had the thought to go towards the pond and there seeing my coat and cap and handkerchief in the water cast almost to the banks by the agitation of the waves she thought it was me and screaming out ran to mrs jewkes and said o madam madam heres a piteous thing mrs pamela lies drowned in the pond thither they all ran and finding my clothes doubted not i was at the bottom and they all swiss among the rest beat their breasts and made most dismal lamentations and mrs jewkes sent nan to the men to bid them get the dragnet ready and leave the horses and come to try to find the poor innocent as she it seems then called me beating her breast and lamenting my hard hap but most what would become of them and what account they should give to my master while every one was thus differently employed some weeping and wailing some running here and there nan came into the woodhouse and there lay poor i so weak so low and dejected and withal so stiff with my bruises that i could not stir nor help myself to get upon my feet and i said with a low voice for i could hardly speak mrs ann mrs ann the creature was sadly frightened but was taking up a billet to knock me on the head believing i was some thief as she said but i cried out o mrs ann mrs ann help me for pitys sake to mrs jewkes for i cannot get up bless me said she what you madam why our hearts are almost broken and we were going to drag the pond for you believing you had drowned yourself now said she youll make us all alive again and without helping me she ran away to the pond and brought all the crew to the woodhouse the wicked woman as she entered said where is she plague of her spells and her witchcrafts she shall dearly repent of this trick if my name be jewkes and coming to me took hold of my arm so roughly and gave me such a pull as made me squeal out my shoulder being bruised on that side and drew me on my face o cruel creature said i if you knew what i have suffered it would move you to pity me even colbrand seemed to be concerned and said fie madam fie you see she is almost dead you must not be so rough with her the coachman robin seemed to be sorry for me too and said with sobs what a scene is here dont you see she is all bloody in her head and cannot stir curse of her contrivance said the horrid creature she has frightened me out of my wits im sure how the d l came you here oh said i ask me now no questions but let the maids carry me up to my prison and there let me die decently and in peace for indeed i thought i could not live two hours the still more inhuman tigress said i suppose you want mr williams to pray by you dont you well ill send for my master this minute let him come and watch you himself for me for theres no such thing as holding you im sure so the maids took me up between them and carried me to my chamber and when the wretch saw how bad i was she began a little to relent while every one wondered at which i had neither strength nor inclination to tell them how all this came to pass which they imputed to sorcery and witchcraft i was so weak when i had got up stairs that i fainted away with dejection pain and fatigue and they undressed me and got me to bed and mrs jewkes ordered nan to bathe my shoulder and arm and ancle with some old rum warmed and they cut the hair a little from the back part of my head and washed that for it was clotted with blood from a pretty long but not a deep gash and put a family plaister upon it for if this woman has any good quality it is it seems in a readiness and skill to manage in cases where sudden misfortunes happen in a family after this i fell into a pretty sound and refreshing sleep and lay till twelve oclock tolerably easy considering i was very feverish and aguishly inclined and she took a deal of care to fit me to undergo more trials which i had hoped would have been happily ended but providence did not see fit she would make me rise about twelve but i was so weak i could only sit up till the bed was made and went into it again and was as they said delirious some part of the afternoon but having a tolerable night on thursday i was a good deal better on friday and on saturday got up and ate a little spoonmeat and my feverishness seemed to be gone and i was so mended by evening that i begged her indulgence in my closet to be left to myself which she consented to it being doublebarred the day before and i assuring her that all my contrivances as she called them were at an end but first she made me tell the whole story of my enterprise which i did very faithfully knowing now that nothing could stand me in any stead or contribute to my safety and escape and she seemed full of wonder at my resolution but told me frankly that i should have found it a hard matter to get quite off for that she was provided with a warrant from my master who is a justice of peace in this county as well as in the other to get me apprehended if i had got away on suspicion of wronging him let me have been where i would o how deeplaid are the mischiefs designed to fall on my devoted head surely surely i cannot be worthy of all this contrivance this too well shews me the truth of what was hinted to me formerly at the other house that my master swore he would have me o preserve me heaven from being his in his own wicked sense of the adjuration i must add that now the woman sees me pick up so fast she uses me worse and has abridged me of paper all but one sheet which i am to shew her written or unwritten on demand and has reduced me to one pen yet my hidden stores stand me in stead but she is more and more snappish and cross and tauntingly calls me mrs williams and any thing she thinks will vex me sunday afternoon mrs jewkes has thought fit to give me an airing for three or four hours this afternoon and i am a good deal better and should be much more so if i knew for what i am reserved but health is a blessing hardly to be coveted in my circumstances since that but exposes me to the calamity i am in continual apprehensions of whereas a weak and sickly state might possibly move compassion for me o how i dread the coming of this angry and incensed master though i am sure i have done him no harm just now we heard that he had like to have been drowned in crossing the stream a few days ago in pursuing his game what is the matter that with all his ill usage of me i cannot hate him to be sure i am not like other people he has certainly done enough to make me hate him but yet when i heard his danger which was very great i could not in my heart forbear rejoicing for his safety though his death would have ended my afflictions ungenerous master if you knew this you surely would not be so much my persecutor but for my late good ladys sake i must wish him well and o what an angel would he be in my eyes yet if he would cease his attempts and reform well i hear by mrs jewkes that john arnold is turned away being detected in writing to mr williams and that mr longman and mr jonathan the butler have incurred his displeasure for offering to speak in my behalf mrs jervis too is in danger for all these three probably went together to beg in my favour for now it is known where i am mrs jewkes has with the news about my master received a letter but she says the contents are too bad for me to know they must be bad indeed if they be worse than what i have already known just now the horrid creature tells me as a secret that she has reason to think he has found out a way to satisfy my scruples it is by marrying me to this dreadful colbrand and buying me of him on the wedding day for a sum of money was ever the like heard she says it will be my duty to obey my husband and that mr williams will be forced as a punishment to marry us and that when my master has paid for me and i am surrendered up the swiss is to go home again with the money to his former wife and children for she says it is the custom of those people to have a wife in every nation but this to be sure is horrid romancing yet abominable as it is it may possibly serve to introduce some plot now hatching with what strange perplexities is my poor mind agitated perchance some sham marriage may be designed on purpose to ruin me but can a husband sell his wife against her own consent and will such a bargain stand good in law monday tuesday wednesday the d d and th days of my imprisonment nothing offers these days but squabblings between mrs jewkes and me she grows worse and worse to me i vexed her yesterday because she talked nastily and told her she talked more like a vile london prostitute than a gentlemans housekeeper and she thinks she cannot use me bad enough for it bless me she curses and storms at me like a trooper and can hardly keep her hands off me you may believe she must talk sadly to make me say such harsh words indeed it cannot be repeated as she is a disgrace to her sex and then she ridicules me and laughs at my notions of honesty and tells me impudent creature as she is what a fine bedfellow i shall make for my master and such like with such whimsical notions about me do you think this is to be borne and yet she talks worse than this if possible quite filthily o what vile hands am i put into thursday i have now all the reason that can be to apprehend my master will be here soon for the servants are busy in setting the house to rights and a stable and coachhouse are cleaning out that have not been used some time i asked mrs jewkes but she tells me nothing nor will hardly answer me when i ask her a question sometimes i think she puts on these strange wicked airs to me purposely to make me wish for what i dread most of all things my masters coming down he talk of love if he had any the least notion of regard for me to be sure he would not give this naughty body such power over me and if he does come where is his promise of not seeing me without i consent to it but it seems his honour owes me nothing so he tells me in his letter and why because i am willing to keep mine but indeed he says he hates me perfectly but it is plain he does or i should not be left to the mercy of this woman and what is worse to my woful apprehensions friday the th day of my imprisonment i took the liberty yesterday afternoon finding the gates open to walk out before the house and ere i was aware had got to the bottom of the long row of elms and there i sat myself down upon the steps of a sort of broad stile which leads into the road and goes towards the town and as i sat musing upon what always busies my mind i saw a whole body of folks running towards me from the house men and women as in a fright at first i wondered what was the matter till they came nearer and i found they were all alarmed thinking i had attempted to get off there was first the horrible colbrand running with his long legs well nigh two yards at a stride then there was one of the grooms poor mr williamss robber then i spied nan half out of breath and the cook maid after her and lastly came waddling as fast as she could mrs jewkes exclaiming most bitterly as i found against me colbrand said o how have you frighted us all and went behind me lest i should run away as i suppose i sat still to let them see i had no view to get away for besides the improbability of succeeding my last sad attempt has cured me of enterprising again and when mrs jewkes came within hearing i found her terribly incensed and raving about my contrivances why said i should you be so concerned here i have sat a few minutes and had not the least thought of getting away or going farther but to return as soon as it was duskish she would not believe me and the barbarous creature struck at me with her horrid fist and i believe would have felled me had not colbrand interposed and said he saw me sitting still looking about me and not seeming to have the least inclination to stir but this would not serve she ordered the two maids to take me each by an arm and lead me back into the house and up stairs and there have i been locked up ever since without shoes in vain have i pleaded that i had no design as indeed i had not the least and last night i was forced to be between her and nan and i find she is resolved to make a handle of this against me and in her own behalf indeed what with her usage and my own apprehensions of still worse i am quite weary of my life just now she has been with me and given me my shoes and has laid her imperious commands upon me to dress myself in a suit of clothes out of the portmanteau which i have not seen lately against three or four oclock for she says she is to have a visit from lady darnfords two daughters who come purposely to see me and so she gave me the key of the portmanteau but i will not obey her and i told her i would not be made a show of nor see the ladies she left me saying it would be worse for me if i did not but how can that be five oclock is come and no young ladies so that i fancy but hold i hear their coach i believe ill step to the window i wont go down to them i am resolved good sirs good sirs what will become of me here is my master come in his fine chariot indeed he is what shall i do where shall i hide myself o what shall i do pray for me but oh youll not see this now good god of heaven preserve me if it be thy blessed will seven oclock though i dread to see him yet do i wonder i have not to be sure something is resolved against me and he stays to hear all her stories i can hardly write yet as i can do nothing else i know not how to forbear yet i cannot hold my pen how crooked and trembling the lines i must leave off till i can get quieter fingers why should the guiltless tremble so when the guilty can possess their minds in peace saturday morning now let me give you an account of what passed last night for i had no power to write nor yet opportunity till now this vile woman held my master till half an hour after seven and he came hither about five in the afternoon and then i heard his voice on the stairs as he was coming up to me it was about his supper for he said i shall choose a boiled chicken with butter and parsley and up he came he put on a stern and majestic air and he can look very majestic when he pleases well perverse pamela ungrateful runaway said he for my first salutation you do well dont you to give me all this trouble and vexation i could not speak but throwing myself on the floor hid my face and was ready to die with grief and apprehension he said well may you hide your face well may you be ashamed to see me vile forward one as you are i sobbed and wept but could not speak and he let me lie and went to the door and called mrs jewkes there said he take up that fallen angel once i thought her as innocent as an angel of light but i have now no patience with her the little hypocrite prostrates herself thus in hopes to move my weakness in her favour and that ill raise her from the floor myself but i shall not touch her no said he cruel gentleman as he was let such fellows as williams be taken in by her artful wiles i know her now and see she is for any fools turn that will be caught by her i sighed as if my heart would break and mrs jewkes lifted me up upon my knees for i trembled so i could not stand come said she mrs pamela learn to know your best friend confess your unworthy behaviour and beg his honours forgiveness of all your faults i was ready to faint and he said she is mistress of arts ill assure you and will mimic a fit ten to one in a minute i was struck to the heart at this but could not speak presently only lifted up my eyes to heaven and at last made shift to say god forgive you sir he seemed in a great passion and walked up and down the room casting sometimes an eye upon me and seeming as if he would have spoken but checked himself and at last he said when she has acted this her first part over perhaps i will see her again and she shall soon know what she has to trust to and so he went out of the room and i was quite sick at heart surely said i i am the wickedest creature that ever breathed well said the impertinent not so wicked as that neither but i am glad you begin to see your faults nothing like being humble come ill stand your friend and plead for you if youll promise to be more dutiful for the future come come added the wretch this may be all made up by to morrow morning if you are not a fool begone hideous woman said i and let not my affliction be added to by thy inexorable cruelty and unwomanly wickedness she gave me a push and went away in a violent passion and it seems she made a story of this and said i had such a spirit there was no bearing it i laid me down on the floor and had no power to stir till the clock struck nine and then the wicked woman came up again you must come down stairs said she to my master that is if you please spirit said i i believe i cannot stand then said she ill send mons colbrand to carry you down i got up as well as i could and trembled all the way down stairs and she went before me into the parlour and a new servant that he had waiting on him instead of john withdrew as soon as i came in and by the way he had a new coachman too which looked as if bedfordshire robin was turned away i thought said he when i came down you should have sat at table with me when i had not company but when i find you cannot forget your original but must prefer my menials to me i call you down to wait on me while i sup that i may have some talk with you and throw away as little time as possible upon you sir said i you do me honour to wait upon you and i never shall i hope forget my original but i was forced to stand behind his chair that i might hold by it fill me said he a glass of that burgundy i went to do it but my hand shook so that i could not hold the plate with the glass in it and spilt some of the wine so mrs jewkes poured it for me and i carried it as well as i could and made a low courtesy he took it and said stand behind me out of my sight why mrs jewkes said he you tell me she remains very sullen still and eats nothing no said she not so much as will keep life and soul together and is always crying you say too yes sir answered she i think she is for one thing or another ay said he your young wenches will feed upon their tears and their obstinacy will serve them for meat and drink i think i never saw her look better though in my life but i suppose she lives upon love this sweet mr williams and her little villanous plots together have kept her alive and well to be sure for mischief love and contradiction are the natural aliments of a woman poor i was forced to hear all this and be silent and indeed my heart was too full to speak and so you say said he that she had another project but yesterday to get away she denies it herself said she but it had all the appearance of one im sure she made me in a fearful pucker about it and i am glad your honour is come with all my heart and i hope whatever be your honours intention concerning her you will not be long about it for youll find her as slippery as an eel ill assure you sir said i and clasped his knees with my arms not knowing what i did and falling on my knees have mercy on me and hear me concerning that wicked womans usage of me he cruelly interrupted me and said i am satisfied she has done her duty it signifies nothing what you say against mrs jewkes that you are here little hypocrite as you are pleading your cause before me is owing to her care of you else you had been with the parson wicked girl said he to tempt a man to undo himself as you have done him at a time i was on the point of making him happy for his life i arose but said with a deep sigh i have done sir i have done i have a strange tribunal to plead before the poor sheep in the fable had such an one when it was tried before the vulture on the accusation of the wolf so mrs jewkes said he you are the wolf i the vulture and this the poor innocent lamb on her trial before us oh you dont know how well this innocent is read in reflection she has wit at will when she has a mind to display her own romantic innocence at the price of other peoples characters well said the aggravated creature this is nothing to what she has called me i have been a jezebel a london prostitute and what not but i am contented with her ill names now i see it is her fashion and she can call your honour a vulture said i i had no thought of comparing my master and was going to say on but he said dont prate girl no said she it dont become you i am sure well said i since i must not speak i will hold my peace but there is a righteous judge who knows the secrets of all hearts and to him i appeal see there said he now this meek good creature is praying for fire from heaven upon us o she can curse most heartily in the spirit of christian meekness ill assure you come saucyface give me another glass of wine so i did as well as i could but wept so that he said i suppose i shall have some of your tears in my wine when he had supped he stood up and said o how happy for you it is that you can at will thus make your speaking eyes overflow in this manner without losing any of their brilliancy you have been told i suppose that you are most beautiful in your tears did you ever said he to her who all this while was standing in one corner of the parlour see a more charming creature than this is it to be wondered at that i demean myself thus to take notice of her see said he and took the glass with one hand and turned me round with the other what a shape what a neck what a hand and what a bloom on that lovely face but who can describe the tricks and artifices that lie lurking in her little plotting guileful heart tis no wonder the poor parson was infatuated with her i blame him less than i do her for who could expect such artifice in so young a sorceress i went to the farther part of the room and held my face against the wainscot and in spite of all i could do to refrain crying sobbed as if my heart would break he said i am surprised mrs jewkes at the mistake of the letters you tell me of but you see i am not afraid any body should read what i write i dont carry on private correspondences and reveal every secret that comes to my knowledge and then corrupt people to carry my letters against their duty and all good conscience come hither hussy said he you and i have a dreadful reckoning to make why dont you come when i bid you fie upon it mrs pamela said she what not stir when his honour commands you to come to him who knows but his goodness will forgive you he came to me for i had no power to stir and put his arms about my neck and would kiss me and said well mrs jewkes if it were not for the thought of this cursed parson i believe in my heart so great is my weakness that i could not forgive this intriguing little slut and take her to my bosom o said the sycophant you are very good sir very forgiving indeed but come added the profligate wretch i hope you will be so good as to take her to your bosom and that by tomorrow morning youll bring her to a better sense of her duty could any thing in womanhood be so vile i had no patience but yet grief and indignation choaked up the passage of my words and i could only stammer out a passionate exclamation to heaven to protect my innocence but the word was the subject of their ridicule was ever poor creature worse beset he said as if he had been considering whether he could forgive me or not no i cannot yet forgive her neither she has given me great disturbance has brought great discredit upon me both abroad and at home has corrupted all my servants at the other house has despised my honourable views and intentions to her and sought to run away with this ungrateful parson and surely i ought not to forgive all this yet with all this wretched grimace he kissed me again and would have put his hand into my bosom but i struggled and said i would die before i would be used thus consider pamela said he in a threatening tone consider where you are and dont play the fool if you do a more dreadful fate awaits you than you expect but take her up stairs mrs jewkes and ill send a few lines to her to consider of and let me have your answer pamela in the morning till then you have to resolve and after that your doom is fixed so i went up stairs and gave myself up to grief and expectation of what he would send but yet i was glad of this nights reprieve he sent me however nothing at all and about twelve oclock mrs jewkes and nan came up as the night before to be my bedfellows and i would go to bed with some of my clothes on which they muttered at sadly and mrs jewkes railed at me particularly indeed i would have sat up all night for fear if she would have let me for i had but very little rest that night apprehending this woman would let my master in she did nothing but praise him and blame me but i answered her as little as i could he has sir simon telltale alias darnford to dine with him today whose family sent to welcome him into the country and it seems the old knight wants to see me so i suppose i shall be sent for as samson was to make sport for him here i am and must bear it all twelve oclock saturday noon just now he has sent me up by mrs jewkes the following proposals so here are the honourable intentions all at once laid open they are my dear parents to make me a vile kept mistress which i hope i shall always detest the thoughts of but youll see how they are accommodated to what i should have most desired could i have honestly promoted it your welfare and happiness i have answered them as i am sure youll approve and i am prepared for the worst for though i fear there will be nothing omitted to ruin me and though my poor strength will not be able to defend me yet i will be innocent of crime in my intention and in the sight of god and to him leave the avenging of all my wrongs time and manner i shall write to you my answer against his articles and hope the best though i fear the worst but if i should come home to you ruined and undone and may not be able to look you in the face yet pity and inspirit the poor pamela to make her little remnant of life easy for long i shall not survive my disgrace and you may be assured it shall not be my fault if it be my misfortune to mrs pamela andrews the following articles are proposed to your serious consideration and let me have an answer in writing to them that i may take my resolutions accordingly only remember that i will not be trifled with and what you give for answer will absolutely decide your fate without expostulation or farther trouble this is my answer forgive sir the spirit your poor servant is about to show in her answer to your articles not to be warm and in earnest on such an occasion as the present would shew a degree of guilt that i hope my soul abhors i will not trifle with you nor act like a person doubtful of her own mind for it wants not one moments consideration with me and i therefore return the answer following let what will be the consequence i if you can convince me that the hated parson has had no encouragement from you in his addresses and that you have no inclination for him in preference to me then i will offer the following proposals to you which i will punctually make good i as to the first article sir it may behove me that i may not deserve in your opinion the opprobrious terms of forward and artful and such like to declare solemnly that mr williams never had the least encouragement from me as to what you hint and i believe his principal motive was the apprehended duty of his function quite contrary to his apparent interest to assist a person he thought in distress you may sir the rather believe me when i declare that i know not the man breathing i would wish to marry and that the only one i could honour more than another is the gentleman who of all others seeks my everlasting dishonour ii i will directly make you a present of guineas for your own use which you may dispose of to any purpose you please and will give it absolutely into the hands of any person you shall appoint to receive it and expect no favour in return till you are satisfied in the possession of it ii as to your second proposal let the consequence be what it will i reject it with all my soul money sir is not my chief good may god almighty desert me whenever it is and whenever for the sake of that i can give up my title to that blessed hope which will stand me in stead at a time when millions of gold will not purchase one happy moment of reflection on a past misspent life iii i will likewise directly make over to you a purchase i lately made in kent which brings in l per annum clear of all deductions this shall be made over to you in full property for your life and for the lives of any children to perpetuity that you may happen to have and your father shall be immediately put into possession of it in trust for these purposes and the management of it will yield a comfortable subsistence to him and your mother for life and i will make up any deficiencies if such should happen to that clear sum and allow him l per annum besides for his life and that of your mother for his care and management of this your estate iii your third proposal sir i reject for the same reason and am sorry you could think my poor honest parents would enter into their part of it and be concerned for the management of an estate which would be owing to the prostitution of their poor daughter forgive sir my warmth on this occasion but you know not the poor man and the poor woman my everdear father and mother if you think that they would not much rather choose to starve in a ditch or rot in a noisome dungeon than accept of the fortune of a monarch upon such wicked terms i dare not say all that my full mind suggests to me on this grievous occasion but indeed sir you know them not nor shall the terrors of death in its most frightful form i hope through gods assisting grace ever make me act unworthy of such poor honest parents iv i will moreover extend my favour to any other of your relations that you may think worthy of it or that are valued by you iv your fourth proposal i take upon me sir to answer as the third if i have any friends that want the favour of the great may they ever want it if they are capable of desiring it on unworthy terms v i will besides order patterns to be sent you for choosing four complete suits of rich clothes that you may appear with reputation as if you were my wife and will give you the two diamond rings and two pair of earrings and diamond necklace that were bought by my mother to present to miss tomlins if the match that was proposed between her and me had been brought to effect and i will confer upon you still other gratuities as i shall find myself obliged by your good behaviour and affection v fine clothes sir become not me nor have i any ambition to wear them i have greater pride in my poverty and meanness than i should have in dress and finery believe me sir i think such things less become the humbleborn pamela than the rags your good mother raised me from your rings sir your necklace and your earrings will better befit ladies of degree than me and to lose the best jewel my virtue would be poorly recompensed by those you propose to give me what should i think when i looked upon my finger or saw in the glass those diamonds on my neck and in my ears but that they were the price of my honesty and that i wore those jewels outwardly because i had none inwardly vi now pamela will you see by this what a value i set upon the freewill of a person already in my power and who if these proposals are not accepted shall find that i have not taken all these pains and risked my reputation as i have done without resolving to gratify my passion for you at all adventures and if you refuse without making any terms at all vi i know sir by woful experience that i am in your power i know all the resistance i can make will be poor and weak and perhaps stand me in little stead i dread your will to ruin me is as great as your power yet sir will i dare to tell you that i will make no freewill offering of my virtue all that i can do poor as it is i will do to convince you that your offers shall have no part in my choice and if i cannot escape the violence of man i hope by gods grace i shall have nothing to reproach myself for not doing all in my power to avoid my disgrace and then i can safely appeal to the great god my only refuge and protector with this consolation that my will bore no part in my violation vii you shall be mistress of my person and fortune as much as if the foolish ceremony had passed all my servants shall be yours and you shall choose any two persons to attend yourself either male or female without any control of mine and if your conduct be such that i have reason to be satisfied with it i know not but will not engage for this that i may after a twelvemonths cohabitation marry you for if my love increases for you as it has done for many months past it will be impossible for me to deny you any thing and now pamela consider well it is in your power to oblige me on such terms as will make yourself and all your friends happy but this will be over this very day irrevocably over and you shall find all you would be thought to fear without the least benefit arising from it to yourself and i beg youll well weigh the matter and comply with my proposals and i will instantly set about securing to you the full effect of them and let me if you value yourself experience a grateful return on this occasion and ill forgive all thats past vii i have not once dared to look so high as to such a proposal as your seventh article contains hence have proceeded all my little abortive artifices to escape from the confinement you have put me in although you promised to be honourable to me your honour well i know would not let you stoop to so mean and so unworthy a slave as the poor pamela all i desire is to be permitted to return to my native meanness unviolated what have i done sir to deserve it should be otherwise for the obtaining of this though i would not have married your chaplain yet would i have run away with your meanest servant if i had thought i could have got safe to my beloved poverty i heard you once say sir that a certain great commander who could live upon lentils might well refuse the bribes of the greatest monarch and i hope as i can contentedly live at the meanest rate and think not myself above the lowest condition that i am also above making an exchange of my honesty for all the riches of the indies when i come to be proud and vain of gaudy apparel and outside finery then which i hope will never be may i rest my principal good in such vain trinkets and despise for them the more solid ornaments of a good fame and a chastity inviolate give me leave to say sir in answer to what you hint that you may in a twelvemonths time marry me on the continuance of my good behaviour that this weighs less with me if possible than any thing else you have said for in the first place there is an end of all merit and all good behaviour on my side if i have now any the moment i consent to your proposals and i should be so far from expecting such an honour that i will pronounce that i should be most unworthy of it what sir would the world say were you to marry your harlot that a gentleman of your rank in life should stoop not only to the baseborn pamela but to a baseborn prostitute little sir as i know of the world i am not to be caught by a bait so poorly covered as this yet after all dreadful is the thought that i a poor weak friendless unhappy creature am too full in your power but permit me sir to pray as i now write on my bended knees that before you resolve upon my ruin you will weigh well the matter hitherto sir though you have taken large strides to this crying sin yet are you on this side the commission of it when once it is done nothing can recall it and where will be your triumph what glory will the spoils of such a weak enemy yield you let me but enjoy my poverty with honesty is all my prayer and i will bless you and pray for you every moment of my life think o think before it is yet too late what stings what remorse will attend your dying hour when you come to reflect that you have ruined perhaps soul and body a wretched creature whose only pride was her virtue and how pleased you will be on the contrary if in that tremendous moment you shall be able to acquit yourself of this foul crime and to plead in your own behalf that you suffered the earnest supplications of an unhappy wretch to prevail with you to be innocent yourself and let her remain so may god almighty whose mercy so lately saved you from the peril of perishing in deep waters on which i hope you will give me cause to congratulate you touch your heart in my favour and save you from this sin and me from this ruin and to him do i commit my cause and to him will i give the glory and night and day pray for you if i may be permitted to escape this great evil your poor oppressed broken spirited servant i took a copy of this for your perusal my dear parents if i shall ever be so happy to see you again for i hope my conduct will be approved of by you and at night when sir simon was gone he sent for me down well said he have you considered my proposals yes sir said i i have and there is my answer but pray let me not see you read it is it your bashfulness said he or your obstinacy that makes you not choose i should read it before you i offered to go away and he said dont run from me i wont read it till you are gone but said he tell me pamela whether you comply with my proposals or not sir said i you will see presently pray dont hold me for he took my hand said he did you well consider before you answered i did sir said i if it be not what you think will please me said he dear girl take it back again and reconsider it for if i have this as your absolute answer and i dont like it you are undone for i will not sue meanly where i can command i fear said he it is not what i like by your manner and let me tell you that i cannot bear denial if the terms i have offered are not sufficient i will augment them to twothirds of my estate for said he and swore a dreadful oath i cannot live without you and since the thing is gone so far i will not and so he clasped me in his arms in such a manner as quite frightened me and kissed me two or three times i got from him and run up stairs and went to the closet and was quite uneasy and fearful in an hours time he called mrs jewkes down to him and i heard him very high in passion and all about me and i heard her say it was his own fault there would be an end of all my complaining and perverseness if he was once resolved and other most impudent aggravations i am resolved not to go to bed this night if i can help it lie still lie still my poor fluttering heart what will become of me almost twelve oclock saturday night he sent mrs jewkes about ten oclock to tell me to come to him where said i ill shew you said she i went down three or four steps and saw her making to his chamber the door of which was open so i said i cannot go there dont be foolish said she but come no harm will be done to you well said i if i die i cannot go there i heard him say let her come or it shall be worse for her i cant bear said he to speak to her myself well said i i cannot come indeed i cannot and so i went up again into my closet expecting to be fetched by force but she came up soon after and bid me make haste to bed said i i will not go to bed this night thats certain then said she you shall be made to come to bed and nan and i will undress you i knew neither prayers nor tears would move this wicked woman so i said i am sure you will let master in and i shall be undone mighty piece of undone she said but he was too much exasperated against me to be so familiar with me she would assure me ay said she youll be disposed of another way soon i can tell you for your comfort and i hope your husband will have your obedience though nobody else can have it no husband in the world said i shall make me do an unjust or base thing she said that would be soon tried and nan coming in what said i am i to have two bed fellows again these warm nights yes said she slipperyone you are till you can have one good one instead of us said i mrs jewkes dont talk nastily to me i see you are beginning again and i shall affront you may be for next to bad actions are bad words for they could not be spoken if they were not in the heart come to bed purity said she you are a nonsuch i suppose indeed said i i cant come to bed and it will do you no harm to let me stay all night in the great chair nan said she undress my young lady if she wont let you ill help you and if neither of us can do it quietly well call my master to do it for us though said she i think it an office worthier of monsieur colbrand you are very wicked said i i know it said she i am a jezebel and a london prostitute you know you did great feats said i to tell my master all this poor stuff but you did not tell him how you beat me no lambkin said she a word i had not heard a good while that i left for you to tell and you was going to do it if the vulture had not taken the wolfs part and bid the poor innocent lamb be silent ay said i no matter for your fleers mrs jewkes though i can have neither justice nor mercy here and cannot be heard in my defence yet a time will come may be when i shall be heard and when your own guilt will strike you dumb ay spirit said she and the vulture too must we both be dumb why that lambkin will be pretty then said the wicked one youll have all the talk to yourself then how will the tongue of the pretty lambkin bleat out innocence and virtue and honesty till the whole trial be at an end youre a wicked woman thats certain said i and if you thought any thing of another world could not talk thus but no wonder it shews what hands im got into ay so it does said she but i beg youll undress and come to bed or i believe your innocence wont keep you from still worse hands i will come to bed said i if you will let me have the keys in my own hand not else if i can help it yes said she and then hey for another contrivance another escape no no said i all my contrivances are over ill assure you pray let me have the keys and i will come to bed she came to me and took me in her huge arms as if i was a feather said she i do this to shew you what a poor resistance you can make against me if i please to exert myself and so lambkin dont say to your wolf i wont come to bed and set me down and tapped me on the neck ah said she thou art a pretty creature tis true but so obstinate so full of spirit if thy strength was but answerable to that thou wouldst run away with us all and this great house too on thy back but undress undress i tell you well said i i see my misfortunes make you very merry and very witty too but i will love you if you will humour me with the keys of the chamberdoors are you sure you will love me said she now speak your conscience why said i you must not put it so close neither would you if you thought you had not given reason to doubt it but i will love you as well as i can i would not tell a wilful lie and if i did you would not believe me after your hard usage of me well said she thats all fair i own but nan pray pull off my young ladys shoes and stockings no pray dont said i i will come to bed presently since i must and so i went to the closet and scribbled a little about this idle chit chat and she being importunate i was forced to go to bed but with some of my clothes on as the former night and she let me hold the two keys for there are two locks there being a double door and so i got a little sleep that night having had none for two or three nights before i cant imagine what she means but nan offered to talk a little once or twice and she snubbed her and said i charge you wench dont open your lips before me and if you are asked any questions by mrs pamela dont answer her one word while i am here but she is a lordly woman to the maidservants and that has always been her character o how unlike good mrs jervis in every thing sunday morning a thought came into my head i meant no harm but it was a little bold for seeing my master dressing to go to church and his chariot getting ready i went to my closet and i writ the prayers of this congregation are earnestly desired for a gentleman of great worth and honour who labours under a temptation to exert his great power to ruin a poor distressed worthless maiden and also the prayers of this congregation are earnestly desired by a poor distressed creature for the preservation of her virtue and innocence mrs jewkes came up always writing said she and would see it and strait all that ever i could say carried it down to my master he looked upon it and said tell her she shall soon see how her prayers are answered she is very bold but as she has rejected all my favours her reckoning for all is not far off i looked after him out of the window and he was charmingly dressed to be sure he is a handsome fine gentleman what pity his heart is not as good as his appearance why cant i hate him but dont be uneasy if you should see this for it is impossible i should love him for his vices all ugly him over as i may say my master sends word that he shall not come home to dinner i suppose he dines with this sir simon darnford i am much concerned for poor mr williams mrs jewkes says he is confined still and takes on much all his trouble is brought upon him for my sake this grieves me much my master it seems will have his money from him this is very hard for it is three fifty pounds he gave him as he thought as a salary for three years that he has been with him but there was no agreement between them and he absolutely depended on my masters favour to be sure it was the more generous of him to run these risks for the sake of oppressed innocence and i hope he will meet with his reward in due time alas for me i dare not plead for him that would raise my oppressors jealousy more and i have not interest to save myself sunday evening mrs jewkes has received a line from my master i wonder what it is for his chariot is come home without him but she will tell me nothing so it is in vain to ask her i am so fearful of plots and tricks i know not what to do every thing i suspect for now my disgrace is avowed what can i think to be sure the worst will be attempted i can only pour out my soul in prayer to god for his blessed protection but if i must suffer let me not be long a mournful survivor only let me not shorten my own time sinfully this woman left upon the table in the chamber this letter of my masters to her and i bolted myself in till i had transcribed it youll see how tremblingly by the lines i wish poor mr williamss release at any rate but this letter makes my heart ache yet i have another days reprieve thank god mrs jewkes i have been so pressed on williamss affair that i shall set out this afternoon in sir simons chariot and with parson peters who is his intercessor for stamford and shall not be back till tomorrow evening if then as to your ward i am thoroughly incensed against her she has withstood her time and now would she sign and seal to my articles it is too late i shall discover something perhaps by him and will on my return let her know that all her ensnaring loveliness shall not save her from the fate that awaits her but let her know nothing of this lest it put her fruitful mind upon plots and artifices be sure trust her not without another with you at night lest she venture the window in her foolish rashness for i shall require her at your hands yours etc i had but just finished taking a copy of this and laid the letter where i had it and unbolted the door when she came up in a great fright for fear i should have seen it but i being in my closet and that lying as she left it she did not mistrust o said she i was afraid you had seen my masters letter here which i carelessly left on the table i wish said i i had known that why sure said she if you had you would not have offered to read my letters indeed said i i should at this time if it had been in my way do let me see it well said she i wish poor mr williams well off i understand my master is gone to make up matters with him which is very good to be sure added she he is a very good gentleman and very forgiving why said i as if i had known nothing of the matter how can he make up matters with him is not mr williams at stamford yes said she i believe so but parson peters pleads for him and he is gone with him to stamford and will not be back tonight so we have nothing to do but to eat our suppers betimes and go to bed ay thats pure said i and i shall have good rest this night i hope so said she you might every night but for your own idle fears you are afraid of your friends when none are near you ay thats true said i for i have not one near me so i have one more good honest night before me what the next may be i know not and so ill try to take in a good deal of sleep while i can be a little easy therefore here i say good night my dear parents for i have no more to write about this night and though his letter shocks me yet i will be as brisk as i can that she maynt suspect i have seen it tuesday night for the future i will always mistrust most when appearances look fairest o your poor daughter what has she not suffered since what i wrote on sunday night my worst trial and my fearfullest danger o how i shudder to write you an account of this wicked interval of time for my dear parents will you not be too much frightened and affected with my distress when i tell you that his journey to stamford was all abominable pretence for he came home privately and had well nigh effected all his vile purposes and the ruin of your poor daughter and that by such a plot as i was not in the least apprehensive of and oh youll hear what a vile and unwomanly part that wicked wretch mrs jewkes acted in it i left off with letting you know how much i was pleased that i had one nights reprieve added to my honesty but i had less occasion to rejoice than ever as you will judge by what i have said already take then the dreadful story as well as i can relate it the maid nan is a little apt to drink if she can get at liquor and mrs jewkes happened or designed as is too probable to leave a bottle of cherrybrandy in her way and the wench drank some of it more than she should and when she came in to lay the cloth mrs jewkes perceived it and fell a rating at her most sadly for she has too many faults of her own to suffer any of the like sort in any body else if she can help it and she bid her get out of her sight when we had supped and go to bed to sleep off her liquor before we came to bed and so the poor maid went muttering up stairs about two hours after which was near eleven oclock mrs jewkes and i went up to go to bed i pleasing myself with what a charming night i should have we locked both doors and saw poor nan as i thought but oh twas my abominable master as you shall hear by and by sitting fast asleep in an elbowchair in a dark corner of the room with her apron thrown over her head and neck and mrs jewkes said there is that beast of a wench fast asleep instead of being abed i knew said she she had taken a fine dose ill wake her said i no dont said she let her sleep on we shall he better without her ay said i so we shall but wont she get cold said she i hope you have no writing tonight no replied i i will go to bed with you mrs jewkes said she i wonder what you can find to write about so much and am sure you have better conveniences of that kind and more paper than i am aware of and i had intended to rummage you if my master had not come down for i spied a broken teacup with ink which gave me suspicion but as he is come let him look after you if he will and if you deceive him it will be his own fault all this time we were undressing ourselves and i fetched a deep sigh what do you sigh for said she i am thinking mrs jewkes answered i what a sad life i live and how hard is my lot i am sure the thief that has robbed is much better off than i bating the guilt and i should i think take it for a mercy to be hanged out of the way rather than live in these cruel apprehensions so being not sleepy and in a prattling vein i began to give a little history of myself as i did once before to mrs jervis in this manner here said i were my poor honest parents they took care to instill good principles into my mind till i was almost twelve years of age and taught me to prefer goodness and poverty to the highest condition of life and they confirmed their lessons by their own practice for they were of late years remarkably poor and always as remarkably honest even to a proverb for as honest as goodman andrews was a byeword well then said i comes my late dear good lady and takes a fancy to me and said she would be the making of me if i was a good girl and she put me to sing to dance to play on the spinnet in order to divert her melancholy hours and also taught me all manner of fine needlework but still this was her lesson my good pamela be virtuous and keep the men at a distance well so i was i hope and so i did and yet though i say it they all loved me and respected me and would do any thing for me as if i was a gentlewoman but then what comes next why it pleased god to take my good lady and then comes my master and what says he why in effect it is be not virtuous pamela so here i have lived about sixteen years in virtue and reputation and all at once when i come to know what is good and what is evil i must renounce all the good all the whole sixteen years innocence which next to gods grace i owed chiefly to my parents and my ladys good lessons and examples and choose the evil and so in a moments time become the vilest of creatures and all this for what i pray why truly for a pair of diamond earrings a necklace and a diamond ring for my finger which would not become me for a few paltry fine clothes which when i wore them would make but my former poverty more ridiculous to every body that saw me especially when they knew the base terms i wore them upon but indeed i was to have a great parcel of guineas beside i forget how many for had there been ten times more they would have been not so much to me as the honest six guineas you tricked me out of mrs jewkes well forsooth but then i was to have i know not how many pounds a year for my life and my poor father there was the jest of it was to be the manager for the abandoned prostitute his daughter and then there was the jest again my kind forgiving virtuous master would pardon me all my misdeeds yes thank him for nothing truly and what pray are all these violent misdeeds why they are for daring to adhere to the good lessons that were taught me and not learning a new one that would have reversed all my former for not being contented when i was run away with in order to be ruined but contriving if my poor wits had been able to get out of danger and preserve myself honest then was he once jealous of poor john though he knew john was his own creature and helped to deceive me then was he outrageous against poor parson williams and him has this good merciful master thrown into gaol and for what why truly for that being a divine and a good man he had the fear of god before his eyes and was willing to forego all his expectations of interest and assist an oppressed poor creature but to be sure i must be forward bold saucy and what not to dare to run away from certain ruin and to strive to escape from an unjust confinement and i must be married to the parson nothing so sure he would have had but a poor catch of me had i consented but he and you too know i did not want to marry any body i only wanted to go to my poor parents and to have my own liberty and not to be confined by such an unlawful restraint and which would not have been inflicted upon me but only that i am a poor destitute young body and have no friend that is able to right me so mrs jewkes said i here is my history in brief and i am a very unhappy young creature to be sure and why am i so why because my master sees something in my person that takes his present fancy and because i would not be undone why therefore to choose i must and i shall be undone and this is all the reason that can be given she heard me run on all this time while i was undressing without any interruption and i said well i must go to the two closets ever since an affair of the closet at the other house though he is so far off and i have a good mind to wake this poor maid no dont said she i charge you i am very angry with her and shell get no harm there and if she wakes she may come to bed well enough as long as there is a candle in the chimney so i looked into the closet and kneeled down in my own as i used to do to say my prayers and this with my underclothes in my hand all undressed and passed by the poor sleeping wench as i thought in my return but oh little did i think it was my wicked wicked master in a gown and petticoat of hers and her apron over his face and shoulders what meanness will not lucifer make his votaries stoop to to gain their abominable ends mrs jewkes by this time was got to bed on the farther side as she used to be and to make room for the maid when she should awake i got into bed and lay close to her and i said where are the keys though said i i am not so much afraid tonight here said the wicked woman put your arm under mine and you shall find them about my wrist as they used to be so i did and the abominable designer held my hand with her righthand as my rightarm was under her left in less than a quarter of an hour i said theres poor nan awake i hear her stir let us go to sleep said she and not mind her shell come to bed when shes quite awake poor soul said i ill warrant she will have the headache finely tomorrow for this be silent said she and go to sleep you keep me awake and i never found you in so talkative a humour in my life dont chide me said i i will but say one thing more do you think nan could hear me talk of my masters offers no no said she she was dead asleep im glad of that said i because i would not expose my master to his common servants and i knew you were no stranger to his fine articles said she i think they were fine articles and you were bewitched you did not close with them but let us go to sleep so i was silent and the pretended nan o wicked base villanous designer what a plot what an unexpected plot was this seemed to be awaking and mrs jewkes abhorrent creature said come nan what are you awake at last prythee come to bed for mrs pamela is in a talking fit and wont go to sleep one while at that the pretended she came to the bed side and sitting down in a chair where the curtain hid her began to undress said i poor mrs anne i warrant your head aches most sadly how do you do says he one word with you pamela one word hear me but i must say one word to you it is this you see now you are in my power you cannot get from me nor help yourself yet have i not offered any thing amiss to you but if you resolve not to comply with my proposals i will not lose this opportunity if you do i will yet leave you o sir said i leave me leave me but and i will do any thing i ought to do swear then to me said he that you will accept my proposals with struggling fright terror i fainted away quite and did not come to myself soon so that they both from the cold sweats that i was in thought me dying and i remember no more than that when with great difficulty they brought me to myself she was sitting on one side of the bed with her clothes on and he on the other with his and in his gown and slippers your poor pamela cannot answer for the liberties taken with her in her deplorable state of death and when i saw them there i sat up in my bed without any regard to what appearance i made and nothing about my neck and he soothing me with an aspect of pity and concern i put my hand to his mouth and said o tell me yet tell me not what have i suffered in this distress and i talked quite wild and knew not what for to be sure i was on the point of distraction he most solemnly and with a bitter imprecation vowed that he had not offered the least indecency that he was frightened at the terrible manner i was taken with the fit that he should desist from his attempt and begged but to see me easy and quiet and he would leave me directly and go to his own bed o then said i take with you this most wicked woman this vile mrs jewkes as an earnest that i may believe you and will you sir said the wicked wretch for a fit or two give up such an opportunity as this i thought you had known the sex better she is now you see quite well again this i heard more she might say but i fainted away once more at these words and at his clasping his arms about me again and when i came a little to myself i saw him sit there and the maid nan holding a smellingbottle to my nose and no mrs jewkes he said taking my hand now will i vow to you my dear pamela that i will leave you the moment i see you better and pacified heres nan knows and will tell you my concern for you i vow to god i have not offered any indecency to you and since i found mrs jewkes so offensive to you i have sent her to the maids bed and the maid shall be with you tonight and but promise me that you will compose yourself and i will leave you but said i will not nan also hold my hand and will not she let you come in again to me he said by heaven i will not come in again tonight nan undress yourself go to bed and do all you can to comfort the dear creature and now pamela said he give me but your hand and say you forgive me and i will leave you to your repose i held out my trembling hand which he vouchsafed to kiss and i said god forgive you sir as you have been just in my distress and as you will be just to what you promise and he withdrew with a countenance of remorse as i hoped and she shut the doors and at my request brought the keys to bed this o my dear parents was a most dreadful trial i tremble still to think of it and dare not recall all the horrid circumstances of it i hope as he assures me he was not guilty of indecency but have reason to bless god who by disabling me in my faculties empowered me to preserve my innocence and when all my strength would have signified nothing magnified himself in my weakness i was so weak all day on monday that i could not get out of my bed my master shewed great tenderness for me and i hope he is really sorry and that this will be his last attempt but he does not say so neither he came in the morning as soon as he heard the door open and i began to be fearful he stopped short of the bed and said rather than give you apprehensions i will come no farther i said your honour sir and your mercy is all i have to beg he sat himself on the side of the bed and asked kindly how i did begged me to be composed said i still looked a little wildly and i said pray good sir let me not see this infamous mrs jewkes i doubt i cannot bear her sight she shant come near you all this day if youll promise to compose yourself then sir i will try he pressed my hand very tenderly and went out what a change does this shew o may it be lasting but alas he seems only to have altered his method of proceeding and retains i doubt his wicked purpose on tuesday about ten oclock when my master heard i was up he sent for me down into the parlour as soon as he saw me he said come nearer to me pamela i did so and he took my hand and said you begin to look well again i am glad of it you little slut how did you frighten me on sunday night sir said i pray name not that night and my eyes overflowed at the remembrance and i turned my head aside said he place some little confidence in me i know what those charming eyes mean and you shall not need to explain yourself for i do assure you that as soon as i saw you change and a cold sweat bedew your pretty face and you fainted away i quitted the bed and mrs jewkes did so too and i put on my gown and she fetched her smellingbottle and we both did all we could to restore you and my passion for you was all swallowed up in the concern i had for your recovery for i thought i never saw a fit so strong and violent in my life and feared we should not bring you to life again for what i saw you in once before was nothing to it this said he might be my folly and my unacquaintedness with what passion your sex can shew when they are in earnest but this i repeat to you that your mind may be entirely comforted whatever i offered to you was before you fainted away and that i am sure was innocent sir said i that was very bad and it was too plain you had the worst designs when said he i tell you the truth in one instance you may believe me in the other i know not i declare beyond this lovely bosom your sex but that i did intend what you call the worst is most certain and though i would not too much alarm you now i could curse my weakness and my folly which makes me own that i love you beyond all your sex and cannot live without you but if i am master of myself and my own resolution i will not attempt to force you to any thing again sir said i you may easily keep your resolution if youll send me out of your way to my poor parents that is all i beg tis a folly to talk of it said he you must not shall not go and if i could be assured you would not attempt it you should have better usage and your confinement should be made easier to you but to what end sir am i to stay said i you yourself seem not sure you can keep your own present good resolutions and do you think if i was to stay when i could get away and be safe it would not look as if either i confided too much in my own strength or would tempt my ruin and as if i was not in earnest to wish myself safe and out of danger and then how long am i to stay and to what purpose and in what light must i appear to the world would not that censure me although i might be innocent and you will allow sir that if there be any thing valuable or exemplary in a good name or fair reputation one must not despise the worlds censure if one can avoid it well said he i sent not for you on this account just now but for two reasons the first is that you promise me that for a fortnight to come you will not offer to go away without my express consent and this i expect for your own sake that i may give you a little more liberty and the second is that you will see and forgive mrs jewkes she takes on much and thinks that as all her fault was her obedience to me it would be very hard to sacrifice her as she calls it to your resentment as to the first sir said i it is a hard injunction for the reasons i have mentioned and as to the second considering her vile unwomanly wickedness and her endeavours to instigate you more to ruin me when your returning goodness seemed to have some compassion upon me it is still harder but to shew my obedience to your commands for you know my dear parents i might as well make a merit of my compliance when my refusal would stand me in no stead i will consent to both and to every thing else that you shall be pleased to enjoin which i can do with innocence thats my good girl said he and kissed me this is quite prudent and shews me that you dont take insolent advantage of my favour for you and will perhaps stand you in more stead than you are aware of so he rung the bell and said call down mrs jewkes she came down and he took my hand and put it into hers and said mrs jewkes i am obliged to you for all your diligence and fidelity to me but pamela i must own is not because the service i employed you in was not so very obliging to her as i could have wished she would have thought it and you were not to favour her but obey me but yet ill assure you at the very first word she has once obliged me by consenting to be friends with you and if she gives me no great cause i shall not perhaps put you on such disagreeable service again now therefore be you once more bedfellows and boardfellows as i may say for some days longer and see that pamela sends no letters nor messages out of the house nor keeps a correspondence unknown to me especially with that williams and as for the rest shew the dear girl all the respect that is due to one i must love if she will deserve it as i hope she will yet and let her be under no unnecessary or harsh restraints but your watchful care is not however to cease and remember that you are not to disoblige me to oblige her and that i will not cannot yet part with her mrs jewkes looked very sullen and as if she would be glad still to do me a good turn if it lay in her power i took courage then to drop a word or two for poor mr williams but he was angry with me for it and said he could not endure to hear his name in my mouth so i was forced to have done for that time all this time my papers that i buried under the rosebush lay there still and i begged for leave to send a letter to you so i should he said if he might read it first but this did not answer my design and yet i would have sent you such a letter as he might see if i had been sure my danger was over but that i cannot for he now seems to take another method and what i am more afraid of because may be he may watch an opportunity and join force with it on occasion when i am least prepared for now he seems to abound with kindness and talks of love without reserve and makes nothing of allowing himself in the liberty of kissing me which he calls innocent but which i do not like and especially in the manner he does it but for a master to do it at all to a servant has meaning too much in it not to alarm an honest body wednesday morning i find i am watched and suspected still very close and i wish i was with you but that must not be it seems this fortnight i dont like this fortnight and it will be a tedious and a dangerous one to me i doubt my master just now sent for me down to take a walk with him in the garden but i like him not at all nor his ways for he would have all the way his arm about my waist and said abundance of fond things to me enough to make me proud if his design had not been apparent after walking about he led me into a little alcove on the farther part of the garden and really made me afraid of myself for he began to be very teasing and made me sit on his knee and was so often kissing me that i said sir i dont like to be here at all i assure you indeed you make me afraid and what made me the more so was what he once said to mrs jewkes and did not think i heard him and which though always uppermost with me i did not mention before because i did not know how to bring it in in my writing she i suppose had been encouraging him in his wickedness for it was before the last dreadful trial and i only heard what he answered said he i will try once more but i have begun wrong for i see terror does but add to her frost but she is a charming girl and may be thawed by kindness and i should have melted her by love instead of freezing her by fear is he not a wicked sad man for this to be sure i blush while i write it but i trust that that god who has delivered me from the paw of the lion and the bear that is his and mrs jewkess violences will soon deliver me from this philistine that i may not defy the commands of the living god but as i was saying this expression coming into my thoughts i was of opinion i could not be too much on my guard at all times more especially when he took such liberties for he professed honour all the time with his mouth while his actions did not correspond i begged and prayed he would let me go and had i not appeared quite regardless of all he said and resolved not to stay if i could help it i know not how far he would have proceeded for i was forced to fall down upon my knees at last he walked out with me still bragging of his honour and his love yes yes sir said i your honour is to destroy mine and your love is to ruin me i see it too plainly but indeed i will not talk with you sir said i any more do you know said he whom you talk to and where you are you may believe i had reason to think him not so decent as he should be for i said as to where i am sir i know it too well and that i have no creature to befriend me and as to whom i talk to sir let me ask you what you would have me answer why tell me said he what answer you would make it will only make you angry said i and so i shall fare worse if possible i wont be angry said he why then sir said i you cannot be my late good ladys son for she loved me and taught me virtue you cannot then be my master for no master demeans himself so to his poor servant he put his arm round me and his other hand on my neck which made me more angry and bold and he said what then am i why said i struggling from him and in a great passion to be sure you are lucifer himself in the shape of my master or you could not use me thus these are too great liberties said he in anger and i desire that you will not repeat them for your own sake for if you have no decency towards me ill have none towards you i was running from him and he said come back when i bid you so knowing every place was alike dangerous to me and i had nobody to run to i came back at his call and seeing him look displeased i held my hands together and wept and said pray sir forgive me no said he rather say pray lucifer forgive me and now since you take me for the devil how can you expect any good from me how rather can you expect any thing but the worst treatment from me you have given me a character pamela and blame me not that i act up to it sir said i let me beg you to forgive me i am really sorry for my boldness but indeed you dont use me like a gentleman and how can i express my resentment if i mince the matter while you are so indecent precise fool said he what indecencies have i offered you i was bewitched i had not gone through my purpose last sunday night and then your licentious tongue had not given the worst name to little puny freedoms that shew my love and my folly at the same time but begone said he taking my hand and tossing it from him and learn another conduct and more wit and i will lay aside my foolish regard for you and assert myself begone said he again with a haughty air indeed sir said i i cannot go till you pardon me which i beg on my bended knees i am truly sorry for my boldness but i see how you go on you creep by little and little upon me and now soothe me and now threaten me and if i should forbear to shew my resentment when you offer incivilities to me would not that be to be lost by degrees would it not shew that i could bear any thing from you if i did not express all the indignation i could express at the first approaches you make to what i dread and have you not as good as avowed my ruin and have you once made me hope you will quit your purposes against me how then sir can i act but by shewing my abhorrence of every step that makes towards my undoing and what is left me but words and can these words be other than such strong ones as shall shew the detestation which from the bottom of my heart i have for every attempt upon my virtue judge for me sir and pardon me pardon you said he what when you dont repent when you have the boldness to justify yourself in your fault why dont you say you never will again offend me i will endeavour sir said i always to preserve that decency towards you which becomes me but really sir i must beg your excuse for saying that when you forget what belongs to decency in your actions and when words are all that are left me to shew my resentment of such actions i will not promise to forbear the strongest expressions that my distressed mind shall suggest to me nor shall your angriest frowns deter me when my honesty is in question what then said he do you beg pardon for where is the promise of amendment for which i should forgive you indeed sir said i i own that must absolutely depend on your usage of me for i will bear any thing you can inflict upon me with patience even to the laying down of my life to shew my obedience to you in other cases but i cannot be patient i cannot be passive when my virtue is at stake it would be criminal in me if i was he said he never saw such a fool in his life and he walked by the side of me some yards without saying a word and seemed vexed and at last walked in bidding me attend him in the garden after dinner so having a little time i went up and wrote thus far wednesday night if my dear parents i am not destined more surely than ever for ruin i have now more comfort before me than ever i yet knew and am either nearer my happiness or my misery than ever i was god protect me from the latter if it be his blessed will i have now such a scene to open to you that i know will alarm both your hopes and your fears as it does mine and this it is after my master had dined he took a turn into the stables to look at his stud of horses and when he came in he opened the parlourdoor where mrs jewkes and i sat at dinner and at his entrance we both rose up but he said sit still sit still and let me see how you eat your victuals pamela o said mrs jewkes very poorly indeed sir no said i pretty well sir considering none of your considerings said he pretty face and tapped me on the cheek i blushed but was glad he was so goodhumoured but i could not tell how to sit before him nor to behave myself so he said i know pamela you are a nice carver my mother used to say so my lady sir said i was very good to me in every thing and would always make me do the honours of her table for her when she was with her few select friends that she loved cut up said he that chicken i did so now said he and took a knife and fork and put a wing upon my plate let me see you eat that o sir said i i have eaten a whole breast of a chicken already and cannot eat so much but he said i must eat it for his sake and he would teach me to eat heartily so i did eat it but was much confused at his so kind and unusual freedom and condescension and good lack you cant imagine how mrs jewkes looked and stared and how respectful she seemed to me and called me good madam ill assure you urging me to take a little bit of tart my master took two or three turns about the room musing and thoughtful as i had never before seen him and at last he went out saying i am going into the garden you know pamela what i said to you before dinner i rose and courtesied saying i would attend his honour and he said do good girl well said mrs jewkes i see how things will go o madam as she called me again i am sure you are to be our mistress and then i know what will become of me ah mrs jewkes said i if i can but keep myself virtuous tis the most of my ambition and i hope no temptation shall make me otherwise notwithstanding i had no reason to be pleased with his treatment of me before dinner yet i made haste to attend him and i found him walking by the side of that pond which for want of grace and through a sinful despondence had like to have been so fatal to me and the sight of which ever since has been a trouble and reproach to me and it was by the side of this pond and not far from the place where i had that dreaded conflict that my present hopes if i am not to be deceived again began to dawn which i presume to flatter myself with being a happy omen for me as if god almighty would shew your poor sinful daughter how well i did to put my affiance in his goodness and not to throw away myself because my ruin seemed inevitable to my shortsighted apprehension so he was pleased to say well pamela i am glad you are come of your own accord as i may say give me your hand i did so and he looked at me very steadily and pressing my hand all the time at last said i will now talk to you in a serious manner you have a good deal of wit a great deal of penetration much beyond your years and as i thought your opportunities you are possessed of an open frank and generous mind and a person so lovely that you excel all your sex in my eyes all these accomplishments have engaged my affection so deeply that as i have often said i cannot live without you and i would divide with all my soul my estate with you to make you mine upon my own terms these you have absolutely rejected and that though in saucy terms enough yet in such a manner as makes me admire you the more your pretty chitchat to mrs jewkes the last sunday night so innocent and so full of beautiful simplicity half disarmed my resolution before i approached your bed and i see you so watchful over your virtue that though i hoped to find it otherwise i cannot but confess my passion for you is increased by it but now what shall i say farther pamela i will make you though a party my adviser in this matter though not perhaps my definitive judge you know i am not a very abandoned profligate i have hitherto been guilty of no very enormous or vile actions this of seizing you and confining you thus may perhaps be one of the worst at least to persons of real innocence had i been utterly given up to my passions i should before now have gratified them and not have shewn that remorse and compassion for you which have reprieved you more than once when absolutely in my power and you are as inviolate a virgin as you were when you came into my house but what can i do consider the pride of my condition i cannot endure the thought of marriage even with a person of equal or superior degree to myself and have declined several proposals of that kind how then with the distance between us in the worlds judgment can i think of making you my wife yet i must have you i cannot bear the thoughts of any other man supplanting me in your affections and the very apprehension of that has made me hate the name of williams and use him in a manner unworthy of my temper now pamela judge for me and since i have told you thus candidly my mind and i see yours is big with some important meaning by your eyes your blushes and that sweet confusion which i behold struggling in your bosom tell me with like openness and candour what you think i ought to do and what you would have me do it is impossible for me to express the agitations of my mind on this unexpected declaration so contrary to his former behaviour his manner too had something so noble and so sincere as i thought that alas for me i found i had need of all my poor discretion to ward off the blow which this treatment gave to my most guarded thoughts i threw myself at his feet for i trembled and could hardly stand o sir said i spare your poor servants confusion o spare the poor pamela speak out said he and tell me when i bid you what you think i ought to do i cannot say what you ought to do answered i but i only beg you will not ruin me and if you think me virtuous if you think me sincerely honest let me go to my poor parents i will vow to you that i will never suffer myself to be engaged without your approbation still he insisted upon a more explicit answer to his question of what i thought he ought to do and i did as to my poor thoughts of what you ought to do i must needs say that indeed i think you ought to regard the worlds opinion and avoid doing any thing disgraceful to your birth and fortune and therefore if you really honour the poor pamela with your respect a little time absence and the conversation of worthier persons of my sex will effectually enable you to overcome a regard so unworthy your condition and this good sir is the best advice i can offer charming creature lovely pamela said he with an ardour that was never before so agreeable to me this generous manner is of a piece with all the rest of your conduct but tell me still more explicitly what you would advise me to in the case o sir said i take not advantage of my credulity and these my weak moments but were i the first lady in the land instead of the poor abject pamela i would i could tell you but i can say no more o my dear father and mother now i know you will indeed be concerned for me for now i am for myself and now i begin to be afraid i know too well the reason why all his hard trials of me and my black apprehensions would not let me hate him but be assured still by gods grace that i shall do nothing unworthy of your pamela and if i find that he is still capable of deceiving me and that this conduct is only put on to delude me more i shall think nothing in this world so vile and so odious and nothing if he be not the worst of his kind as he says and i hope he is not so desperately guileful as the heart of man he generously said i will spare your confusion pamela but i hope i may promise myself that you can love me preferably to any other man and that no one in the world has had any share in your affections for i am very jealous of what i love and if i thought you had a secret whispering in your soul that had not yet come up to a wish for any other man breathing i should not forgive myself to persist in my affection for you nor you if you did not frankly acquaint me with it as i still continued on my knees on the grass border by the pondside he sat himself down on the grass by me and took me in his arms why hesitates my pamela said he can you not answer me with truth as i wish if you cannot speak and i will forgive you o good sir said i it is not that indeed it is not but a frightful word or two that you said to mrs jewkes when you thought i was not in hearing comes cross my mind and makes me dread that i am in more danger than ever i was in my life you have never found me a common liar said he too fearful and foolish pamela nor will i answer how long i may hold in my present mind for my pride struggles hard within me ill assure you and if you doubt me i have no obligation to your confidence or opinion but at present i am really sincere in what i say and i expect you will be so too and answer directly my question i find sir said i i know not myself and your question is of such a nature that i only want to tell you what i heard and to have your kind answer to it or else what i have to say to your question may pave the way to my ruin and shew a weakness that i did not believe was in me well said he you may say what you have overheard for in not answering me directly you put my soul upon the rack and half the trouble i have had with you would have brought to my arms one of the finest ladies in england o sir said i my virtue is as dear to me as if i was of the highest quality and my doubts for which you know i have had too much reason have made me troublesome but now sir i will tell you what i heard which has given me great uneasiness you talked to mrs jewkes of having begun wrong with me in trying to subdue me with terror and of frost and such like you remember it well and that you would for the future change your conduct and try to melt me that was your word by kindness i fear not sir the grace of god supporting me that any acts of kindness would make me forget what i owe to my virtue but sir i may i find be made more miserable by such acts than by terror because my nature is too frank and open to make me wish to be ungrateful and if i should be taught a lesson i never yet learnt with what regret should i descend to the grave to think that i could not hate my undoer and that at the last great day i must stand up as an accuser of the poor unhappy soul that i could wish it in my power to save exalted girl said he what a thought is that why now pamela you excel yourself you have given me a hint that will hold me long but sweet creature said he tell me what is this lesson which you never yet learnt and which you are so afraid of learning if sir said i you will again generously spare my confusion i need not speak it but this i will say in answer to the question you seem most solicitous about that i know not the man breathing that i would wish to be married to or that ever i thought of with such an idea i had brought my mind so to love poverty that i hoped for nothing but to return to the best though the poorest of parents and to employ myself in serving god and comforting them and you know not sir how you disappointed those hopes and my proposed honest pleasures when you sent me hither well then said he i may promise myself that neither the parson nor any other man is any the least secret motive to your steadfast refusal of my offers indeed sir said i you may and as you was pleased to ask i answer that i have not the least shadow of a wish or thought for any man living but said he for i am foolishly jealous and yet it shews my fondness for you have you not encouraged williams to think you will have him indeed sir said i i have not but the very contrary and would you not have had him said he if you had got away by his means i had resolved sir said i in my mind otherwise and he knew it and the poor man i charge you said he say not a word in his favour you will excite a whirlwind in my soul if you name him with kindness and then youll be borne away with the tempest sir said i i have done nay said he but do not have done let me know the whole if you have any regard for him speak out for it would end fearfully for you for me and for him if i found that you disguised any secret of your soul from me in this nice particular sir said i if i have ever given you cause to think me sincere say then said he interrupting me with great vehemence and taking both my hands between his say that you now in the presence of god declare that you have not any the most hidden regard for williams or any other man sir said i i do as god shall bless me and preserve my innocence i have not well said he i will believe you pamela and in time perhaps i may better bear that mans name and if i am convinced that you are not prepossessed my vanity makes me assured that i need not to fear a place in your esteem equal if not preferable to any man in england but yet it stings my pride to the quick that you was so easily brought and at such a short acquaintance to run away with that college novice o good sir said i may i be heard one thing and though i bring upon me your highest indignation i will tell you perhaps the unnecessary and imprudent but yet the whole truth my honesty i am poor and lowly and am not entitled to call it honour was in danger i saw no means of securing myself from your avowed attempts you had shewed you would not stick at little matters and what sir could any body have thought of my sincerity in preferring that to all other considerations if i had not escaped from these dangers if i could have found any way for it i am not going to say any thing for him but indeed indeed sir i was the cause of putting him upon assisting me in my escape i got him to acquaint me what gentry there were in the neighbourhood that i might fly to and prevailed upon him dont frown at me good sir for i must tell you the whole truth to apply to one lady jones to lady darnford and he was so good to apply to mr peters the minister but they all refused me and then it was he let me know that there was no honourable way but marriage that i declined and he agreed to assist me for gods sake now said he you are going i boldly put my hand before his mouth hardly knowing the liberty i took pray sir said i dont be angry i have just done i would only say that rather than have staid to be ruined i would have thrown myself upon the poorest beggar that ever the world saw if i thought him honest and i hope when you duly weigh all matters you will forgive me and not think me so bold and so forward as you have been pleased to call me well said he even in this your last speech which let me tell you shews more your honesty of heart than your prudence you have not over much pleased me but i must love you and that vexes me not a little but tell me pamela for now the former question recurs since you so much prize your honour and your virtue since all attempts against that are so odious to you and since i have avowedly made several of these attempts do you think it is possible for you to love me preferably to any other of my sex ah sir said i and here my doubt recurs that you may thus graciously use me to take advantage of my credulity still perverse and doubting said he cannot you take me as i am at present and that i have told you is sincere and undesigning whatever i may be hereafter ah sir replied i what can i say i have already said too much if this dreadful hereafter should take place dont bid me say how well i can and then my face glowing as the fire i all abashed leaned upon his shoulder to hide my confusion he clasped me to him with great ardour and said hide your dear face in my bosom my beloved pamela your innocent freedoms charm me but then say how well what if you will be good said i to your poor servant and spare her i cannot say too much but if not i am doubly undone undone indeed said he i hope my present temper will hold for i tell you frankly that i have known in this agreeable hour more sincere pleasure than i have experienced in all the guilty tumults that my desiring soul compelled me into in the hopes of possessing you on my own terms and pamela you must pray for the continuance of this temper and i hope your prayers will get the better of my temptations this sweet goodness overpowered all my reserves i threw myself at his feet and embraced his knees what pleasure sir you give me at these gracious words is not lent your poor servant to express i shall be too much rewarded for all my sufferings if this goodness hold god grant it may for your own souls sake as well as mine and oh how happy should i be if he stopt me and said but my dear girl what must we do about the world and the worlds censure indeed i cannot marry now was i again struck all of a heap however soon recollecting myself sir said i i have not the presumption to hope such an honour if i may be permitted to return in peace and safety to my poor parents to pray for you there it is all i at present request this sir after all my apprehensions and dangers will be a great pleasure to me and if i know my own poor heart i shall wish you happy in a lady of suitable degree and rejoice most sincerely in every circumstance that shall make for the happiness of my late good ladys most beloved son well said he this conversation pamela is gone farther than i intended it you need not be afraid at this rate of trusting yourself with me but it is i that ought to be doubtful of myself when i am with you but before i say any thing farther on this subject i will take my proud heart to task and till then let every thing be as if this conversation had never passed only let me tell you that the more confidence you place in me the more youll oblige me but your doubts will only beget cause of doubts and with this ambiguous saying he saluted me with a more formal manner if i may so say than before and lent me his hand and so we walked toward the house side by side he seeming very thoughtful and pensive as if he had already repented him of his goodness what shall i do what steps take if all this be designing o the perplexities of these cruel doubtings to be sure if he be false as i may call it i have gone too far much too far i am ready on the apprehension of this to bite my forward tongue or rather to beat my more forward heart that dictated to that poor machine for what i have said but sure at least he must be sincere for the time he could not be such a practised dissembler if he could o how desperately wicked is the heart of man and where could he learn all these barbarous arts if so it must be native surely to the sex but silent be my rash censurings be hushed ye stormy tumults of my disturbed mind for have i not a father who is a man a man who knows no guile who would do no wrong who would not deceive or oppress to gain a kingdom how then can i think it is native to the sex and i must also hope my good ladys son cannot be the worst of men if he is hard the lot of the excellent woman that bore him but much harder the hap of your poor pamela who has fallen into such hands but yet i will trust in god and hope the best and so lay down my tired pen for this time thursday morning somebody rapped at our chamberdoor this morning soon after it was light mrs jewkes asked who it was my master said open the door mrs jewkes o said i for gods sake mrs jewkes dont indeed said she but i must then said i and clung about her let me slip on my clothes first but he rapped again and she broke from me and i was frightened out of my wits and folded myself in the bedclothes he entered and said what pamela so fearful after what passed yesterday between us o sir sir said i i fear my prayers have wanted their wished effect pray good sir consider he sat down on the bedside and interrupted me no need of your foolish fears i shall say but a word or two and go away after you went up stairs said he i had an invitation to a ball which is to be this night at stamford on occasion of a wedding and i am going to call on sir simon and his lady and daughters for the bride is a relation of theirs so i shall not be at home till saturday i come therefore to caution you mrs jewkes before pamela that she may not wonder at being closer confined than for these three or four days past that nobody sees her nor delivers any letter to her in that space for a person has been seen lurking about and inquiring after her and i have been well informed that either mrs jervis or mr longman has written a letter with a design of having it conveyed to her and said he you must know pamela that i have ordered mr longman to give up his accounts and have dismissed jonathan and mrs jervis since i have been here for their behaviour has been intolerable and they have made such a breach between my sister davers and me as we shall never perhaps make up now pamela i shall take it kindly in you if you will confine yourself to your chamber pretty much for the time i am absent and not give mrs jewkes cause of trouble or uneasiness and the rather as you know she acts by my orders alas sir said i i fear all these good people have suffered for my sake why said he i believe so too and there was never a girl of your innocence that set a large family in such an uproar surely but let that pass you know both of you my mind and in part the reason of it i shall only say that i have had such a letter from my sister as i could not have expected and pamela said he neither you nor i have reason to thank her as you shall know perhaps at my return i go in my coach mrs jewkes because i take lady darnford and mrs peterss niece and one of lady darnfords daughters along with me and sir simon and his other daughter go in his chariot so let all the gates be fastened and dont take any airing in either of the chariots nor let any body go to the gate without you mrs jewkes ill be sure said she to obey your honour i will give mrs jewkes no trouble sir said i and will keep pretty much in my chamber and not stir so much as into the garden without her to shew you i will obey in every thing i can but i begin to fear ay said he more plots and contrivances dont you but ill assure you you never had less reason and i tell you the truth for i am really going to stamford this time and upon the occasion i tell you and so pamela give me your hand and one kiss and then i am gone i durst not refuse and said god bless you sir wherever you go but i am sorry for what you tell me about your servants he and mrs jewkes had a little talk without the door and i heard her say you may depend sir upon my care and vigilance he went in his coach as he said he should and very richly dressed which looks as if what he said was likely but really i have been used to so many tricks and plots and surprises that i know not what to think but i mourn for poor mrs jervis so here is parson williams heres poor naughty john here is good mrs jervis and mr longman and mr jonathan turned away for me mr longman is rich indeed and so need the less matter it but i know it will grieve him and for poor mr jonathan i am sure it will cut that good old servant to the heart alas for me what mischiefs am i the occasion of or rather my master whose actions towards me have made so many of my kind friends forfeit his favour for my sake i am very sad about these things if he really loved me methinks he should not be so angry that his servants loved me too i know not what to think friday night i have removed my papers from under the rosebush for i saw the gardener begin to dig near that spot and i was afraid he would find them mrs jewkes and i were looking yesterday through the iron gate that fronts the elms and a gipsylike body made up to us and said if madam you will give me some broken victuals i will tell you both your fortunes i said let us hear our fortunes mrs jewkes she said i dont like these sort of people but we will hear what shell say to us however i shant fetch you any victuals woman but i will give you some pence said she but nan coming out she said fetch some bread and some of the cold meat and you shall have your fortune told nan this youll think like some of my other matters a very trifling thing to write about but mark the discovery of a dreadful plot which i have made by it o bless me what can i think of this naughty this very naughty gentleman now will i hate him most heartily thus it was mrs jewkes had no suspicion of the woman the iron gate being locked and she on the outside and we on the inside and so put her hand through she said muttering over a parcel of cramp words why madam you will marry soon i can tell you at that she seemed pleased and said i am glad to hear that and shook her fat sides with laughing the woman looked most earnestly at me all the time and as if she had meaning then it came into my head from my masters caution that possibly this woman might be employed to try to get a letter into my hands and i was resolved to watch all her motions so mrs jewkes said what sort of a man shall i have pray why said she a man younger than yourself and a very good husband hell prove i am glad of that said she and laughed again come madam let us hear your fortune the woman came to me and took my hand o said she i cannot tell your fortune your hand is so white and fine i cannot see the lines but said she and stooping pulled up a little tuft of grass i have a way for that and so rubbed my hand with the mould part of the tuft now said she i can see the lines mrs jewkes was very watchful of all her ways and took the tuft and looked upon it lest any thing should be in that and then the woman said here is the line of jupiter crossing the line of life and mars odd my pretty mistress said she you had best take care of yourself for you are hard beset ill assure you you will never be married i can see and will die of your first child out upon thee woman said i better thou hadst never come here said mrs jewkes whispering i dont like this it looks like a cheat pray mrs pamela go in this moment so i will said i for i have enough of fortunetelling and in i went the woman wanted sadly to tell me more which made mrs jewkes threaten her suspecting still the more and away the woman went having told nan her fortune and she would be drowned this thing ran strongly in all our heads and we went an hour after to see if the woman was lurking about and took mr colbrand for our guard looking through the iron gate he spied a man sauntering about the middle of the walk which filled mrs jewkes with still more suspicions and she said mr colbrand you and i will walk towards this fellow and see what he saunters there for and nan do you and madam stay at the gate so they opened the iron gate and walked down towards the man and guessing the woman if employed must mean something by the tuft of grass i cast my eye that way whence she pulled it and saw more grass seemingly pulled up then i doubted not something was there for me and i walked to it and standing over it said to nan thats a pretty sort of wild flower that grows yonder near the elm the fifth from us on the left pray pull it for me said she it is a common weed well said i but pull it for me there are sometimes beautiful colours in a weed while she went on i stooped and pulled up a good handful of the grass and in it a bit of paper which i put instantly in my bosom and dropt the grass and my heart went pitapat at the odd adventure said i lets go in mrs anne no said she we must stay till mrs jewkes comes i was all impatience to read this paper and when colbrand and she returned i went in said she certainly there is some reason for my masters caution i can make nothing of this sauntering fellow but to be sure there was some roguery in the gipsy well said i if there was she lost her aim you see ay very true said she but that was owing to my watchfulness and you was very good to go away when i spoke to you i hastened up stairs to my closet and found the billet to contain in a hand that seemed disguised and bad spelling the following words twenty contrivances have been thought of to let you know your danger but all have proved in vain your friends hope it is not yet too late to give you this caution if it reaches your hands the squire is absolutely determined to ruin you and because he despairs of any other way he will pretend great love and kindness to you and that he will marry you you may expect a parson for this purpose in a few days but it is a sly artful fellow of a broken attorney that he has hired to personate a minister the man has a broad face pitted much with the smallpox and is a very great companion so take care of yourself doubt not this advice perhaps youll have had but too much reason already to confirm you in the truth of it from your zealous well wisher somebody now my dear father and mother what shall we say of this truly diabolical master o how shall i find words to paint my griefs and his deceit i have as good as confessed i love him but indeed it was on supposing him good this however has given him too much advantage but now i will break this wicked forward heart of mine if it will not be taught to hate him o what a black dismal heart must he have so here is a plot to ruin me and by my own consent to no wonder he did not improve his wicked opportunities which i thought owing to remorse for his sin and compassion for me when he had such a project as this in reserve here should i have been deluded with the hopes of a happiness that my highest ambition could have had aspired to but how dreadful must have been my lot when i had found myself an undone creature and a guilty harlot instead of a lawful wife oh this is indeed too much too much for your poor pamela to support this is the worse as i hoped all the worst was over and that i had the pleasure of beholding a reclaimed man and not an abandoned libertine what now must your poor daughter do now all her hopes are dashed and if this fails him then comes to be sure my forced disgrace for this shews he will never leave till he has ruined me o the wretched wretched pamela saturday noon one oclock my master is come home and to be sure has been where he said so once he has told truth and this matter seems to be gone off without a plot no doubt he depends upon his sham wicked marriage he has brought a gentleman with him to dinner and so i have not seen him yet two oclock i am very sorrowful and still have greater reason for just now as i was in my closet opening the parcel i had hid under the rosebush to see if it was damaged by lying so long mrs jewkes came upon me by surprise and laid her hands upon it for she had been looking through the keyhole it seems i know not what i shall do for now he will see all my private thoughts of him and all my secrets as i may say what a careless creature i am to be sure i deserve to be punished you know i had the good luck by mr williamss means to send you all my papers down to sunday night the th day of my imprisonment but now these papers contain all my matters from that time to wednesday the th day of my distress and which as you may now perhaps never see i will briefly mention the contents to you in these papers then are included an account of mrs jewkess arts to draw me in to approve of mr williamss proposal for marriage and my refusing to do so and desiring you not to encourage his suit to me mr williamss being wickedly robbed and a visit of hers to him whereby she discovered all his secrets how i was inclined to get off while she was gone but was ridiculously prevented by my foolish fears etc my having the key of the backdoor mrs jewkess writing to my master all the secrets she had discovered of mr williams and her behaviour to me and him upon it continuance of my correspondence with mr williams by the tiles begun in the parcel you had my reproaches to him for his revealing himself to mrs jewkes and his letter to me in answer threatening to expose my master if he deceived him mentioning in it john arnolds correspondence with him and a letter which john sent and was intercepted as it seems of the correspondence being carried on by a friend of his at gainsborough of the horse he was to provide for me and one for himself of what mr williams had owned to mrs jewkes and of my discouraging his proposals then it contained a pressing letter of mine to him urging my escape before my master came with his halfangry answer to me your good letter to me my dear father sent to me by mr williamss conveyance in which you would have me encourage mr williams but leave it to me and in which fortunately enough you take notice of my being uninclined to marry my earnest desire to be with you the substance of my answer to mr williams expressing more patience etc a dreadful letter of my master to mrs jewkes which by mistake was directed to me and one to me directed by like mistake to her and very free reflections of mine upon both the concern i expressed for mr williamss being taken in deceived and ruined an account of mrs jewkess glorying in her wicked fidelity a sad description i gave of monsieur colbrand a person he sent down to assist mrs jewkes in watching me how mr williams was arrested and thrown into gaol and the concern i expressed upon it and my free reflections on my master for it a projected contrivance of mine to get away out of the window and by the backdoor and throwing by petticoat and handkerchief into the pond to amuse them while i got off an attempt that had like to have ended very dreadfully for me my further concern for mr williamss ruin on my account and lastly my overhearing mrs jewkes brag of her contrivance to rob mr williams in order to get at my papers which however he preserved and sent safe to you these down to the execution of my unfortunate plot to escape are to the best of my remembrance the contents of the papers which this merciless woman seized for how badly i came off and what followed i still have safe as i hope sewed in my undercoat about my hips in vain were all my prayers and tears to her to get her not to shew them to my master for she said it had now come out why i affected to be so much alone and why i was always writing and she thought herself happy she said she had found these for often and often had she searched every place she could think of for writings to no purpose before and she hoped she said there was nothing in them by what any body might see for said she you know you are all innocence insolent creature said i i am sure you are all guilt and so you must do your worst for now i cant help myself and i see there is no mercy to be expected from you just now my master being come up she went to him upon the stairs and gave him my papers there sir said she you always said mrs pamela was a great writer but i never could get at any thing of hers before he took them and without coming to me went down to the parlour again and what with the gipsy affair and what with this i could not think of going down to dinner and she told him that too and so i suppose i shall have him up stairs as soon as his company is gone saturday six oclock my master came up and in a pleasanter manner than i expected said so pamela we have seized it seems your treasonable papers treasonable said i very sullenly ay said he i suppose so for you are a great plotter but i have not read them yet then sir said i very gravely it will be truly honourable in you not to read them but to give them to me again to whom says he are they written to my father sir but i suppose you see to whom indeed returned he i have not read three lines yet then pray sir dont read them but give them to me again that i will not said he till i have read them sir said i you served me not well in the letters i used to write formerly i think it was not worthy your character to contrive to get them in your hands by that false john arnold for should such a gentleman as you mind what your poor servant writes yes said he by all means mind what such a servant as my pamela writes your pamela thought i then the sham marriage came into my head and indeed it has not been out of it since the gipsy affair but said he have you any thing in these papers you would not have me see to be sure sir said i there is for what one writes to ones father and mother is not for every body to see nor said he am i every body those letters added he that i did see by johns means were not to your disadvantage ill assure you for they gave me a very high opinion of your wit and innocence and if i had not loved you do you think i would have troubled myself about your letters alas sir said i great pride to me that for they gave you such an opinion of my innocence that you was resolved to ruin me and what advantage have they brought me who have been made a prisoner and used as i have been between you and your housekeeper why pamela said he a little seriously why this behaviour for my goodness to you in the garden this is not of a piece with your conduct and softness there that quite charmed me in your favour and you must not give me cause to think that you will be the more insolent as you find me kinder ah sir said i you know best your own heart and designs but i fear i was too openhearted then and that you still keep your resolution to undo me and have only changed the form of your proceedings when i tell you once again said he a little sternly that you cannot oblige me more than by placing some confidence in me i will let you know that these foolish and perverse doubts are the worst things you can be guilty of but said he i shall possibly account for the cause of them in these papers of yours for i doubt not you have been sincere to your father and mother though you begin to make me suspect you for i tell you perverse girl that it is impossible you should be thus cold and insensible after what has passed in the garden if you were not prepossessed in some other persons favour and let me add that if i find it so it shall be attended with such effects as will make every vein in your heart bleed he was going away in wrath and i said one word good sir one word before you read them since you will read them pray make allowances for all the harsh reflections that you will find in them on your own conduct to me and remember only that they were not written for your sight and were penned by a poor creature hardly used and who was in constant apprehension of receiving from you the worst treatment that you could inflict upon her if that be all said he and there be nothing of another nature that i cannot forgive you have no cause for uneasiness for i had as many instances of your saucy reflections upon me in your former letters as there were lines and yet you see i have never upbraided you on that score though perhaps i wished you had been more sparing of your epithets and your freedoms of that sort well sir said i since you will you must read them and i think i have no reason to be afraid of being found insincere or having in any respect told you a falsehood because though i dont remember all i wrote yet i know i wrote my heart and that is not deceitful and remember sir another thing that i always declared i thought myself right to endeavour to make my escape from this forced and illegal restraint and so you must not be angry that i would have done so if i could ill judge you never fear said he as favourably as you deserve for you have too powerful a pleader within me and so went down stairs about nine oclock he sent for me down into the parlour i went a little fearfully and he held the paper in his hand and said now pamela you come upon your trial said i i hope i have a just judge to hear my cause ay said he and you may hope for a merciful one too or else i know not what will become of you i expect continued he that you will answer me directly and plainly to every question i shall ask you in the first place here are several loveletters between you and williams loveletters sir said i well call them what you will said he i dont entirely like them ill assure you with all the allowances you desired me to make for you do you find sir said i that i encouraged his proposal or do you not why said he you discourage his address in appearance but no otherwise than all your cunning sex do to ours to make us more eager in pursuing you well sir said i that is your comment but it does not appear so in the text smartly said says he where a d l gottest thou at these years all this knowledge and then thou hast a memory as i see by your papers that nothing escapes alas sir said i what poor abilities i have serve only to make me more miserable i have no pleasure in my memory which impresses things upon me that i could be glad never were or everlastingly to forget well said he so much for that but where are the accounts since you have kept so exact a journal of all that has befallen you previous to these here in my hand my father has them sir said i by whose means said he by mr williamss said i well answered said he but cannot you contrive to get me a sight of them that would be pretty said i i wish i could have contrived to have kept those you have from your sight said he i must see them pamela or i shall never be easy for i must know how this correspondence between you and williams began and if i can see them it shall be better for you if they answer what these give me hope they will i can tell you sir very faithfully said i what the beginning was for i was bold enough to be the beginner that wont do said he for though this may appear a punctilio to you to me it is of high importance sir said i if you please to let me go to my father i will send them to you by any messenger you shall send for them will you so but i dare say if you will write for them they will send them to you without the trouble of such a journey to yourself and i beg you will i think sir said i as you have seen all my former letters through johns baseness and now these through your faithful housekeepers officious watchfulness you might see all the rest but i hope you will not desire it till i can see how much my pleasing you in this particular will be of use to myself you must trust to my honour for that but tell me pamela said the sly gentleman since i have seen these would you have voluntarily shewn me those had they been in your possession i was not aware of this inference and said yes truly sir i think i should if you commanded it well then pamela said he as i am sure you have found means to continue your journal i desire till the former part can come that you will shew me the succeeding o sir sir said i have you caught me so but indeed you must excuse me there why said he tell me truly have you not continued your account till now dont ask me sir said i but i insist upon your answer replied he why then sir i will not tell an untruth i have thats my good girl said he i love sincerity at my heart in another sir said i i presume you mean well said he ill allow you to be a little witty upon me because it is in you and you cannot help it but you will greatly oblige me to shew me voluntarily what you have written i long to see the particulars of your plot and your disappointment where your papers leave off for you have so beautiful a manner that it is partly that and partly my love for you that has made me desirous of reading all you write though a great deal of it is against myself for which you must expect to suffer a little and as i have furnished you with the subject i have a title to see the fruits of your pen besides said he there is such a pretty air of romance as you relate them in your plots and my plots that i shall be better directed in what manner to wind up the catastrophe of the pretty novel if i was your equal sir said i i should say this is a very provoking way of jeering at the misfortunes you have brought upon me o said he the liberties you have taken with my character in your letters sets us upon a par at least in that respect sir i could not have taken those liberties if you had not given me the cause and the cause sir you know is before the effect true pamela said he you chop logic very prettily what the deuse do we men go to school for if our wits were equal to womens we might spare much time and pains in our education for nature teaches your sex what in a long course of labour and study ours can hardly attain to but indeed every lady is not a pamela you delight to banter your poor servant said i nay continued he i believe i must assume to myself half the merit of your wit too for the innocent exercises you have had for it from me have certainly sharpened your invention sir said i could i have been without those innocent exercises as you are pleased to call them i should have been glad to have been as dull as a beetle but then pamela said he i should not have loved you so well but then sir i should have been safe easy and happy ay may be so and may be not and the wife too of some clouterly ploughboy but then sir i should have been content and innocent and thats better than being a princess and not so and may be not said he for if you had had that pretty face some of us keen foxhunters should have found you out and in spite of your romantic notions which then too perhaps would not have had so strong a place in your mind might have been more happy with the ploughmans wife than i have been with my mothers pamela i hope sir said i god would have given me more grace well but resumed he as to these writings of yours that follow your fine plot i must see them indeed sir you must not if i can help it nothing said he pleases me better than that in all your arts shifts and stratagems you have had a great regard to truth and have in all your little pieces of deceit told very few wilful fibs now i expect youll continue this laudable rule in your conversation with me let me know then where you have found supplies of pen ink and paper when mrs jewkes was so vigilant and gave you but two sheets at a time tell me truth why sir little did i think i should have such occasion for them but when i went away from your house i begged some of each of good mr longman who gave me plenty yes yes said he it must be good mr longman all your confederates are good every one of them but such of my servants as have done their duty and obeyed my orders are painted out by you as black as devils nay so am i too for that matter sir said i i hope you wont be angry but saving yourself do you think they are painted worse than they deserve or worse than the parts they acted require you say saving myself pamela but is not that saying a mere compliment to me because i am present and you are in my hands tell me truly good sir excuse me but i fancy i might ask you why you should think so if there was not a little bit of conscience that told you there was but too much reason for it he kissed me and said i must either do thus or be angry with you for you are very saucy pamela but with your bewitching chitchat and pretty impertinence i will not lose my question where did you hide your paper pens and ink some sir in one place some in another that i might have some left if others should be found thats a good girl said he i love you for your sweet veracity now tell me where it is you hide your written papers your saucy journal i must beg your excuse for that sir said i but indeed answered he you will not have it for i will know and i will see them this is very hard sir said i but i must say you shall not if i can help it we were standing most of this time but he then sat down and took me by both my hands and said well said my pretty pamela if you can help it but i will not let you help it tell me are they in your pocket no sir said i my heart up at my mouth said he i know you wont tell a downright fib for the world but for equivocation no jesuit ever went beyond you answer me then are they in neither of your pockets no sir said i are they not said he about your stays no sir replied i but pray no more questions for ask me ever so much i will not tell you o said he i have a way for that i can do as they do abroad when the criminals wont confess torture them till they do but pray sir said i is this fair just or honest i am no criminal and i wont confess o my girl said he many an innocent person has been put to the torture but let me know where they are and you shall escape the question as they call it abroad sir said i the torture is not used in england and i hope you wont bring it up admirably said said the naughty gentleman but i can tell you of as good a punishment if a criminal wont plead with us here in england we press him to death or till he does plead and so now pamela that is a punishment shall certainly be yours if you wont tell without tears stood in my eyes and i said this sir is very cruel and barbarous no matter said he it is but like your lucifer you know in my shape and after i have done so many heinous things by you as you think you have no great reason to judge so hardly of this or at least it is but of a piece with the rest but sir said i dreadfully afraid he had some notion they were about me if you will be obeyed in this unreasonable manner though it is sad tyranny to be sure let me go up to them and read them over again and you shall see so far as to the end of the sad story that follows those you have ill see them all said he down to this time if you have written so far or at least till within this week then let me go up to them said i and see what i have written and to what day to shew them to you for you wont desire to see every thing but i will replied he but say pamela tell me truth are they above i was much affrighted he saw my confusion tell me truth said he why sir answered i i have sometimes hid them under the dry mould in the garden sometimes in one place sometimes in another and those you have in your hand were several days under a rosebush in the garden artful slut said he whats this to my question are they not about you if said i i must pluck them out of my hidingplace behind the wainscot wont you see me still more and more artful said he is this an answer to my question i have searched every place above and in your closet for them and cannot find them so i will know where they are now said he it is my opinion they are about you and i never undressed a girl in my life but i will now begin to strip my pretty pamela and i hope i shall not go far before i find them i fell a crying and said i will not be used in this manner pray sir said i for he began to unpin my handkerchief consider pray sir do and pray said he do you consider for i will see these papers but may be said he they are tied about your knees with your garters and stooped was ever any thing so vile and so wicked i fell on my knees and said what can i do what can i do if youll let me go up ill fetch them to you will you said he on your honour let me see them uncurtailed and not offer to make them away no not a single paper i will sir on your honour yes sir and so he let me go up stairs crying sadly for vexation to be so used sure nobody was ever so served as i am i went to my closet and there i sat me down and could not bear the thoughts of giving up my papers besides i must all undress me in a manner to untack them so i writ thus sir to expostulate with such an arbitrary gentleman i know will signify nothing and most hardly do you use the power you so wickedly have got over me i have heart enough sir to do a deed that would make you regret using me thus and i can hardly bear it and what i am further to undergo but a superior consideration withholds me thank god it does i will however keep my word if you insist upon it when you have read this but sir let me beg of you to give me time till tomorrow morning that i may just run them over and see what i put into your hands against me and i will then give my papers to you without the least alteration or adding or diminishing but i should beg still to be excused if you please but if not spare them to me but till tomorrow morning and this so hardly am i used shall be thought a favour which i shall be very thankful for i guessed it would not be long before i heard from him and he accordingly sent up mrs jewkes for what i had promised so i gave her this note to carry to him and he sent word that i must keep my promise and he would give me till morning but that i must bring them to him without his asking again so i took off my undercoat and with great trouble of mind unsewed them from it and there is a vast quantity of it i will just slightly touch upon the subjects because i may not perhaps get them again for you to see they begin with an account of my attempting to get away out of the window first and then throwing my petticoat and handkerchief into the pond how sadly i was disappointed the lock of the backdoor being changed how in trying to climb over the door i tumbled down and was piteously bruised the bricks giving way and tumbling upon me how finding i could not get off and dreading the hard usage i should receive i was so wicked as to think of throwing myself into the water my sad reflections upon this matter how mrs jewkes used me upon this occasion when she found me how my master had like to have been drowned in hunting and my concern for his danger notwithstanding his usage of me mrs jewkess wicked reports to frighten me that i was to be married to the ugly swiss who was to sell me on the weddingday to my master her vile way of talking to me like a london prostitute my apprehensions of seeing preparations made for my masters coming her causeless fears that i was trying to get away again when i had no thoughts of it and my bad usage upon it my masters dreadful arrival and his hard very hard treatment of me and mrs jewkess insulting of me his jealousy of mr williams and me how mrs jewkes vilely instigated him to wickedness and down to here i put into one parcel hoping that would content him but for fear it should not i put into another parcel the following viz a copy of his proposals to me of a great parcel of gold and fine clothes and rings and an estate of i cant tell what a year and l a year for the life of both you my dear parents to be his mistress with an insinuation that may be he would marry me at the years end all sadly vile with threatenings if i did not comply that he would ruin me without allowing me any thing a copy of my answer refusing all with just abhorrence but begging at last his goodness towards me and mercy on me in the most moving manner i could think of an account of his angry behaviour and mrs jewkess wicked advice hereupon his trying to get me to his chamber and my refusal to go a deal of stuff and chitchat between me and the odious mrs jewkes in which she was very wicked and very insulting two notes i wrote as if to be carried to church to pray for his reclaiming and my safety which mrs jewkes seized and officiously shewed him a confession of mine that notwithstanding his bad usage i could not hate him my concern for mr williams a horrid contrivance of my masters to ruin me being in my room disguised in clothes of the maids who lay with me and mrs jewkes how narrowly i escaped it makes my heart ache to think of it still by falling into fits mrs jewkess detestable part in this sad affair how he seemed moved at my danger and forbore his abominable designs and assured me he had offered no indecency how ill i was for a day or two after and how kind he seemed how he made me forgive mrs jewkes how after this and great kindness pretended he made rude offers to me in the garden which i escaped how i resented them then i had written how kindly he behaved himself to me and how he praised me and gave me great hopes of his being good at last of the too tender impression this made upon me and how i began to be afraid of my own weakness and consideration for him though he had used me so ill how sadly jealous he was of mr williams and how i as justly could cleared myself as to his doubts on that score how just when he had raised me up to the highest hope of his goodness he dashed me sadly again and went off more coldly my free reflections upon this trying occasion this brought down matters from thursday the th day of my imprisonment to wednesday the st and here i was resolved to end let what would come for only thursday friday and saturday remain to give an account of and thursday he set out to a ball at stamford and friday was the gipsy story and this is saturday his return from stamford and truly i shall have but little heart to write if he is to see all so these two parcels of papers i have got ready for him against tomorrow morning to be sure i have always used him very freely in my writings and shewed him no mercy but yet he must thank himself for it for i have only writ truth and i wish he had deserved a better character at my hands as well for his own sake as mine so though i dont know whether ever youll see what i write i must say that i will go to bed with remembering you in my prayers as i always do and as i know you do me and so my dear parents good night sunday morning i remembered what he said of not being obliged to ask again for my papers and what i should be forced to do and could not help i thought i might as well do in such a manner as might shew i would not disoblige on purpose though i stomached this matter very heavily too i had therefore got in readiness my two parcels and he not going to church in the morning bid mrs jewkes tell me he was gone into the garden i knew that was for me to go to him and so i went for how can i help being at his beck which grieves me not a little though he is my master as i may say for i am so wholly in his power that it would do me no good to incense him and if i refused to obey him in little matters my refusal in greater would have the less weight so i went down to the garden but as he walked in one walk i took another that i might not seem too forward neither he soon spied me and said do you expect to be courted to come to me sir said i and crossed the walk to attend him i did not know but i should interrupt you in your meditations this good day was that the case said he truly and from your heart why sir said i i dont doubt but you have very good thoughts sometimes though not towards me i wish said he i could avoid thinking so well of you as i do but where are the papers i dare say you had them about you yesterday for you say in those i have that you will bury your writings in the garden for fear you should be searched if you did not escape this added he gave me a glorious pretence to search you and i have been vexing myself all night that i did not strip you garment by garment till i had found them o fie sir said i let me not be scared with hearing that you had such a thought in earnest well said he i hope you have not now the papers to give me for i had rather find them myself ill assure you i did not like this way of talk at all and thinking it best not to dwell upon it said well but sir you will excuse me i hope giving up my papers dont trifle with me said he where are they i think i was very good to you last night to humour you as i did if you have either added or diminished and have not strictly kept your promise woe be to you indeed sir said i i have neither added nor diminished but there is the parcel that goes on with my sad attempt to escape and the terrible consequences it had like to have been followed with and it goes down to the naughty articles you sent me and as you know all that has happened since i hope these will satisfy you he was going to speak but i said to drive him from thinking of any more and i must beg you sir to read the matter favourably if i have exceeded in any liberties of my pen i think said he halfsmiling you may wonder at my patience that i can be so easy to read myself abused as i am by such a saucy slut sir said i i have wondered you should be so desirous to see my bold stuff and for that very reason i have thought it a very good or a very bad sign what said he is your good sign that it may have an effect upon your temper at last in my favour when you see me so sincere your bad sign why that if you can read my reflections and observations upon your treatment of me with tranquillity and not be moved it is a sign of a very cruel and determined heart now pray sir dont be angry at my boldness in telling you so freely my thoughts you may perhaps said he be least mistaken when you think of your bad sign god forbid said i so i took out my papers and said here sir they are but if you please to return them without breaking the seal it will be very generous and i will take it for a great favour and a good omen he broke the seal instantly and opened them so much for your omen replied he i am sorry for it said i very seriously and was walking away whither now said he i was going in sir that you might have time to read them if you thought fit he put them into his pocket and said you have more than these yes sir but all they contain you know as well as i but i dont know said he the light you put things in and so give them me if you have not a mind to be searched sir said i i cant stay if you wont forbear that ugly world give me then no reason for it where are the other papers why then unkind sir if it must be so here they are and so i gave him out of my pocket the second parcel sealed up as the former with this superscription from the naughty articles down through sad attempts to thursday the d day of my imprisonment this is last thursday is it yes sir but now you will see what i write i will find some other way to employ my time for how can i write with any face what must be for your perusal and not for those i intended to read my melancholy stories yes said he i would have you continue your penmanship by all means and i assure you in the mind i am in i will not ask you for any after these except any thing very extraordinary occurs and i have another thing to tell you added he that if you send for those from your father and let me read them i may very probably give them all back again to you and so i desire you will do it this a little encourages me to continue my scribbling but for fear of the worst i will when they come to any bulk contrive some way to hide them if i can that i may protest i have them not about me which before i could not say of a truth and that made him so resolutely bent to try to find them upon me for which i might have suffered frightful indecencies he led me then to the side of the pond and sitting down on the slope made me sit by him come said he this being the scene of part of your project and where you so artfully threw in some of your clothes i will just look upon that part of your relation sir said i let me then walk about at a little distance for i cannot bear the thought of it dont go far said he when he came as i suppose to the place where i mentioned the bricks falling upon me he got up and walked to the door and looked upon the broken part of the wall for it had not been mended and came back reading on to himself towards me and took my hand and put it under his arm why this said he my girl is a very moving tale it was a very desperate attempt and had you got out you might have been in great danger for you had a very bad and lonely way and i had taken such measures that let you have been where you would i should have had you you may see sir said i what i ventured rather than be ruined and you will be so good as hence to judge of the sincerity of my profession that my honesty is dearer to me than my life romantic girl said he and read on he was very serious at my reflections on what god had enabled me to escape and when he came to my reasonings about throwing myself into the water he said walk gently before and seemed so moved that he turned away his face from me and i blessed this good sign and began not so much to repent at his seeing this mournful part of my story he put the papers in his pocket when he had read my reflections and thanks for escaping from myself and said taking me about the waist o my dear girl you have touched me sensibly with your mournful relation and your sweet reflections upon it i should truly have been very miserable had it taken effect i see you have been used too roughly and it is a mercy you stood proof in that fatal moment then he most kindly folded me in his arms let us say i too my pamela walk from this accursed piece of water for i shall not with pleasure look upon it again to think how near it was to have been fatal to my fair one i thought added he of terrifying you to my will since i could not move you by love and mrs jewkes too well obeyed me when the terrors of your return after your disappointment were so great that you had hardly courage to withstand them but had like to have made so fatal a choice to escape the treatment you apprehended o sir said i i have reason i am sure to bless my dear parents and my good lady your mother for giving me something of a religious education for but for that and gods grace i should more than upon one occasion have attempted at least a desperate act and i the less wonder how poor creatures who have not the fear of god before their eyes and give way to despondency cast themselves into perdition come kiss me said he and tell me you forgive me for pushing you into so much danger and distress if my mind hold and i can see those former papers of yours and that these in my pocket give me no cause to altar my opinion i will endeavour to defy the world and the worlds censures and make my pamela amends if it be in the power of my whole life for all the hardships i have made her undergo all this looked well but you shall see how strangely it was all turned for this shammarriage then came into my mind again and i said your poor servant is far unworthy of this great honour for what will it be but to create envy to herself and discredit to you therefore sir permit me to return to my poor parents and that is all i have to ask he was in a fearful passion then and is it thus said he in my fond conceding moments that i am to be despised and answered precise perverse unseasonable pamela begone from my sight and know as well how to behave in a hopeful prospect as in a distressful state and then and not till then shalt thou attract the shadow of my notice i was startled and going to speak but he stamped with his foot and said begone i tell you i cannot bear this stupid romantic folly one word said i but one word i beseech you sir he turned from me in great wrath and took down another alley and so i went with a very heavy heart and fear i was too unseasonable just at a time when he was so condescending but if it was a piece of art of his side as i apprehended to introduce the shamwedding and to be sure he is very full of stratagem and art i think i was not so much to blame so i went up to my closet and wrote thus far while he walked about till dinner was ready and he is now sat down to it as i hear by mrs jewkes very sullen thoughtful and out of humour and she asks what i have done to him now again i dread to see him when will my fears be over three oclock well he continues exceeding wrath he has ordered his travelling chariot to be got ready with all speed what is to come next i wonder sure i did not say so much but see the lordliness of a high condition a poor body must not put in a word when they take it into their heads to be angry what a fine time a person of an equal condition would have of it if she were even to marry such a one his poor dear mother spoiled him at first nobody must speak to him or contradict him as i have heard when he was a child and so he has not been used to be controlled and cannot bear the least thing that crosses his violent will this is one of the blessings attending men of high condition much good may do them with their pride of birth and pride of fortune say i all that it serves for as far as i can see is to multiply their disquiets and every bodys else that has to do with them so so where will this end mrs jewkes has been with me from him and she says i must get out of the house this moment well said i but whither am i to be carried next why home said she to your father and mother and can it be said i no no i doubt i shall not be so happy as that to be sure some bad design is on foot again to be sure it is sure sure said i mrs jewkes he has not found out some other housekeeper worse than you she was very angry you may well think but i know she cant be made worse than she is she came up again are you ready said she bless me said i you are very hasty i have heard of this not a quarter of an hour ago but i shall be soon ready for i have but little to take with me and no kind friends in this house to take leave of to delay me yet like a fool i cant help crying pray said i just step down and ask if i may not have my papers so i am quite ready now against she comes up with an answer and so i will put up these few writings in my bosom that i have left i dont know what to think nor how to judge but i shall never believe i am with you till i am on my knees before you begging both your blessings yet i am sorry he is so angry with me i thought i did not say so much there is i see the chariot drawn out the horses too the grim colbrand going to get on horseback what will be the end of all this monday well where this will end i cannot say but here i am at a little poor village almost such a one as yours i shall learn the name of it by and by and robin assures me he has orders to carry me to you my dear father and mother o that he may say truth and not deceive me again but having nothing else to do and i am sure i shall not sleep a wink to night if i was to go to bed i will write my time away and take up my story where i left off on sunday afternoon mrs jewkes came up to me with this answer about my papers my master says he will not read them yet lest he should be moved by any thing in them to alter his resolution but if he should think it worth while to read them he will send them to you afterwards to your fathers but said she here are your guineas that i borrowed for all is over now with you i find she saw me cry and said do you repent of what said i nay i cant tell replied she but to be sure he has had a taste of your satirical flings or he would not be so angry o continued she and held up her hand thou hast a spirit but i hope it will now be brought down i hope so too said i well added i i am ready she lifted up the window and said ill call robin to take your portmanteau bag and baggage proceeded she im glad youre going i have no words said i to throw away upon you mrs jewkes but making her a very low courtesy i most heartily thank you for all your virtuous civilities to me and so adieu for ill have no portmanteau ill assure you nor any thing but these few things that i brought with me in my handkerchief besides what i have on for i had all this time worn my own bought clothes though my master would have had it otherwise often but i had put up paper ink and pens however so down i went and as i passed by the parlour she stepped in and said sir you have nothing to say to the girl before she goes i heard him reply though i did not see him who bid you say the girl mrs jewkes in that manner she has offended only me i beg your honours pardon said the wretch but if i was your honour she should not for all the trouble she has cost you go away scotfree no more of this as i told you before said he what when i have such proof that her virtue is all her pride shall i rob her of that no added he let her go perverse and foolish as she is but she deserves to go honest and she shall go so i was so transported with this unexpected goodness that i opened the door before i knew what i did and said falling on my knees at the door with my hands folded and lifted up o thank you thank your honour a million of times may god bless you for this instance of your goodness to me i will pray for you as long as i live and so shall my dear father and mother and mrs jewkes said i i will pray for you too poor wicked wretch that you are he turned from me and went into his closet and shut the door he need not have done so for i would not have gone nearer to him surely i did not say so much to incur all this displeasure i think i was loath to leave the house can you believe it what could be the matter with me i wonder i felt something so strange and my heart was so lumpish i wonder what ailed me but this was so unexpected i believe that was all yet i am very strange still surely surely i cannot be like the old murmuring israelites to long after the onions and garlick of egypt when they had suffered there such heavy bondage ill take thee o lumpish contradictory ungovernable heart to severe task for this thy strange impulse when i get to my dear fathers and mothers and if i find any thing in thee that should not be depend upon it thou shalt be humbled if strict abstinence prayer and mortification will do it but yet after all this last goodness of his has touched me too sensibly i wish i had not heard it almost and yet methinks i am glad i did for i should rejoice to think the best of him for his own sake well and so i went out to the chariot the same that brought me down so mr robert said i here i am again a poor sportingpiece for the great a mere tennisball of fortune you have your orders i hope yes madam said he pray now said i dont madam me nor stand with your hat off to such a one as i had not my master said he ordered me not to be wanting in respect to you i would have shewn you all i could well said i with my heart full thats very kind mr robert mr colbrand mounted on horseback with pistols before him came up to me as soon as i got in with his hat off too what monsieur said i are you to go with me part of the way he said to see you safe i hope thats kind too in you mr colbrand said i i had nobody to wave my handkerchief to now nor to take leave of and so i resigned myself to my contemplations with this strange wayward heart of mine that i never found so ungovernable and awkward before so away drove the chariot and when i had got out of the elmwalk and into the great road i could hardly think but i was in a dream all the time a few hours before in my masters arms almost with twenty kind things said to me and a generous concern for the misfortunes he had brought upon me and only by one rash halfword exasperated against me and turned out of doors at an hours warning and all his kindness changed to hate and i now from three oclock to five several miles off but if i am going to you all will be well again i hope lackaday what strange creatures are men gentlemen i should say rather for my dear deserving good mother though poverty be both your lots has had better hap and you are and have always been blest in one another yet this pleases me too he was so good he would not let mrs jewkes speak ill of me and scorned to take her odious unwomanly advice o what a black heart has this poor wretch so i need not rail against men so much for my master bad as i have thought him is not half so bad as this woman to be sure she must be an atheist do you think she is not we could not reach further than this little poor place and sad alehouse rather than inn for it began to be dark and robin did not make so much haste as he might have done and he was forced to make hard shift for his horses mr colbrand and robert too are very civil i see he has got my portmanteau lashed behind the coach i did not desire it but i shall not come quite empty a thorough riddance of me i see bag and baggage as mrs jewkes says well my story surely would furnish out a surprising kind of novel if it was to be well told mr robert came up to me just now and begged me to eat something i thanked him but said i could not eat i bid him ask mr colbrand to walk up and he came but neither of them would sit nor put their hats on what mockado is this to such a poor soul as i i asked them if they were at liberty to tell me the truth of what they were to do with me if not i would not desire it they both said robin was ordered to carry me to my fathers and mr colbrand was to leave me within ten miles and then strike off for the other house and wait till my master arrived there they both spoke so solemnly that i could not but believe them but when robin went down the other said he had a letter to give me next day at noon when we baited as we were to do at mrs jewkess relations may i not said i beg the favour to see it tonight he seemed so loath to deny me that i have hopes i shall prevail on him by and by well my dear father and mother i have got the letter on great promises of secrecy and making no use of it i will try if i can open it without breaking the seal and will take a copy of it by and by for robin is in and out there being hardly any room in this little house for one to be long alone well this is the letter when these lines are delivered to you you will be far on your way to your father and mother where you have so long desired to be and i hope i shall forbear thinking of you with the least shadow of that fondness my foolish heart had entertained for you i bear you however no ill will but the end of my detaining you being over i would not that you should tarry with me an hour more than needed after the ungenerous preference you gave at a time that i was inclined to pass over all other considerations for an honourable address to you for well i found the tables entirely turned upon me and that i was in far more danger from you than you were from me for i was just upon resolving to defy all the censures of the world and to make you my wife i will acknowledge another truth that had i not parted with you as i did but permitted you to stay till i had read your journal reflecting as i doubt not i shall find it and till i had heard your bewitching pleas in your own behalf i feared i could not trust myself with my own resolution and this is the reason i frankly own that i have determined not to see you nor hear you speak for well i know my weakness in your favour but i will get the better of this fond folly nay i hope i have already done it since it was likely to cost me so dear and i write this to tell you that i wish you well with all my heart though you have spread such mischief through my family and yet i cannot but say that i could wish you would not think of marrying in haste and particularly that you would not have this cursed williams but what is all this to me now only my weakness makes me say that as i had already looked upon you as mine and you have so soon got rid of your first husband so you will not refuse to my memory the decency that every common person observes to pay a twelvemonths compliment though but a mere compliment to my ashes your papers shall be faithfully returned you and i have paid so dear for my curiosity in the affection they have rivetted upon me for you that you would look upon yourself amply revenged if you knew what they have cost me i thought of writing only a few lines but i have run into length i will now try to recollect my scattered thoughts and resume my reason and shall find trouble enough to replace my affairs and my own family and to supply the chasms you have made in it for let me tell you though i can forgive you i never can my sister nor my domestics for my vengeance must be wreaked somewhere i doubt not your prudence in forbearing to expose me any more than is necessary for your own justification and for that i will suffer myself to be accused by you and will also accuse myself if it be needful for i am and will ever be your affectionate wellwisher this letter when i expected some new plot has affected me more than any thing of that sort could have done for here is plainly his great value for me confessed and his rigorous behaviour accounted for in such a manner as tortures me much and all this wicked gipsy story is as it seems a forgery upon us both and has quite ruined me for o my dear parents forgive me but i found to my grief before that my heart was too partial in his favour but now with so much openness so much affection nay so much honour too which was all i had before doubted and kept me on the reserve i am quite overcome this was a happiness however i had no reason to expect but to be sure i must own to you that i shall never be able to think of any body in the world but him presumption you will say and so it is but love is not a voluntary thing love did i say but come i hope not at least it is not i hope gone so far as to make me very uneasy for i know not how it came nor when it began but crept crept it has like a thief upon me and before i knew what was the matter it looked like love i wish since it is too late and my lot determined that i had not had this letter nor heard him take my part to that vile woman for then i should have blessed myself in having escaped so happily his designing arts upon my virtue but now my poor mind is all topsyturvied and i have made an escape to be more a prisoner but i hope since thus it is that all will be for the best and i shall with your prudent advice and pious prayers be able to overcome this weakness but to be sure my dear sir i will keep a longer time than a twelvemonth as a true widow for a compliment and more than a compliment to your ashes o the dear word how kind how moving how affectionate is the word o why was i not a duchess to shew my gratitude for it but must labour under the weight of an obligation even had this happiness befallen me that would have pressed me to death and which i never could return by a whole life of faithful love and cheerful obedience o forgive your poor daughter i am sorry to find this trial so sore upon me and that all the weakness of my weak sex and tender years who never before knew what it was to be so touched is come upon me and too mighty to be withstood by me but time prayer and resignation to gods will and the benefits of your good lessons and examples i hope will enable me to get over this so heavy a trial o my treacherous treacherous heart to serve me thus and give no notice to me of the mischiefs thou wast about to bring upon me but thus foolishly to give thyself up to the proud invader without ever consulting thy poor mistress in the least but thy punishment will be the first and the greatest and well deservest thou to smart o perfidious traitor for giving up so weakly thy whole self before a summons came and to one too who had used me so hardly and when likewise thou hadst so well maintained thy post against the most violent and avowed and therefore as i thought more dangerous attacks after all i must either not shew you this my weakness or tear it out of my writing memorandum to consider of this when i get home monday morning eleven oclock we are just come in here to the inn kept by mrs jewkess relation the first compliment i had was in a very impudent manner how i liked the squire i could not help saying bold forward woman is it for you who keep an inn to treat passengers at this rate she was but in jest she said and asked pardon and she came and begged excuse again very submissively after robin and mr colbrand had talked to her a little the latter here in great form gave me before robin the letter which i had given him back for that purpose and i retired as if to read it and so i did for i think i cant read it too often though for my peace of minds sake i might better try to forget it i am sorry methinks i cannot bring you back a sound heart but indeed it is an honest one as to any body but me for it has deceived nobody else wicked thing that it is more and more surprising things still just as i had sat down to try to eat a bit of victuals to get ready to pursue my journey came in mr colbrand in a mighty hurry o madam madam said he here be de groom from de squire b all over in a lather man and horse o how my heart went pitapat what now thought i is to come next he went out and presently returned with a letter for me and another enclosed for mr colbrand this seemed odd and put me all in a trembling so i shut the door and never sure was the like known found the following agreeable contents in vain my pamela do i find it to struggle against my affection for you i must needs after you were gone venture to entertain myself with your journal when i found mrs jewkess bad usage of you after your dreadful temptations and hurts and particularly your generous concern for me on hearing how narrowly i escaped drowning though my death would have been your freedom and i had made it your interest to wish it and your most agreeable confession in another place that notwithstanding all my hard usage of you you could not hate me and that expressed in so sweet so soft and so innocent a manner that i flatter myself you may be brought to love me together with the other parts of your admirable journal i began to repent my parting with you but god is my witness for no unlawful end as you would call it but the very contrary and the rather as all this was improved in your favour by your behaviour at leaving my house for oh that melodious voice praying for me at your departure and thanking me for my rebuke to mrs jewkes still hangs upon my ears and delights my memory and though i went to bed i could not rest but about two got up and made thomas get one of the best horses ready in order to set out to overtake you while i sat down to write this to you now my dear pamela let me beg of you on the receipt of this to order robin to drive you back again to my house i would have set out myself for the pleasure of bearing you company back in the chariot but am really indisposed i believe with vexation that i should part thus with my souls delight as i now find you are and must be in spite of the pride of my own heart you cannot imagine the obligation your return will lay me under to your goodness and yet if you will not so far favour me you shall be under no restraint as you will see by my letter enclosed to colbrand which i have not sealed that you may read it but spare me my dearest girl the confusion of following you to your fathers which i must do if you persist to go on for i find i cannot live a day without you if you are the generous pamela i imagine you to be for hitherto you have been all goodness where it has not been merited let me see by this new instance the further excellence of your disposition let me see you can forgive the man who loves you more than himself let me see by it that you are not prepossessed in any other persons favour and one instance more i would beg and then i am all gratitude and that is that you would despatch monsieur colbrand with a letter to your father assuring him that all will end happily and to desire that he will send to you at my house the letters you found means by williamss conveyance to send him and when i have all my proud and perhaps punctilious doubts answered i shall have nothing to do but to make you happy and be so myself for i must be yours and only yours monday morn near three oclock o my exulting heart how it throbs in my bosom as if it would reproach me for so lately upbraiding it for giving way to the love of so dear a gentleman but take care thou art not too credulous neither o fond believer things that we wish are apt to gain a too ready credence with us this shammarriage is not yet cleared up mrs jewkes the vile mrs jewkes may yet instigate the mind of this master his pride of heart and pride of condition may again take place and a man that could in so little a space first love me then hate then banish me his house and send me away disgracefully and now send for me again in such affectionate terms may still waver may still deceive thee therefore will i not acquit thee yet o credulous fluttering throbbing mischief that art so ready to believe what thou wishest and i charge thee to keep better guard than thou hast lately done and lead me not to follow too implicitly thy flattering and desirable impulses thus foolishly dialogued i with my heart and yet all the time this heart is pamela i opened the letter to monsieur colbrand which was in these words monsieur i am sure youll excuse the trouble i give you i have for good reasons changed my mind and i have besought it as a favour that mrs andrews will return to me the moment tom reaches you i hope for the reasons i have given her she will have the goodness to oblige me but if not you are to order robin to pursue his directions and set her down at her fathers door if she will oblige me in her return perhaps shell give you a letter to her father for some papers to be delivered to you for her which youll be so good in that case to bring to her here but if she will not give you such a letter youll return with her to me if she please to favour me so far and that with all expedition that her health and safety will permit for i am pretty much indisposed but hope it will be but slight and soon go off i am yours etc on second thoughts let tom go forward with mrs andrewss letter if she pleases to give one and you return with her for her safety now this is a dear generous manner of treating me o how i love to be generously used now my dear parents i wish i could consult you for your opinions how i should act should i go back or should i not i doubt he has got too great hold in my heart for me to be easy presently if i should refuse and yet this gipsy information makes me fearful well i will i think trust in his generosity yet is it not too great a trust especially considering how i have been used but then that was while he avowed his bad designs and now he gives great hope of his good ones and i may be the means of making many happy as well as myself by placing a generous confidence in him and then i think he might have sent to colbrand or to robin to carry me back whether i would or not and how different is his behaviour to that and would it not look as if i was prepossessed as he calls it if i dont oblige him and as if it was a silly female piece of pride to make him follow me to my fathers and as if i would use him hardly in my turn for his having used me ill in his upon the whole i resolved to obey him and if he uses me ill afterwards double will be his ungenerous guilt though hard will be my lot to have my credulity so justly blamable as it will then seem for to be sure the world the wise world that never is wrong itself judges always by events and if he should use me ill then i shall be blamed for trusting him if well o then i did right to be sure but how would my censurers act in my case before the event justifies or condemns the action is the question then i have no notion of obliging by halves but of doing things with a grace as one may say where they are to be done and so i wrote the desired letter to you assuring you that i had before me happier prospects than ever i had and hoped all would end well and that i begged you would send me by the bearer mr thomas my masters groom those papers which i had sent you by mr williamss conveyance for that they imported me much for clearing up a point in my conduct that my master was desirous to know before he resolved to favour me as he had intended but you will have that letter before you can have this for i would not send you this without the preceding which now is in my masters hands and so having given the letter to mr thomas for him to carry to you when he had baited and rested after his great fatigue i sent for monsieur colbrand and robin and gave to the former his letter and when he had read it i said you see how things stand i am resolved to return to our master and as he is not so well as were to be wished the more haste you make the better and dont mind my fatigue but consider only yourselves and the horses robin who guessed the matter by his conversation with thomas as i suppose said god bless you madam and reward you as your obligingness to my good master deserves and may we all live to see you triumph over mrs jewkes i wondered to hear him say so for i was always careful of exposing my master or even that naughty woman before the common servants but yet i question whether robin would have said this if he had not guessed by thomass message and my resolving to return that i might stand well with his master so selfish are the hearts of poor mortals that they are ready to change as favour goes so they were not long getting ready and i am just setting out back again and i hope i shall have no reason to repent it robin put on very vehemently and when we came to the little town where we lay on sunday night he gave his horses a bait and said he would push for his masters that night as it would be moonlight if i should not be too much fatigued because there was no place between that and the town adjacent to his masters fit to put up at for the night but monsieur colbrands horse beginning to give way made a doubt between them wherefore i said hating to be on the road if it could be done i should bear it well enough i hoped and that monsieur colbrand might leave his horse when it failed at some house and come into the chariot this pleased them both and about twelve miles short he left the horse and took off his spurs and holsters etc and with abundance of ceremonial excuses came into the chariot and i sat the easier for it for my bones ached sadly with the jolting and so many miles travelling in so few hours as i have done from sunday night five oclock but for all this it was eleven oclock at night when we came to the village adjacent to my masters and the horses began to be very much tired and robin too but i said it would be pity to put up only three miles short of the house so about one we reached the gate but every body was abed but one of the helpers got the keys from mrs jewkes and opened the gates and the horses could hardly crawl into the stable and i when i went to get out of the chariot fell down and thought i had lost the use of my limbs mrs jewkes came down with her clothes huddled on and lifted up her hands and eyes at my return but shewed more care of the horses than of me by that time the two maids came and i made shift to creep in as well as i could it seems my poor master was very ill indeed and had been upon the bed most part of the day and abraham who succeeded john sat up with him and he was got into a fine sleep and heard not the coach come in nor the noise we made for his chamber lies towards the garden on the other side of the house mrs jewkes said he had a feverish complaint and had been blooded and very prudently ordered abraham when he awaked not to tell him i was come for fear of surprising him and augmenting his fever nor indeed to say any thing of me till she herself broke it to him in the morning as she should see how he was so i went to bed with mrs jewkes after she had caused me to drink almost half a pint of burnt wine made very rich and cordial with spices which i found very refreshing and set me into a sleep i little hoped for tuesday morning getting up pretty early i have written thus far while mrs jewkes lies snoring in bed fetching up her last nights disturbance i long for her rising to know how my poor master does tis well for her she can sleep so purely no love but for herself will ever break her rest i am sure i am deadly sore all over as if i had been soundly beaten i did not think i could have lived under such fatigue mrs jewkes as soon as she got up went to know how my master did and he had had a good night and having drank plentifully of sack whey had sweated much so that his fever had abated considerably she said to him that he must not be surprised and she would tell him news he asked what and she said i was come he raised himself up in his bed can it be said he what already she told him i came last night monsieur colbrand coming to inquire of his health he ordered him to draw near him and was highly pleased with the account he gave him of the journey my readiness to come back and my willingness to reach home that night and he said why these tender fair ones i think bear fatigue better than us men but she is very good to give me such an instance of her readiness to oblige me pray mrs jewkes said he take great care of her health and let her be abed all day she told him i had been up these two hours ask her said he if she will be so good as to make me a visit if she wont ill rise and go to her indeed sir said she you must be still and ill go to her but dont urge her too much said he if she be unwilling she came to me and told me all the above and i said i would most willingly wait upon him for indeed i longed to see him and was much grieved he was so ill so i went down with her will she come said he as i entered the room yes sir said we and she said at the first word most willingly sweet excellence said he as soon as he saw me he said o my beloved pamela you have made me quite well im concerned to return my acknowledgments to you in so unfit a place and manner but will you give me your hand i did and he kissed it with great eagerness sir said i you do me too much honour i am sorry you are so ill i cant be ill said he while you are with me i am very well already well said he and kissed my hand again you shall not repent this goodness my heart is too full of it to express myself as i ought but i am sorry you have had such a fatiguing time of it life is no life without you if you had refused me and yet i had hardly hopes you would oblige me i should have had a severe fit of it i believe for i was taken very oddly and knew not what to make of myself but now i shall be well instantly you need not mrs jewkes added he send for the doctor from stamford as we talked yesterday for this lovely creature is my doctor as her absence was my disease he begged me to sit down by his bedside and asked me if i had obliged him with sending for my former packet i said i had and hoped it would be brought he said it was doubly kind i would not stay long because of disturbing him and he got up in the afternoon and desired my company and seemed quite pleased easy and much better he said mrs jewkes after this instance of my good pamelas obligingness in her return i am sure we ought to leave her entirely at her own liberty and pray if she pleases to take a turn in our chariot or in the garden or to the town or wherever she will let her be left at liberty and asked no questions and do you do all in your power to oblige her she said she would to be sure he took my hand and said one thing i will tell you pamela because i know you will be glad to hear it and yet not care to ask me i had before you went taken williamss bond for the money for how the poor man had behaved i cant tell but he could get no bail and if i have no fresh reason given me perhaps i shall not exact the payment and he has been some time at liberty and now follows his school but methinks i could wish you would not see him at present sir said i i will not do any thing to disoblige you wilfully and i am glad he is at liberty because i was the occasion of his misfortunes i durst say no more though i wanted to plead for the poor gentleman which in gratitude i thought i ought when i could do him service i said i am sorry sir lady davers who loves you so well should have incurred your displeasure and that there should be any variance between your honour and her i hope it was not on my account he took out of his waistcoat pocket as he sat in his gown his lettercase and said here pamela read that when you go up stairs and let me have your thoughts upon it and that will let you into the affair he said he was very heavy of a sudden and would lie down and indulge for that day and if he was better in the morning would take an airing in the chariot and so i took my leave for the present and went up to my closet and read the letter he was pleased to put into my hands which is as follows brother i am very uneasy at what i hear of you and must write whether it please you or not my full mind i have had some people with me desiring me to interpose with you and they have a greater regard for your honour than i am sorry to say it you have yourself could i think that a brother of mine would so meanly run away with my late dear mothers waitingmaid and keep her a prisoner from all her friends and to the disgrace of your own but i thought when you would not let the wench come to me on my mothers death that you meant no good i blush for you ill assure you the girl was an innocent good girl but i suppose thats over with her now or soon will what can you mean by this let me ask you either you will have her for a kept mistress or for a wife if the former there are enough to be had without ruining a poor wench that my mother loved and who really was a very good girl and of this you may be ashamed as to the other i dare say you dont think of it but if you should you would be utterly inexcusable consider brother that ours is no upstart family but is as ancient as the best in the kingdom and for several hundreds of years it has never been known that the heirs of it have disgraced themselves by unequal matches and you know you have been sought to by some of the best families in the nation for your alliance it might be well enough if you were descended of a family of yesterday or but a remove or two from the dirt you seem so fond of but let me tell you that i and all mine will renounce you for ever if you can descend so meanly and i shall be ashamed to be called your sister a handsome man as you are in your person so happy in the gifts of your mind that every body courts your company and possessed of such a noble and clear estate and very rich in money besides left you by the best of fathers and mothers with such ancient blood in your veins untainted for you to throw away yourself thus is intolerable and it would be very wicked in you to ruin the wench too so that i beg you will restore her to her parents and give her l or so to make her happy in some honest fellow of her own degree and that will be doing something and will also oblige and pacify your much grieved sister if i have written too sharply consider it is my love to you and the shame you are bringing upon yourself and i wish this may have the effect upon you intended by your very loving sister this is a sad letter my dear father and mother and one may see how poor people are despised by the proud and the rich and yet we were all on a foot originally and many of these gentry that brag of their ancient blood would be glad to have it as wholesome and as really untainted as ours surely these proud people never think what a short stage life is and that with all their vanity a time is coming when they shall be obliged to submit to be on a level with us and true said the philosopher when he looked upon the skull of a king and that of a poor man that he saw no difference between them besides do they not know that the richest of princes and the poorest of beggars are to have one great and tremendous judge at the last day who will not distinguish between them according to their circumstances in life but on the contrary may make their condemnations the greater as their neglected opportunities were the greater poor souls how do i pity their pride o keep me heaven from their high condition if my mind shall ever be tainted with their vice or polluted with so cruel and inconsiderate a contempt of the humble estate which they behold with so much scorn but besides how do these gentry know that supposing they could trace back their ancestry for one two three or even five hundred years that then the original stems of these poor families though they have not kept such elaborate records of their goodfor nothingness as it often proves were not still deeper rooted and how can they be assured that one hundred years hence or two some of those now despised upstart families may not revel in their estates while their descendants may be reduced to the others dunghills and perhaps such is the vanity as well as changeableness of human estates in their turns set up for pride of family and despise the others these reflections occurred to my thoughts made serious by my masters indisposition and this proud letter of the lowly lady davers against the highminded pamela lowly i say because she could stoop to such vain pride and highminded i because i hope i am too proud ever to do the like but after all poor wretches that we be we scarce know what we are much less what we shall be but once more pray i to be kept from the sinful pride of a high estate on this occasion i recall the following lines which i have read where the poet argues in a much better manner wise providence does various parts for various minds dispense the meanest slaves or those who hedge and ditch are useful by their sweat to feed the rich the rich in due return impart their store which comfortably feeds the labring poor nor let the rich the lowest slave disdain hes equally a link of natures chain labours to the same end joins in one view and both alike the will divine pursue and at the last are levelld king and slave without distinction in the silent grave wednesday morning my master sent me a message just now that he was so much better that he would take a turn after breakfast in the chariot and would have me give him my company i hope i shall know how to be humble and comport myself as i should do under all these favours mrs jewkes is one of the most obliging creatures in the world and i have such respects shewn me by every one as if i was as great as lady davers but now if this should all end in the shammarriage it cannot be i hope yet the pride of greatness and ancestry and suchlike is so strongly set out in lady daverss letter that i cannot flatter myself to be so happy as all these desirable appearances make for me should i be now deceived i should be worse off than ever but i shall see what light this new honour will procure me so ill get ready but i wont i think change my garb should i do it it would look as if i would be nearer on a level with him and yet should i not it might be thought a disgrace to him but i will i think open the portmanteau and for the first time since i came hither put on my best silk nightgown but then that will be making myself a sort of right to the clothes i had renounced and i am not yet quite sure i shall have no other crosses to encounter so i will go as i am for though ordinary i am as clean as a penny though i say it so ill een go as i am except he orders otherwise yet mrs jewkes says i ought to dress as fine as i can but i say i think not as my master is up and at breakfast i will venture down to ask him how he will have me be well he is kinder and kinder and thank god purely recovered how charmingly he looks to what he did yesterday blessed be god for it he arose and came to me and took me by the hand and would set me down by him and he said my charming girl seemed going to speak what would you say sir said i a little ashamed i think it is too great an honour to go into the chariot with you no my dear pamela said he the pleasure of your company will be greater than the honour of mine and so say no more on that head but sir said i i shall disgrace you to go thus you would grace a prince my fairone said the good kind kind gentleman in that dress or any you shall choose and you look so pretty that if you shall not catch cold in that roundeared cap you shall go just as you are but sir said i then youll be pleased to go a byeway that it maynt be seen you do so much honor to your servant o my good girl said he i doubt you are afraid of yourself being talked of more than me for i hope by degrees to take off the worlds wonder and teach them to expect what is to follow as a due to my pamela o the dear good man theres for you my dear father and mother did i not do well now to come back o could i get rid of my fears of this shammarriage for all this is not yet inconsistent with that frightful scheme i should be too happy so i came up with great pleasure for my gloves and now wait his kind commands dear dear sir said i to myself as if i was speaking to him for gods sake let me have no more trials and reverses for i could not bear it now i verily think at last the welcome message came that my master was ready and so i went down as fast as i could and he before all the servants handed me in as if i was a lady and then came in himself mrs jewkes begged he would take care he did not catch cold as he had been ill and i had the pride to hear his new coachman say to one of his fellowservants they are a charming pair i am sure tis pity they should be parted o my dear father and mother i fear your girl will grow as proud as any thing and especially you will think i have reason to guard against it when you read the kind particulars i am going to relate he ordered dinner to be ready by two and abraham who succeeds john went behind the coach he bid robin drive gently and told me he wanted to talk to me about his sister davers and other matters indeed at first setting out he kissed me a little too often that he did and i was afraid of robins looking back through the foreglass and people seeing us as they passed but he was exceedingly kind to me in his words as well at last he said you have i doubt not read over and over my sisters saucy letter and find as i told you that you are no more obliged to her than i am you see she intimates that some people had been with her and who should they be but the officious mrs jervis and mr longman and jonathan and so that has made me take the measures i did in dismissing them my service i see said he you are going to speak on their behalfs but your time is not come to do that if ever i shall permit it my sister says he i have been beforehand with for i have renounced her i am sure i have been a kind brother to her and gave her to the value of l more than her share came to by my fathers will when i entered upon my estate and the woman surely was beside herself with passion and insolence when she wrote me such a letter for well she knew i would not bear it but you must know pamela that she is much incensed that i will give no ear to a proposal of hers of a daughter of my lord who said he neither in person or mind or acquirements even with all her opportunities is to be named in a day with my pamela but yet you see the plea my girl which i made to you before of the pride of condition and the worlds censure which i own sticks a little too close with me still for a woman shines not forth to the public as man and the world sees not your excellencies and perfections if it did i should entirely stand acquitted by the severest censures but it will be taken in the lump that here is mr b with such and such an estate has married his mothers waitingmaid not considering there is not a lady in the kingdom that can outdo her or better support the condition to which she will be raised if i should marry her and said he putting his arm round me and again kissing me i pity my dear girl too for her part in this censure for here will she have to combat the pride and slights of the neighbouring gentry all around us sister davers you see will never be reconciled to you the other ladies will not visit you and you will with a merit superior to them all be treated as if unworthy their notice should i now marry my pamela how will my girl relish all this wont these be cutting things to my fair one for as to me i shall have nothing to do but with a good estate in possession to brazen out the matter of my former pleasantry on this subject with my companions of the chase the green and the assemblee stand their rude jests for once or twice and my fortune will create me always respect enough i warrant you but i say what will my poor girl do as to her part with her own sex for some company you must keep my station will not admit it to be with my servants and the ladies will fly your acquaintance and still though my wife will treat you as my mothers waitingmaid what says my girl to this you may well guess my dear father and mother how transporting these kind these generous and condescending sentiments were to me i thought i had the harmony of the spheres all around me and every word that dropped from his lips was as sweet as the honey of hybla to me oh sir said i how inexpressibly kind and good is all this your poor servant has a much greater struggle than this to go through a more knotty difficulty to overcome what is that said he a little impatiently i will not forgive your doubts now no sir said i i cannot doubt but it is how i shall support how i shall deserve your goodness to me dear girl said he and hugged me to his breast i was afraid you would have made me angry again but that i would not be because i see you have a grateful heart and this your kind and cheerful return after such cruel usage as you had experienced in my house enough to make you detest the place has made me resolve to bear any thing in you but doubts of my honour at a time when i am pouring out my soul with a true and affectionate ardour before you but good sir said i my greatest concern will be for the rude jests you will have yourself to encounter with for thus stooping beneath yourself for as to me considering my lowly estate and little merit even the slights and reflections of the ladies will be an honour to me and i shall have the pride to place more than half their ill will to their envy at my happiness and if i can by the most cheerful duty and resigned obedience have the pleasure to be agreeable to you i shall think myself but too happy let the world say what it will he said you are very good my dearest girl but how will you bestow your time when you will have no visits to receive or pay no parties of pleasure to join in no cardtables to employ your winter evenings and even as the taste is half the day summer and winter and you have often played with my mother too and so know how to perform a part there as well as in the other diversions and ill assure you my girl i shall not desire you to live without such amusements as my wife might expect were i to marry a lady of the first quality o sir said i you are all goodness how shall i bear it but do you think sir in such a family as yours a person whom you shall honour with the name of mistress of it will not find useful employments for her time without looking abroad for any others in the first place sir if you will give me leave i will myself look into such parts of the family economy as may not be beneath the rank to which i shall have the honour of being exalted if any such there can be and this i hope without incurring the ill will of any honest servant then sir i will ease you of as much of your family accounts as i possibly can when i have convinced you that i am to be trusted with them and you know sir my late good lady made me her treasurer her almoner and every thing then sir if i must needs be visiting or visited and the ladies wont honour me so much or even if they would now and then i will visit if your goodness will allow me so to do the sick poor in the neighbourhood around you and administer to their wants and necessities in such matters as may not be hurtful to your estate but comfortable to them and entail upon you their blessings and their prayers for your dear health and welfare then i will assist your housekeeper as i used to do in the making jellies comfits sweetmeats marmalades cordials and to pot and candy and preserve for the uses of the family and to make myself all the fine linen of it for yourself and me then sir if you will sometimes indulge me with your company i will take an airing in your chariot now and then and when you shall return home from your diversions on the green or from the chase or where you shall please to go i shall have the pleasure of receiving you with duty and a cheerful delight and in your absence count the moments till you return and you will may be fill up some part of my time the sweetest by far with your agreeable conversation for an hour or two now and then and be indulgent to the impertinent overflowings of my grateful heart for all your goodness to me the breakfastingtime the preparations for dinner and sometimes to entertain your chosen friends and the company you shall bring home with you gentlemen if not ladies and the supperings will fill up a great part of the day in a very necessary manner and may be sir now and then a goodhumoured lady will drop in and i hope if they do i shall so behave myself as not to add to the disgrace you will have brought upon yourself for indeed i will be very circumspect and try to be as discreet as i can and as humble too as shall be consistent with your honour cards tis true i can play at in all the usual games that our sex delight in but this i am not fond of nor shall ever desire to play unless to induce such ladies as you may wish to see not to abandon your house for want of an amusement they are accustomed to music which our good lady taught me will fill up some intervals if i should have any and then sir you know i love reading and scribbling and though all the latter will be employed in the family accounts between the servants and me and me and your good self yet reading at proper times will be a pleasure to me which i shall be unwilling to give up for the best company in the world except yours and o sir that will help to polish my mind and make me worthier of your company and conversation and with the explanations you will give me of what i shall not understand will be a sweet employment and improvement too but one thing sir i ought not to forget because it is the chief my duty to god will i hope always employ some good portion of my time with thanks for his superlative goodness to me and to pray for you and myself for you sir for a blessing on you for your great goodness to such an unworthy creature for myself that i may be enabled to discharge my duty to you and be found grateful for all the blessings i shall receive at the hands of providence by means of your generosity and condescension with all this sir said i can you think i shall be at a loss to pass my time but as i know that every slight to me if i come to be so happy will be in some measure a slight to you i will beg of you sir not to let me go very fine in dress but appear only so as that you may not be ashamed of it after the honour i shall have of being called by your worthy name for well i know sir that nothing so much excites the envy of my own sex as seeing a person above them in appearance and in dress and that would bring down upon me an hundred saucy things and lowborn brats and i cant tell what there i stopped for i had prattled a great deal too much so early and he said clasping me to him why stops my dear pamela why does she not proceed i could dwell upon your words all the day long and you shall be the directress of your own pleasures and your own time so sweetly do you choose to employ it and thus shall i find some of my own bad actions atoned for by your exemplary goodness and god will bless me for your sake o said he what pleasure you give me in this sweet foretaste of my happiness i will now defy the saucy busy censurers of the world and bid them know your excellence and my happiness before they with unhallowed lips presume to judge of my actions and your merit and let me tell you my pamela that i can add my hopes of a still more pleasing amusement and what your bashful modesty would not permit you to hint and which i will no otherwise touch upon lest it should seem to your nicety to detract from the present purity of my good intentions than to say i hope to have superadded to all these such an employment as will give me a view of perpetuating my happy prospects and my family at the same time of which i am almost the only male i blushed i believe yet could not be displeased at the decent and charming manner with which he insinuated this distant hope and oh judge for me how my heart was affected with all these things he was pleased to add another charming reflection which shewed me the noble sincerity of his kind professions i do own to you my pamela said he that i love you with a purer flame than ever i knew in my whole life a flame to which i was a stranger and which commenced for you in the garden though you unkindly by your unseasonable doubts nipped the opening bud while it was too tender to bear the cold blasts of slight or negligence and i know more sincere joy and satisfaction in this sweet hours conversation with you than all the guilty tumults of my former passion ever did or had even my attempts succeeded ever could have afforded me o sir said i expect not words from your poor servant equal to these most generous professions both the means and the will i now see are given to you to lay me under an everlasting obligation how happy shall i be if though i cannot be worthy of all this goodness and condescension i can prove myself not entirely unworthy of it but i can only answer for a grateful heart and if ever i give you cause wilfully and you will generously allow for involuntary imperfections to be disgusted with me may i be an outcast from your house and favour and as much repudiated as if the law had divorced me from you but sir continued i though i was so unseasonable as i was in the garden you would i flatter myself had you then heard me have pardoned my imprudence and owned i had some cause to fear and to wish to be with my poor father and mother and this i the rather say that you should not think me capable of returning insolence for your goodness or appearing foolishly ungrateful to you when you was so kind to me indeed pamela said he you gave me great uneasiness for i love you too well not to be jealous of the least appearance of your indifference to me or preference to any other person not excepting your parents themselves this made me resolve not to hear you for i had not got over my reluctance to marriage and a little weight you know turns the scale when it hangs in an equal balance but yet you see that though i could part with you while my anger held yet the regard i had then newly professed for your virtue made me resolve not to offer to violate it and you have seen likewise that the painful struggle i underwent when i began to reflect and to read your moving journal between my desire to recall you and my doubt whether you would return though yet i resolved not to force you to it had like to have cost me a severe illness but your kind and cheerful return has dispelled all my fears and given me hope that i am not indifferent to you and you see how your presence has chased away my illness i bless god for it said i but since you are so good as to encourage me and will not despise my weakness i will acknowledge that i suffered more than i could have imagined till i experienced it in being banished your presence in so much anger and the more still was i affected when you answered the wicked mrs jewkes so generously in my favour at my leaving your house for this sir awakened all my reverence for you and you saw i could not forbear not knowing what i did to break boldly in upon you and acknowledge your goodness on my knees tis true my dear pamela said he we have sufficiently tortured one another and the only comfort that can result from it will be reflecting upon the matter coolly and with pleasure when all these storms are overblown as i hope they now are and we sit together secured in each others good opinion recounting the uncommon gradations by which we have ascended to the summit of that felicity which i hope we shall shortly arrive at meantime said the good gentleman let me hear what my dear girl would have said in her justification could i have trusted myself with her as to her fears and the reason of her wishing herself from me at a time that i had begun to shew my fondness for her in a manner that i thought would have been agreeable to her and virtue i pulled out of my pocket the gipsy letter but i said before i shewed it to him i have this letter sir to shew you as what i believe you will allow must have given me the greatest disturbance but first as i know not who is the writer and it seems to be in a disguised hand i would beg it as a favour that if you guess who it is which i cannot it may not turn to their prejudice because it was written very probably with no other view than to serve me he took it and read it and it being signed somebody he said yes this is indeed from somebody and disguised as the hand is i know the writer dont you see by the setness of some of these letters and a little secretary cut here and there especially in that c and that r that it is the hand of a person bred in the lawway why pamela said he tis old longmans hand an officious rascal as he is but i have done with him o sir said i it would be too insolent in me to offer so much am i myself overwhelmed with your goodness to defend any body that you are angry with yet sir so far as they have incurred your displeasure for my sake and for no other want of duty or respect i could wish but i dare not say more but said he as to the letter and the information it contains let me know pamela when you received this on the friday sir said i that you were gone to the wedding at stamford how could it be conveyed to you said he unknown to mrs jewkes when i gave her such a strict charge to attend you and you had promised me that you would not throw yourself in the way of such intelligence for said he when i went to stamford i knew from a private intimation given me that there would be an attempt made to see you or give you a letter by somebody if not to get you away but was not certain from what quarter whether from my sister davers mrs jervis mr longman or john arnold or your father and as i was then but struggling with myself whether to give way to my honourable inclinations or to free you and let you go to your father that i might avoid the danger i found myself in of the former for i had absolutely resolved never to wound again even your ears with any proposals of a contrary nature that was the reason i desired you to permit mrs jewkes to be so much on her guard till i came back when i thought i should have decided this disputed point within myself between my pride and my inclinations this good sir said i accounts well to me for your conduct in that case and for what you said to me and mrs jewkes on that occasion and i see more and more how much i may depend upon your honour and goodness to me but i will tell you all the truth and then i recounted to him the whole affair of the gipsy and how the letter was put among the loose grass etc and he said the man who thinks a thousand dragons sufficient to watch a woman when her inclination takes a contrary bent will find all too little and she will engage the stones in the street or the grass in the field to act for her and help on her correspondence if the mind said he be not engaged i see there is hardly any confinement sufficient for the body and you have told me a very pretty story and as you never gave me any reason to question your veracity even in your severest trials i make no doubt of the truth of what you have now mentioned and i will in my turn give you such a proof of mine that you shall find it carry a conviction with it you must know then my pamela that i had actually formed such a project so well informed was this old rascally somebody and the time was fixed for the very person described in this letter to be here and i had thought he should have read some part of the ceremony as little as was possible to deceive you in my chamber and so i hoped to have you mine upon terms that then would have been much more agreeable to me than real matrimony and i did not in haste intend you the mortification of being undeceived so that we might have lived for years perhaps very lovingly together and i had at the same time been at liberty to confirm or abrogate it as i pleased o sir said i i am out of breath with the thoughts of my danger but what good angel prevented the execution of this deeplaid design why your good angel pamela said he for when i began to consider that it would have made you miserable and me not happy that if you should have a dear little one it would be out of my own power to legitimate it if i should wish it to inherit my estate and that as i am almost the last of my family and most of what i possess must descend to a strange line and disagreeable and unworthy persons notwithstanding that i might in this case have issue of my own body when i further considered your untainted virtue what dangers and trials you had undergone by my means and what a world of troubles i had involved you in only because you were beautiful and virtuous which had excited all my passion for you and reflected also upon your tried prudence and truth i though i doubted not effecting this my last plot resolved to overcome myself and however i might suffer in struggling with my affection for you to part with you rather than to betray you under so black a veil besides said he i remember how much i had exclaimed against and censured an action of this kind that had been attributed to one of the first men of the law and of the kingdom as he afterwards became and that it was but treading in a path that another had marked out for me and as i was assured with no great satisfaction to himself when he came to reflect my foolish pride was a little piqued with this because i loved to be if i went out of the way my own original as i may call it on all these considerations it was that i rejected this project and sent word to the person that i had better considered of the matter and would not have him come till he heard further from me and in this suspense i suppose some of your confederates pamela for we have been a couple of plotters though your virtue and merit have procured you faithful friends and partisans which my money and promises could hardly do one way or other got knowledge of it and gave you this notice but perhaps it would have come too late had not your white angel got the better of my black one and inspired me with resolutions to abandon the project just as it was to have been put into execution but yet i own that from these appearances you were but too well justified in your fears on this odd way of coming at this intelligence and i have only one thing to blame you for that though i was resolved not to hear you in your own defence yet as you have so ready a talent at your pen you might have cleared your part of this matter up to me by a line or two and when i had known what seeming good grounds you had for pouring cold water on a young flame that was just then rising to an honourable expansion should not have imputed it as i was apt to do to unseasonable insult for my tenderness to you on one hand to perverse nicety on the other or to what i was most alarmed by and concerned for prepossession for some other person and this would have saved us both much fatigue i of mind you of body and indeed sir said i of mind too and i could not better manifest this than by the cheerfulness with which i obeyed your recalling me to your presence ay that my dear pamela said he and clasped me in his arms was the kind the inexpressibly kind action that has rivetted my affections to you and obliges me in this free and unreserved manner to pour my whole soul into your bosom i said i had the less merit in this my return because i was driven by an irresistible impulse to it and could not help it if i would this said he and honoured me by kissing my hand is engaging indeed if i may hope that my pamelas gentle inclination for her persecutor was the strongest motive to her return and i so much value a voluntary love in the person i would wish for my wife that i would have even prudence and interest hardly named in comparison with it and can you return me sincerely the honest compliment i now make you in the choice i have made it is impossible i should have any view to my interest love true love is the only motive by which i am induced and were i not what i am could you give me the preference to any other you know in the world notwithstanding what has passed between us why said i should your so much obliged pamela refuse to answer this kind question cruel as i have thought you and dangerous as your views to my honesty have been you sir are the only person living that ever was more than indifferent to me and before i knew this to be what i blush now to call it i could not hate you or wish you ill though from my soul the attempts you made were shocking and most distasteful to me i am satisfied my pamela said he nor shall i want to see those papers that you have kindly written for to your father though i still wish to see them too for the sake of the sweet manner in which you relate what has passed and to have before me the whole series of your sufferings that i may learn what degree of kindness may be sufficient to recompense you for them in this manner my dear father and mother did your happy daughter find herself blessed by her generous master an ample recompense for all her sufferings did i think this sweet conversation only a hundred tender things he expressed besides that though they never can escape my memory yet would be too tedious to write down oh how i blessed god and i hope ever shall for all his gracious favours to his unworthy handmaid what a happy change is this and who knows but my kind my generous master may put it in my power when he shall see me not quite unworthy of it to be a means without injuring him to dispense around me to many persons the happy influences of the condition to which i shall be by his kind favour exalted doubly blest shall i be in particular if i can return the hundredth part of the obligations i owe to such honest good parents to whose pious instructions and examples under god i owe all my present happiness and future prospects o the joy that fills my mind on these proud hopes on these delightful prospects it is too mighty for me and i must sit down to ponder all these things and to admire and bless the goodness of that providence which has through so many intricate mazes made me tread the paths of innocence and so amply rewarded me for what it has itself enabled me to do all glory to god alone be ever given for it by your poor enraptured daughter i will now continue my most pleasing relation as the chariot was returning home from this sweet airing he said from all that has passed between us in this pleasing turn my pamela will see and will believe that the trials of her virtue are all over from me but perhaps there will be some few yet to come of her patience and humility for i have at the earnest importunity of lady darnford and her daughters promised them a sight of my beloved girl and so i intend to have their whole family and lady jones and mrs peterss family to dine with me once in a few days and since i believe you would hardly choose at present to grace the table on the occasion till you can do it in your own right i should be glad you would not refuse coming down to us if i should desire it for i would preface our nuptials said the dear gentleman o what a sweet word was that with their good opinion of your merits and to see you and your sweet manner will be enough for that purpose and so by degrees prepare my neighbours for what is to follow and they already have your character from me and are disposed to admire you sir said i after all that has passed i should be unworthy if i could not say that i can have no will but yours and however awkwardly i shall behave in such company weighed down with a sense of your obligations on one side and my own unworthiness with their observations on the other i will not scruple to obey you i am obliged to you pamela said he and pray be only dressed as you are for since they know your condition and i have told them the story of your present dress and how you came by it one of the young ladies begs it as a favour that they may see you just as you are and i am the rather pleased it should be so because they will perceive you owe nothing to dress but make a much better figure with your own native stock of loveliness than the greatest ladies arrayed in the most splendid attire and adorned with the most glittering jewels o sir said i your goodness beholds your poor servant in a light greatly beyond her merit but it must not be expected that others ladies especially will look upon me with your favourable eyes but nevertheless i should be best pleased to wear always this humble garb till you for your own sake shall order it otherwise for oh sir said i i hope it will be always my pride to glory most in your goodness and it will be a pleasure to me to shew every one that with respect to my happiness in this life i am entirely the work of your bounty and to let the world see from what a lowly original you have raised me to honours that the greatest ladies would rejoice in admirable pamela said he excellent girl surely thy sentiments are superior to those of all thy sex i might have addressed a hundred fine ladies but never surely could have had reason to admire one as i do you as my dear father and mother i repeat these generous sayings only because they are the effect of my masters goodness being far from presuming to think i deserve one of them so i hope you will not attribute it to my vanity for i do assure you i think i ought rather to be more humble as i am more obliged for it must be always a sign of a poor condition to receive obligations one cannot repay as it is of a rich mind when it can confer them without expecting or needing a return it is on one side the state of the human creature compared on the other to the creator and so with due deference may his beneficence be said to be godlike and that is the highest that can be said the chariot brought us home at near the hour of two and blessed be god my master is pure well and cheerful and that makes me hope he does not repent him of his late generous treatment of me he handed me out of the chariot and to the parlour with the same goodness that he shewed when he put me into it before several of the servants mrs jewkes came to inquire how he did quite well mrs jewkes said he quite well i thank god and this good girl for it i am glad of it said she but i hope you are not the worse for my care and my doctoring of you no but the better mrs jewkes said he you have much obliged me by both then he said mrs jewkes you and i have used this good girl very hardly i was afraid sir said she i should be the subject of her complaints i assure you said he she has not opened her lips about you we have had a quite different subject to talk of and i hope she will forgive us both you especially she must because you have done nothing but by my orders but i only mean that the necessary consequence of those orders has been very grievous to my pamela and now comes our part to make her amends if we can sir said she i always said to madam as she called me that you was very good and very forgiving no said he i have been stark naught and it is she i hope will be very forgiving but all this preamble is to tell you mrs jewkes that now i desire youll study to oblige her as much as to obey me you was forced to disoblige her before and youll remember that in every thing she is to be her own mistress yes said she and mine too i suppose sir ay said the generous gentleman i believe it will be so in a little time then said she i know how it will go with me and so put her handkerchief to her eyes pamela said my master comfort poor mrs jewkes this was very generous already to seem to put her in my power and i took her by the hand and said i shall never take upon me mrs jewkes to make a bad use of any opportunities that may be put into my hands by my generous master nor shall i ever wish to do you any disservice if i might for i shall consider that what you have done was in obedience to a will which it will become me also to submit to and so if the effects of our obedience may be different yet as they proceed from one cause that must be always reverenced by me see there mrs jewkes said my master we are both in generous hands and indeed if pamela did not pardon you i should think she but half forgave me because you acted by my instructions well said she god bless you both together since it must be so and i will double my diligence to oblige my lady as i find she will soon be o my dear father and mother now pray for me on another score for fear i should grow too proud and be giddy and foolish with all these promising things so soothing to the vanity of my years and sex but even to this hour can i pray that god would remove from me all these delightful prospects if they were likely so to corrupt my mind as to make me proud and vain and not acknowledge with thankful humility the blessed providence which has so visibly conducted me through the dangerous paths i have trod to this happy moment my master was pleased to say that he thought i might as well dine with him since he was alone but i begged he would excuse me for fear as i said such excess of goodness and condescension all at once should turn my head and that he would by slower degrees bring on my happiness lest i should not know how to bear it persons that doubt themselves said he seldom do amiss and if there was any fear of what you say you could not have it in your thoughts for none but the presumptuous the conceited and the thoughtless err capitally but nevertheless said he i have such an opinion of your prudence that i shall generally think what you do right because it is you that do it sir said i your kind expressions shall not be thrown away upon me if i can help it for they will task me with the care of endeavouring to deserve your good opinion and your approbation as the best rule of my conduct being then about to go up stairs permit me sir said i looking about me with some confusion to see that nobody was there thus on my knees to thank you as i often wanted to do in the chariot for all your goodness to me which shall never i hope be cast away upon me and so i had the boldness to kiss his hand i wonder since how i came to be so forward but what could i do my poor grateful heart was like a too full river which overflows its banks and it carried away my fear and my shamefacedness as that does all before it on the surface of its waters he clasped me in his arms with transport and condescendingly kneeled by me and kissing me said o my dear obliging good girl on my knees as you on yours i vow to you everlasting truth and fidelity and may god but bless us both with half the pleasures that seem to be before us and we shall have no reason to envy the felicity of the greatest princes o sir said i how shall i support so much goodness i am poor indeed in every thing compared to you and how far very far do you in every generous way leave me behind you he raised me and as i bent towards the door led me to the stairs foot and saluting me there again left me to go up to my closet where i threw myself on my knees in raptures of joy and blessed that gracious god who had thus changed my distress to happiness and so abundantly rewarded me for all the sufferings i had passed through and oh how light how very light do all those sufferings now appear which then my repining mind made so grievous to me hence in every state of life and in all the changes and chances of it for the future will i trust in providence who knows what is best for us and frequently turns the very evils we most dread to be the causes of our happiness and of our deliverance from greater my experiences young as i am as to this great point of reliance on god are strong though my judgment in general may be weak and uninformed but youll excuse these reflections because they are your beloved daughters and so far as they are not amiss derive themselves from the benefit of yours and my late good ladys examples and instructions i have written a vast deal in a little time and shall only say to conclude this delightful wednesday that in the afternoon my good master was so well that he rode out on horseback and came home about nine at night and then stepped up to me and seeing me with pen and ink before me in my closet said i come only to tell you i am very well my pamela and since i have a letter or two to write i will leave you to proceed in yours as i suppose that was your employment for i had put by my papers at his coming up and so he saluted me bid me good night and went down and i finished up to this place before i went to bed mrs jewkes told me if it was more agreeable to me she would he in another room but i said no thank you mrs jewkes pray let me have your company and she made me a fine courtesy and thanked me how times are altered thursday this morning my master came up to me and talked with me on various subjects for a good while together in the most kind manner among other things he asked me if i chose to order any new clothes against my marriage o how my heart flutters when he mentions this subject so freely i said i left every thing to his good pleasure only repeated my request for the reasons aforegiven that i might not be too fine he said i think my dear it shall be very private i hope you are not afraid of a shammarriage and pray get the service by heart that you may see nothing is omitted i glowed between shame and delight o how i felt my cheeks burn i said i feared nothing i apprehended nothing but my own unworthiness said he i think it shall be done within these fourteen days from this day at this house o how i trembled but not with grief you may believe what says my girl have you to object against any day of the next fourteen because my affairs require me to go to my other house and i think not to stir from this till i am happy with you i have no will but yours said i all glowing like the fire as i could feel but sir did you say in the house ay said he for i care not how privately it be done and it must be very public if we go to church it is a holy rite sir said i and would be better methinks in a holy place i see said he most kindly my lovely maids confusion and your trembling tenderness shews i ought to oblige you all i may therefore i will order my own little chapel which has not been used for two generations for any thing but a lumberroom because our family seldom resided here long together to be cleared and cleaned and got ready for the ceremony if you dislike your own chamber or mine sir said i that will be better than the chamber and i hope it will never be lumbered again but kept to the use for which as i presume it has been consecrated o yes said he it has been consecrated and that several ages ago in my great great grandfathers time who built that and the good old house together but now my good girl if i do not too much add to your sweet confusion shall it be in the first seven days or the second of this fortnight i looked down quite out of countenance tell me said he in the second if you please sir said i as you please said he most kindly but i should thank you pamela if you would choose the first id rather sir if you please said i have the second well said he be it so but dont defer it till the last day of the fourteen pray sir said i since you embolden me to talk on this important subject may i not send my dear father and mother word of my happiness you may said he but charge them to keep it secret till you or i direct the contrary and i told you i would see no more of your papers but i meant i would not without your consent but if you will shew them to me and now i have no other motive for my curiosity but the pleasure i take in reading what you write i shall acknowledge it as a favour if sir said i you will be pleased to let me write over again one sheet i will though i had relied upon your word and not written them for your perusal what is that said he though i cannot consent to it beforehand for i more desire to see them because they are your true sentiments at the time and because they were not written for my perusal sir said i what i am loath you should see are very severe reflections on the letter i received by the gipsy when i apprehended your design of the shammarriage though there are other things i would not have you see but that is the worst it cant be worse said he my dear sauce box than i have seen already and i will allow your treating me in ever so black a manner on that occasion because it must have a very black appearance to you well sir said i i think i will obey you before night but dont alter a word said he i wont sir replied i since you order it while we were talking mrs jewkes came up and said thomas was returned o said my master let him bring up the papers for he hoped and so did i that you had sent them by him but it was a great balk when he came up and said sir mr andrews did not care to deliver them and would have it that his daughter was forced to write that letter to him and indeed sir said he the old gentleman took on sadly and would have it that his daughter was undone or else he said she would not have turned back when on her way as i told him she did said thomas instead of coming to them i began to be afraid now that all would be bad for me again well tom said he dont mince the matter tell me before mrs andrews what they said why sir both he and goody andrews after they had conferred together upon your letter madam came out weeping bitterly that grieved my very heart and they said now all was over with their poor daughter and either she had written that letter by compulsion or had yielded to your honour so they said and was or would be ruined my master seemed vexed as i feared and i said pray sir be so good as to excuse the fears of my honest parents they cannot know your goodness to me and so said he without answering me they refused to deliver the papers yes and please your honour said thomas though i told them that you madam of your own accord on a letter i had brought you very cheerfully wrote what i carried but the old gentleman said why wife there are in these papers twenty things nobody should see but ourselves and especially not the squire o the poor girl has had so many stratagems to struggle with and now at last she has met with one that has been too hard for her and can it be possible for us to account for her setting out to come to us and in such post haste and when she had got above halfway to send us this letter and to go back again of her own accord as you say when we know that all her delight would have been to come to us and to escape from the perils she had been so long contending with and then and please your honour he said he could not bear this for his daughter was ruined to be sure before now and so said thomas the good old couple sat themselves down and handinhand leaning upon each others shoulder did nothing but lament i was piteously grieved said he but all i could say could not comfort them nor would they give me the papers though i told them i should deliver them only to mrs andrews herself and so and please your honour i was forced to come away without them my good master saw me all bathed in tears at this description of your distress and fears for me and he said i would not have you take on so i am not angry with your father in the main he is a good man and i would have you write out of hand and it shall be sent by the post to mr atkins who lives within two miles of your father and ill enclose it in a cover of mine in which ill desire mr atkins the moment it comes to his hand to convey it safely to your father or mother and say nothing of their sending their papers that it may not make them uneasy for i want not now to see them on any other score than that of mere curiosity and that will do at any time and so saying he saluted me before thomas and with his own handkerchief wiped my eyes and said to thomas the good old folks are not to be blamed in the main they dont know my honourable intentions by their dear daughter who tom will in a little time be your mistress though i shall keep the matter private some days and would not have it spoken of by my servants out of my house thomas said god bless your honour you know best and i said o sir you are all goodness how kind is this to forgive the disappointment instead of being angry as i feared you would thomas then withdrew and my master said i need not remind you of writing out of hand to make the good folks easy and i will leave you to yourself for that purpose only send me down such of your papers as you are willing i should see with which i shall entertain myself for an hour or two but one thing added he i forgot to tell you the neighbouring gentry i mentioned will be here tomorrow to dine with me and i have ordered mrs jewkes to prepare for them and must i sir said i be shewn to them o yes said he thats the chief reason of their coming and youll see nobody equal to yourself dont be concerned i opened my papers as soon as my master had left me and laid out those beginning on the thursday morning he set out for stamford with the morning visit he made me before i was up and the injunctions of watchfulness etc to mrs jewkes the next days gipsy affair and my reflections in which i called him truly diabolical and was otherwise very severe on the strong appearances the matter had then against him his return on saturday with the dread he put me in on the offering to search me for my papers which followed those he had got by mrs jewkess means my being forced to give them up his carriage to me after he had read them and questions to me his great kindness to me on seeing the dangers i had escaped and the troubles i had undergone and how i unseasonably in the midst of his goodness expressed my desire of being sent to you having the intelligence of a shammarriage from the gipsy in my thoughts how this enraged him and made him turn me that very sunday out of his house and send me on my way to you the particulars of my journey and my grief at parting with him and my free acknowledgment to you that i found unknown to myself i had begun to love him and could not help it his sending after me to beg my return but yet generously leaving me at my liberty when he might have forced me to return whether i was willing or not my resolution to oblige him and fatiguing journey back my concern for his illness on my return his kind reception of me and shewing me his sister daverss angry letter against his behaviour to me desiring him to set me free and threatening to renounce him as a brother if he should degrade himself by marrying me my serious reflections on this letter etc all which i hope with the others you will shortly see and this carried matters down to tuesday night last all that followed was so kind on his side being our chariot conference as above on wednesday morning and how good he has been ever since that i thought i would go no further for i was a little ashamed to be so very open on that tender and most grateful subject though his great goodness to me deserves all the acknowledgments i can possibly make and when i had looked these out i carried them down myself into the parlour to him and said putting them into his hands your allowances good sir as heretofore and if i have been too open and free in my reflections or declarations let my fears on one side and my sincerity on the other be my excuse you are very obliging my good girl said he you have nothing to apprehend from my thoughts any more than from my actions so i went up and wrote the letter to you briefly acquainting you with my present happiness and my masters goodness and expressing the gratitude of heart which i owe to the kindest gentleman in the world and assuring you that i should soon have the pleasure of sending back to you not only those papers but all that succeeded them to this time as i know you delight to amuse yourself in your leisure hours with my scribble and i said carrying it down to my master before i sealed it will you please sir to take the trouble of reading what i write to my dear parents thank you pamela said he and set me on his knee while he read it and seemed much pleased with it and giving it me again you are very happy said he my beloved girl in your style and expressions and the affectionate things you say of me are inexpressibly obliging and again with this kiss said he do i confirm for truth all that you have promised for my intentions in this letter o what halcyon days are these god continue them a change would kill me quite he went out in his chariot in the afternoon and in the evening returned and sent me word he would be glad of my company for a little walk in the garden and down i went that very moment he came to meet me so says he how does my dear girl do now whom do you think i have seen since i have been out i dont know sir said i why said he there is a turning in the road about five miles off that goes round a meadow that has a pleasant footway by the side of a little brook and a double row of limes on each side where now and then the gentry in the neighbourhood walk and angle and divert themselves ill shew it you next opportunity and i stept out of my chariot to walk across this meadow and bid robin meet me with it on the further part of it and whom should i spy there walking with a book in his hand reading but your humble servant mr williams dont blush pamela said he as his back was towards me i thought i would speak to the man and before he saw me i said how do you old acquaintance for said he you know we were of one college for a twelvemonth i thought the man would have jumped into the brook he gave such a start at hearing my voice and seeing me poor man said i ay said he but not too much of your poor man in that soft accent neither pamela said i i am sorry my voice is so startling to you mr williams what are you reading sir said he and stammered with the surprise it is the french telemachus for i am about perfecting myself if i can in the french tongue thought i i had rather so than perfecting my pamela in it you do well replied i dont you think that yonder cloud may give us a small shower and it did a little begin to wet he said he believed not much if said i you are for the village ill give you a cast for i shall call at sir simons in my return from the little round i am taking he asked me if it was not too great a favour no said i dont talk of that let us walk to the further opening there and we shall meet my chariot so pamela continued my master we fell into conversation as we walked he said he was very sorry he had incurred my displeasure and the more as he had been told by lady jones who had it from sir simons family that i had a more honourable view than at first was apprehended i said we fellows of fortune mr williams take sometimes a little more liberty with the world than we ought to do wantoning very probably as you contemplative folks would say in the sunbeams of a dangerous affluence and cannot think of confining ourselves to the common paths though the safest and most eligible after all and you may believe i could not very well like to be supplanted in a view that lay next my heart and that by an old acquaintance whose good before this affair i was studious to promote i would only say sir said he that my first motive was entirely such as became my function and very politely said my master he added and i am very sure that however inexcusable i might seem in the progress of the matter yourself sir would have been sorry to have it said you had cast your thoughts on a person that nobody could have wished for but yourself well mr williams said i i see you are a man of gallantry as well as religion but what i took most amiss was that if you thought me doing a wrong thing you did not expostulate with me upon it as your function might have allowed you to do but immediately determined to counterplot me and attempt to secure to yourself a prize you would have robbed me of and that from my own house but the matter is at an end and i retain not any malice upon it though you did not know but i might at last do honourably by her as i actually intend i am sorry for myself sir said he that i should so unhappily incur your displeasure but i rejoice for her sake in your honourable intentions give me leave only to say that if you make miss andrews your lady she will do credit to your choice with every body that sees her or comes to know her and for person and mind both you may challenge the county in this manner said my master did the parson and i confabulate and i set him down at his lodgings in the village but he kept your secret pamela and would not own that you gave any encouragement to his addresses indeed sir said i he could not say that i did and i hope you believe me i do i do said he but tis still my opinion that if when i saw plots set up against my plots i had not discovered the parson as i did the correspondence between you might have gone to a length that would have put our present situation out of both our powers sir said i when you consider that my utmost presumption could not make me hope for the honour you now seem to design me that i was so hardly used and had no prospect before me but dishonour you will allow that i should have seemed very little in earnest in my professions of honesty if i had not endeavoured to get away but yet i resolved not to think of marriage for i never saw the man i could love till your goodness emboldened me to look up to you i should my dear pamela said he make a very ill compliment to my vanity if i did not believe you though at the same time justice calls upon me to say that it is some things considered beyond my merit there was a sweet noble expression for your poor daughter my dear father and mother and from my master too i was glad to hear this account of the interview between mr williams and himself but i dared not to say so i hope in time he will be reinstated in his good graces he was so good as to tell me he had given orders for the chapel to be cleared o how i look forward with inward joy yet with fear and trembling friday about twelve oclock came sir simon and his lady and two daughters and lady jones and a sisterinlaw of hers and mr peters and his spouse and niece mrs jewkes who is more and more obliging was much concerned i was not dressed in some of my best clothes and made me many compliments they all went into the garden for a walk before dinner and i understood were so impatient to see me that my master took them into the largest alcove after they had walked two or three turns and stept himself to me come my pamela said he the ladies cant be satisfied without seeing you and i desire youll come i said i was ashamed but i would obey him said he the two young ladies are dressed out in their best attire but they make not such an appearance as my charming girl in this ordinary garb sir said i shant i follow you thither for i cant bear you should do me so much honour well said he ill go before you and he bid mrs jewkes bring a bottle of sack and some cake so he went down to them this alcove fronts the longest gravelwalk in the garden so that they saw me all the way i came for a good way and my master told me afterwards with pleasure all they said of me will you forgive the little vain slut your daughter if i tell you all as he was pleased to tell me he said spying me first look there ladies comes my pretty rustic they all i saw which dashed me stood at the windows and in the doorway looking full at me my master told me that lady jones said she is a charming creature i see that at this distance and sir simon it seems who has been a sad rake in his younger days swore he never saw so easy an air so fine a shape and so graceful a presence the lady darnford said i was a sweet girl and mrs peters said very handsome things even the parson said i should be the pride of the county o dear sirs all this was owing to the light my good masters favour placed me in which made me shine out in their eyes beyond my deserts he said the young ladies blushed and envied me when i came near he saw me in a little confusion and was so kind as to meet me give me your hand said he my poor girl you walk too fast for indeed i wanted to be out of their gazing i did so with a courtesy and he led me up the steps of the alcove and in a most gentlemanlike manner presented me to the ladies and they all saluted me and said they hoped to be better acquainted with me and lady darnford was pleased to say i should be the flower of their neighbourhood sir simon said good neighbour by your leave and saluting me added now will i say that i have kissed the loveliest maiden in england but for all this methought i owed him a grudge for a telltale though all had turned out so happily mr peters very gravely followed his example and said like a bishop god bless you fair excellence said lady jones pray dear madam sit down by me and they all sat down but i said i would stand if they pleased no pamela said my master pray sit down with these good ladies my neighbours they will indulge it to you for my sake till they know you better and for your own when they are acquainted with you sir said i i shall be proud to deserve their indulgence they all so gazed at me that i could not look up for i think it is one of the distinctions of persons of condition and wellbred people to put bashful bodies out of countenance well sir simon said my master what say you now to my pretty rustic he swore a great oath that he should better know what to say to me if he was as young as himself lady darnford said you will never leave sir simon said my master you are a little confused my good girl and out of breath but i have told all my kind neighbours here a good deal of your story and your excellence yes said lady darnford my dear neighbour as i will call you we that are here present have all heard of your uncommon story madam said i you have then heard what must make your kind allowance for me very necessary no said mrs peters we have heard what will always make you valued as an honour to our sex and as a worthy pattern for all the young ladies in the county you are very good madam said i to make me able to look up and to be thankful for the honour you are pleased to do me mrs jewkes came in with the canary brought by nan to the alcove and some cakes on a silver salver and i said mrs jewkes let me be your assistant i will serve the ladies with the cake and so i took the salver and went round to the good company with it ending with my master the lady jones said she never was served with such a grace and it was giving me too much trouble o madam said i i hope my good masters favour will never make me forget that it is my duty to wait upon his friends master sweet one said sir simon i hope you wont always call mr b by that name for fear it should become a fashion for all our ladies to do the like through the county i sir said i shall have many reasons to continue this style which cannot affect your good ladies sir simon said lady jones you are very arch upon us but i see very well that it will be the interest of all the gentlemen to bring their ladies into an intimacy with one that can give them such a good example i am sure then madam said i it must be after i have been polished and improved by the honour of such an example as yours they all were very good and affable and the young lady darnford who had wished to see me in this dress said i beg your pardon dear miss as she called me but i had heard how sweetly this garb became you and was told the history of it and i begged it as a favour that you might oblige us with your appearance in it i am much obliged to your ladyship said i that your kind prescription was so agreeable to my choice why said she was it your choice then i am glad of that though i am sure your person must give and not take ornament from any dress you are very kind madam said i but there will be the less reason to fear i should forget the high obligations i should have to the kindest of gentlemen when i can delight to shew the humble degree from which his goodness had raised me my dear pamela said my master if you proceed at this rate i must insist upon your first seven days you know what i mean sir said i you are all goodness they drank a glass of sack each and sir simon would make me do so too saying it will be a reflection madam upon all the ladies if you dont do as they no sir simon said i that cant be because the ladies journey hither makes a glass of canary a proper cordial for them but i wont refuse because i will do myself the honour of drinking good health to you and to all this worthy company said good lady darnford to my master i hope sir we shall have mrs andrewss company at table he said very obligingly madam it is her time now and i will leave it to her choice if the good ladies then will forgive me sir said i i had rather be excused they all said i must not be excused i begged i might your reason for it my dear pamela said my master since the ladies request it i wish you would oblige them sir replied i your goodness will make me every day worthier of the honour the ladies do me and when i can persuade myself that i am more worthy of it than at present i shall with great joy embrace all the opportunities they will be pleased to give me mrs peters whispered lady jones as my master told me afterwards did you ever see such excellence such prudence and discretion never in my life said the other good lady she will adorn she was pleased to say her distinction ay says mrs peters she would adorn any station in life my good master was highly delighted generous gentleman as he is with the favourable opinion of the ladies and i took the more pleasure in it because their favour seemed to lessen the disgrace of his stooping so much beneath himself lady darnford said we will not oppress you though we could almost blame your too punctilious exactness but if we excuse miss andrews from dinner we must insist upon her company at the cardtable and at a dish of tea for we intend to pass the whole day with you sir as we told you what say you to that pamela said my master sir replied i whatever you and the ladies please i will cheerfully do they said i was very obliging but sir simon rapt out an oath and said that they might dine together if they would but he would dine with me and nobody else for said he i say sir as parson williams said by which i found my master had told them the story you must not think you have chosen one that nobody can like but yourself the young ladies said if i pleased they would take a turn about the garden with me i answered i would very gladly attend them and so we three and lady joness sisterinlaw and mr peterss niece walked together they were very affable kind and obliging and we soon entered into a good deal of familiarity and i found miss darnford a very agreeable person her sister was a little more on the reserve and i afterwards heard that about a year before she would fain have had my master make his addresses to her but though sir simon is reckoned rich she was not thought sufficient fortune for him and now to have him look down so low as me must be a sort of mortification to a poor young lady and i pitied her indeed i did i wish all young persons of my sex could be as happy as i am like to be my master told me afterwards that i left the other ladies and sir simon and mr peters full of my praises so that they could hardly talk of any thing else one lanching out upon my complexion another upon my eyes my hand and in short for youll think me sadly proud upon my whole person and behaviour and they all magnified my readiness and obligingness in my answers and the like and i was glad of it as i said for my good masters sake who seemed quite pleased and rejoiced god bless him for his goodness to me dinner not being ready the young ladies proposed a tune upon the spinnet i said i believed it was not in tune they said they knew it was but a few months ago if it is said i i wish i had known it though indeed ladies added i since you know my story i must own that my mind has not been long in tune to make use of it so they would make me play upon it and sing to it which i did a song my dear good lady made me learn and used to be pleased with and which she brought with her from bath and the ladies were much taken with the song and were so kind as to approve my performance and miss darnford was pleased to compliment me that i had all the accomplishments of my sex i said i had had a good lady in my masters mother who had spared no pains nor cost to improve me she said she wished mr b could be prevailed upon to give a ball on an approaching happy occasion that we might have a dancingmatch etc but i cant say i do though i did not say so for these occasions i think are too solemn for the principals at least of our sex to take part in especially if they have the same thoughts of that solemnity that i have for indeed though i have before me a prospect of happiness that may be envied by ladies of high rank yet i must own to you my dear parents that i have something very awful upon my mind when i think of the matter and shall more and more as it draws nearer and nearer this is the song i go happy paper gently steal and underneath her pillow lie there in soft dreams my love reveal that love which i must still conceal and wrapt in awful silence die ii should flames be doomd thy hapless fate to atoms thou wouldst quickly turn my pains may bear a longer date for should i live and should she hate in endless torments i should burn iii tell fair aurelia she has charms might in a hermit stir desire t attain the heavn thats in her arms id quit the worlds alluring harms and to a cell content retire iv of all that pleasd my ravishd eye her beauty should supply the place bold raphaels strokes and titians dye should but in vain presume to vie with her inimitable face v no more id wish for phoebus rays to gild the object of my sight much less the tapers fainter blaze her eyes should measure out my days and when she slept it should be night about four oclock my master just came up to me and said if you should see mr williams below do you think pamela you should not be surprised no sir said i i hope not why should i expect said he a stranger then when you come down to us in the parlour for the ladies are preparing themselves for the cardtable and they insist upon your company you have a mind sir said i i believe to try all my courage why said he does it want courage to see him no sir said i not at all but i was grievously dashed to see all those strange ladies and gentlemen and now to see mr williams before them as some of them refused his application for me when i wanted to get away it will a little shock me to see them smile in recollecting what has passed of that kind well said he guard your heart against surprises though you shall see when you come down a man that i can allow you to love dearly though hardly preferably to me this surprises me much i am afraid he begins to be jealous of me what will become of me for he looked very seriously if any turn should happen now my heart aches i know not whats the matter but i will go down as brisk as i can that nothing may be imputed to me yet i wish this mr williams had not been there now when they are all there because of their fleers at him and me otherwise i should be glad to see the poor gentleman for indeed i think him a good man and he has suffered for my sake so i am sent for down to cards ill go but wish i may continue their good opinions of me for i shall be very awkward my master by his serious question and bidding me guard my heart against surprises though i should see when i came down a man he can allow me to love dearly though hardly better than himself has quite alarmed me and made me sad i hope he loves me but whether he does or not i am in for it now over head and ears i doubt and cant help loving him tis a folly to deny it but to be sure i cant love any man preferably to him i shall soon know what he means now my dear mother must i write to you well might my good master say so mysteriously as he did about guarding my heart against surprises i never was so surprised in my life and never could see a man i loved so dearly o my dear mother it was my dear dear father and not mr williams that was below ready to receive and to bless your daughter and both my master and he enjoined me to write how the whole matter was and what my thoughts were on this joyful occasion i will take the matter from the beginning that providence directed his feet to this house to this time as i have had it from mrs jewkes from my master my father the ladies and my own heart and conduct as far as i know of both because they command it and you will be pleased with my relation and so as you know how i came by the connexion will make one uniform relation of it it seems then my dear father and you were so uneasy to know the truth of the story which thomas had told you that fearing i was betrayed and quite undone he got leave of absence and set out the day after thomas was there and so on friday morning he got to the neighbouring town and there he heard that the gentry in the neighbourhood were at my masters at a great entertainment he put on a clean shirt and neckcloth which he brought in his pocket at an alehouse there and got shaved and so after he had eaten some bread and cheese and drank a can of ale he set out for my masters house with a heavy heart dreading for me and in much fear of being browbeaten he had it seems asked at the alehouse what family the squire had down here in hopes to hear something of me and they said a housekeeper two maids and at present two coachmen and two grooms a footman and a helper was that all he said they told him there was a young creature there belike who was or was to be his mistress or somewhat of that nature but had been his mothers waitingmaid this he said grieved his heart and confirmed his fears so he went on and about three oclock in the afternoon came to the gate and ringing there sir simons coachman went to the iron gate and he asked for the housekeeper though from what i had written in his heart he could not abide her she sent for him in little thinking who he was and asked him in the little hall what his business with her was only madam said he whether i cannot speak one word with the squire no friend said she he is engaged with several gentlemen and ladies said he i have business with his honour of greater consequence to me than either life or death and tears stood in his eyes at that she went into the great parlour where my master was talking very pleasantly with the ladies and she said sir here is a good tight old man that wants to see you on business of life and death he says and is very earnest ay said he who can that be let him stay in the little hall and ill come to him presently they all seemed to stare and sir simon said no more nor less i dare say my good friend but a bastard child if it is said lady jones bring it in to us i will said he mrs jewkes tells me my master was much surprised when he saw who it was and she much more when my dear father said good god give me patience but as great as you are sir i must ask for my child and burst out into tears o what trouble have i given you both my master said taking him by the hand dont be uneasy goodman andrews your daughter is in the way to be happy this alarmed my dear father and he said what then is she dying and trembled he could scarce stand my master made him sit down and sat down by him and said no god be praised she is very well and pray be comforted i cannot bear to see you thus apprehensive but she has written you a letter to assure you that she has reason to be well satisfied and happy ah sir i said he you told me once she was in london waiting on a bishops lady when all the time she was a severe prisoner here well thats all over now goodman andrews said my master but the times are altered for now the sweet girl has taken me prisoner and in a few days i shall put on the most agreeable fetters that ever man wore o sir said he you are too pleasant for my griefs my hearts almost broke but may i not see my poor child you shall presently said he for she is coming down to us and since you wont believe me i hope you will her i will ask you good sir said he but one question till then that i may know how to look upon her when i see her is she honest is she virtuous as the newborn babe mr andrews said my good master and in twelve days time i hope will be my wife o flatter me not good your honour said he it cannot be it cannot be i fear you have deluded her with strange hopes and would make me believe impossibilities mrs jewkes said he do you tell my dear pamelas good father when i go out all you know concerning me and your mistress that is to be meantime make much of him and set out what you have and make him drink a glass of what he likes best if this be wine added he fill me a bumper she did so and he took my father by the hand and said believe me good man and be easy for i cant bear to see you tortured in this cruel suspense your dear daughter is the beloved of my soul i am glad you are come for youll see us all in the same story and heres your dames health and god bless you both for being the happy means of procuring for me so great a blessing and so he drank a bumper to this most obliging health what do i hear it cannot surely be said my father and your honour is too good i hope to mock a poor old man this ugly story sir of the bishop runs in my head but you say i shall see my dear child and i shall see her honest if not poor as i am i would not own her my master bid mrs jewkes not to let me know yet that my father was come and went to the company and said i have been agreeably surprised here is honest old goodman andrews come full of grief to see his daughter for he fears she is seduced and tells me good honest man that poor as he is he will not own her if she be not virtuous o said they all with one voice almost dear sir shall we not see the good old man you have so praised for his plain good sense and honest heart if said he i thought pamela would not be too much affected with the surprise i would make you all witness to their first interview for never did daughter love a father or a father a daughter as they two do one another miss darnford and all the ladies and the gentlemen too begged it might be so but was not this very cruel my dear mother for well might they think i should not support myself in such an agreeable surprise he said kindly i have but one fear that the dear girl may be too much affected o said lady darnford well all help to keep up her spirits says he ill go up and prepare her but wont tell her of it so he came up to me as i have said and amused me about mr williams to half prepare me for some surprise though that could not have been any thing to this and he left me as i said in that suspense at his mystical words saying he would send to me when they were going to cards my master went from me to my father and asked if he had eaten any thing no said mrs jewkes the good mans heart is so full he cannot eat nor do any thing till he has seen his dear daughter that shall soon be said my master i will have you come in with me for she is going to sit down with my guests to a game at quadrille and i will send for her down o sir said my father dont dont let me i am not fit to appear before your guests let me see my daughter by myself i beseech you said he they all know your honest character goodman andrews and long to see you for pamelas sake so he took my father by the hand and led him in against his will to the company they were all very good my master kindly said ladies and gentlemen i present to you one of the honestest men in england my good pamelas father mr peters went to him and took him by the hand and said we are all glad to see you sir you are the happiest man in the world in a daughter whom we never saw before today but cannot enough admire said my master this gentleman goodman andrews is the minister of the parish but is not young enough for mr williams this airy expression my poor father said made him fear for a moment that all was a jest sir simon also took him by the hand and said ay you have a sweet daughter honesty we are all in love with her and the ladies came and said very fine things lady darnford particularly that he might think himself the happiest man in england in such a daughter if and please you madam said he she be but virtuous tis all in all for all the rest is accident but i doubt his honour has been too much upon the jest with me no said mrs peters we are all witnesses that he intends very honourably by her it is some comfort said he and wiped his eyes that such good ladies say so but i wish i could see her they would have had him sit down by them but he would only sit behind the door in the corner of the room so that one could not soon see him as one came in because the door opened against him and hid him almost the ladies all sat down and my master said desire mrs jewkes to step up and tell mrs andrews the ladies wait for her so down i came miss darnford rose and met me at the door and said well miss andrews we longed for your company i did not see my dear father and it seems his heart was too full to speak and he got up and sat down three or four times successively unable to come to me or to say any thing the ladies looked that way but i would not supposing it was mr williams and they made me sit down between lady darnford and lady jones and asked me what we should play at i said at what your ladyships please i wondered to see them smile and look upon me and to that corner of the room but i was afraid of looking that way for fear of seeing mr williams though my face was that way too and the table before me said my master did you send your letter away to the posthouse my good girl for your father to be sure sir said i i did not forget that i took the liberty to desire mr thomas to carry it what said he i wonder will the good old couple say to it o sir said i your goodness will be a cordial to their dear honest hearts at that my dear father not able to contain himself nor yet to stir from the place gushed out into a flood of tears which he good soul had been struggling with it seems and cried out o my dear child i knew the voice and lifting up my eyes and seeing my father gave a spring overturned the table without regard to the company and threw myself at his feet o my father my father said i can it be is it you yes it is it is o bless your happy daughter i would have said and down i sunk my master seemed concerned i feared said he that the surprise would be too much for her spirits and all the ladies ran to me and made me drink a glass of water and i found myself encircled in the arms of my dearest father o tell me said i every thing how long have you been here when did you come how does my honoured mother and half a dozen questions more before he could answer one they permitted me to retire with my father and then i poured forth all my vows and thanksgivings to god for this additional blessing and confirmed all my masters goodness to his scarcebelieving amazement and we kneeled together blessing god and one another for several ecstatic minutes and my master coming in soon after my dear father said o sir what a change is this may god reward and bless you both in this world and the next may god bless us all said he but how does my sweet girl i have been in pain for you i am sorry i did not apprise you beforehand o sir said i it was you and all you do must be good but this was a blessing so unexpected well said he you have given pain to all the company they will be glad to see you when you can for you have spoiled all their diversion and yet painfully delighted them at the same time mr andrews added he do you make this house your own and the longer you stay the more welcome youll be after you have a little composed yourself my dear girl step in to us again i am glad to see you so well already and so he left us see you my dear father said i what goodness there is in this once naughty master o pray for him and pray for me that i may deserve it how long has this happy change been wrought my dear child o said i several happy days i have written down every thing and youll see from the depth of misery what god has done for your happy daughter blessed be his name said he but do you say he will marry you can it be that such a brave gentleman will make a lady of the child of such a poor man as i o the divine goodness how will your poor dear mother be able to support these happy tidings i will set out tomorrow to acquaint her with them for i am but half happy till the dear good woman shares them with me to be sure my dear child we ought to go into some far country to hide ourselves that we may not disgrace you by our poverty o my dear father said i now you are unkind for the first time your poverty has been my glory and my riches and i have nothing to brag of but that i ever thought it an honour rather than a disgrace because you were always so honest that your child might well boast of such a parentage in this manner my dear mother did we pass the happy moments till miss darnford came to me and said how do you do dear madam i rejoice to see you so well pray let us have your company and yours too good mr andrews taking his hand this was very obliging i told her and we went to the great parlour and my master took my father by the hand and made him sit down by him and drink a glass of wine with him meantime i made my excuses to the ladies as well as i could which they readily granted me but sir simon after his comical manner put his hands on my shoulders let me see let me see said he where your wings grow for i never saw any body fly like you why said he you have broken lady joness shins with the table shew her else madam his pleasantry made them laugh and i said i was very sorry for my extravagancy and if it had not been my masters doings i should have said it was a fault to permit me to be surprised and put out of myself before such good company they said all was very excusable and they were glad i suffered no more by it they were so kind as to excuse me at cards and played by themselves and i went by my masters commands and sat on the other side in the happiest place i ever was blest with between two of the dearest men in the world to me and each holding one of my hands my father every now and then with tears lifting up his eyes and saying could i ever have hoped this i asked him if he had been so kind as to bring the papers with him he said he had and looked at me as who should say must i give them to you now i said be pleased to let me have them he pulled them from his pocket and i stood up and with my best duty gave them into my masters hands he said thank you pamela your father shall take all with him so see what a sad fellow i have been as well as the present happier alteration but i must have them all again for the writers sake the ladies and gentlemen would make me govern the teatable whatever i could do and abraham attended me to serve the company my master and my father sat together and drank a glass or two of wine instead of tea and sir simon joked with my master saying i warrant you would not be such a womans man as to drink tea for ever so much with the ladies but your times coming and i doubt not youll be made as comfortable as i my master was very urgent with them to stay supper and at last they complied on condition that i would grace the table as they were pleased to call it i begged to be excused my master said dont be excused pamela since the ladies desire it and besides said he we wont part with your father and so you may as well stay with us i was in hopes my father and i might sup by ourselves or only with mrs jewkes and miss darnford who is a most obliging young lady said we will not part with you indeed we wont when supper was brought in lady darnford took me by the hand and said to my master sir by your leave and would have placed me at the upper end of the table pray pray madam said i excuse me i cannot do it indeed i cannot pamela said my master to the great delight of my good father as i could see by his looks oblige lady darnford since she desires it it is but a little before your time you know dear good sir said i pray dont command it let me sit by my father pray why said sir simon heres ado indeed sit down at the upper end as you should do and your father shall sit by you there this put my dear father upon difficulties and my master said come ill place you all and so put lady darnford at the upper end lady jones at her right hand and mrs peters on the other and he placed me between the two young ladies but very genteelly put miss darnford below her younger sister saying come miss i put you here because you shall hedge in this little cuckow for i take notice with pleasure of your goodness to her and besides all you very young ladies should sit together this seemed to please both sisters for had the youngest miss been put there it might have piqued her as matters have been formerly to be placed below me whereas miss darnford giving place to her youngest sister made it less odd she should to me especially with that handsome turn of the dear man as if i was a cuckow and to be hedged in my master kindly said come mr andrews you and i will sit together and so took his place at the bottom of the table and set my father on his right hand and sir simon would sit on his left for said he parson i think the petticoats should sit together and so do you sit down by that lady his sister a boiled turkey standing by me my master said cut up that turkey pamela if it be not too strong work for you that lady darnford may not have too much trouble so i carved it in a trice and helped the ladies miss darnford said i would give something to be so dexterous a carver o madam said i my late good lady would always make me do these things when she entertained her female friends as she used to do on particular days ay said my master i remember my poor mother would often say if i or any body at table happened to be a little out in carving ill send up for my pamela to shew you how to carve said lady jones mrs andrews has every accomplishment of her sex she is quite wonderful for her years miss darnford said and i can tell you madam that she plays sweetly upon the spinnet and sings as sweetly to it for she has a fine voice foolish said sir simon who that hears her speak knows not that and who that sees her fingers believes not that they were made to touch any key o parson said he tis well youre by or i should have had a blush from the ladies i hope not sir simon said lady jones for a gentleman of your politeness would not say any thing that would make ladies blush no no said he for the world but if i had it would have been as the poet says they blush because they understand when the company went away lady darnford lady jones and mrs peters severally invited my master and me with him to their houses and begged he would permit me at least to come before we left those parts and they said we hope when the happy knot is tied you will induce mr b to reside more among us we were always glad said lady darnford when he was here but now shall have double reason o what grateful things were these to the ears of my good father when the company was gone my master asked my father if he smoked he answered no he made us both sit down by him and said i have been telling this sweet girl that in fourteen days and two of them are gone she must fix on one to make me happy and have left it to her to choose either one of the first or last seven my father held up his hands and eyes god bless your honour said he is all i can say now pamela said my master taking my hand dont let a little wrongtimed bashfulness take place without any other reason because i should be glad to go to bedfordshire as soon as i could and i would not return till i carry my servants there a mistress who should assist me to repair the mischiefs she has made in it i could not look up for confusion and my father said my dear child i need not i am sure prompt your obedience in whatever will most oblige so good a gentleman what says my pamela said my master she does not use to be at a loss for expressions sir said i were i too sudden it would look as if i doubted whether you would hold in your mind and was not willing to give you time for reflection but otherwise to be sure i ought to resign myself implicitly to your will said he i want not time for reflection for i have often told you and that long ago i could not live without you and my pride of condition made me both tempt and terrify you to other terms but your virtue was proof against all temptations and was not to be awed by terrors wherefore as i could not conquer my passion for you i corrected myself and resolved since you would not be mine upon my terms you should upon your own and now i desire you not on any other i assure you and i think the sooner it is done the better what say you mr andrews sir said he there is so much goodness on your side and blessed be god so much prudence on my daughters that i must be quite silent but when it is done i and my poor wife shall have nothing to do but to pray for you both and to look back with wonder and joy on the ways of providence this said my master is friday night and suppose my girl it be next monday tuesday wednesday or thursday morning say my pamela will you sir said i excuse me till tomorrow for an answer i will said he and touched the bell and called for mrs jewkes where said he does mr andrews lie tonight youll take care of him hes a very good man and will bring a blessing upon every house he sets his foot in my dear father wept for joy and i could not refrain keeping him company and my master saluting me bid us good night and retired and i waited upon my dear father and was so full of prattle of my masters goodness and my future prospects that i believed afterwards i was turned all into tongue but he indulged me and was transported with joy and went to bed and dreamed of nothing but jacobs ladder and angels ascending and descending to bless him and his daughter saturday i arose early in the morning but found my father was up before me and was gone to walk in the garden i went to him and with what delight with what thankfulness did we go over every scene of it that had before been so dreadful to me the fishpond the backdoor and every place o what reason had we for thankfulness and gratitude about seven oclock my good master joined us in his morning gown and slippers and looking a little heavy i said sir i fear you had not good rest last night that is your fault pamela said he after i went from you i must needs look into your papers and could not leave them till i had read them through and so twas three oclock before i went to sleep i wish sir said i you had had better entertainment the worst part of it said he was what i had brought upon myself and you have not spared me sir said i he interrupting me said well i forgive you you had too much reason for it but i find plainly enough that if you had got away you would soon have been williamss wife and i cant see how it could well have been otherwise indeed sir said i i had no notion of it or of being any bodys i believe so said he but it must have come as a thing of course and i see your father was for it sir said he i little thought of the honour your goodness would confer upon her and i thought that would be a match above what we could do for her a great deal but when i found she was not for it i resolved not to urge her but leave all to her own prudence i see said he all was sincere honest and open and i speak of it if it had been done as a thing that could hardly well be avoided and i am quite satisfied but said he i must observe as i have a hundred times with admiration what a prodigious memory and easy and happy manner of narration this excellent girl has and though she is full of her pretty tricks and artifices to escape the snares i had laid for her yet all is innocent lovely and uniformly beautiful you are exceedingly happy in a daughter and i hope i shall be so in a wife or said my father may she not have that honour i fear it not said he and i hope i shall deserve it of her but pamela said my master i am sorry to find in some parts of your journal that mrs jewkes carried her orders a little too far and i the more take notice of it because you have not complained to me of her behaviour as she might have expected for some parts of it though a good deal was occasioned by my strict orders but she had the insolence to strike my girl i find sir said i i was a little provoking i believe but as we forgave one another i was the less entitled to complain of her well said he you are very good but if you have any particular resentment i will indulge it so far as that she shall hereafter have nothing to do where you are sir said i you are so kind that i ought to forgive every body and when i see that my happiness is brought about by the very means that i thought then my greatest grievance i ought to bless those means and forgive all that was disagreeable to me at the same time for the great good that hath issued from it that said he and kissed me is sweetly considered and it shall be my part to make you amends for what you have suffered that you may still think lighter of the one and have cause to rejoice in the other my dear fathers heart was full and he said with his hands folded and lifted up pray sir let me go let me go to my dear wife and tell her all these blessed things while my heart holds for it is ready to burst with joy good man said my master i hope to hear this honest heart of yours speaking at your lips i enjoin you pamela to continue your relation as you have opportunity and though your father be here write to your mother that this wondrous story be perfect and we your friends may read and admire you more and more ay pray pray do my child said my father and this is the reason that i write on my dear mother when i thought not to do it because my father could tell you all that passed while he was here my master took notice of my psalm and was pleased to commend it and said that i had very charitably turned the last verses which in the original were full of heavy curses to a wish that shewed i was not of an implacable disposition though my then usage might have excused it if i had but said he i think you shall sing it to me tomorrow after we have breakfasted added he if you have no objection pamela well take an airing together and it shall be in the coach because well have your fathers company he would have excused himself but my master would have it so but he was much ashamed because of the meanness of his appearance my master would make us both breakfast with him on chocolate and he said i would have you pamela begin to dress as you used to do for now at least you may call your two other bundles your own and if you want any thing against the approaching occasion private as i design it ill send to lincoln for it by a special messenger i said my good ladys bounty and his own had set me much above my degree and i had very good things of all sorts and i did not desire any other because i would not excite the censure of the ladies that would be a different thing he was pleased to say when he publicly owned his nuptials after we came to the other house but at present if i was satisfied he would not make words with me i hope mr andrews said he to my father youll not leave us till you see the affair over and then youll be sure i mean honourably and besides pamela will be induced to set the day sooner o sir said he i bless god i have no reason to doubt your meaning honourably and i hope youll excuse me if i set out on monday morning very early to my dear wife and make her as happy as i am why pamela says my good master may it not be performed on tuesday and then your father maybe will stay i should have been glad to have had it tomorrow added he but i have sent monsieur colbrand for a license that you may have no scruple unanswered and he cant very well be back before tomorrow night or monday morning this was most agreeable news i said sir i know my dear father will want to be at home and as you was so good to give me a fortnight from last thursday i should be glad you would be pleased to indulge me still to some day in the second seven well said he i will not be too urgent but the sooner you fix the better mr andrews we must leave something to these jephthahs daughters in these cases he was pleased to say i suppose the little bashful folly which in the happiest circumstances may give a kind of regret to quit the maiden state and an awkwardness at the entrance into a new one is a reason with pamela and so she shall name her day sir said he you are all goodness i went up soon after and new dressed myself taking possession in a happy moment i hope of my two bundles as my good master was pleased to call them alluding to my former division of those good things my lady and himself bestowed upon me and so put on fine linen silk shoes and fine white cotton stockings a fine quilted coat a delicate green mantea silk gown and coat a french necklace and a laced cambric handkerchief and clean gloves and taking my fan in my hand i like a little proud hussy looked in the glass and thought myself a gentlewoman once more but i forgot not to return due thanks for being able to put on this dress with so much comfort mrs jewkes would help to dress me and complimented me highly saying among other things that now i looked like a lady indeed and as she said the little chapel was ready and divine service would be read in it tomorrow she wished the happy knot might then be tied said she have you not seen the chapel madam since it has been cleaned out no said i but are we to have service in it tomorrow do you say i am glad of that for i have been a sad heathen lately sore against my will but who is to officiate somebody replied she mr peters will send you tell me very good news said i mrs jewkes i hope it will never be a lumberroom again ay said she i can tell you more good news for the two misses darnford and lady jones are to be here at the opening of it and will stay and dine with you my master said i has not told me that you must alter your style madam said she it must not be master now sure o returned i this is a language i shall never forget he shall always be my master and i shall think myself more and more his servant my poor father did not know i went up to dress myself and he said his heart misgave him when he saw me first for fear i was made a fool of and that here was some fine lady that was to be my masters true wife and he stood in admiration and said o my dear child how well will you become your happy condition why you look like a lady already i hope my dear father said i and boldly kissed him i shall always be your dutiful daughter whatever my condition be my master sent me word he was ready and when he saw me said dress as you will pamela youre a charming girl and so handed me to the coach and would make my father and me sit both on the foreside and sat backwards over against me and bid the coachman drive to the meadow that is where he once met mr williams the conversation was most agreeable to me and to my dear father as we went and he more and more exceeded in goodness and generosity and while i was gone up to dress he had presented my father with twenty guineas desiring him to buy himself and my mother such apparel as they should think proper and lay it all out but i knew not this till after we came home my father having had no opportunity to tell me of it he was pleased to inform me of the chapel being got in tolerable order and said it looked very well and against he came down next it should be all new whitewashed and painted and lined and a new pulpitcloth cushion desk etc and that it should always be kept in order for the future he told me the two misses darnford and lady jones would dine with him on sunday and with their servants and mine said he we shall make a tolerable congregation and added he have i not well contrived to shew you that the chapel is really a little house of god and has been consecrated before we solemnize our nuptials in it o sir replied i your goodness to me is inexpressible mr peters said he offered to come and officiate in it but would not stay to dine with me because he has company at his own house and so i intend that divine service shall be performed in it by one to whom i shall make some yearly allowance as a sort of chaplain you look serious pamela added he i know you think of your friend williams indeed sir said i if you wont be angry i did poor man i am sorry i have been the cause of his disobliging you when we came to the meadow where the gentry have their walk sometimes the coach stopt and my master alighted and led me to the brookside and it is a very pretty summer walk he asked my father if he chose to walk out or go on in the coach to the farther end he poor man chose to go on in the coach for fear he said any gentry should be walking there and he told me he was most of the way upon his knees in the coach thanking god for his gracious mercies and goodness and begging a blessing upon my good master and me i was quite astonished when we came into the shady walk to see mr williams there see there said my master theres poor williams taking his solitary walk again with his book and it seems it was so contrived for mr peters had been as i since find desired to tell him to be in that walk at such an hour in the morning so old acquaintance said my master again have i met you in this place what book are you now reading he said it was boileaus lutrin said my master you see i have brought with me my little fugitive that would have been while you are perfecting yourself in french i am trying to learn english and hope soon to be master of it mine sir said he is a very beautiful piece of french but your english has no equal you are very polite mr williams said my master and he that does not think as you do deserves no share in her why pamela added he very generously why so strange where you have once been so familiar i do assure you both that i mean not by this interview to insult mr williams or confound you then i said mr williams i am very glad to see you well and though the generous favour of my good master has happily changed the scene since you and i last saw one another i am nevertheless very glad of an opportunity to acknowledge with gratitude your good intentions not so much to serve me as me but as a person that then had great reason to believe herself in distress and i hope sir added i to my master your goodness will permit me to say this you pamela said he may make what acknowledgments you please to mr williamss good intentions and i would have you speak as you think but i do not apprehend myself to be quite so much obliged to those intentions sir said mr williams i beg leave to say i knew well that by education you was no libertine nor had i reason to think you so by inclination and when you came to reflect i hoped you would not be displeased with me and this was no small motive to me at first to do as i did ay but mr williams said my master could you think i should have had reason to thank you if loving one person above all her sex you had robbed me of her and married her yourself and then said he you are to consider that she was an old acquaintance of mine and a quite new one to you that i had sent her down to my own house for better securing her and that you who had access to my house could not effect your purpose without being guilty in some sort of a breach of the laws of hospitality and friendship as to my designs upon her i own they had not the best appearance but still i was not answerable to mr williams for those much less could you be excused to invade a property so very dear to me and to endeavour to gain an interest in her affections when you could not be certain that matters would not turn out as they have actually done i own said he that some parts of my conduct seem exceptionable as you state it but sir i am but a young man i meant no harm i had no interest i am sure to incur your displeasure and when you think of every thing and the inimitable graces of person and perfections of mind that adorn this excellent lady so he called me you will perhaps find your generosity allow something as an extenuation of a fault which your anger would not permit as an excuse i have done said my master nor did i meet you here to be angry with you pamela knew not that she should see you and now you are both present i would ask you mr williams if now you know my honourable designs towards this good girl you can really be almost i will not say quite as well pleased with the friendship of my wife as you could be with the favour of mrs andrews sir said he i will answer you truly i think i could have preferred with her any condition that could have befallen me had i considered only myself but sir i was very far from having any encouragement to expect her favour and i had much more reason to believe that if she could have hoped for your goodness her heart would have been too much preengaged to think of any body else and give me leave further to say sir that though i tell you sincerely my thoughts were i only to consider myself yet when i consider her good and her merit i should be highly ungenerous were it put to my choice if i could not wish her in a condition so much superior to what i could raise her to and so very answerable to her merit pamela said my master you are obliged to mr williams and ought to thank him he has distinguished well but as for me who had like to have lost you by his means i am glad the matter was not left to his choice mr williams added he i give you pamelas hand because i know it will be pleasing to her in token of her friendship and esteem for you and i give you mine that i will not be your enemy but yet i must say that i think i owe this proper manner of your thinking more to your disappointment than to the generosity you talk of mr williams kissed my hand as my master gave it him and my master said sir you will go home and dine with me and ill shew you my little chapel and do you pamela look upon yourself at liberty to number mr williams in the list of your friends how generous how noble was this mr williams and so had i had tears of pleasure in his eyes i was silent but mr williams said sir i shall be taught by your generosity to think myself inexcusably wrong in every step i took that could give you offence and my future life shall shew my respectful gratitude we walked on till we came to the coach where was my dear father pamela said my master tell mr williams who that good man is o mr williams said i it is my dear father and my master was pleased to say one of the honestest men in england pamela owes every thing that she is to be as well as her being to him for i think she would not have brought me to this nor made so great resistance but for the good lessons and religious education she had imbibed from him mr williams said taking fathers hand you see good mr andrews with inexpressible pleasure no doubt the fruits of your pious care and now are in a way with your beloved daughter to reap the happy effects of it i am overcome said my dear father with his honours goodness but i can only say i bless god and bless him mr williams and i being nearer the coach than my master and he offering to draw back to give way to him he kindly said pray mr williams oblige pamela with your hand and step in yourself he bowed and took my hand and my master made him step in and sit next me all that ever he could do and sat himself over against him next my father who sat against me and he said mr andrews i told you yesterday that the divine you saw was not mr williams i now tell you this gentleman is and though i have been telling him i think not myself obliged to his intentions yet i will own that pamela and you are and though i wont promise to love him i would have you sir said mr williams you have a way of overcoming that hardly all my reading affords an instance of and it is the more noble as it is on this side as i presume the happy ceremony which great as your fortune is will lay you under an obligation to so much virtue and beauty when the lady becomes yours for you will then have a treasure that princes might envy you said my generous master god bless him mr williams it is impossible that you and i should long live at variance when our sentiments agree so well together on subjects the most material i was quite confounded and my master seeing it took my hand and said look up my good girl and collect yourself dont injure mr williams and me so much as to think we are capping compliments as we used to do verses at school i dare answer for us both that we say not a syllable we dont think o sir said i how unequal am i to all this goodness every moment that passes adds to the weight of the obligations you oppress me with think not too much of that said he most generously mr williamss compliments to you have great advantage of mine for though equally sincere i have a great deal to say and to do to compensate the sufferings i have made you undergo and at last must sit down dissatisfied because those will never be balanced by all i can do for you he saw my dear father quite unable to support these affecting instances of his goodness and he let go my hand and took his and said seeing his tears i wonder not my dear pamelas father that your honest heart springs thus to your eyes to see all her trials at an end i will not pretend to say that i had formerly either power or will to act thus but since i began to resolve on the change you see i have reaped so much pleasure in it that my own interest will keep me steady for till within these few days i knew not what it was to be happy poor mr williams with tears of joy in his eyes said how happily sir have you been touched by the divine grace before you have been hurried into the commission of sins that the deepest penitence could hardly have atoned for god has enabled you to stop short of the evil and you have nothing to do but to rejoice in the good which now will be doubly so because you can receive it without the least inward reproach you do well said he to remind me that i owe all this to the grace of god i bless him for it and i thank this good man for his excellent lessons to his daughter i thank her for following them and i hope from her good example and your friendship mr williams in time to be half as good as my tutoress and that said he i believe youll own will make me without disparagement to any man the best foxhunter in england mr williams was going to speak and he said you put on so grave a look mr williams that i believe what i have said with you practical good folks is liable to exception but i see we are become quite grave and we must not be too serious neither what a happy creature my dear mother is your pamela o may my thankful heart and the good use i may be enabled to make of the blessings before me be a means to continue this delightful prospect to a long date for the sake of the dear good gentleman who thus becomes the happy instrument in the hand of providence to bless all he smiles upon to be sure i shall never enough acknowledge the value he is pleased to express for my unworthiness in that he has prevented my wishes and unasked sought the occasion of being reconciled to a good man who for my sake had incurred his displeasure and whose name he could not a few days before permit to pass through my lips but see the wonderful ways of providence the very things that i most dreaded his seeing or knowing the contents of my papers have as i hope satisfied all his scruples and been a means to promote my happiness henceforth let not us poor shortsighted mortals pretend to rely on our own wisdom or vainly think that we are absolutely to direct for ourselves i have abundant reason i am sure to say that when i was most disappointed i was nearer my happiness for had i made my escape which was so often my chief point in view and what i had placed my heart upon i had escaped the blessings now before me and fallen perhaps headlong into the miseries i would have avoided and yet after all it was necessary i should take the steps i did to bring on this wonderful turn o the unsearchable wisdom of god and how much ought i to adore the divine goodness and humble myself who am made a poor instrument as i hope not only to magnify his graciousness to this fine gentleman and myself but also to dispense benefits to others which god of his mercy grant in the agreeable manner i have mentioned did we pass the time in our second happy tour and i thought mrs jewkes would have sunk into the ground when she saw mr williams brought in the coach with us and treated so kindly we dined together in a most pleasant easy and frank manner and i found i need not from my masters generosity to be under any restraint as to my conduct to this good clergyman for he so often as he fancied i was reserved moved me to be free with him and to him and several times called upon me to help my father and mr williams and seemed to take great delight in seeing me carve as indeed he does in every thing i do after dinner we went and looked into the chapel which is a very pretty one and very decent and when finished as he designs it against his next coming down will be a very pretty place my heart my dear mother when i first set my foot in it throbbed a good deal with awful joy at the thoughts of the solemnity which i hope will in a few days be performed here and when i came up towards the little pretty altarpiece while they were looking at a communion picture and saying it was prettily done i gently stept into a corner out of sight and poured out my soul to god on my knees in supplication and thankfulness that after having been so long absent from divine service the first time i entered into a house dedicated to his honour should be with such blessed prospects before me and begging of god to continue me humble and to make me not unworthy of his mercies and that he would be pleased to bless the next author of my happiness my good master i heard my master say wheres pamela and so i broke off sooner than i would and went up to him he said mr williams i hope i have not so offended you by my conduct past for really it is what i ought to be ashamed of as that you will refuse to officiate and to give us your instructions here tomorrow mr peters was so kind for the first time to offer it but i knew it would be inconvenient for him and besides i was willing to make this request to you an introduction to our reconciliation sir said he most willingly and most gratefully will i obey you though if you expect a discourse i am wholly unprepared for the occasion i would not have it replied he pointed to any particular occasion but if you have one upon the text there is more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth than over ninetynine just persons that need no repentance and if it makes me not such a sad fellow as to be pointed at by mine and the ladies servants we shall have here i shall be well content tis a general subject added he makes me speak of that but any one you please will do for you cannot make a bad choice i am sure sir said he i have one upon that text but i am ready to think that a thanksgiving one which i made on a great mercy to myself if i may be permitted to make my own acknowledgments of your favour the subject of a discourse will be suitable to my grateful sentiments it is on the text now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace for mine eyes have seen thy salvation that text said i will be a very suitable one for me not so pamela said my master because i dont let you depart in peace but i hope you will stay here with content o but sir said i i have seen gods salvation i am sure added i if any body ever had reason i have to say with the blessed virgin my soul doth magnify the lord for he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden and exalted one of low degree said my good father i am sure if there were time for it the book of ruth would afford a fine subject for the honour done my dear child why good mr andrews said my master should you say so i know that story and mr williams will confirm what i say that my good girl here will confer at least as much honour as she will receive sir said i you are inexpressibly generous but i shall never think so why my pamela said he thats another thing it will be best for me to think you will and it will be kind in you to think you shant and then we shall always have an excellent rule to regulate our conduct by to one another was not this finely nobly wisely said my dear mother o what a blessed thing it is to be matched to a man of sense and generosity how edifying how but what shall i say i am at loss for words mr williams said when we came out of the little chapel he would go home and look over his discourses for one for the next day my master said i have one thing to say before you go when my jealousy on account of this good girl put me upon such a vindictive conduct to you you know i took a bond for the money i had caused you to be troubled for i really am ashamed of the matter because i never intended when i presented it to you to have it again you may be sure but i knew not what might happen between you and her nor how far matters might have gone between you and so i was willing to have that in awe over you and i think it is no extraordinary present therefore to give you up your bond again cancelled and so he took it from his pocket and gave it him i think added he all the charges attending it and the trouble you had were defrayed by my attorney i ordered that they should they were sir said he and ten thousand thanks to you for this goodness and the kind manner in which you do it if you will go mr williams said he shall my chariot carry you home no sir answered he i thank you my time will be so well employed all the way in thinking of your favours that i choose to meditate upon them as i walk home my dear father was a little uneasy about his habit for appearing at chapel next day because of misses darnford and the servants for fear poor man he should disgrace my master and he told me when he was mentioning this of my masters kind present of twenty guineas for clothes for you both which made my heart truly joyful but oh to be sure i can never deserve the hundredth part of his goodness it is almost a hard thing to be under the weight of such deep obligations on one side and such a sense of ones own unworthiness on the other o what a godlike power is that of doing good i envy the rich and the great for nothing else my master coming to us just then i said oh sir will your bounty know no limits my dear father has told me what you have given him a trifle pamela said he a little earnest only of my kindness say no more of it but did i not hear the good man expressing some sort of concern for somewhat hide nothing from me pamela only sir said i he knew not how to absent himself from divine service and yet is afraid of disgracing you by appearing fie mr andrews said he i thought you knew that the outward appearance was nothing i wish i had as good a habit inwardly as you have but ill tell you pamela your father is not so much thinner than i am nor much shorter he and i will walk up together to my wardrobe though it is not so well stored here as in bedfordshire and so said he pleasantly dont you pretend to come near us till i call for you for you must not yet see how men dress and undress themselves o sir said my father i beg to be excused i am sorry you were told so am not i said my master pray come along with me he carried him up stairs and shewed him several suits and would have had him take his choice my poor father was quite confounded for my master saw not any he thought too good and my father none that he thought bad enough and my good master at last he fixed his eye upon a fine drab which he thought looked the plainest would help him to try the coat and waistcoat on himself and indeed one would not have thought it because my master is taller and rather plumper as i thought but as i saw afterwards they fitted him very well and being plain and lined with the same colour and made for travelling in a coach pleased my poor father much he gave him the whole suit and calling up mrs jewkes said let these clothes be well aired against tomorrow morning mr andrews brought only with him his common apparel not thinking to stay sunday with us and pray see for some of my stockings and whether any of my shoes will fit him and see also for some of my linen for we have put the good man quite out of his course by keeping him sunday over he was then pleased to give him the silver buckles out of his own shoes so my good mother you must expect to see my dear father a great beau wig said my master he wants none for his own venerable white locks are better than all the perukes in england but i am sure i have hats enough somewhere ill take care of every thing sir said mrs jewkes and my poor father when he came to me could not refrain tears i know not how said he to comport myself under these great favours o my child it is all owing to the divine goodness and your virtue sunday this blessed day all the family seemed to take delight to equip themselves for the celebration of the sabbath in the little chapel and lady jones and mr williams came in her chariot and the two misses darnford in their own and we breakfasted together in a most agreeable manner my dear father appeared quite spruce and neat and was quite caressed by the three ladies as we were at breakfast my master told mr williams we must let the psalms alone he doubted for want of a clerk but mr williams said no nothing should be wanting that he could supply my father said if it might be permitted him he would as well as he was able perform that office for it was always what he had taken delight in and as i knew he had learnt psalmody formerly in his youth and had constantly practised it in private at home on sunday evenings as well as endeavoured to teach it in the little school he so unsuccessfully set up at the beginning of his misfortunes before he took to hard labour i was in no pain for his undertaking it in this little congregation they seemed much pleased with this and so we went to chapel and made a pretty tolerable appearance mrs jewkes and all the servants attending but the cook and i never saw divine service performed with more solemnity nor assisted at with greater devotion and decency my master lady jones and the two misses setting a lovely example my good father performed his part with great applause making the responses as if he had been a practised parishclerk and giving the xxiiid psalm the lord is only my support and he that doth me feed how can i then lack any thing whereof i stand in need in pastures green he feedeth me where i do safely lie and after leads me to the streams which run most pleasantly and when i find myself near lost then home he doth me take conducting me in his right paths een for his own names sake and tho i were een at deaths door yet would i fear no ill for both thy rod and shepherds crook afford me comfort still thou hast my table richly spread in presence of my foe thou hast my head with balm refreshd my cup doth overflow and finally while breath doth last thy grace shall me defend and in the house of god will i my life for ever spend which consisted of but three staves we had it all and he read the line and began the tune with a heart so entirely affected with the duty that he went through it distinctly calmly and fervently at the same time so that lady jones whispered me that good man were fit for all companies and present to every laudable occasion and miss darnford said god bless the dear good man you must think how i rejoiced in my mind i know my dear mother you can say most of the shortest psalms by heart so i need not transcribe it especially as your chief treasure is a bible and a worthy treasure it is i know nobody makes more or better use of it mr williams gave us an excellent discourse on liberality and generosity and the blessings attending the right use of riches from the xith chapter of proverbs ver there is that scattereth and yet increaseth and there is that withholdeth more than is meet but it tendeth to poverty the liberal soul shall be made fat and he that watereth shall be watered also himself and he treated the subject in so handsome a manner that my masters delicacy who at first was afraid of some personal compliments was not offended mr williams judiciously keeping to generals and it was an elegant and sensible discourse as my master said my father was in the clerks place just under the desk and lady jones by her footman whispered him to favour us with another psalm when the sermon was ended he thinking as he said afterwards that the former was rather of the longest chose the shortest in the book which you know is the cxviith o all ye nations of the world praise ye the lord always and all ye people every where set forth his noble praise for great his kindness is to us his truth doth not decay wherefore praise ye the lord our god praise ye the lord alway my master thanked mr williams for his excellent discourse and so did the ladies as also did i most heartily and he was pleased to take my dear father by the hand as did also mr williams and thanked him the ladies likewise made him their compliments and the servants all looked upon him with countenances of respect and pleasure at dinner do what i could i was forced to take the upper end of the table and my master sat at the lower end between mr williams and my father and he said pamela you are so dexterous that i think you may help the ladies yourself and i will help my two good friends i should have told you though that i dressed myself in a flowered satin that was my ladys and looked quite fresh and good and which was given me at first by my master and the ladies who had not seen me out of my homespun before made me abundance of fine compliments as soon as they saw me first talking of the psalms just after dinner my master was very naughty if i may so say for he said to my father mr andrews i think in the afternoon as we shall have only prayers we may have one longer psalm and what think you of the cxxxviith o good sir said i pray pray not a word more say what you will pamela said he you shall sing it to us according to your on version before these good ladies go away my father smiled but was half concerned for me and said will it bear and please your honour o ay said he never fear it so long as mrs jewkes is not in the hearing this excited all the ladies curiosity and lady jones said she would be loath to desire to hear any thing that would give me concern but should be glad i would give leave for it indeed madam said i i must beg you wont insist upon it i cannot bear it you shall see it indeed ladies said my master and pray pamela not always as you please neither then pray sir said i not in my hearing i hope sure pamela returned he you would not write what is not fit to be heard but sir said i there are particular cases times and occasions that may make a thing passable at one time that would not be tolerable at another o said he let me judge of that as well as you pamela these ladies know a good part of your story and let me tell you what they know is more to your credit than mine so that if i have no averseness to reviving the occasion you may very well bear it said he i will put you out of your pain pamela here it is and took it out of his pocket i stood up and said indeed sir i cant bear it i hope youll allow me to leave the room a minute if you will read it indeed but i wont answered he lady jones said pray good sir dont let us hear it if mrs andrews be so unwilling well pamela said my master i will put it to your choice whether i shall read it now or you will sing it by and by thats very hard sir said i it must be one i assure you said he why then sir replied i you must do as you please for i cannot sing it well then said my master i find i must read it and yet added he after all i had as well let it alone for it is no great reputation to myself o then said miss darnford pray let us hear it to choose why then proceeded he the case was this pamela i find when she was in the time of her confinement that is added he when she was taken prisoner in order to make me one for that is the upshot of the matter in the journal she kept which was intended for nobodys perusal but her parents tells them that she was importuned one sunday by mrs jewkes to sing a psalm but her spirits not permitting she declined it but after mrs jewkes was gone down she says she recollected that the cxxxviith psalm was applicable to her own case mrs jewkes having often on other days in vain besought her to sing a song that thereupon she turned it more to her own supposed case and believing mrs jewkes had a design against her honour and looking upon her as her gaoler she thus gives her version of this psalm but pray mr williams do you read one verse of the common translation and i will read one of pamelas then mr williams pulling out his little pocket commonprayerbook read the first two stanzas i when we did sit in babylon the rivers round about then in remembrance of sion the tears for grief burst out ii we hangd our harps and instruments the willow trees upon for in that place men for that use had planted many a one my master then read i when sad i sat in bnhall all guarded round about and thought of evry absent friend the tears for grief burst out ii my joys and hopes all overthrown my heartstrings almost broke unfit my mind for melody much more to bear a joke the ladies said it was very pretty and miss darnford that somebody else had more need to be concerned than the versifier i knew said my master i should get no credit by shewing this but let us read on mr williams so mr williams read iii then they to whom we prisners were said to us tauntingly now let us hear your hebrew songs and pleasant melody now this said my master is very near and read iii then she to whom i prisoner was said to me tauntingly now cheer your heart and sing a song and tune your mind to joy mighty sweet said mr williams but let us see how the next verse is turned it is this iv alas said we who can once frame his heavy heart to sing the praises of our living god thus under a strange king why said my master it is turned with beautiful simplicity thus iv alas said i how can i frame my heavy heart to sing or tune my mind while thus enthralld by such a wicked thing very pretty said mr williams lady jones said o dear madam could you wish that we should be deprived of this new instance of your genius and accomplishments o said my dear father you will make my good child proud no said my master very generously pamela cant be proud for no one is proud to hear themselves praised but those who are not used to it but proceed mr williams he read v but yet if i jerusalem out of my heart let slide then let my fingers quite forget the warbling harp to guide well now said my master for pamelas version v but yet if from my innocence i evn in thought should slide then let my fingers quite forget the sweet spinnet to guide mr williams read vi and let my tongue within my mouth be tyd for ever fast if i rejoice before i see thy full delivrance past this also said my master is very near vi and let my tongue within my mouth be lockd for ever fast if i rejoice before i see my full delivrance past now good sir said i oblige me dont read any further pray dont o pray madam said mr williams let me beg to have the rest read for i long to know whom you make the sons of edom and how you turn the psalmists execrations against the insulting babylonians well mr williams replied i you should not have said so o said my master that is one of the best things of all poor mrs jewkes stands for edoms sons and we must not lose this because i think it one of my pamelas excellencies that though thus oppressed she prays for no harm upon the oppressor read mr williams the next stanza so he read vii therefore o lord remember now the cursed noise and cry that edoms sons against us made when they rasd our city viii remember lord their cruel words when with a mighty sound they cried down yea down with it unto the very ground well said my master here seems in what i am going to read a little bit of a curse indeed but i think it makes no ill figure in the comparison vii and thou almighty recompense the evils i endure from those who seek my sad disgrace so causeless to procure and now said he for edoms sons though a little severe in the imputation viii remember lord this mrs jewkes when with a mighty sound she cries down with her chastity down to the very ground sure sir said i this might have been spared but the ladies and mr williams said no by no means and i see the poor wicked woman has no favourers among them now said my master read the psalmists heavy curses and mr williams read ix evn so shalt thou o babylon at length to dust be brought and happy shall that man be calld that our revenge hath wrought x yea blessed shall the man be calld that takes thy little ones and dasheth them in pieces small against the very stones thus he said very kindly has my pamela turned these lines ix evn so shalt thou o wicked one at length to shame be brought and happy shall all those be calld that my delivrance wrought x yea blessed shall the man be calld that shames thee of thy evil and saves me from thy vile attempts and thee too from the d l i fancy this blessed man said my master smiling was at that time hoped to be you mr williams if the truth was known sir said he whoever it was intended for then it can be nobody but your good self now i could hardly hold up my head for the praises the kind ladies were pleased to heap upon me i am sure by this they are very partial in my favour all because my master is so good to me and loves to hear me praised for i see no such excellence in these lines as they would make me believe besides what is borrowed from the psalmist we all as before and the cookmaid too attended the prayers of the church in the afternoon and my dear father concluded with the following stanzas of the cxlvth psalm suitably magnifying the holy name of god for all mercies but did not observe altogether the method in which they stand which was the less necessary he thought as he gave out the lines the lord is just in all his ways his works are holy all and he is near all those that do in truth upon him call he the desires of all them that fear him will fulfil and he will hear them when they cry and save them all he will the eyes of all do wait on thee thou dost them all relieve and thou to each sufficient food in season due dost give thou openest thy plenteous hand and bounteously dost fill all things whatever that do live with gifts of thy good will my thankful mouth shall gladly speak the praises of the lord all flesh to praise his holy name for ever shall accord we walked in the garden till tea was ready and as he went by the back door my master said to me of all the flowers in the garden the sun flower is the fairest o sir said i let that be now forgot mr williams heard him say so and seemed a little out of countenance whereupon my master said i mean not to make you serious mr williams but we see how strangely things are brought about i see other scenes hereabouts that in my pamelas dangers give me more cause of concern than any thing you ever did should give you sir said he you are very generous my master and mr williams afterwards walked together for a quarter of an hour and talked about general things and some scholastic subjects and joined us very well pleased with one anothers conversation lady jones said putting herself on one side of me as my master was on the other but pray sir when is the happy time to be we want it over that we may have you with us as long afterwards as you can said my master i would have it tomorrow or next day at farthest if pamela will for i have sent for a license and the messenger will be here to night or early in the morning i hope but added he pray pamela do not take beyond thursday she was pleased to say sure it will not be delayed by you madam more than needs well said he now you are on my side i will leave you with her to settle it and i hope she will not let little bashful niceties be important with her and so he joined the two misses lady jones told me i was to blame she would take upon her to say if i delayed it a moment because she understood lady davers was very uneasy at the prospect that it would be so and if any thing should happen it would be a sad thing madam said i when he was pleased to mention it to me first he said it should be in fourteen days and afterwards asked me if i would have it in the first or the second seven i answered for how could i do otherwise in the second he desired it might not be the last day of the second seven now madam said i as he was then pleased to speak his mind no doubt i would not for any thing seem too forward well but said she as he now urges you in so genteel and gentlemanly a manner for a shorter day i think if i was in your place i would agree to it she saw me hesitate and blush and said well you know best but i say only what i would do i said i would consider of it and if i saw he was very earnest to be sure i should think i ought to oblige him misses darnford were begging to be at the wedding and to have a ball and they said pray mrs andrews second our requests and we shall be greatly obliged to you indeed ladies said i i cannot promise that if i might why so said they because answered i i know not what but i think one may with pleasure celebrate an anniversary of ones nuptials but the day itself indeed ladies i think it is too solemn a business for the parties of our sex to be very gay upon it is a quite serious and awful affair and i am sure in your own cases you would be of my mind why then said miss darnford the more need one has to be as lighthearted and merry as one can i told you said my master what sort of an answer youd have from pamela the younger miss said she never heard of such grave folks in her life on such an occasion why sir said she i hope youll sing psalms all day and miss will fast and pray such sackcloth and ashes doings for a wedding did i never hear of she spoke a little spitefully i thought and i returned no answer i shall have enough to do i reckon in a while if i am to answer every one that will envy me we went in to tea and all that the ladies could prevail upon my master for was a dancing match before he left this county but miss darnford said it should then be at their house for truly if she might not be at the wedding she would be affronted and come no more hither till we had been there when they were gone my master would have had my father stay till the affair was over but he begged he might set out as soon as it was light in the morning for he said my mother would be doubly uneasy at his stay and he burned with impatience to let her know all the happy things that had befallen her daughter when my master found him so desirous to go he called mr thomas and ordered him to get a particular bay horse ready betimes in the morning for my father and a portmanteau to put his things in and to attend him a days journey and if said he mr andrews chooses it see him safe to his own home and added he since that horse will serve you mr andrews to ride backwards and forwards to see us when we go into bedfordshire i make you a present of it with the accoutrements and seeing my father going to speak he added i wont be said nay o how good was this he also said a great many kind things at suppertime and gave him all the papers he had of mine but desired when he and my mother had read them that he would return them to him again and then he said so affectionate a father and daughter may perhaps be glad to be alone together therefore remember me to your good wife and tell her it will not be long i hope before i see you together on a visit to your daughter at my other house and so i wish you good night and a good journey if you go before i see you and then he shook hands and left my dear father almost unable to speak through the sense of his favours and goodness you may believe my dear mother how loath i was to part with my good father and he was also unwilling to part with me but he was so impatient to see you and tell you the blessed tidings with which his heart overflowed that i could hardly wish to detain him mrs jewkes brought two bottles of cherrybrandy and two of cinnamon water and some cake and they were put up in the portmanteau with my fathers newly presented clothes for he said he would not for any thing be seen in them in his neighbourhood till i was actually known by every body to be married nor would he lay out any part of the twenty guineas till then neither for fear of reflections and then he would consult me as to what he would buy well said i as you please my dear father and i hope now we shall often have the pleasure of hearing from one another without needing any art or contrivances he said he would go to bed betimes that he might be up as soon as it was light and so he took leave of me and said he would not love me if i got up in the morning to see him go which would but make us both loath to part and grieve us both all day mr thomas brought him a pair of boots and told him he would call him up at peep of day and put up every thing over night and so i received his blessing and his prayers and his kind promises of procuring the same from you my dear mother and went up to my closet with a heavy heart and yet a halfpleased one if i may so say for that as he must go he was going to the best of wives and with the best of tidings but i begged he would not work so hard as he had done for i was sure my master would not have given him twenty guineas for clothes if he had not designed to do something else for him and that he should be the less concerned at receiving benefits from my good master because he who had so many persons to employ in his large possessions could make him serviceable to a degree equivalent without hurting any body else he promised me fair and pray dear mother see he performs i hope my master will not see this for i will not send it you at present till i can send you the best of news and the rather as my dear father can supply the greatest part of what i have written since the papers he carries you by his own observation so good night my dear mother and god send my father a safe journey and a happy meeting to you both monday mr colbrand being returned my master came up to me to my closet and brought me the license o how my heart fluttered at the sight of it now pamela said he tell me if you can oblige me with the day your word is all thats wanting i made bold to kiss his dear hand and though unable to look up said i know not what to say sir to all your goodness i would not for any consideration that you should believe me capable of receiving negligently an honour that all the duty of a long life were it to be lent me will not be sufficient to enable me to be grateful for i ought to resign myself in every thing i may or can implicitly to your will but but what said he with a kind impatience why sir said i when from last thursday you mentioned four days i had reason to think that term your choice and my heart is so wholly yours that i am afraid of nothing but that i may be forwarder than you wish impossible my dear creature said he and folded me in his arms impossible if this be all it shall be set about this moment and this happy day shall make you mine ill send away instantly said the dear gentleman and was going i said no pray sir pray sir hear me indeed it cannot be today cannot said he no indeed sir said i and was ready to sink to see his generous impatience why flattered you then my fond heart replied he with the hope that it might sir said i i will tell you what i had thought if youll vouchsafe me your attention do then said he i have sir proceeded i a great desire that whenever the day is it may be on a thursday on a thursday my dear father and mother were married and though poor they are a very happy pair on a thursday your poor pamela was born on a thursday my dear good lady took me from my parents into her protection on a thursday sir you caused me to be carried away to this place to which i now by gods goodness and your favour owe so amazingly all my present prospects and on a thursday it was you named to me that fourteen days from that you would confirm my happiness now sir if you please to indulge my superstitious folly you will greatly oblige me i was sorry sir for this reason when you bid me not defer till the last day of the fourteen that thursday in next week was that last day this pamela is a little superstitious i must needs say and i think you should begin now to make another day in the week a happy one as for example on a monday may you say my father and mother concluded to be married on the thursday following on a monday so many years ago my mother was preparing all her matters to be brought to bed on the thursday following on a monday several weeks ago it was that you had but two days more to stay till you was carried away on thursday on a monday i myself said he well remember it was that i wrote you the letter that prevailed on you so kindly to return to me and on the same day you did return to my house here which i hope my girl will be as propitious an era as any you have named and now lastly will you say which will crown the work and on a monday i was married come come my dear added he thursday has reigned long enough oconscience let us now set monday in its place or at least on an equality with it since you see it has a very good title and as we now stand in the week before us claims priority and then i hope we shall make tuesday wednesday friday saturday and sunday as happy days as monday and thursday and so by gods blessing move round as the days move in a delightful circle till we are at a loss what day to prefer to the rest o how charmingly was this said and how sweetly kind indeed sir said i you rally my folly very agreeably but dont let a little matter stand in the way when you are so generously obliging in a greater indeed i like thursday best if i may choose well then said he if you can say you have a better reason than this i will oblige you else ill send away for the parson this moment and so i protest he was going dear sirs how i trembled stay stay sir said i we have a great deal to say first i have a deal of silly prate to trouble you with well say then in a minute replied he the most material for all we have to say may be talked of while the parson is coming o but indeed and indeed said i it cannot be today well then shall it be tomorrow said he why sir if it must not be on a thursday you have given so many pleasant distinctions for a monday that let it then be next monday what a week still said he sir answered i if you please for that will be as you enjoined within the second seven days why girl said he twill be seven months till next monday let it said he if not tomorrow be on wednesday i protest i will stay no longer then sir returned i please to defer it however for one day more and it will be my beloved thursday if i consent to defer it till then may i hope my pamela said he that next thursday shall certainly be the happy day yes sir said i and i am sure i looked very foolishly and yet my dear father and mother why should i with such a fine gentleman and whom i so dearly love and so much to my honour too but there is something greatly awful upon my mind in the solemn circumstance and a change of condition never to be recalled though all the prospects are so desirable and i can but wonder at the thoughtless precipitancy with which most young folks run into this important change of life so now my dear parents have i been brought to fix so near a day as next thursday and this is monday o dear it makes one out of breath almost to think of it this though was a great cut off a whole week out of ten days i hope i am not too forward im sure if it obliges my dear master i am justified for he deserves of me all things in my poor power after this he rode out on horseback attended by abraham and did not return till night how by degrees things steal upon one i thought even this small absence tedious and the more as we expected him home to dinner i wish i may not be too fond and make him indifferent but yet my dear father and mother you were always fond of one another and never indifferent let the world run as it would when he returned he said he had had a pleasant ride and was led out to a greater distance than he intended at supper he told me that he had a great mind mr williams should marry us because he said it would shew a thorough reconciliation on his part but said he most generously i am apprehensive from what passed between you that the poor man will take it hardly and as a sort of insult which i am not capable of what says my girl do you think he would i hope not sir said i as to what he may think i cant answer but as to any reason for his thoughts i can for indeed sir said i you have been already so generous that he cannot i think mistake your goodness he then spoke with some resentment of lady daverss behaviour and i asked if any thing new had occurred yes said he i have had a letter delivered me from her impertinent husband professedly at her instigation that amounted to little less than a piece of insolent bravery on supposing i was about to marry you i was so provoked added he that after i had read it i tore it in a hundred pieces and scattered them in the air and bid the man who brought it let his master know what i had done with his letter and so would not permit him to speak to me as he would fain have done i think the fellow talked somewhat of his lady coming hither but she shall not set her foot within my doors and i suppose this treatment will hinder her i was much concerned at this and he said had i a hundred sisters pamela their opposition should have no weight with me and i did not intend you should know it but you cant but expect a little difficulty from the pride of my sister who have suffered so much from that of her brother and we are too nearly allied in mind as well as blood i find but this is not her business and if she would have made it so she should have done it with more decency little occasion had she to boast of her birth that knows not what belongs to good manners i said i am very sorry sir to be the unhappy occasion of a misunderstanding between so good a brother and so worthy a sister dont say so pamela because this is an unavoidable consequence of the happy prospect before us only bear it well yourself because she is my sister and leave it to me to make her sensible of her own rashness if sir said i the most lowly behaviour and humble deportment and in every thing shewing a dutiful regard to good lady davers will have any weight with her ladyship assure yourself of all in my power to mollify her no pamela returned he dont imagine when you are my wife i will suffer you to do any thing unworthy of that character i know the duty of a husband and will protect your gentleness to the utmost as much as if you were a princess by descent you are inexpressibly good sir said i but i am far from taking a gentle disposition to shew a meanness of spirit and this is a trial i ought to expect and well i may bear it that have so many benefits to set against it which all spring from the same cause well said he all the matter shall be this we will talk of our marriage as a thing to be done next week i find i have spies upon me wherever i go and whatever i do but now i am on so laudable a pursuit that i value them not nor those who employ them i have already ordered my servants to have no conference with any body for ten or twelve days to come and mrs jewkes tells me every one names thursday come sennight for our nuptials so i will get mr peters who wants to see my little chapel to assist mr williams under the notion of breakfasting with me next thursday morning since you wont have it sooner and there will nobody else be wanting and i will beg of mr peters to keep it private even from his own family for a few days has my girl any objection o sir answered i you are so generous in all your ways i can have no objections but i hope lady davers and you will not proceed to irreconcilable lengths and when her ladyship comes to see you and to tarry with you two or three weeks as she used to do i will keep close up so as not to disgust her with the sight of me well pamela said he we will talk of that afterwards you must do then as i shall think fit and i shall be able to judge what both you and i ought to do but what still aggravates the matter is that she should instigate the titled ape her husband to write to me after she had so little succeeded herself i wish i had kept his letter that i might have shewn you how a man that generally acts like a fool can take upon him to write like a lord but i suppose it is of my sisters penning and he poor man is the humble copier tuesday mr thomas is returned from you my dear father with the good news of your health and your proceeding in your journey to my dear mother where i hope to hear soon you are arrived my master has just now been making me play upon the spinnet and sing to it and was pleased to commend me for both but he does so for every thing i do so partial does his goodness make him to me one oclock we are just returned from an airing in the chariot and i have been delighted with his conversation upon english authors poets particularly he entertained me also with a description of some of the curiosities he had seen in italy and france when he made what the polite world call the grand tour he said he wanted to be at his other seat for he knew not well how to employ himself here having not proposed to stay half the time and when i get there pamela said he you will hardly be troubled with so much of my company after we have settled for i have a great many things to adjust and i must go to london for i have accounts that have run on longer than ordinary with my banker there and i dont know added he but the ensuing winter i may give you a little taste of the diversions of the town for a month or so i said his will and pleasure should determine mine and i never would as near as i could have a desire after those or any other entertainments that were not in his own choice he was pleased to say i make no doubt but that i shall be very happy in you and hope you will be so in me for said he i have no very enormous vices to gratify though i pretend not to the greatest purity neither my girl sir said i if you can account to your own mind i shall always be easy in whatever you do but our greatest happiness here sir continued i is of very short duration and this life at the longest is a poor transitory one and i hope we shall be so happy as to be enabled to look forward with comfort to another where our pleasures will be everlasting you say well pamela and i shall by degrees be more habituated to this way of thinking as i more and more converse with you but at present you must not be over serious with me all at once though i charge you never forbear to mingle your sweet divinity in our conversation whenever it can be brought in a propos and with such a cheerfulness of temper as shall not throw a gloomy cloud over our innocent enjoyments i was abashed at this and silent fearing i had offended but he said if you attend rightly to what i said i need not tell you again pamela not to be discouraged from suggesting to me on every proper occasion the pious impulses of your own amiable mind sir said i you will be always indulgent i make no doubt to my imperfections so long as i mean well my master made me dine with him and would eat nothing but what i helped him to and my heart is every hour more and more enlarged with his goodness and condescension but still what ails me i wonder a strange sort of weight hangs upon my mind as thursday draws on which makes me often sigh involuntarily and damps at times the pleasures of my delightful prospects i hope this is not ominous but only the foolish weakness of an overthoughtful mind on an occasion the most solemn and important of ones life next to the last scene which shuts up all i could be very serious but i will commit all my ways to that blessed providence which hitherto has so wonderfully conducted me through real evils to this hopeful situation i only fear and surely i have great reason that i shall be too unworthy to hold the affections of so dear a gentleman god teach me humility and to know my own demerit and this will be next to his grace my surest guard in the state of life to which though most unworthy i am going to be exalted and dont cease your prayers for me my dear parents for perhaps this new condition may be subject to still worse hazards than those i have escaped as would be the case were conceitedness vanity and pride to take hold of my frail heart and if i was for my sins to be left to my own conduct a frail bark in a tempestuous ocean without ballast or other pilot than my own inconsiderate will but my master said on another occasion that those who doubted most always erred least and i hope i shall always doubt my own strength my own worthiness i will not trouble you with twenty sweet agreeable things that passed in conversation with my excellent benefactor nor with the civilities of m colbrand mrs jewkes and all the servants who seem to be highly pleased with me and with my conduct to them and as my master hitherto finds no fault that i go too low nor they that i carry it too high i hope i shall continue to have every bodys goodwill but yet will i not seek to gain any ones by little meannesses or debasements but aim at an uniform and regular conduct willing to conceal involuntary errors as i would have my own forgiven and not too industrious to discover real ones or to hide such if any such should appear as might encourage bad hearts or unclean hands in material cases where my master should receive damage or where the morals of the transgressors should appear wilfully and habitually corrupt in short i will endeavour as much as i can that good servants shall find in me a kind encourager indifferent ones be made better by inspiring them with a laudable emulation and bad ones if not too bad in nature and quite irreclaimable reformed by kindness expostulation and even proper menaces if necessary but most by a good example all this if god pleases wednesday now my dear parents i have but this one day between me and the most solemn rite that can be performed my heart cannot yet shake off this heavy weight sure i am ungrateful to the divine goodness and the favour of the best of benefactors yet i hope i am not for at times my mind is all exultation with the prospect of what good tomorrows happy solemnity may possibly by the leave of my generous master put it in my power to do o how shall i find words to express as i ought my thankfulness for all the mercies before me wednesday evening my dear master is all love and tenderness he sees my weakness and generously pities and comforts me i begged to be excused supper but he brought me down himself from my closet and placed me by him bidding abraham not wait i could not eat and yet i tried for fear he should be angry he kindly forbore to hint any thing of the dreadful yet delightful tomorrow and put now and then a little bit on my plate and guided it to my mouth i was concerned to receive his goodness with so ill a grace well said he if you wont eat with me drink at least with me i drank two glasses by his overpersuasions and said i am really ashamed of myself why indeed said he my dear girl i am not a very dreadful enemy i hope i cannot bear any thing that is the least concerning to you oh sir said i all is owing to the sense i have of my own unworthiness to be sure it cannot be any thing else he rung for the things to be taken away and then reached a chair and sat down by me and put his kind arms about me and said the most generous and affecting things that ever dropt from the honeyflowing mouth of love all i have not time to repeat some i will and oh indulge your foolish daughter who troubles you with her weak nonsense because what she has to say is so affecting to her and because if she went to bed instead of scribbling she could not sleep this sweet confusion and thoughtfulness in my beloved pamela said the kind man on the near approach of our happy union when i hope all doubts are cleared up and nothing of dishonour is apprehended shew me most abundantly what a wretch i was to attempt such purity with a worse intention no wonder that one so virtuous should find herself deserted of life itself on a violence so dreadful to her honour and seek a refuge in the shadow of death but now my dearest pamela that you have seen a purity on my side as nearly imitating your own as our sex can shew to yours and since i have all the day long suppressed even the least intimation of the coming days that i might not alarm your tender mind why all this concern why all this affecting yet sweet confusion you have a generous friend my dear girl in me a protector now not a violator of your innocence why then once more i ask this strange perplexity this sweet confusion o sir said i and hid my face on his arm expect not reason from a foolish creature you should have still indulged me in my closet i am ready to beat myself for this ungrateful return to your goodness but i know not what i am to be sure a silly creature o had you but suffered me to stay by myself above i should have made myself ashamed of so culpable a behaviour but goodness added to goodness every moment and the sense of my own unworthiness quite overcome my spirits now said the generous man will i though reluctantly make a proposal to my sweet girl if i have been too pressing for the day if another day will still be more obliging if you have fears you will not then have you shall say but the word and ill submit yes my pamela for though i have these three days past thought every tedious hour a day till thursday comes if you earnestly desire it i will postpone it say my dear girl freely say but accept not my proposal without great reason which yet i will not ask for sir said i i can expect nothing but superlative goodness i have been so long used to it from you this is a most generous instance of it but i fear yes i fear it will be too much the same thing some days hence when the happy yet fool that i am dreaded time shall be equally near kind lovely charmer said he now do i see you are to be trusted with power from the generous use you make of it not one offensive word or look from me shall wound your nicest thoughts but pray try to subdue this overscrupulousness and unseasonable timidity i persuade myself you will if you can indeed sir i will said i for i am quite ashamed of myself with all these lovely views before me the honours you do me the kindness you shew me i cannot forgive myself for oh if i know the least of this idle foolish heart of mine it has not a misgiving thought of your goodness and i should abhor it if it were capable of the least affectation but dear good sir leave me a little to myself and i will take myself to a severer task than your goodness will let you do and i will present my heart before you a worthier offering to you than at present its wayward follies will let it seem to be but one thing is one has no kind friend of ones own sex to communicate ones foolish thoughts to and to be strengthened by their comfortings but i am left to myself and oh what a weak silly thing i am he kindly withdrew to give me time to recollect myself and in about half an hour returned and then that he might not begin at once upon the subject and say at the same time something agreeable to me said your father and mother have had a great deal of talk by this time about you pamela o sir returned i your goodness has made them quite happy but i cant help being concerned about lady davers he said i am vexed i did not hear the footman out because it runs in my head he talked somewhat about her coming hither she will meet with but an indifferent reception from me unless she comes resolved to behave better than she writes pray sir said i be pleased to bear with my good lady for two reasons what are they said he why first sir answered i because she is your sister and to be sure may very well think what all the world will that you have much undervalued yourself in making me happy and next because if her ladyship finds you out of temper with her it will still aggravate her more against me and every time that any warm words you may have between you come into her mind she will disdain me more dont concern yourself about it said he for we have more proud ladies than she in our other neighbourhood who perhaps have still less reason to be punctilious about their descent and yet will form themselves upon her example and say why his own sister will not forgive him nor visit him and so if i can subdue her spirit which is more than her husband ever could or indeed any body else it is a great point gained and if she gives me reason ill try for it i assure you well but my dear girl continued he since the subject is so important may i not say one word about tomorrow sir said i i hope i shall be less a fool i have talked as harshly to my heart as lady davers can do and the naughty thing suggests to me a better and more grateful behaviour he smiled and kissing me said i took notice pamela of what you observed that you have none of your own sex with you i think it is a little hard upon you and i should have liked you should have had miss darnford but then her sister must have been asked and i might as well make a public wedding which you know would have required clothes and other preparations besides added he a foolish proposal was once made me of that second sister who has two or three thousand pounds more than the other left her by a godmother and she cant help being a little piqued though said he it was a proposal they could not expect should succeed for there is nothing in her person nor mind and her fortune as that must have been the only inducement would not do by any means and so i discouraged it at once i am thinking sir said i of another mortifying thing too that were you to marry a lady of birth and fortune answerable to your own all the eve to the day would be taken up in reading signing and sealing of settlements and portion and such like but now the poor pamela brings you nothing at all and the very clothes she wears so very low is she are entirely the effects of your bounty and that of your good mother this makes me a little sad for alas sir i am so much oppressed by your favours and the sense of the obligations i lie under that i cannot look up with the confidence that i otherwise should on this awful occasion there is my dear pamela said he where the power is wanting as much generosity in the will as in the action to all that know your story and your merit it will appear that i cannot recompense you for what i have made you suffer you have had too many hard struggles and exercises and have nobly overcome and who shall grudge you the reward of the hardbought victory this affair is so much the act of my own will that i glory in being capable of distinguishing so much excellence and my fortune is the more pleasurable to me as it gives me hope that i may make you some part of satisfaction for what you have undergone this sir said i is all goodness unmerited on my side and makes my obligations the greater i can only wish for more worthiness but how poor is it to offer nothing but words for such generous deeds and to say i wish for what is a wish but the acknowledged want of power to oblige and a demonstration of ones poverty in every thing but will and that my dear girl said he is every thing tis all i want tis all that heaven itself requires of us but no more of these little doubts though they are the natural impulses of a generous and grateful heart i want not to be employed in settlements those are for such to regard who make convenience and fortune the prime considerations i have possessions ample enough for us both and you deserve to share them with me and you shall do it with as little reserve as if you had brought me what the world reckons an equivalent for as to my own opinion you bring me what is infinitely more valuable an experienced truth a welltried virtue and a wit and behaviour more than equal to the station you will be placed in to say nothing of this sweet person that itself might captivate a monarch and of the meekness of temper and sweetness of disposition which make you superior to all the women i ever saw thus kind and soothing and honourably affectionate was the dear gentleman to the unworthy doubting yet assured pamela and thus patiently did he indulge and generously pardon my impertinent weakness he offered to go himself to lady jones in the morning and reveal the matter to her and desire her secrecy and presence but i said that would disoblige the young ladies darnford no sir said i i will cast myself upon your generous kindness for why should i fear the kind protector of my weakness and the guide and director of my future steps you cannot said he forgive mrs jewkes for she must know it and suffer her to be with you yes sir said i i can she is very civil to me now and her former wickedness i will forgive for the sake of the happy fruits that have attended it and because you mention her well said he i will call her in if you please as you please sir said i and he rung for her and when she came in he said mrs jewkes i am going to entrust you with a secret sir answered she i will be sure to keep it as such why said he we intend tomorrow privately as possible for our weddingday and mr peters and mr williams are to be here as to breakfast with me and to shew mr peters my little chapel as soon as the ceremony is over we will take a little airing in the chariot as we have done at other times and so it will not be wondered that we are dressed and the two parsons have promised secrecy and will go home i believe you cant well avoid letting one of the maids into the secret but that ill leave to you sir replied she we all concluded it would be in a few days and i doubt it wont be long a secret no said he i dont desire it should but you know we are not provided for a public wedding and i shall declare it when we go to bedfordshire which wont be long but the men who lie in the outhouses need not know it for by some means or other my sister davers knows all that passes do you know sir said she that her ladyship intends to be down here with you in a few days her servant told me so who brought you the letter you were angry at i hope said he we shall be set out for tother house first and shall be pleased she loses her labour sir continued she her ladyship proposes to be here time enough to hinder your nuptials which she takes as we did will be the latter end of next week well said he let her come but yet i desire not to see her mrs jewkes said to me give me leave madam to wish you all manner of happiness but i am afraid i have too well obeyed his honour to be forgiven by you indeed mrs jewkes returned i you will be more your own enemy than i will be i will look all forward and shall not presume so much as by a whisper to set my good master against any one he pleases to approve of and as to his old servants i shall always value them and never offer to dictate to his choice or influence it by my own caprices mrs jewkes said my master you find you have no cause to apprehend any thing my pamela is very placable and as we have both been sinners together we must both be included in one act of grace such an example of condescension as i have before me mrs jewkes said i may make you very easy for i must be highly unworthy if i did not forego all my little resentments if i had any for the sake of so much goodness to myself you are very kind madam said she and you may depend upon it i will atone for all my faults by my future duty and respect to you as well as to my master thats well said on both sides said he but mrs jewkes to assure you that my good girl here has no malice she chooses you to attend her in the morning at the ceremony and you must keep up her spirits i shall replied she be very proud of the honour but i cannot madam but wonder to see you so very lowspirited as you have been these two or three days past with so much happiness before you why mrs jewkes answered i there can be but one reason given and that is that i am a sad fool but indeed i am not ungrateful neither nor would i put on a foolish affectation but my heart at times sinks within me i know not why except at my own unworthiness and because the honour done me is too high for me to support myself under as i should do it is an honour mrs jewkes added i i was not born to and no wonder then i behave so awkwardly she made me a fine compliment upon it and withdrew repeating her promises of care secrecy etc he parted from me with very great tenderness and i came up and set to writing to amuse my thoughts and wrote thus far and mrs jewkes being come up and it being past twelve i will go to bed but not one wink i fear shall i get this night i could beat myself for anger sure there is nothing ominous in this strange folly but i suppose all young maidens are the same so near so great a change of condition though they carry it off more discreetly than i thursday six oclock in the morning i might as well have not gone to bed last night for what sleep i had mrs jewkes often was talking to me and said several things that would have been well enough from any body else of our sex but the poor woman has so little purity of heart that it is all say from her and goes no farther than the ear i fancy my master has not slept much neither for i heard him up and walking about his chamber ever since break of day to be sure good gentleman he must have some concern as well as i for here he is going to marry a poor foolish unworthy girl brought up on the charity as one may say at least bounty of his worthy family and this foolish girl must be to all intents and purposes after twelve oclock this day as much his wife as if he were to marry a duchess and here he must stand the shocks of common reflection the great mr b has done finely he has married his poor servant wench will some say the ridicule and rude jests of his equals and companions too he must stand and the disdain of his relations and indignation of lady davers his lofty sister dear good gentleman he will have enough to do to be sure o how shall i merit all these things at his hand i can only do the best i can and pray to god to reward him and resolve to love him with a pure heart and serve him with a sincere obedience i hope the dear gentleman will continue to love me for this for alas i have nothing else to offer but as i can hardly expect so great a blessing if i can be secure from his contempt i shall not be unfortunate and must bear his indifference if his rich friends should inspire him with it and proceed with doing my duty with cheerfulness half an hour past eight oclock my good dear master my kind friend my generous benefactor my worthy protector and oh all the good words in one my affectionate husband that is soon to be be curbed in my proud heart know thy self and be conscious of thy unworthiness has just left me with the kindest tenderest expressions and gentlest behaviour that ever blest a happy maiden he approached me with a sort of reinedin rapture my pamela said he may i just ask after your employment dont let me chide my dear girl this day however the two parsons will be here to breakfast with us at nine and yet you are not a bit dressed why this absence of mind and sweet irresolution why indeed sir said i i will set about a reformation this instant he saw the commonprayer book lying in the window i hope said he my lovely maiden has been conning the lesson she is byandby to repeat have you not pamela and clasped his arms about me and kissed me indeed sir said i i have been reading over the solemn service and what thinks my fairest for so he called me of it o sir tis very awful and makes one shudder to reflect upon it no wonder said he it should affect my sweet pamela i have been looking into it this morning and i cant say but i think it a solemn but very suitable service but this i tell my dear love continued he and again clasped me to him there is not a tittle in it that i cannot joyfully subscribe to and that my dear pamela should make you easy and join cheerfully in it with me i kissed his dear hand o my generous kind protector said i how gracious is it to confirm thus the doubting mind of your poor servant which apprehends nothing so much as her own unworthiness of the honour and blessing that await her he was pleased to say i know well my dearest creature that according to the liberties we people of fortune generally give ourselves i have promised a great deal when i say so but i would not have said it if deliberately i could not with all my heart so banish from your mind all doubt and uneasiness let a generous confidence in me take place and let me see it does by your cheerfulness in this days solemn business and then i will love you for ever may god almighty sir said i reward all your goodness to me that is all i can say but oh how kind it is in you to supply the want of the presence and comfortings of a dear mother of a loving sister or of the kind companions of my own sex which most maidens have to soothe their anxieties on the so near approach of so awful a solemnity you sir are all these tender relations in one to me your condescensions and kindness shall if possible embolden me to look up to you without that sweet terror that must confound poor bashful maidens on such an occasion when they are surrendered up to a more doubtful happiness and to halfstrange men whose good faith and good usage of them must be less experienced and is all involved in the dark bosom of futurity and only to be proved by the event this my dear pamela said he is most kindly said it shews me that you enter gratefully into my intention for i would by my conduct supply all these dear relations to you and i voluntarily promise from my heart to you what i think i could not with such assured resolutions of performance to the highestborn lady in the kingdom for let me tell my sweet girl that after having been long tossed by the boisterous winds of a more culpable passion i have now conquered it and am not so much the victim of your beauty all charming as you are as of your virtue and therefore may more boldly promise for myself having so stable a foundation for my affection which should this outward beauty fail will increase with your virtue and shine forth the brighter as that is more illustriously displayed by the augmented opportunities which the condition you are now entering into will afford you o the dear charming man how nobly how encouragingly kind was all this i could not suitably express myself and he said i see my girl is at a loss for words i doubt not your kind acceptance of my declarations and when i have acted too much the part of a libertine formerly for you to look back without some anxiety i ought not being now happily convicted to say less but why loses my girl her time i will now only add that i hope for many happy years to make good by my conduct what so willingly flows from my lips he kissed me again and said but whatever you do pamela be cheerful for else may be of the small company we shall have some one not knowing how to account for your too nice modesty will think there is some other person in the world whose addresses would be still more agreeable to you this he said with an air of sweetness and pleasantry but it alarmed me exceedingly and made me resolve to appear as calm and cheerful as possible for this was indeed a most affecting expression and enough to make me if any thing can behave as i ought and to force my idle fears to give way to hopes so much better grounded and i began almost on this occasion to wish mr williams were not to marry me lest i should behave like a fool and so be liable to an imputation which i should be most unworthy if i deserved so i set about dressing me instantly and he sent mrs jewkes to assist me but i am never long a dressing when i set about it and my master has now given me a hint that will for half an hour more at least keep my spirits in a brisk circulation yet it concerns me a little too lest he should have any the least shadow of a doubt that i am not mind and person entirely his and so being now ready and not called to breakfast i sat down and wrote thus far i might have mentioned that i dressed myself in a rich white satin nightgown that had been my good ladys and my best headclothes etc i have got such a knack of writing that when i am by myself i cannot sit without a pen in my hand but i am now called to breakfast i suppose the gentlemen are come now courage pamela remember thou art upon thy good behaviour fie upon it my heart begins to flutter again foolish heart be still never sure was any maidens perverse heart under so little command as mine it gave itself away at first without my leave it has been for weeks pressing me with its wishes and yet now when it should be happy itself and make me so it is throb throb throb like a little fool and filling me with such unseasonable misgivings as abate the rising comforts of all my better prospects thursday near three oclock i thought i should have found no time nor heart to write again this day but here are three gentlemen come unexpectedly to dine with my master and so i shall not appear he has done all he could civilly to send them away but they will stay though i believe he had rather they would not and so i have nothing to do but to write till i go to dinner myself with mrs jewkes for my master was not prepared for this company and it will be a little latish today so i will begin with my happy story where i left off when i came down to breakfast mr peters and mr williams were both there and as soon as my master heard me coming down he met me at the door and led me in with great tenderness he had kindly spoken to them as he told me afterwards to mention no more of the matter to me than needs must i paid my respects to them i believe a little awkwardly and was almost out of breath but said i had come down a little too fast when abraham came in to wait my master said that the servants should not mistrust tis well gentlemen you came as you did for my good girl and i were going to take an airing till dinnertime i hope youll stay and dine with me sir said mr peters we wont hinder your airing i only came having a little time upon my hands to see your chapel but must be at home at dinner and mr williams will dine with me well then said my master we will pursue our intention and ride out for an hour or two as soon as i have shewn mr peters my little chapel will you pamela after breakfast walk with us to it if if said i and had like to have stammered foolish that i was if you please sir i could look none of them in the face abraham looking at me why child said my master you have hardly recovered your fright yet how came your foot to slip tis well you did not hurt yourself said mr peters improving the hint you hant sprained your ancle madam i hope no sir said i i believe not but tis a little painful to me and so it was for i meant my foolishness abraham said my master bid robin put the horses to the coach instead of the chariot and if these gentlemen will go we can set them down no matter sir said mr peters i had as lieve walk if mr williams chooses it well then said my master let it be the chariot as i told him i could eat nothing though i attempted it and my hand shook so i spilled some of my chocolate and so put it down again and they were all very good and looked another way my master said when abraham was out i have a quite plain ring here mr peters and i hope the ceremony will dignify the ring and that i shall give my girl reason to think it for that cause the most valuable one that can be presented her mr peters said he was sure i should value it more than the richest diamond in the world i had bid mrs jewkes not to dress herself lest she should give cause of mistrust and she took my advice when breakfast was over my master said before abraham well gentlemen we will step into the chapel and you must give me your advice as to the alterations i design i am in the more haste because the survey you are going to take of it for the alterations will take up a little time and we shall have but a small space between that and dinner for the little tour i design to make pamela youll give us your opinion wont you yes sir said i ill come after you so they went out and i sat down in the chair again and fanned myself i am sick at heart said i i think mrs jewkes said she shall i fetch you a little cordial no said i i am a sad fool i want spirits thats all she took her smellingbottle and would have given it me but i said keep it in your hand may be i shall want it but i hope not she gave me very good words and begged me to go and i got up but my knees beat so against one another i was forced to sit down again but at last i held by her arm and passing by abraham i said this ugly slip coming down stairs has made me limp though so i must hold by you mrs jewkes do you know what alterations there are to be in the chapel that we must all give our opinions of them nan she told me was let into the secret and she had ordered her to stay at the chapel door to see that nobody came in my dear master came to me at entering the chapel and took my hand and led me up to the altar remember my dear girl whispered he and be cheerful i am i will sir said i but i hardly knew what i said and so you may believe when i said to mrs jewkes dont leave me pray mrs jewkes dont leave me as if i had all confidence in her and none where it was most due so she kept close to me god forgive me but i never was so absent in my life as at first even till mr williams had gone on in the service so far as to the awful words about requiring us as we should answer at the dreadful day of judgment and then the solemn words and my masters whispering mind this my dear made me start said he still whispering know you any impediment i blushed and said softly none sir but my great unworthiness then followed the sweet words wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife etc and i began to take heart a little when my dearest master answered audibly to this question i will but i could only make a courtesy when they asked me though i am sure my heart was readier than my speech and answered to every article of obey serve love and honour mr peters gave me away and i said after mr williams as well as i could as my dear master did with a much better grace the words of betrothment and the ceremony of the ring passing next i received the dear favour at his worthy hands with a most grateful heart and he was pleased to say afterwards in the chariot that when he had done saying with this ring i thee wed etc i made a courtesy and said thank you sir may be i did for i am sure it was a most grateful part of the service and my heart was overwhelmed with his goodness and the tender grace wherewith he performed it i was very glad that the next part was the prayer and kneeling for i trembled so i could hardly stand betwixt fear and joy the joining of our hands afterwards the declaration of our being married to the few witnesses present for reckoning nan whose curiosity would not let her stay at the door there were but mr peters mrs jewkes and she the blessing the psalm and the subsequent prayers and the concluding exhortation were so many beautiful welcome and lovely parts of this divine office that my heart began to be delighted with them and my spirits to be a little freer and thus my dearest dear parents is your happy happy thrice happy pamela at last married and to whom why to her beloved gracious master the lord of her wishes and thus the dear once naughty assailer of her innocence by a blessed turn of providence is become the kind the generous protector and rewarder of it god be evermore blessed and praised and make me not wholly unworthy of such a transcendent honour and bless and reward the dear dear good gentleman who has thus exalted his unworthy servant and given her a place which the greatest ladies would think themselves happy in my master saluted me most ardently and said god give you my dear love as much joy on this occasion as i have and he presented me to mr peters who saluted me and said you may excuse me dear madam for i gave you away and you are my daughter and mr williams modestly withdrawing a little way mr williams said my master pray accept my thanks and wish your sister joy so he saluted me too and said most heartily madam i do and i will say that to see so much innocence and virtue so eminently rewarded is one of the greatest pleasures i have ever known this my master took very kindly mrs jewkes would have kissed my hand at the chapeldoor but i put my arms about her neck for i had got a new recruit of spirits just then and kissed her and said thank you mrs jewkes for accompanying me i have behaved sadly no madam said she pretty well pretty well mr peters walked out with me and mr williams and my master came out after us talking together mr peters when we came into the parlour said i once more madam must wish you joy on this happy occasion i wish every day may add to your comforts and may you very long rejoice in one another for you are the loveliest couple i ever saw joined i told him i was highly obliged to his kind opinion and good wishes and hoped my future conduct would not make me unworthy of them my good benefactor came in with mr williams so my dear life said he how do you do a little more composed i hope well you see this is not so dreadful an affair as you apprehended sir said mr peters very kindly it is a very solemn circumstance and i love to see it so reverently and awfully entered upon it is a most excellent sign for the most thoughtful beginnings make the most prudent proceedings mrs jewkes of her own accord came in with a large silver tumbler filled with sack and a toast and nutmeg and sugar and my master said thats well thought of mrs jewkes for we have made but sorry breakfasting and he would make me take some of the toast as they all did and drank pretty heartily and i drank a little and it cheered my heart i thought for an hour after my master took a fine diamond ring from his finger and presented it to mr peters who received it very kindly and to mr williams he said my old acquaintance i have reserved for you against a variety of solicitations the living i always designed for you and i beg youll prepare to take possession of it and as the doing it may be attended with some expense pray accept of this towards it and so he gave him as he told me afterwards it was a bank note of l so did this generous good gentleman bless us all and me in particular for whose sake he was as bounteous as if he had married one of the noblest fortunes so he took his leave of the gentlemen recommending secrecy again for a few days and they left him and none of the servants suspected any thing as mrs jewkes believes and then i threw myself at his feet blessed god and blessed him for his goodness and he overwhelmed me with kindness calling me his sweet bride and twenty lovely epithets that swell my grateful heart beyond the power of utterance he afterwards led me to the chariot and we took a delightful tour round the neighbouring villages and he did all he could to dissipate those still perverse anxieties that dwell upon my mind and do what i can spread too thoughtful an air as he tells me over my countenance we came home again by half an hour after one and he was pleasing himself with thinking not to be an hour out of my company this blessed day that as he was so good as to say he might inspire me with a familiarity that should improve my confidence in him when he was told that a footman of sir charles hargrave had been here to let him know that his master and two other gentlemen were on the road to take a dinner with him in their way to nottingham he was heartily vexed at this and said to me he should have been glad of their companies at any other time but that it was a barbarous intrusion now and he wished they had been told he would not be at home at dinner and besides said he they are horrid drinkers and i shant be able to get them away tonight perhaps for they have nothing to do but to travel round the country and beat up their friends quarters all the way and it is all one to them whether they stay a night or a month at a place but added he ill find some way if i can to turn them off after dinner confound them said he in a violent pet that they should come this day of all the days in the year we had hardly alighted and got in before they came three mad rakes they seemed to be as i looked through the window setting up a hunting note as soon as they came to the gate that made the courtyard echo again and smacking their whips in concert so i went up to my chamber and saw what made my heart throb mrs jewkess officious pains to put the room in order for a guest that however welcome as now my duty teaches me to say is yet dreadful to me to think of so i took refuge in my closet and had recourse to pen and ink for my amusement and to divert my anxiety of mind if ones heart is so sad and ones apprehension so great where one so extremely loves and is so extremely obliged what must be the case of those poor maidens who are forced for sordid views by their tyrannical parents or guardians to marry the man they almost hate and perhaps to the loss of the man they most love o that is a sad thing indeed and what have not such cruel parents to answer for and what do not such poor innocent victims suffer but blessed be god this lot is far from being mine my good master for i cannot yet have the presumption to call him by a more tender name came up to me and said well i just come to ask my dear bride o the charming charming word how she does i see you are writing my dear said he these confounded rakes are half mad i think and will make me so however said he i have ordered my chariot to be got ready as if i was under an engagement five miles off and will set them out of the house if possible and then ride round and come back as soon as i can get rid of them i find said he lady davers is full of our affairs she has taken great freedoms with me before sir charles and they have all been at me without mercy and i was forced to be very serious with them or else they would have come up to have seen you since i would not call you down he kissed me and said i shall quarrel with them if i cant get them away for i have lost two or three precious hours with my souls delight and so he went down mrs jewkes asked me to walk down to dinner in the little parlour i went down and she was so complaisant as to offer to wait upon me at table and would not be persuaded without difficulty to sit down with me but i insisted she should for said i it would be very extraordinary if one should so soon go into such distance mrs jewkes whatever my new station may require of me added i i hope i shall always conduct myself in such a manner that pride and insolence shall bear no part in my character you are very good madam said she but i will always know my duty to my masters lady why then replied i if i must take state upon me so early mrs jewkes let me exact from you what you call your duty and sit down with me when i desire you this prevailed upon her and i made shift to get down a bit of applepye and a little custard but that was all my good master came in again and said well thank my stars these rakes are going now but i must set out with them and i choose my chariot for if i took horse i should have difficulty to part with them for they are like a snowball and intend to gather company as they go to make a merry tour of it for some days together we both got up when he came in fie pamela said he why this ceremony now sit still mrs jewkes nay sir said she i was loath to sit down but my lady would have me she is very right mrs jewkes said my master and tapped me on the cheek for we are but yet half married and so she is not above half your lady yet dont look so down dont be so silent my dearest said he why you hardly spoke twenty words to me all the time we were out together something i will allow for your bashful sweetness but not too much mrs jewkes have you no pleasant tales to tell my pamela to make her smile till i return yes sir said she i could tell twenty pleasant stories but my lady is too nice to hear them and yet i hope i should not be shocking neither ah poor woman thought i thy chastest stories will make a modest person blush if i know thee and i desire to hear none of them my master said tell her one of the shortest you have in my hearing why sir said she i knew a bashful young lady as madam may be married to dear mrs jewkes interrupted i no more of your story i beseech you i dont like the beginning of it go on mrs jewkes said my master no pray sir dont require it said i pray dont well said he then well have it another time mrs jewkes abraham coming in to tell him the gentlemen were going and that his chariot was ready i am glad of that said he and went to them and set out with them i took a turn in the garden with mrs jewkes after they were gone and having walked a while i said i should be glad of her company down the elmwalk to meet the chariot for o i know not how to look up at him when he is with me nor how to bear his absence when i have reason to expect him what a strange contradiction there is in this unaccountable passion what a different aspect every thing in and about this house bears now to my thinking to what it once had the garden the pond the alcove the elmwalk but oh my prison is become my palace and no wonder every thing wears another face we sat down upon the broad stile leading towards the road and mrs jewkes was quite another person to me to what she was the last time i sat there at last my best beloved returned and alighted there what my pamela and mrs jewkes then left me what said he and kissed me brings you this way i hope to meet me yes sir said i thats kind indeed said he but why that averted eye that downcast countenance as if you was afraid of me you must not think so sir said i revive my heart then said he with a more cheerful aspect and let that overanxious solicitude which appears in the most charming face in the world be chased from it have you my dear girl any fears that i can dissipate any doubts that i can obviate any hopes that i can encourage any request that i can gratify speak my dear pamela and if i have power but speak and to purchase one smile it shall be done i cannot sir said i have any fears any doubts but that i shall never be able to deserve all your goodness i have no hopes but that my future conduct may be agreeable to you and my determined duty well accepted nor have i any request to make but that you will forgive all my imperfections and among the rest this foolish weakness that makes me seem to you after all the generous things that have passed to want this further condescension and these kind assurances but indeed sir i am oppressed by your bounty my spirits sink under the weight of it and the oppression is still the greater as i see not how possibly in my whole future life by all i can do to merit the least of your favours i know your grateful heart said he but remember my dear what the lawyers tell us that marriage is the highest consideration which the law knows and this my sweet bride has made you mine and me yours and you have the best claim in the world to share my fortune with me but set that consideration aside what is the obligation you have to me your mind is pure as that of an angel and as much transcends mine your wit and your judgment to make you no compliment are more than equal to mine you have all the graces that education can give a woman improved by a genius which makes those graces natural to you you have a sweetness of temper and a noble sincerity beyond all comparison and in the beauty of your person you excel all the ladies i ever saw where then my dearest is the obligation if not on my side to you but to avoid these comparisons let us talk of nothing henceforth but equality although if the riches of your mind and your unblemished virtue be set against my fortune which is but an accidental good as i may call it and all i have to boast of the condescension will be yours and i shall not think i can possibly deserve you till after your sweet example my future life shall become nearly as blameless as yours o sir said i what comfort do you give me that instead of my being in danger of being ensnared by the high condition to which your goodness has exalted me you make me hope that i shall be confirmed and approved by you and that we may have a prospect of perpetuating each others happiness till time shall be no more but sir i will not as you once cautioned me be too serious i will resolve with these sweet encouragements to be in every thing what you would have me be and i hope i shall more and more shew you that i have no will but yours he kissed me very tenderly and thanked me for this kind assurance as he called it and so we entered the house together eight oclock at night now these sweet assurances my dear father and mother you will say must be very consolatory to me and being voluntary on his side were all that could be wished for on mine and i was resolved if possible to subdue my idle fears and apprehensions ten oclock at night as we sat at supper he was generously kind to me as well in his actions as expressions he took notice in the most delicate manner of my endeavour to conquer my foibles and said i see with pleasure my dear girl strives to comport herself in a manner suitable to my wishes i see even through the sweet tender struggles of your overnice modesty how much i owe to your intentions of obliging me as i have once told you that i am the conquest more of your virtue than your beauty so not one alarming word or look shall my beloved pamela hear or see to give her reason to suspect the truth of what i aver you may the rather believe me continued he as you may see the pain i have to behold any thing that concerns you even though your concern be causeless and yet i will indulge my dear girls bashful weakness so far as to own that so pure a mind may suffer from apprehension on so important a change as this and i can therefore be only displeased with such part of your conduct as may make your sufferings greater than my own when i am resolved through every stage of my future life in all events to study to make them less after supper of which with all his sweet persuasions i could hardly taste he made me drink two glasses of champaign and afterwards a glass of sack which he kindly forced upon me by naming your healths and as the time of retiring drew on he took notice but in a very delicate manner how my colour went and came and how foolishly i trembled nobody surely in such delightful circumstances ever behaved so silly and he said my dearest girl i fear you have had too much of my company for so many hours together and would better recollect yourself if you retired for half an hour to your closet i wished for this but durst not say so much lest he should be angry for as the hours grew on i found my apprehensions increase and my silly heart was the unquieter every time i could lift up my eyes to his dear face so sweetly terrible did he appear to my apprehensions i said you are all goodness dear sir and i boldly kissed his dear hand and pressed it to my lips with both mine and saluting me very fervently he gave me his hand seeing me hardly able to stand and led me to my chamberdoor and then most generously withdrew i went to my closet and the first thing i did on my knees again thanked god for the blessing of the day and besought his divine goodness to conduct my future life in such a manner as should make me a happy instrument of his glory after this being now left to my own recollection i grew a little more assured and lightsome and the pen and paper being before me i amused myself with writing thus far eleven oclock thursday night mrs jewkes being come up with a message desiring to know whether her master may attend upon me in my closet and hinting to me that however she believed he did not expect to find me there i have sent word that i beg he would indulge me one quarter of an hour so committing myself to the mercies of the almighty who has led me through so many strange scenes of terror and affrightment to this happy yet awful moment i will wish you my dear parents a good night and though you will not see this in time yet i know i have your hourly prayers and therefore cannot fail of them now so good night good night god bless you and god bless me amen amen if it be his blessed will subscribes your everdutiful daughter friday evening o how this dear excellent man indulges me in every thing every hour he makes me happier by his sweet condescension than the former he pities my weakness of mind allows for all my little foibles endeavours to dissipate my fears his words are so pure his ideas so chaste and his whole behaviour so sweetly decent that never surely was so happy a creature as your pamela i never could have hoped such a husband could have fallen to my lot and much less that a gentleman who had allowed himself in attempts that now i will endeavour to forget for ever should have behaved with so very delicate and unexceptionable a demeanour no light frothy jests drop from his lips no alarming railleries no offensive expressions nor insulting airs reproach or wound the ears of your happy thrice happy daughter in short he says every thing that may embolden me to look up with pleasure upon the generous author of my happiness at breakfast when i knew not how to see him he emboldened me by talking of you my dear parents a subject he generously knew i could talk of and gave me assurances that he would make you both happy he said he would have me send you a letter to acquaint you with my nuptials and as he could make business that way thomas should carry it purposely as to morrow nor will i said he my dear pamela desire to see your writings because i told you i would not for now i will in every thing religiously keep my word with my dear spouse o the dear delightful word and you may send all your papers to them from those they have down to this happy moment only let me beg they will preserve them and let me have them when they have read them as also those i have not seen which however i desire not to see till then but then shall take it for a favour if you will grant it it will be my pleasure as well as my duty sir said i to obey you in every thing and i will write up to the conclusion of this day that they may see how happy you have made me i know you will both join with me to bless god for his wonderful mercies and goodness to you as well as to me for he was pleased to ask me particularly after your circumstances and said he had taken notice that i had hinted in some of my first letters that you owed money in the world and he gave me fifty guineas and bid me send them to you in my packet to pay your debts as far as they would go and that you would quit your present business and put yourself and my dear mother into a creditable appearance and he would find a better place of abode for you than that you had when he returned to bedfordshire o how shall i bear all these exceeding great and generous favours i send them wrapt up five guineas in a parcel in double papers to me he gave no less than one hundred guineas more and said i would have you my dear give mrs jewkes when you go away from hence what you think fit out of these as from yourself nay good dear sir said i let that be what you please give her then said he twenty guineas as a compliment on your nuptials give colbrand ten guineas give the two coachmen five guineas each to the two maids at this house five guineas each give abraham five guineas give thomas five guineas and give the gardeners grooms and helpers twenty guineas among them and when said he i return with you to the other house i will make you a suitable present to buy you such ornaments as are fit for my beloved wife to appear in for now my pamela continued he you are not to mind as you once proposed what other ladies will say but to appear as my wife ought to do else it would look as if what you thought of as a means to avoid the envy of others of your sex was a wilful slight in me which i hope i never shall be guilty of and i will shew the world that i value you as i ought and as if i had married the first fortune in the kingdom and why should it not be so when i know none of the first quality that matches you in excellence he saw i was at a loss for words and said i see my dearest bride my spouse my wife my pamela your grateful confusion and kissing me as i was going to speak i will stop your dear mouth said he you shall not so much as thank me for when i have done ten times more than this i shall but poorly express my love for so much beauty of mind and loveliness of person which thus said he and clasped me to his generous bosom i can proudly now call my own o how my dear parents can i think of any thing but redoubled love joy and gratitude and thus generously did he banish from my mind those painful reflections and bashful apprehensions that made me dread to see him for the first time this day when i was called to attend him at breakfast and made me all ease composure and tranquillity he then thinking i seemed somewhat thoughtful proposed a little turn in the chariot till dinnertime and this was another sweet relief to me and he diverted me with twenty agreeable relations of what observations he had made in his travels and gave me the characters of the ladies and gentlemen in his other neighbourhood telling me whose acquaintance he would have me most cultivate and when i mentioned lady davers with apprehension he said to be sure i love my sister dearly notwithstanding her violent spirit and i know she loves me and i can allow a little for her pride because i know what my own so lately was and because she knows not my pamela and her excellencies as i do but you must not my dear forget what belongs to your character as my wife nor meanly stoop to her though i know you will choose by softness to try to move her to a proper behaviour but it shall be my part to see that you do not yield too much however continued he as i would not publicly declare my marriage here i hope she wont come near us till we are in bedfordshire and then when she knows we are married she will keep away if she is not willing to be reconciled for she dares not surely come to quarrel with me when she knows it is done for that would have a hateful and wicked appearance as if she would try to make differences between man and wife but we will have no more of this subject nor talk of any thing added he that shall give concern to my dearest and so he changed the talk to a more pleasing subject and said the kindest and most soothing things in the world when we came home which was about dinnertime he was the same obliging kind gentleman and in short is studious to shew on every occasion his generous affection to me and after dinner he told me he had already written to his draper in town to provide him new liveries and to his late mothers mercer to send him down patterns of the most fashionable silks for my choice i told him i was unable to express my gratitude for his favours and generosity and as he knew best what befitted his own rank and condition i would wholly remit myself to his good pleasure but by all his repeated bounties to me of so extraordinary a nature i could not but look forward with awe upon the condition to which he had exalted me and now i feared i should hardly be able to act up to it in such a manner as should justify the choice he had condescended to make but that i hoped i should have not only his generous allowance for my imperfections which i could only assure him should not be wilful ones but his kind instructions and that as often as he observed any part of my conduct such as he could not entirely approve he would let me know it and i would think his reproofs of beginning faults the kindest and most affectionate things in the world because they would keep me from committing greater and be a means to continue to me the blessing of his good opinion he answered me in the kindest manner and assured me that nothing should ever lie upon his mind which he would not reveal and give me an opportunity either of convincing him or being convinced myself he then asked me when i should be willing to go to the bedfordshire house i said whenever he pleased we will come down hither again before the winter said he if you please in order to cultivate the acquaintance you have begun with lady jones and sir simons family and if it please god to spare us to one another in the winter i will give you as i promised for two or three months the diversions of london and i think added he if my dear pleases we will set out next week about tuesday for tother house i can have no objection sir said i to any thing you propose but how will you avoid miss darnfords solicitation for an evening to dance why said he we can make monday evening do for that purpose if they wont excuse us but if you please said he i will invite lady jones mr peters and his family and sir simon and his family to my little chapel on sunday morning and to stay dinner with me and then i will declare my marriage to them because my dear life shall not leave this country with the least reason for a possibility of any bodys doubting that it is so o how good was this but indeed his conduct is all of a piece noble kind and considerate what a happy creature am i and then may be said he they will excuse us till we return into this country again as to the ball is there any thing added he that my beloved pamela has still to wish if you have freely speak hitherto my dearest sir replied i you have not only prevented my wishes but my hopes and even my thoughts and yet i must own since your kind command of speaking my mind seems to shew that you expect from me i should say something that i have only one or two things to wish more and then i shall be too happy say said he what they are sir proceeded i i am indeed ashamed to ask any thing lest it should not be agreeable to you and lest it should look as if i was taking advantage of your kind condescensions to me and knew not when to be satisfied i will only tell you pamela said he that you are not to imagine that these things which i have done in hopes of obliging you are the sudden impulses of a new passion for you but if i can answer for my own mind they proceed from a regular and uniform desire of obliging you which i hope will last as long as your merit lasts and that i make no doubt will be as long as i live and i can the rather answer for this because i really find so much delight in myself in my present way of thinking and acting as infinitely overpays me and which for that reason i am likely to continue for both our sakes my beloved wife therefore said he for methinks i am grown fond of a name i once despised may venture to speak her mind and i will promise that so far as it is agreeable to me and i cheerfully can i will comply and you will not insist upon it if that should not be the case to be sure sir said i i ought not neither will i and now you embolden me to become an humble petitioner and that as i ought upon my knees for the reinstating such of your servants as i have been the unhappy occasion of their disobliging you he raised me up and said my beloved pamela has too often been in this suppliant posture to me to permit it any more rise my fairest and let me know whom in particular you would reinstate and he kindly held me in his arms and pressed me to his beloved bosom mrs jervis sir said i in the first place for she is a good woman and the misfortunes she has had in the world must make your displeasure most heavy to her well said he who next mr longman sir said i and i am sure kind as they have been to me yet would i not ask it if i could not vouch for their integrity and if i did not think it was my dear masters interest to have such good servants have you any thing further said he sir said i your good old butler who has so long been in your family before the day of your happy birth i would if i might become an advocate for well said he i have only to say that had not mr longman and mrs jervis and jonathan too joined in a body in a bold appeal to lady davers which has given her the insolent handle she has taken to intermeddle in my affairs i could easily have forgiven all the rest of their conduct though they have given their tongues no little license about me but i could have forgiven them because i desire every body should admire you and it is with pride that i observe not only their opinion and love but that of every body else that knows you justify my own but yet i will forgive even this because my pamela desires it and i will send a letter myself to tell longman what he owes to your interposition if the estate he has made in my family does not set him above the acceptance of it and as to mrs jervis do you my dear write a letter to her and give her your commands instantly on the receipt of it to go and take possession of her former charge for now my dearest girl she will be more immediately your servant and i know you love her so well that youll go thither with the more pleasure to find her there but dont think added he that all this compliance is to be for nothing ah sir said i tell me but what i can do poor as i am in power but rich in will and i will not hesitate one moment why then said he of your own accord reward me for my cheerful compliance with one sweet kiss i instantly said thus then dear sir will i obey and oh you have the sweetest and most generous way in the world to make that a condition which gives me double honour and adds to my obligations and so i clasped my arms about his neck and was not ashamed to kiss him once and twice and three times once for every forgiven person now my dearest pamela said he what other things have you to ask mr williams is already taken care of and i hope will be happy have you nothing to say for john arnold why dear sir said i you have seen the poor fellows penitence in my letters yes my dear so i have but that is his penitence for his having served me against you and i think when he would have betrayed me afterwards he deserves nothing to be said or done for him by either but dear sir said i this is a day of jubilee and the less he deserves poor fellow the more will be your goodness and let me add one word that as he was divided in his inclinations between his duty to you and good wishes to me and knew not how to distinguish between the one and the other when he finds us so happily united by your great goodness to me he will have no more puzzles in his duty for he has not failed in any other part of it but i hope will serve you faithfully for the future well then suppose i put mrs jewkes in a good way of business in some inn and give her john for a husband and then your gipsy story will be made out that she will have a husband younger than herself you are all goodness sir said i i can freely forgive poor mrs jewkes and wish her happy but permit me sir to ask would not this look like a very heavy punishment to poor john and as if you could not forgive him when you are so generous to every body else he smiled and said o my pamela this for a forgiving spirit is very severe upon poor jewkes but i shall never by the grace of god have any more such trying services to put him or the rest upon and if you can forgive him i think i may and so john shall be at your disposal and now let me know what my pamela has further to wish o my dearest sir said i not a single wish more has your grateful pamela my heart is overwhelmed with your goodness forgive these tears of joy added i you have left me nothing to pray for but that god will bless you with life and health and honour and continue to me the blessing of your esteem and i shall then be the happiest creature in the world he clasped me in his arms and said you cannot my dear life be so happy in me as i am in you o how heartily i despise all my former pursuits and headstrong appetites what joys what true joys flow from virtuous love joys which the narrow soul of the libertine cannot take in nor his thoughts conceive and which i myself whilst a libertine had not the least notion of but said he i expected my dear spouse my pamela had something to ask for herself but since all her own good is absorbed in the delight her generous heart takes in promoting that of others it shall be my study to prevent her wishes and to make her care for herself unnecessary by my anticipating kindness in this manner my dear parents is your happy daughter blessed in a husband o how my exulting heart leaps at the dear dear word and i have nothing to do but to be humble and to look up with gratitude to the allgracious dispenser of these blessings so with a thousand thanks i afterwards retired to my closet to write you thus far and having completed what i purpose for this packet and put up the kind obliging present i have nothing more to say but that i hope soon to see you both and receive your blessings on this happy thrice happy occasion and so hoping for your prayers that i may preserve an humble and upright mind to my gracious god a dutiful gratitude to my dear master and husband that i may long rejoice in the continuance of these blessings and favours and that i may preserve at the same time an obliging deportment to every one else i conclude myself your everdutiful and most happy daughter pamela b o think it not my pride my dear parents that sets me on glorying in my change of name yours will be always dear to me and what i shall never be ashamed of im sure but yet for such a husband what shall i say since words are too faint to express my gratitude and my joy i have taken copies of my masters letter to mr longman and mine to mrs jervis which i will send with the further occurrences when i go to the other dear house or give you when i see you as i now hope soon to do saturday morning the third of my happy nuptials i must still write on till i come to be settled in the duty of the station to which i am so generously exalted and to let you participate with me the transporting pleasures that rise from my new condition and the favours that are hourly heaped upon me by the best of husbands when i had got my packet for you finished i then set about writing as he had kindly directed me to mrs jervis and had no difficulty till i came to sign my name and so i brought it down with me when i was called to supper unsigned my good master for i delight and always shall to call him by that name had been writing to mr longman and he said pleasantly see here my dearest what i have written to your somebody i read as follows mr longman i have the pleasure to acquaint you that last thursday i was married to my beloved pamela i have had reason to be disobliged with you and mrs jervis and jonathan not for your kindness to and regard for my dear spouse that now is but for the manner in which you appealed to my sister davers which has made a very wide breach between her and me but as it was one of her first requests that i would overlook what had passed and reinstate you in all your former charges i think myself obliged without the least hesitation to comply with it so if you please you may enter again upon an office which you have always executed with unquestionable integrity and to the satisfaction of yours etc friday afternoon i shall set out next tuesday or wednesday for bedfordshire and desire to find jonathan as well as you in your former offices in which i dare say youll have the more pleasure as you have such an early instance of the sentiments of my dear wife from whose goodness you may expect every agreeable thing she writes herself to mrs jervis i thanked him most gratefully for his goodness and afterwards took the above copy of it and shewed him my letter to mrs jervis as follows my dear mrs jervis i have joyful tidings to communicate to you for yesterday i was happily married to the best of gentlemen yours and my beloved master i have only now to tell you that i am inexpressibly happy that my generous benefactor denies me nothing and even anticipates my wishes you may be sure i could not forget my dear mrs jervis and i made it my request and had it granted as soon as asked that you might return to the kind charge which you executed with so much advantage to our masters interest and so much pleasure to all under your direction all the power that is put into my hands by the most generous of men shall be exerted to make every thing easy and agreeable to you and as i shall soon have the honour of attending my beloved to bedfordshire it will be a very considerable addition to my delight and to my unspeakable obligations to the best of men to see my dear mrs jervis and to be received by her with that pleasure which i promise myself from her affection for i am my dear good friend and always will be yours very affectionately and gratefully pamela he read this letter and said tis yours my dear and must be good but dont you put your name to it sir said i your goodness has given me a right to a very honourable one but as this is the first occasion of the kind except that to my dear father and mother i think i ought to shew it you unsigned that i may not seem overforward to take advantage of the honour you have done me however sweetly humble and requisite said he this may appear to my dear pamelas niceness it befits me to tell you that i am every moment more and more pleased with the right you have to my name and my dear life added he i have only to wish i may be half as worthy as you are of the happy knot so lately knit he then took a pen himself and wrote after pamela his most worthy sirname and i underwrote thus o rejoice with me my dear mrs jervis that i am enabled by gods graciousness and my dear masters goodness thus to write myself these letters and the packet to you were sent away by mr thomas early this morning my dearest master is just gone to take a ride out and intends to call upon lady jones mr peters and sir simon darnford to invite them to chapel and dinner tomorrow and says he chooses to do it himself because the time is so short they will perhaps deny a servant i forgot to mention that mr williams was here yesterday to ask leave to go to see his new living and to provide for taking possession of it and seemed so pleased with my masters kindness and fondness for me as well as his generous deportment to himself that he left us in such a disposition as shewed he was quite happy i am very glad of it for it would rejoice me to be an humble means of making all mankind so and oh what returns ought i not to make to the divine goodness and how ought i to strive to diffuse the blessings i experience to all in my knowledge for else what is it for such a worm as i to be exalted what is my single happiness if i suffer it niggardlike to extend no farther than to myself but then indeed do god almightys creatures act worthy of the blessings they receive when they make or endeavour to make the whole creation so far as is in the circle of their power happy great and good god as thou hast enlarged my opportunities enlarge also my will and make me delight in dispensing to others a portion of that happiness which i have myself so plentifully received at the hand of thy gracious providence then shall i not be useless in my generation then shall i not stand a single mark of thy goodness to a poor worthless creature that in herself is of so small account in the scale of beings a mere cipher on the wrong side of a figure but shall be placed on the right side and though nothing worth in myself shall give signification by my place and multiply the blessings i owe to thy goodness which has distinguished me by so fair a lot this as i conceive is the indispensable duty of a high condition and how great must be the condemnation of poor creatures at the great day of account when they shall be asked what uses they have made of the opportunities put into their hands and are able only to say we have lived but to ourselves we have circumscribed all the power thou hast given us into one narrow selfish compass we have heaped up treasures for those who came after us though we knew not whether they would not make a still worse use of them than we ourselves did and how can such poor selfish pleaders expect any other sentence than the dreadful depart ye cursed but sure my dear father and mother such persons can have no notion of the exalted pleasures that flow from doing good were there to be no afteraccount at all there is something so satisfactory and pleasing to reflect on the being able to administer comfort and relief to those who stand in need of it as infinitely of itself rewards the beneficent mind and how often have i experienced this in my good ladys time though but the second hand dispenser of her benefits to the poor and sickly when she made me her almoner how have i been affected with the blessings which the miserable have heaped upon her for her goodness and upon me for being but the humble conveyer of her bounty to them and how delighted have i been when the moving report i have made of a particular distress has augmented my good ladys first intentions in relief of it this i recall with pleasure because it is now by the divine goodness become my part to do those good things she was wont to do and oh let me watch myself that my prosperous state do not make me forget to look up with due thankfulness to the providence which has entrusted me with the power that so i may not incur a terrible woe by the abuse or neglect of it forgive me these reflections my dear parents and let me have your prayers that i may not find my present happiness a snare to me but that i may consider that more and more will be expected from me in proportion to the power given me and that i may not so unworthily act as if i believed i ought to set up my rest in my mean self and think nothing further to be done with the opportunities put into my hand by the divine favour and the best of men saturday seven oclock in the evening my master returned home to dinner in compliment to me though much pressed to dine with lady jones as he was also by sir simon to dine with him but mr peters could not conveniently provide a preacher for his own church tomorrow morning at so short a notice mr williams being gone as i said to his new living but believed he could for the afternoon and so he promised to give us his company to dinner and to read afternoon service and this made my master invite all the rest as well as him to dinner and not to church and he made them promise to come and told mr peters he would send his coach for him and his family miss darnford told him pleasantly she would not come unless he would promise to let her be at his wedding by which i find mr peters has kept the secret as my master desired he was pleased to give me an airing after dinner in the chariot and renewed his kind assurances to me and if possible is kinder than ever this is sweetly comfortable to me because it shews me he does not repent of his condescensions to me and it encourages me to look up to him with more satisfaction of mind and less doubtfulness i begged leave to send a guinea to a poor body in the town that i heard by mrs jewkes lay very ill and was very destitute he said send two my dear if you please said i sir i will never do any thing of this kind without letting you know what i do he most generously answered i shall then perhaps have you do less good than you would otherwise do from a doubt of me though i hope your discretion and my own temper which is not avaricious will make such doubt causeless now my dear continued he ill tell you how we will order this point to avoid even the shadow of uneasiness on one side or doubt on the other as to your father and mother in the first place they shall be quite out of the question for i have already determined in my mind about them and it is thus they shall go down if they and you think well of it to my little kentish estate which i once mentioned to you in such a manner as made you reject it with a nobleness of mind that gave me pain then but pleasure since there is a pretty little farm and house untenanted upon that estate and tolerably well stocked and i will further stock it for them for such industrious folks wont know how to live without some employment and it shall be theirs for both their lives without paying any rent and i will allow them l per annum besides that they may keep up the stock and be kind to any other of their relations without being beholden to you or me for small matters and for greater where needful you shall always have it in your power to accommodate them for i shall never question your prudence and we will so long as god spares our lives go down once a year to see them and they shall come up as often as they please it cannot be too often to see us for i mean not this my dear to send them from us before i proceed does my pamela like this o sir said i the english tongue affords not words or at least i have them not to express sufficiently my gratitude teach me dear sir continued i and pressed his dear hand to my lips teach me some other language if there be any that abounds with more grateful terms that i may not thus be choked with meanings for which i can find no utterance my charmer says he your language is all wonderful as your sentiments and you most abound when you seem most to want all that i wish is to find my proposals agreeable to you and if my first are not my second shall be if i can but know what you wish did i say too much my dearest parents when i said he was if possible kinder and kinder o the blessed man how my heart is overwhelmed with his goodness well said he my dearest let me desire you to mention this to them to see if they approve it but if it be your choice and theirs to have them nearer to you or even under the same roof with you i will freely consent to it o no sir said i and i fear almost sinned in my grateful flight i am sure they would not choose that they could not perhaps serve god so well if they were to live with you for so constantly seeing the hand that blesses them they would it may be as must be my care to avoid be tempted to look no further in their gratitude than to the dear dispenser of such innumerable benefits excellent creature said he my beloved wants no language nor sentiments neither and her charming thoughts so sweetly expressed would grace any language and this is a blessing almost peculiar to my fairest your so kind acceptance my pamela added he repays the benefit with interest and leaves me under obligation to your goodness but now my dearest i will tell you what we will do with regard to points of your own private charity for far be it from me to put under that name the subject we have been mentioning because that and more than that is duty to persons so worthy and so nearly related to my pamela and as such to myself o how the sweet man outdoes me in thoughts words power and every thing and this said he lies in very small compass for i will allow you two hundred pounds a year which longman shall constantly pay you at fifty pounds a quarter for your own use and of which i expect no account to commence from the day you enter into my other house i mean said he that the first fifty pounds shall then be due because you shall have something to begin with and added the dear generous man if this be pleasing to you let it since you say you want words be signified by such a sweet kiss as you gave me yesterday i hesitated not a moment to comply with these obliging terms and threw my arms about his dear neck though in the chariot and blessed his goodness to me but indeed sir said i i cannot bear this generous treatment he was pleased to say dont be uneasy my dear about these trifles god has blessed me with a very good estate and all of it in a prosperous condition and generally well tenanted i lay up money every year and have besides large sums in government and other securities so that you will find what i have hitherto promised is very short of that proportion of my substance which as my dearest wife you have a right to in this sweet manner did we pass our time till evening when the chariot brought us home and then our supper succeeded in the same agreeable manner and thus in a rapturous circle the time moves on every hour bringing with it something more delightful than the past sure nobody was ever so blest as i sunday the fourth day of my happiness not going to chapel this morning the reason of which i told you i bestowed the time from the hour of my beloveds rising to breakfast in prayer and thanksgiving in my closet and now i begin to be quite easy cheerful and free in my spirits and the rather as i find myself encouraged by the tranquillity and pleasing vivacity in the temper and behaviour of my beloved who thereby shews he does not repent of his goodness to me i attended him to breakfast with great pleasure and freedom and he seemed quite pleased with me and said now does my dearest begin to look upon me with an air of serenity and satisfaction it shall be always added he my delight to give you occasion for this sweet becoming aspect of confidence and pleasure in me my heart dear sir said i is quite easy and has lost all its foolish tumults which combating with my gratitude might give an unacceptable appearance to my behaviour but now your goodness sir has enabled it to get the better of its uneasy apprehensions and my heart is all of one piece and devoted to you and grateful tranquillity and could i be so happy as to see you and my good lady davers reconciled i have nothing in this world to wish for more but the continuance of your favour he said i wish this reconciliation my dearest as well as you and i do assure you more for your sake than my own and if she would behave tolerably i would make the terms easier to her for that reason he said i will lay down one rule for you my pamela to observe in your dress and i will tell you every thing i like or dislike as it occurs to me and i would have you do the same on your part that nothing may be upon either of our minds that may occasion the least reservedness i have often observed in married folks that in a little while the lady grows careless in her dress which to me looks as if she would take no pains to secure the affection she had gained and shews a slight to her husband that she had not to her lover now you must know this has always given me great offence and i should not forgive it even in my pamela though she would have this excuse for herself that thousands could not make that she looks lovely in every thing so my dear i shall expect of you always to be dressed by dinnertime except something extraordinary happens and this whether you are to go abroad or stay at home for this my love will continue to you that sweet ease in your dress and behaviour which you are so happy a mistress of and whomsoever i bring home with me to my table youll be in readiness to receive them and will not want to make those foolish apologies to unexpected visitors that carry with them a reflection on the conduct of those who make them and besides will convince me that you think yourself obliged to appear as graceful to your husband as you would to persons less familiar to your sight this dear sir said i is a most obliging injunction and i most heartily thank you for it and will always take care to obey it why my dear said he you may better do this than half your sex because they too generally act in such a manner as if they seemed to think it the privilege of birth and fortune to turn day into night and night into day and are seldom stirring till it is time to sit down to dinner and so all the good old family rules are reversed for they breakfast when they should dine dine when they should sup and sup when they should go to bed and by the help of dear quadrille sometimes go to bed when they should rise in all things but these my dear continued he i expect you to be a lady and my good mother was one of this oldfashioned cut and in all other respects as worthy a lady as any in the kingdom and so you have not been used to the new way and may the easier practise the other dear sir said i pray give me more of your sweet injunctions why then continued he i shall in the usual course and generally if not hindered by company like to go to bed with my dearest by eleven and if i dont shant hinder you i ordinarily now rise by six in summer i will allow you to be half an hour after me or so then youll have some time you may call your own till you give me your company to breakfast which may be always so as that we may have done at a little after nine then will you have several hours again at your disposal till two oclock when i shall like to sit down at table you will then have several useful hours more to employ yourself in as you shall best like and i would generally go to supper by eight and when we are resolved to stick to these oldfashioned rules as near as we can we shall have our visitors conform to them too and expect them from us and suit themselves accordingly for i have always observed that it is in every ones power to prescribe rules to himself it is only standing a few ridiculous jests at first and that too from such generally as are not the most worthy to be minded and after a while they will say it signifies nothing to ask him he will have his own way there is no putting him out of his bias he is a regular piece of clock work they will joke and all that and why my dear should we not be so for man is as frail a piece of machinery as any clockwork whatever and by irregularity is as subject to be disordered then my dear continued the charming man when they see they are received at my own times with an open countenance and cheerful heart when they see plenty and variety at my board and meet a kind and hearty welcome from us both they will not offer to break in upon my conditions nor grudge me my regular hours and as most of these people have nothing to do except to rise in a morning they may as well come to breakfast with us at half an hour after eight in summer as at ten or eleven to dinner at two as at four five or six and to supper at eight as at ten or eleven and then our servants too will know generally the times of their business and the hours of their leisure or recess and we as well as they shall reap the benefits of this regularity and who knows my dear but we may revive the good oldfashion in our neighbourhood by this means at least it will be doing our parts towards it and answering the good lesson i learned at school every one mend one and the worst that will happen will be that when some of my brother rakes such as those who broke in upon us so unwelcomely last thursday are got out of the way if that can ever be and begin to consider who they shall go to dine with in their rambles they will only say we must not go to him for his dinnertime is over and so theyll reserve me for another time when they happen to suit it better or perhaps they will take a supper and a bed with me instead of it now my dearest continued the kind man you see here are more of my injunctions as you call them and though i will not be so set as to quarrel if they are not always exactly complied with yet as i know you wont think them unreasonable i shall be glad they may as often as they can and you will give your orders accordingly to your mrs jervis who is a good woman and will take pleasure in obeying you o dearest dear sir said i have you nothing more to honour me with you oblige and improve me at the same time what a happy lot is mine why let me see my dearest said he but i think of no more at present for it would be needless to say how much i value you for your natural sweetness of temper and that open cheerfulness of countenance which adorns you when nothing has given my fairest apprehensions for her virtue a sweetness and a cheerfulness that prepossesses in your favour at first sight the mind of every one that beholds you i need not i hope say that i would have you diligently preserve this sweet appearance let no thwarting accident no cross fortune for we must not expect to be exempt from such happy as we now are in each other deprive this sweet face of this its principal grace and when any thing unpleasing happens in a quarter of an hour at farthest begin to mistrust yourself and apply to your glass and if you see a gloom arising or arisen banish it instantly smooth your dear countenance resume your former composure and then my dearest whose heart must always be seen in her face and cannot be a hypocrite will find this a means to smooth her passions also and if the occasion be too strong for so sudden a conquest she will know how to do it more effectually by repairing to her closet and begging that gracious assistance which has never yet failed her and so shall i my dear who as you once but too justly observed have been too much indulged by my good mother have an example from you as well as a pleasure in you which will never be palled one thing continued he i have frequently observed at the house of many a gentleman that when we have unexpectedly visited or broken in upon the family order laid down by the lady and especially if any of us have lain under the suspicion of having occasionally seduced our married companion into bad hours or given indifferent examples the poor gentleman has been oddly affected at our coming though the good breeding of the lady has made her just keep up appearances he has looked so conscious has been so afraid as it were to disoblige has made so many excuses for some of us before we had been accused as have always shewn me how unwelcome we have been and how much he is obliged to compound with his lady for a tolerable reception of us and perhaps she too in proportion to the honest mans concern to court her smiles has been more reserved stiff and formal and has behaved with an indifference and slight that has often made me wish myself out of her house for too plainly have i seen that it was not his this my dear you will judge by my description has afforded me subject for animadversion upon the married life for a man may not though in the main he is willing to flatter himself that he is master of his house and will assert his prerogative upon great occasions when it is strongly invaded be always willing to contend and such women as those i have described are always ready to take the field and are worse enemies than the old parthians who annoy most when they seem to retreat and never fail to return to the charge again and carry on the offensive war till they have tired out resistance and made the husband willing like a vanquished enemy to compound for small matters in order to preserve something at least the poor man does not care to let his friends see his case and so will not provoke a fire to break out that he sees and so do his friends too the meek lady has much ado to smother and which very possibly burns with a most comfortable ardour after we are gone you smile my pamela said he at this whimsical picture and i am sure i never shall have reason to include you in these disagreeable outlines but yet i will say that i expect from you whoever comes to my house that you accustom yourself to one even uniform complaisance that no frown take place on your brow that however ill or well provided we may be for their reception you shew no flutter or discomposure that whoever you may have in your company at the time you signify not by the least reserved look that the stranger is come upon you unseasonably or at a time you wished he had not but be facetious kind obliging to all and if to one more than another to such as have the least reason to expect it from you or who are most inferior at the table for thus will you my pamela cheer the doubting mind quiet the uneasy heart and diffuse ease pleasure and tranquillity around my board and be sure my dear continued he let no little accidents ruffle your temper i shall never forget once that i was at lady arthurs and a footman happened to stumble and let fall a fine china dish and broke it all to pieces it was grievous to see the uneasiness it gave the poor lady and she was so sincere in it that she suffered it to spread all over the company and it was a pretty large one too and not a person in it but turned either her consoler or fell into stories of the like misfortunes and so we all became for the rest of the evening nothing but blundering footmen and careless servants or were turned into broken jars plates glasses teacups and such like brittle substances and it affected me so much that when i came home i went to bed and dreamt that robin with the handle of his whip broke the fore glass of my chariot and i was so solicitous methought to keep the good lady in countenance for her anger that i broke his head in revenge and stabbed one of my coachhorses and all the comfort i had when it was done methought was that i had not exposed myself before company and there were no sufferers but guilty robin and one innocent coachhorse i was exceedingly diverted with the facetious hints and the pleasant manner in which he gave them and i promised to improve by the excellent lessons contained in them i then went up and dressed myself as like a bride as i could in my best clothes and on inquiry hearing my dearest master was gone to walk in the garden i went to find him out he was reading in the little alcove and i said sir am i licensed to intrude upon you no my dear said he because you cannot intrude i am so wholly yours that wherever i am you have not only a right to join me but you do me a very acceptable favour at the same time i have sir said i obeyed your first kind injunction as to dressing myself before dinner but may be you are busy sir he put up the papers he was reading and said i can have no business or pleasure of equal value to your company my dear what were you going to say only sir to know if you have any more kind injunctions to give me i could hear you talk a whole day together you are very obliging pamela said he but you are so perfectly what i wish that i might have spared those i gave you but i was willing you should have a taste of my freedom with you to put you upon the like with me for i am confident there can be no friendship lasting without freedom and without communicating to one another even the little caprices if my pamela can have any such which may occasion uneasiness to either now my dear said he be so kind as to find some fault with me and tell me what you would wish me to do to appear more agreeable to you o sir said i and i could have kissed him but for shame to be sure i shall grow a sad fond hussy i have not one single thing to wish for no not one he saluted me very kindly and said he should be sorry if i had and forbore to speak it do you think my dear sir said i that your pamela has no conscience do you think that because you so kindly oblige her and delight in obliging her that she must rack her invention for trials of your goodness and knows not when shes happy o my dearest sir added i less than one half of the favours you have so generously conferred upon me would have exceeded my utmost wishes my dear angel said he and kissed me again i shall be troublesome to you with my kisses if you continue thus sweetly obliging in your actions and expressions o sir said i i have been thinking as i was dressing myself what excellent lessons you teach me when you commanded me at your table to cheer the doubting mind and comfort the uneasy heart and to behave most kindly to those who have least reason to expect it and are most inferior how sweetly in every instance that could possibly occur have you done this yourself by your poor unworthy pamela till you have diffused in your own dear words ease pleasure and tranquillity around my glad heart then again sir when you bid me not be disturbed by little accidents or by strangers coming in upon me unexpectedly how noble an instance did you give me of this when on our happy weddingday the coming of sir charles hargrave and the other two gentlemen for which you were quite unprovided and which hindered our happiness of dining together on that chosen day did not so disturb you but that you entertained the gentlemen pleasantly and parted with them civilly and kindly what charming instances are these i have been recollecting with pleasure of your pursuing the doctrine you deliver my dear said he these observations are very kind in you and much to my advantage but if i do not always for i fear these were too much accidents so well pursue the doctrines i lay down my pamela must not expect that my imperfections will be a plea for her nonobservance of my lessons as you call them for i doubt i shall never be half so perfect as you and so i cannot permit you to recede in your goodness though i may find myself unable to advance as i ought in my duty i hope sir said i by gods grace i never shall i believe it said he but i only mention this knowing my own defects lest my future lessons should not be so well warranted by my practice as in the instances you have kindly recollected he was pleased to take notice of my dress and spanning my waist with his hands said what a sweet shape is here it would make one regret to lose it and yet my beloved pamela i shall think nothing but that loss wanting to complete my happiness i put my bold hand before his mouth and said hush hush o fie sir the freest thing you have ever yet said since i have been yours he kissed my hand and said such an innocent wish my dearest may be permitted me because it is the end of the institution but say would such a case be unwelcome to my pamela i will say sir said i and hid my blushing face on his bosom that your wishes in every thing shall be mine but pray sir say no more he kindly saluted me and thanked me and changed the subject i was not too free i hope thus we talked till we heard the coaches and then he said stay here in the garden my dear and ill bring the company to you and when he was gone i passed by the backdoor kneeled down against it and blessed god for not permitting my then so much desired escape i went to the pond and kneeled down on the mossy bank and again blessed god there for his mercy in my escape from myself my then worst enemy though i thought i had none but enemies and no friend near me and so i ought to do in almost every step of this garden and every room in this house and i was bending my steps to the dear little chapel to make my acknowledgment there but i saw the company coming towards me miss darnford said so miss andrews how do you do now o you look so easy so sweetly so pleased that i know youll let me dance at your wedding for i shall long to be there lady jones was pleased to say i looked like an angel and mrs peters said i improved upon them every time they saw me lady darnford was also pleased to make me a fine compliment and said i looked freer and easier every time she saw me dear heart i wish thought i you would spare these compliments for i shall have some joke i doubt passed on me byandby that will make me suffer for all these fine things mr peters said softly god bless you dear daughter but not so much as my wife knows it sir simon came in last and took me by the hand and said mr b by your leave and kissed my hand five or six times as if he was mad and held it with both his and made a very free jest by way of compliment in his way well i think a young rake is hardly tolerable but an old rake and an old beau are two very sad things and all this before daughters womengrown i whispered my dearest a little after and said i fear i shall suffer much from sir simons rude jokes byandby when you reveal the matter tis his way my dear said he you must now grow above these things miss nanny darnford said to me with a sort of half grave ironical air well miss andrews if i may judge by your easy deportment now to what it was when i saw you last i hope you will let my sister if you wont me see the happy knot tied for she is quite wild about it i courtesied and only said you are all very good to me ladies mr peterss niece said well miss andrews i hope before we part we shall be told the happy day my good master heard her and said you shall you shall madam thats pure said miss darnford he took me aside and said softly shall i lead them to the alcove and tell them there or stay till we go in to dinner neither sir i think said i i fear i shant stand it nay said he they must know it i would not have invited them else why then sir said i let it alone till they are going away then replied he you must pull off your ring no no sir said i that i must not well said he do you tell miss darnford of it yourself indeed sir answered i i cannot mrs jewkes came officiously to ask my master just then if she should bring a glass of rhenish and sugar before dinner for the gentlemen and ladies and he said thats well thought of bring it mrs jewkes and she came with nan attending her with two bottles and glasses and a salver and must needs making a low courtesy offered first to me saying will your ladyship begin i coloured like scarlet and said no my master to be sure but they all took the hint and miss darnford said ill be hanged if they have not stolen a wedding said mrs peters it must certainly be so ah mr peters ill assure you said he i have not married them where were you said she and mr williams last thursday morning said sir simon let me alone let me alone if any thing has been stolen ill find it out im a justice of the peace you know and so he took me by the hand and said come madam answer me by the oath you have taken are you married or not my master smiled to see me look so like a fool and i said pray sir simon ay ay said he i thought you did not look so smirking upon us for nothing well then pamela said my master since your blushes discover you dont be ashamed but confess the truth now said miss darnford i am quite angry and said lady darnford i am quite pleased let me give you joy dear madam if it be so and so they all said and saluted me all round i was vexed it was before mrs jewkes for she shook her fat sides and seemed highly pleased to be a means of discovering it nobody said my master wishes me joy no said lady jones very obligingly nobody need for with such a peerless spouse you want no good wishes and he saluted them and when he came last to me said before them all now my sweet bride my pamela let me conclude with you for here i began to love and here i desire to end loving but not till my life ends this was sweetly said and taken great notice of and it was doing credit to his own generous choice and vastly more than i merited but i was forced to stand many more jokes afterwards for sir simon said several times come come madam now you are become one of us i shall be a little less scrupulous than i have been ill assure you when we came in to dinner i made no difficulty of what all offered me the upper end of the table and performed the honours of it with pretty tolerable presence of mind considering and with much ado my good benefactor promising to be down again before winter we got off the ball but appointed tuesday evening at lady darnfords to take leave of all this good company who promised to be there my master designing to set out on wednesday morning for bedfordshire we had prayers in the little chapel in the afternoon but they all wished for the good clerk again with great encomiums upon you my dear father and the company staid supper also and departed exceeding well satisfied and with abundance of wishes for the continuance of our mutual happiness and my master desired mr peters to answer for him to the ringers at the town if they should hear of it till our return into this country and that then he would be bountiful to them because he would not publicly declare it till he had first done so in bedfordshire monday the fifth day i have had very little of my dear friends company this day for he only staid breakfast with me and rode out to see a sick gentleman about eighteen miles off who begged by a man and horse on purpose to speak with him believing he should not recover and upon part of whose estate my master has a mortgage he said my dearest i shall be very uneasy if i am obliged to tarry all night from you but lest you should be alarmed if i dont come home by ten dont expect me for poor mr carlton and i have pretty large concerns together and if he should be very ill and would be comforted by my presence as i know he loves me and his family will be more in my power if he dies than i wish for charity will not let me refuse it is now ten oclock at night and i fear he will not return i fear for the sake of his poor sick friend who i doubt is worse though i know not the gentleman i am sorry for his own sake for his familys sake and for my dear masters sake who by his kind expressions i find loves him and methinks i should be sorry any grief should touch his generous heart though yet there is no living in this world without too many occasions for concern even in the most prosperous state and it is fit it should be so or else poor wretches as we are we should look no farther but be like sensual travellers on a journey homeward who meeting with good entertainment at some inn on the way put up their rest there and never think of pursuing their journey to their proper home this i remember was often a reflection of my good ladys to whom i owe it eleven oclock mrs jewkes has been with me and asked if i will have her for a bed fellow in want of a better i thanked her but i said i would see how it was to be by myself one night i might have mentioned that i made mrs jewkes dine and sup with me and she was much pleased with it and my behaviour to her and i could see by her manner that she was a little struck inwardly at some of her former conduct to me but poor wretch it is much i fear because i am what i am for she has otherwise very little remorse i doubt her talk and actions are entirely different from what they used to be quite circumspect and decent and i should have thought her virtuous and even pious had i never known her in another light by this we may see my dear father and mother of what force example is and what is in the power of the heads of families to do and this shews that evil examples in superiors are doubly pernicious and doubly culpable because such persons are bad themselves and not only do no good but much harm to others and the condemnation of such must to be sure be so much the greater and how much the greater still must my condemnation be who have had such a religious education under you and been so well nurtured by my good lady if i should forget with all these mercies heaped upon me what belongs to the station i am preferred to o how i long to be doing some good for all that is past yet is my dear dear masters god bless him and return him safe to my wishes for methinks already tis a week since i saw him if my love would not be troublesome and impertinent i should be nothing else for i have a true grateful spirit and i had need to have such a one for i am poor in every thing but will tuesday morning eleven oclock my dear dear master im sure i should still say but i will learn to rise to a softer epithet nowandthen is not yet come i hope he is safe and well so mrs jewkes and i went to breakfast but i can do nothing but talk and think of him and all his kindness to me and to you which is still me more intimately i have just received a letter from him which he wrote overnight as i find by it and sent early this morning this is a copy of it to mrs andrews my dearest pamela monday night i hope my not coming home this night will not frighten you you may believe i cant help it my poor friend is so very ill that i doubt he cant recover his desires to have me stay with him are so strong that i shall sit up all night with him as it is now near one oclock in the morning for he cant bear me out of his sight and i have made him and his distressed wife and children so easy in the kindest assurances i could give him of my consideration for him and them that i am looked upon as the poor disconsolate widow as she i doubt will soon be tells me as their good angel i could have wished we had not engaged to the good neighbourhood at sir simons for tomorrow night but i am so desirous to set out on wednesday for the other house that as well as in return for the civilities of so many good friends who will be there on purpose i would not put it off what i beg of you therefore my dear is that you would go in the chariot to sir simons the sooner in the day the better because you will be diverted with the company who all so much admire you and i hope to join you there by your teatime in the afternoon which will be better than going home and returning with you as it will be six miles difference to me and i know the good company will excuse my dress on the occasion i count every hour of this little absence for a day for i am with the utmost sincerity my dearest love for ever yours etc if you could go to dine with them it will be a freedom that would be very pleasing to them and the more as they dont expect it i begin to have a little concern lest his fatigue should be too great and for the poor sick gentleman and family but told mrs jewkes that the least intimation of his choice should be a command to me and so i would go to dinner there and ordered the chariot to be got ready to carry me when a messenger came up just as i was dressed to tell her she must come down immediately i see at the window that visitors are come for there is a chariot and six horses the company gone out of it and three footmen on horseback and i think the chariot has coronets who can it be i wonder but here i will stop for i suppose i shall soon know good sirs how unlucky this is what shall i do here is lady davers come her own self and my kind protector a great great many miles off mrs jewkes out of breath comes and tells me this and says she is inquiring for my master and me she asked her it seemed naughty lady as she is if i was whored yet theres a word for a ladys mouth mrs jewkes says she knew not what to answer and my lady said she is not married i hope and said she i said no because you have not owned it yet publicly my lady said that was well enough said i i will run away mrs jewkes and let the chariot go to the bottom of the elmwalk and i will steal out of the door unperceived but she is inquiring for you madam replied she and i said you was within but going out and she said she would see you presently as soon as she could have patience what did she call me said i the creature madam i will see the creature said she as soon as i can have patience ay but said i the creature wont let her if she can help it pray mrs jewkes favour my escape for this once for i am sadly frighted said she ill bid the chariot go down as you order and wait till you come and ill step down and shut the hall door that you may pass unobserved for she sits cooling herself in the parlour over against the staircase thats a good mrs jewkes said i but who has she with her her woman answered she and her nephew but he came on horseback and is going into the stables and they have three footmen and i wish said i they were all three hundred miles off what shall i do so i wrote thus far and wait impatiently to hear the coast is clear mrs jewkes tells me i must come down or she will come up what does she call me now said i wench madam bid the wench come down to me and her nephew and her woman are with her said i i cant go and thats enough you might contrive it that i might get out if you would indeed madam said she i cannot for i went to shut the door and she bid me let it stand open and there she sits over against the staircase then said i ill get out of the window i think and fanned myself for i am sadly frightened laud madam said she i wonder you so much disturb yourself youre on the right side the hedge im sure and i would not be so discomposed for any body ay said i but who can help constitution i dare say you would no more be so discomposed that i can help it said she indeed madam if it was to me i would put on an air as mistress of the house as you are and go and salute her ladyship and bid her welcome ay ay replied i fine talking but how unlucky this is your good master is not at home what answer shall i give her said she to her desiring to see you tell her said i i am sick abed im dying and must not be disturbed im gone out or any thing but her woman came up to me just as i had uttered this and said how do you do mrs pamela my lady desires to speak to you so i must go sure she wont beat me oh that my dear protector was at home well now i will tell you all that happened in this frightful interview and very bad it was i went down dressed as i was and my gloves on and my fan in my hand to be just ready to step into the chariot when i could get away and i thought all my trembling fits had been over now but i was mistaken for i trembled sadly yet resolved to put on as good an air as i could so i went to the parlour and said making a very low courtesy your servant my good lady and your servant again said she my lady for i think you are dressed out like one a charming girl though said her rakish nephew and swore a great oath dear aunt forgive me but i must kiss her and was coming to me and i said forbear uncivil gentleman i wont be used freely jackey said my lady sit down and dont touch the creature shes proud enough already theres a great difference in her air ill assure you since i saw her last well child said she sneeringly how dost find thyself thourt mightily come on of late i hear strange reports about thee thourt almost got into fools paradise i doubt and wilt find thyself terribly mistaken in a little while if thou thinkest my brother will disgrace his family to humour thy babyface i see said i sadly vexed her woman and nephew smiling by your ladyship has no very important commands for me and i beg leave to withdraw beck said she to her woman shut the door my young lady and i must not have done so soon wheres your wellmannered deceiver gone child says she said i when your ladyship is pleased to speak intelligibly i shall know how to answer well but my dear child said she in drollery dont be too pert neither i beseech thee thou wilt not find thy masters sister half so ready to take thy freedoms as thy mannerly master is so a little of that modesty and humility that my mothers waitingmaid used to shew will become thee better than the airs thou givest thyself since my mothers son has taught thee to forget thyself i would beg said i one favour of your ladyship that if you would have me keep my distance you will not forget your own degree why suppose miss pert i should forget my degree wouldst thou not keep thy distance then if you madam said i lessen the distance yourself you will descend to my level and make an equality which i dont presume to think of for i cant descend lower than i am at least in your ladyships esteem did i not tell you jackey said she that i should have a wit to talk to he who swears like a fine gentleman at every word rapped out an oath and said drolling i think mrs pamela if i may be so bold as to say so you should know you are speaking to lady davers sir said i i hope there was no need of your information and so i cant thank you for it and am sorry you seem to think it wants an oath to convince me of the truth of it he looked more foolish than i at this if possible not expecting such a reprimand and said at last why mrs pamela you put me half out of countenance with your witty reproof sir said i you seem quite a fine gentleman and it will not be easily done i dare say how now pert one said my lady do you know whom you talk to i think i do not madam replied i and for fear i should forget myself more ill withdraw your ladyships servant said i and was going but she rose and gave me a push and pulled a chair and setting the back against the door sat down in it well said i i can bear anything at your ladyships hands but i was ready to cry though and i went and sat down and fanned myself at the other end of the room her woman who stood all the time said softly mrs pamela you should not sit in my ladys presence and my lady though she did not hear her said you shall sit down child in the room where i am when i give you leave so i stood up and said when your ladyship will hardly permit me to stand one might be indulged to sit down but i ask you said she whither your master is gone to one mr carlton madam about eighteen miles off who is very sick and when does he come home this evening madam and where are you going to a gentlemans house in the town madam and how was you to go in the chariot madam why you must be a lady in time to be sure i believe youd become a chariot mighty well child was you ever out in it with your master pray your ladyship said i a little too pertly perhaps be pleased to ask half a dozen such questions together because one answer may do for all why boldface said she youll forget your distance and bring me to your level before my time i could no longer refrain tears but said pray your ladyship let me ask what i have done to be thus severely treated i never did your ladyship any harm and if you think i am deceived as you was pleased to hint i should be more entitled to your pity than your anger she rose and took me by the hand and led me to her chair and then sat down and still holding my hand said why pamela i did indeed pity you while i thought you innocent and when my brother seized you and brought you down hither without your consent i was concerned for you and i was still more concerned for you and loved you when i heard of your virtue and resistance and your laudable efforts to get away from him but when as i fear you have suffered yourself to be prevailed upon and have lost your innocence and added another to the number of the fools he has ruined this shocked me a little i cannot help shewing my displeasure to you madam replied i i must beg no hasty judgment i have not lost my innocence take care take care pamela said she dont lose your veracity as well as your honour why are you here when you are at full liberty to go whither you please i will make one proposal to you and if you are innocent i am sure youll accept it will you go and live with me i will instantly set out with you in my chariot and not stay half an hour longer in this house if youll go with me now if you are innocent and willing to keep so deny me if you can i am innocent madam replied i and willing to keep so and yet i cannot consent to this then said she very mannerly thou liest child thats all and i give thee up and so she arose and walked about the room in great wrath her nephew and her woman said your ladyships very good tis a plain case a very plain case i would have removed the chair to have gone out but her nephew came and sat in it this provoked me for i thought i should be unworthy of the honour i was raised to though i was afraid to own it if i did not shew some spirit and i said what sir is your pretence in this house to keep me a prisoner here because said he i like it do you so sir replied i if that is the answer of a gentleman to such an one as i it would not i dare say be the answer of a gentleman to a gentleman my lady my lady said he a challenge a challenge by gad no sir said i i am of a sex that gives no challenges and you think so too or you would not give this occasion for the word said my lady dont be surprised nephew the wench could not talk thus if she had not been her masters bedfellow pamela pamela said she and tapped me upon the shoulder two or three times in anger thou hast lost thy innocence girl and thou hast got some of thy bold masters assurance and art fit to go any where then and please your ladyship said i i am unworthy of your presence and desire i may quit it no replied she i will know first what reason you can give for not accepting my proposal if you are innocent i can give said i a very good one but i beg to be excused i will hear it said she why then answered i i should perhaps have less reason to like this gentleman than where i am well then said she ill put you to another trial ill set out this moment with you to your father and mother and give you up safe to them what do you say to that ay mrs pamela said her nephew now what does your innocence say to that fore gad madam you have puzzled her now be pleased madam said i to call off this fine gentleman your kindness in these proposals makes me think you would not have me baited ill be dd said he if she does not make me a bulldog why shell toss us all by and by sir said i you indeed behave as if you were in a beargarden jackey be quiet said my lady you only give her a pretence to evade my questions come answer me pamela i will madam said i and it is thus i have no occasion to be beholden to your ladyship for this honour for i am to set out tomorrow morning on the way to my parents now again thou liest wench i am not of quality said i to answer such language once again said she provoke me not by these reflections and this pertness if thou dost i shall do something by thee unworthy of myself that thought i you have done already but i ventured not to say so but who is to carry you said she to your father and mother who my master pleases madam said i ay said she i doubt not thou wilt do every thing he pleases if thou hast not already why now tell me pamela from thy heart hast thou not been in bed with thy master ha wench i was quite shocked at this and said i wonder how your ladyship can use me thus i am sure you can expect no answer and my sex and my tender years might exempt me from such treatment from a person of your ladyships birth and quality and who be the distance ever so great is of the same sex with me thou art a confident wench said she i see pray madam said i let me beg you to permit me to go i am waited for in the town to dinner no replied she i cant spare you and whomsoever you are to go to will excuse you when they are told tis i that command you not to go and you may excuse it too young lady wouldbe if you consider that it is the unexpected coming of your late ladys daughter and your masters sister that commands your stay but a preengagement your ladyship will consider is something ay so it is but i know not what reason waitingmaids have to assume these airs of preengagements oh pamela pamela i am sorry for thy thus aping thy betters and giving thyself such airs i see thourt quite spoiled of a modest innocent girl that thou wast and humble too thou art now fit for nothing in the world but what i fear thou art why please your ladyship said her kinsman what signifies all you say the matters over with her no doubt and she likes it and she is in a fairydream and tis pity to awaken her before her dreams out bad as you take me to be madam said i i am not used to such language or reflections as this gentleman bestows upon me and i wont bear it well jackey said she be silent and shaking her head poor girl said she what a sweet innocence is here destroyed a thousand pities i could cry over her if that would do her good but she is quite lost quite undone and then has assumed a carriage upon it that all those creatures are distinguished by i cried sadly for vexation and said say what you please madam if i can help it i will not answer another word mrs jewkes came in and asked if her ladyship was ready for dinner she said yes i would have gone out with her but my lady said taking my hand she could not spare me and miss said she you may pull off your gloves and lay your fan by for you shant go and if you behave well you shall wait upon me at dinner and then i shall have a little further talk with you mrs jewkes said to me madam may i speak one word with you i cant tell mrs jewkes said i for my lady holds my hand and you see i am a kind of prisoner what you have to say mrs jewkes said she you may speak before me but she went out and seemed vexed for me and she says i looked like the very scarlet the cloth was laid in another parlour and for three persons and she led me in come my little dear said she with a sneer ill hand you in and i would have you think it as well as if it was my brother what a sad case thought i should i be in if i were as naughty as she thinks me it was bad enough as it was jackey said my lady come let us go to dinner she said to her woman do you beck help pamela to tend us we will have no menfellows come my young lady shall i help you off with your white gloves i have not madam said i deserved this at your ladyships hands mrs jewkes coming in with the first dish she said do you expect any body else mrs jewkes that you lay the cloth for three said she i hoped your ladyship and madam would have been so well reconciled that she would have sat down too what means the clownish woman said my lady in great disdain could you think the creature should sit down with me she does madam and please your ladyship with my master i doubt it not good woman said she and lies with him too does she not answer me fatface how these ladies are privileged if she does madam said she there may be a reason for it perhaps and went out so said she has the wench got thee over too come my little dear pull off thy gloves i say and off she pulled my left glove herself and spied my ring o my dear god said she if the wench has not got a ring well this is a pretty piece of foolery indeed dost know my friend that thou art miserably tricked and so poor innocent thou hast made a fine exchange hast thou not thy honesty for this bauble and ill warrant my little dear has topped her part and paraded it like any real wife and so mimics still the condition why said she and turned me round thou art as mincing as any bride no wonder thou art thus tricked out and talkest of thy preengagements prythee child walk before me to that glass survey thyself and cone back to me that i may see how finely thou canst act the theatrical part given thee i was then resolved to try to be silent although most sadly vexed so i went and sat me down in the window and she took her place at the upper end of the table and her saucy jackey fleering at me most provokingly sat down by her said he shall not the bride sit down by us madam ay well thought of said my lady pray mrs bride your pardon for sitting down in your place i said nothing said she with a poor pun thou hast some modesty however child for thou canst not stand it so must sit down though in my presence i still kept my seat and said nothing thought i this is a sad thing that i am hindered too from shewing my duty where it is most due and shall have anger there too may be if my dear master should be there before me so she ate some soup as did her kinsman and then as she was cutting up a fowl said if thou longest my little dear i will help thee to a pinion or breast or any thing but may be child said he thou likest the rump shall i bring it thee and then laughed like an idiot for all he is a lords son and may be a lord himself for he is the son of lord and his mother who was lord daverss sister being dead he has received what education he has from lord daverss direction poor wretch for all his greatness hell neer die for a plot at least of his own hatching if i could then have gone up i would have given you his picture but for one of or years of age much about the age of my dear master he is a most odd mortal pamela said my lady help me to a glass of wine no beck said she you shant for she was offering to do it i will have my lady bride confer that honour upon me and then i shall see if she can stand up i was silent and never stirred dost hear chastity said she help me to a glass of wine when i bid thee what not stir then ill come and help thee to one still i stirred not and fanning myself continued silent said she when i have asked thee meekone half a dozen questions together i suppose thou wilt answer them all at once pretty creature is not that it i was so vexed i bit a piece of my fan out not knowing what i did but still i said nothing and did nothing but flutter it and fan myself i believe said she my next question will make up half a dozen and then modest one i shall be entitled to an answer he rose and brought the bottle and glass come said he mrs bride be pleased to help my lady and i will be your deputy sir replied i it is in a good hand help my lady yourself why creature said she dost thou think thyself above it and then flew into a passion insolence continued she this moment when i bid you know your duty and give me a glass of wine or so i took a little spirit then thought i i can but be beat if said i to attend your ladyship at table or even kneel at your feet was required of me i would most gladly do it were i only the person you think me but if it be to triumph over one who has received honours that she thinks require her to act another part not to be utterly unworthy of them i must say i cannot do it she seemed quite surprised and looked now upon her kinsman and then upon her woman im astonished quite astonished well then i suppose you would have me conclude you my brothers wife could you not your ladyship said i compels me to say this well returned she but dost thou thyself think thou art so silence said her kinsman gives consent tis plain enough she does shall i rise madam and pay my duty to my new aunt tell me said my lady what in the name of impudence possesses thee to dare to look upon thyself as my sister madam replied i that is a question will better become your most worthy brother to answer than me she was rising in great wrath but her woman said good your ladyship youll do yourself more harm than her and if the poor girl has been deluded so as you have heard with the sham marriage shell be more deserving of your ladyships pity than anger true beck very true said my lady but theres no bearing the impudence of the creature in the mean time i would have gone out at the door but her kinsman ran and set his back against it i expected bad treatment from her pride and violent temper but this was worse than i could have thought of and i said to him sir when my master comes to know your rude behaviour you will may be have cause to repent it and went and sat down in the window again another challenge by gad said he but i am glad she says her master you see madam she herself does not believe she is married and so has not been so much deluded as you think for and coming to me with a most barbarous air of insult he said kneeling on one knee before me my new aunt your blessing or your curse i care not which but quickly give me one or other that i may not lose my dinner i gave him a most contemptuous look tinselled toy said i for he was laced all over twenty or thirty years hence when you are at age i shall know how to answer you better mean time sport with your footman and not with me and so i removed to another window nearer the door and he looked like a sad fool as he is beck beck said my lady this is not to be borne was ever the like heard is my kinsman and lord daverss to be thus used by such a slut and was coming to me and indeed i began to be afraid for i have but a poor heart after all but mrs jewkes hearing high words came in again with the second course and said pray your ladyship dont so discompose yourself i am afraid this days business will make matters wider than ever between your good ladyship and your brother for my master doats upon madam woman said she do thou be silent sure i that was born in this house may have some privilege in it without being talked to by the saucy servants in it i beg pardon madam replied mrs jewkes and turning to me said madam my master will take it very ill if you make him wait for you thus so i rose to go out but my lady said if it was only for that reason she shant go and went to the door and shut it and said to mrs jewkes woman dont come again till i call you and coming to me took my hand and said find your legs miss if you please i stood up and she tapped my cheek oh says she that scarlet glow shews what a rancorous little heart thou hast if thou durst shew it but come this way and so led me to her chair stand there said she and answer me a few questions while i dine and ill dismiss thee till i call thy impudent master to account and then ill have you face to face and all this mystery of iniquity shall be unravelled for between you i will come to the bottom of it when she had sat down i moved to the window on the other side of the parlour looking into the private garden and her woman said mrs pamela dont make my lady angry stand by her ladyship as she bids you said i pray good now let it suffice you to attend your ladys commands and dont lay yours upon me your pardon sweet mrs pamela said she times are much altered with you ill assure you said i her ladyship has a very good plea to be free in the house that she was born in but you may as well confine your freedoms to the house in which you had your breedings why how now mrs pamela said she since you provoke me to it ill tell you a piece of my mind hush hush good woman said i alluding to my ladys language to mrs jewkes my lady wants not your assistance besides i cant scold the woman was ready to flutter with vexation and lord jackey laughed as if he would burst his sides g d d n me beck said he youd better let her alone to my lady here for shell be too many for twenty such as you and i and then he laughed again and repeated i cant scold quotha but by gad miss you can speak dd spiteful words i can tell you that poor beck poor beck fore gad shes quite dumbfoundered well but pamela said my lady come hither and tell me truly dost thou think thyself really married said i and approached her chair my good lady ill answer all your commands if youll have patience with me and not be so angry as you are but i cant bear to be used thus by this gentleman and your ladyships woman child said she thou art very impertinent to my kinsman thou canst not be civil to me and my ladyships woman is much thy betters but thats not the thing dost thou think thou art really married i see madam said i you are resolved not to be pleased with any answer i shall return if i should say i am not then your ladyship will call me hard names and perhaps i should tell a fib if i should say i am your ladyship will ask how i have the impudence to be so and will call it a shammarriage i will said she be answered more directly why what madam does it signify what i think your ladyship will believe as you please but canst thou have the vanity the pride the folly said she to think thyself actually married to my brother he is no fool child and libertine enough of conscience and thou art not the first in the list of his credulous harlots well well said i and was in a sad flutter as i am easy and pleased with my lot pray madam let me continue so as long as i can it will be time enough for me to know the worst when the worst comes and if it should be so bad your ladyship should pity me rather than thus torment me before my time well said she but dost not think i am concerned that a young wench whom my poor dear mother loved so well should thus cast herself away and suffer herself to be deluded and undone after such a noble stand as thou madst for so long a time i think myself far from being deluded and undone and am as innocent and virtuous as ever i was in my life thou liest child said she so your ladyship told me twice before she gave me a slap on the hand for this and i made a low courtesy and said i humbly thank your ladyship but i could not refrain tears and added your dear brother madam however wont thank your ladyship for this usage of me though i do come a little nearer me my dear said she and thou shalt have a little more than that to tell him of if thou thinkst thou hast not made mischief enough already between a sister and brother but child if he was here i would serve thee worse and him too i wish he was said i dost thou threaten me mischiefmaker and insolent as thou art now pray madam said i but got to a little distance be pleased to reflect upon all that you have said to me since i have had the honour or rather misfortune to come into your presence whether you have said one thing befitting your ladyships degree to me even supposing i was the wench and the creature you imagine me to be come hither my pert dear replied she come but within my reach for one moment and ill answer thee as thou deservest to be sure she meant to box my ears but i should not be worthy my happy lot if i could not shew some spirit when the cloth was taken away i said i suppose i may now depart your presence madam i suppose not said she why ill lay thee a wager child thy stomachs too full to eat and so thou mayst fast till thy mannerly master comes home pray your ladyship said her woman let the poor girl sit down at table with mrs jewkes and me said i you are very kind mrs worden but times as you said are much altered with me and i have been of late so much honoured with better company that i cant stoop to yours was ever such confidence said my lady poor beck poor beck said her kinsman why she beats you quite out of the pit will your ladyship said i be so good as to tell me how long i am to tarry for youll please to see by that letter that i am obliged to attend my masters commands and so i gave her the dear gentlemans letter from mr carltons which i thought would make her use me better as she might judge by it of the honour done me by him ay said she this is my worthy brothers hand it is directed to mrs andrews thats to you i suppose child and so she ran on making remarks as she went along in this manner my dearest pamela mighty well i hope my not coming home this night will not frighten you vastly tender indeed and did it frighten you child you may believe i cant help it no to be sure a person in thy way of life is more tenderly used than an honest wife but mark the end of it i could have wished prythee jackey mind this we mind the significant we had not engaged to the good neighbourhood at sir simons for tomorrow night why does the good neighbourhood and does sir simon permit thy visits child they shall have none of mine then ill assure them but i am so desirous to set out on wednesday for the other house so jackey but we just nicked it i find that as well as in return for the civilities of so many good friends who will be there on purpose i would not put it off now mind jackey what i beg of you mind the wretch that could use me and your uncle as he has done he is turned beggar to this creature i beg of you therefore my dear my dear theres for you i wish i may not be quite sick before i get through what i beg of you therefore my dear and then she looked me full in the face is that you will go in the chariot to sir simons the sooner in the day the better dear heart and why so when we were not expected till night why pray observe the reason hem said she because you will be diverted with the company mighty kind indeed who all jackey jackey mind this who all so much admire you now hed ha been hanged before he would have said so complaisant a thing had he been married im sure very true aunt said he a plain case that thought i thats hard upon poor matrimony though i hope my lady dont find it so but i durst not speak out who all so much admire you said she i must repeat that pretty miss i wish thou wast as admirable for thy virtue as for that babyface of thine and i hope to join you there by your teatime in the afternoon so youre in very good time child an hour or two hence to answer all your important preengagements which will be better than going home and returning with you as it will be six miles difference to me and i know the good company will excuse my dress on this occasion very true any dress is good enough im sure for such company as admire thee child for a companion in thy ruined state jackey jackey mind mind again more fine things still i count every hour of this little absence for a day theres for you let me repeat it i count every hour of this little absence for a day mind too the wit of the good man one may see love is a new thing to him here is a very tedious time gone since he saw his deary no less than according to his amorous calculation a dozen days and nights at least and yet tedious as it is it is but a little absence well said my good accurate and consistent brother but wise men in love are always the greatest simpletons but now cones the reason why this little absence which at the same time is so great an absence is so tedious for i am ay now for it with the utmost sincerity my dearest love out upon dearest love i shall never love the word again pray bid your uncle never call me dearest love jackey for ever yours but brother thou liest thou knowest thou dost and so my good lady andrews or what shall i call you your dearest love will be for ever yours and hast thou the vanity to believe this but stay here is a postscript the poor man knew not when to have done to his dearest love hes sadly in fort truly why his dearest love you are mighty happy in such a lover if you could go to dine with them cry you mercy my dearest love now comes the pre engagement it will be a freedom that will be very pleasing to them and the more as they dont expect it well so much for this kind letter but you see you cannot honour this admiring company with this little expected and but in complaisance to his folly i dare say little desired freedom and i cannot forbear admiring you so much myself my dearest love that i will not spare you at all this whole evening for tis a little hard if thy masters sister may not be blest a little bit with thy charming company so i found i had shewn her my letter to very little purpose and repented it several times as she read on well then said i i hope your ladyship will give me leave to send my excuses to your good brother and say that your ladyship is come and is so fond of me that you will not let me leave you pretty creature said she and wantest thou thy good master to come and quarrel with his sister on thy account but thou shalt not stir from my presence and i would now ask thee what it is thou meanest by shewing me this letter why madam said i to shew your ladyship how i was engaged for this day and evening and for nothing else said she why i cant tell madam said i but if you can collect from it any other circumstances i might hope i should not be the worse treated i saw her eyes began to sparkle with passion and she took my hand and said grasping it very hard i know confident creature that thou shewedst it me to insult me you shewed it me to let me see that he could be civiller to a beggar born than to me or to my good lord davers you shewed it me as if youd have me to be as credulous a fool as yourself to believe your marriage true when i know the whole trick of it and have reason to believe you do too and you shewed it me to upbraid me with his stooping to such painted dirt to the disgrace of a family ancient and untainted beyond most in the kingdom and now will i give thee one hundred guineas for one bold word that i may fell thee at my foot was not this very dreadful to be sure i had better have kept the letter from her i was quite frightened and this fearful menace and her fiery eyes and rageful countenance made me lose all my courage so i said weeping good your ladyship pity me indeed i am honest indeed i am virtuous indeed i would not do a bad thing for the world though i know said she the whole trick of thy pretended marriage and thy foolish ring here and all the rest of the wicked nonsense yet i should not have patience with thee if thou shouldst but offer to let me know thy vanity prompts thee to believe thou art married to my brother i could not bear the thought so take care pamela take care beggarly brat take care good madam said i spare my dear parents they are honest and industrious they were once in a very creditable way and never were beggars misfortunes may attend any body and i can bear the cruellest imputations on myself because i know my innocence but upon such honest industrious parents who went through the greatest trials without being beholden to any thing but gods blessing and their own hard labour i cannot bear reflection what art thou setting up for a family creature as thou art god give me patience with thee i suppose my brothers folly and his wickedness together will in a little while occasion a search at the heralds office to set out thy wretched obscurity provoke me i desire thou wilt one hundred guineas will i give thee to say but thou thinkest thou art married to my brother your ladyship i hope wont kill me and since nothing i can say will please you but your ladyship is resolved to quarrel with me since i must not say what i think on one hand nor another whatever your ladyship designs by me be pleased to do and let me depart your presence she gave me a slap on the hand and reached to box my ear but mrs jewkes hearkening without and her woman too they both came in at that instant and mrs jewkes said pushing herself in between us your ladyship knows not what you do indeed you dont my master would never forgive me if i suffered in his house one he so dearly loves to be so used and it must not be though you are lady davers her woman too interposed and told her i was not worth her ladyships anger but she was like a person beside herself i offered to go out and mrs jewkes took my hand to lead me out but her kinsman set his back against the door and put his hand to his sword and said i should not go till his aunt permitted it he drew it halfway and i was so terrified that i cried out oh the sword the sword and not knowing what i did i ran to my lady herself and clasped my arms about her forgetting just then how much she was my enemy and said sinking on my knees defend me good your ladyship the sword the sword mrs jewkes said oh my lady will fall into fits but lady davers was herself so startled at the matter being carried so far that she did not mind her words and said jackey dont draw your sword you see as great as her spirit is she cant bear that come said she be comforted he shant frighten you ill try to overcome my anger and will pity you so wench rise up and dont be foolish mrs jewkes held her salts to my nose and i did not faint and my lady said mrs jewkes if you would be forgiven leave pamela and me by ourselves and jackey do you withdraw only you beck stay so i sat down in the window all in a sad fluster for to be sure i was sadly frightened said her woman you should not sit in my ladys presence mrs pamela yes let her sit till she is a little recovered of her fright said my lady and do you set my chair by her and so she sat overagainst me and said to be sure pamela you have been very provoking with your tongue to be sure you have as well upon my nephew who is a man of quality too as me and palliating her cruel usage and beginning i suppose to think herself she had carried it further than she could answer it to her brother she wanted to lay the fault upon me own said she you have been very saucy and beg my pardon and beg jackeys pardon and i will try to pity you for you are a sweet girl after all if you had but held out and been honest tis injurious to me madam said i to imagine i am not honest said she have you not been abed with my brother tell me that your ladyship replied i asks your questions in a strange way and in strange words o your delicacy is wounded i suppose by my plain questions this niceness will soon leave you wench it will indeed but answer me directly then your ladyships next question said i will be am i married and you wont bear my answer to that and will beat me again i hant beat you yet have i beck said she so you want to make out a story do you but indeed i cant bear thou shouldst so much as think thou art my sister i know the whole trick of it and so tis my opinion dost thou it is only thy little cunning that it might look like a cloak to thy yielding and get better terms from him prythee prythee wench thou seest i know the world a little almost as much at thirtytwo as thou dost at sixteen remember that i rose from the window and walking to the other end of the room beat me again if you please said i but i must tell your ladyship i scorn your words and am as much married as your ladyship at that she ran to me but her woman interposed again let the vain wicked creature go from your presence madam said she she is not worthy to be in it she will but vex your ladyship stand away beck said she thats an assertion that i would not take from my brother i cant bear it as much married as i is that to be borne but if the creature believes she is madam said her woman she is to be as much pitied for her credulity as despised for her vanity i was in hopes to have slipt out at the door but she caught hold of my gown and pulled me back pray your ladyship said i dont kill me i have done no harm but she locked the door and put the key in her pocket so seeing mrs jewkes before the window i lifted up the sash and said mrs jewkes i believe it would be best for the chariot to go to your master and let him know that lady davers is here and i cannot leave her ladyship she was resolved to be displeased let me say what i would said she no no hell then think that i make the creature my companion and know not how to part with her i thought your ladyship replied i could not have taken exceptions at this message thou knowest nothing wench said she of what belongs to people of condition how shouldst thou nor thought i do i desire it at this rate what shall i say madam said i nothing at all replied she let him expect his dearest love and be disappointed it is but adding a few more hours and he will make every one a day in his amorous account mrs jewkes coming nearer me and my lady walking about the room being then at the end i whispered let robert stay at the elms ill have a struggle fort by and by as much married as i repeated she the insolence of the creature and so she walked about the room talking to herself to her woman and now and then to me but seeing i could not please her i thought i had better be silent and then it was am i not worthy an answer if i speak said i your ladyship is angry at me though ever so respectfully if i do not i cannot please would your ladyship tell me but how i shall oblige you and i would do it with all my heart confess the truth said she that thou art an undone creature hast been in bed with thy master and art sorry for it and for the mischief thou hast occasioned between him and me and then ill pity thee and persuade him to pack thee off with a hundred or two of guineas and some honest farmer may take pity of thee and patch up thy shame for the sake of the money and if nobody will have thee thou must vow penitence and be as humble as i once thought thee i was quite sick at heart at all this passionate extravagance and to be hindered from being where was the desire of my soul and afraid too of incurring my dear masters displeasure and as i sat i saw it was no hard matter to get out of the window into the front yard the parlour being even with the yard and so have a fair run for it and after i had seen my lady at the other end of the room again in her walks having not pulled down the sash when i spoke to mrs jewkes i got upon the seat and whipped out in a minute and ran away as hard as i could drive my lady calling after me to return and her woman at the other window but two of her servants appearing at her crying out and she bidding them to stop me i said touch me at your peril fellows but their ladys commands would have prevailed on them had not mr colbrand who it seems had been kindly ordered by mrs jewkes to be within call when she saw how i was treated come up and put on one of his deadly fierce looks the only time i thought it ever became him and said he would chine the man that was his word who offered to touch his lady and so he ran alongside of me and i heard my lady say the creature flies like a bird and indeed mr colbrand with his huge strides could hardly keep pace with me and i never stopped till i got to the chariot and robert had got down seeing me running at a distance and held the door in his hand with the step ready down and in i jumped without touching the step saying drive me drive me as fast as you can out of my ladys reach and he mounted and colbrand said dont be frightened madam nobody shall hurt you and shut the door and away robert drove but i was quite out of breath and did not recover it and my fright all the way mr colbrand was so kind but i did not know it till the chariot stopped at sir simons to step up behind the carriage lest as he said my lady should send after me and he told mrs jewkes when he got home that he never saw such a runner as me in his life when the chariot stopped which was not till six oclock so long did this cruel lady keep me miss darnford ran out to me o madam said she ten times welcome but youll be beat i can tell you for here has been mr b come these two hours and is very angry with you thats hard indeed said i indeed i cant afford it for i hardly knew what i said having not recovered my fright let me sit down miss any where said i for i have been sadly off so i sat down and was quite sick with the hurry of my spirits and leaned upon her arm said she your lord and master came in very moody and when he had staid an hour and you not come he began to fret and said he did not expect so little complaisance from you and he is now sat down with great persuasion to a game at loo come you must make your appearance lady fair for he is too sullen to attend you i doubt you have no strangers have you miss said i only two women relations from stamford replied she and an humble servant of one of them only all the world miss said i what shall i do if he be angry i cant bear that just as i had said so came in lady darnford and lady jones to chide me as they said for not coming sooner and before i could speak came in my dear master i ran to him how dye pamela said he and saluting me with a little more formality than i could well bear i expected half a word from me when i was so complaisant to your choice would have determined you and that youd have been here to dinner and the rather as i made my request a reasonable one and what i thought would be agreeable to you o dear sir said i pray pray hear me and youll pity me and not be displeased mrs jewkes will tell you that as soon as i had your kind commands i said i would obey you and come to dinner with these good ladies and so prepared myself instantly with all the pleasure in the world lady darnford and miss said i was their dear look you said miss did i not tell you stately one that something must have happened but o these tyrants these men why what hindered it my dear said he give yourself time you seem out of breath o sir said i out of breath well i may for just as i was ready to come away who should drive into the courtyard but lady davers lady davers nay then my sweet dear said he and saluted me more tenderly hast thou had a worse trial than i wish thee from one of the haughtiest women in england though my sister for she too my pamela was spoiled by my good mother but have you seen her yes sir said i and more than seen her why sure said he she has not had the insolence to strike my girl sir said i but tell me you forgive me for indeed i could not come sooner and these good ladies but excuse me and ill tell you all another time for to take up the good companys attention now will spoil their pleasantry and be to them though more important to me like the broken china you cautioned me about thats a dear girl said he i see my hints are not thrown away upon you and i beg pardon for being angry with you and for the future will stay till i hear your defence before i judge you said miss darnford this is a little better to own a fault is some reparation and what every lordly husband will not do he said but tell me my dear did lady davers offer you any incivility o sir replied i she is your sister and i must not tell you all but she has used me very severely did you tell her said he you were married yes sir i did at last but she will have it tis a shammarriage and that i am a vile creature and she was ready to beat me when i said so for she could not have patience that i should be deemed her sister as she said how unlucky it was replied he i was not at home why did you not send to me here send sir i was kept prisoner by force they would not let me stir or do you think i would have been hindered from obeying you nay i told them that i had a preengagement but she ridiculed me and said waitingmaids talk of preengagements and then i shewed her your kind letter and she made a thousand remarks upon it and made me wish i had not in short whatever i could do or say there was no pleasing her and i was a creature and wench and all that was naught but you must not be angry with her on my account well but said he i suppose she hardly asked you to dine with her for she came before dinner i presume if it was soon after you had received my letter no sir dine with my lady no indeed why she would make me wait at table upon her with her woman because she would not expose herself and me before the menservants which you know sir was very good of her ladyship well said he but did you wait upon her would you have had me sir said i only pamela replied he if you did and knew not what belonged to your character as my wife i shall be very angry with you sir said i i did not but refused it out of consideration to the dignity you have raised me to else sir i could have waited on my knees upon your sister now said he you confirm my opinion of your prudence and judgment she is an insolent woman and shall dearly repent it but sir she is to be excused because she wont believe i am indeed married so dont be too angry at her ladyship he said ladies pray dont let us keep you from the company ill only ask a question or two more and attend you said lady jones i so much long to hear this story of poor madams persecution that if it was not improper i should be glad to stay miss darnford would stay for the same reason my master saying he had no secrets to ask and that it was kind of them to interest themselves in my grievances but lady darnford went into the company and told them the cause of my detention for it seems my dear master loved me too well to keep to himself the disappointment my not being here to receive him was to him and they had all given the two misses boroughs and mr perry the stamford guests such a character of me that they said they were impatient to see me said my master but pamela you said they and them who had my sister with her besides her woman her nephew sir and three footmen on horseback and she and her woman were in her chariot and six thats a sad coxcomb said he how did he behave to you not extraordinarily sir but i should not complain for i was even with him because i thought i ought not to bear with him as with my lady by heaven said he if i knew he behaved unhandsomely to my jewel id send him home to his uncle without his ears indeed sir returned i i was as hard upon him as he was upon me said he tis kind to say so but i believe i shall make them dearly repent their visit if i find their behaviour to call for my resentment but sure my dear you might have got away when you went to your own dinner indeed sir said i her ladyship locked me in and would not let me stir so you hant ate any dinner no indeed sir nor had a stomach for any my poor dear said he but then how got you away at last o sir replied i i jumped out of the parlour window and ran away to the chariot which had waited for me several hours by the elmwalk from the time of my ladys coming for i was just going as i said and mr colbrand conducted me through her servants whom she called to to stop me and was so kind to step behind the chariot unknown to me and saw me safe here im sure said he these insolent creatures must have treated you vilely but tell me what part did mrs jewkes act in this affair a very kind part sir said i in my behalf and i shall thank her for it sweet creature said he thou lovest to speak well of every body but i hope she deserves it for she knew you were married but come well now join the company and try to forget all you have suffered for two or three hours that we may not tire the company with our concerns and resume the subject as we go home and you shall find i will do you justice as i ought but you forgive me sir said i and are not angry forgive you my dear returned he i hope you forgive me i shall never make you satisfaction for what you have suffered from me and for me and with those words he led me into the company he very kindly presented me to the two stranger ladies and the gentleman and them to me and sir simon who was at cards rose from table and saluted me adad madam said he im glad to see you here what it seems you have been a prisoner twas well you was or your spouse and i should have sat in judgment upon you and condemned you to a fearful punishment for your first crime of laesae majestatis i had this explained to me afterwards as a sort of treason against my liege lord and husband for we husbands hereabouts said he are resolved to turn over a new leaf with our wives and your lord and master shall shew us the way i can tell you that but i see by your eyes my sweet culprit added he and your complexion you have had sour sauce to your sweet meat miss darnford said i think we are obliged to our sweet guest at last for she was forced to jump out at a window to come to us indeed said mrs peters and my masters back being turned says she lady davers when a maiden was always vastly passionate but a very good lady when her passion was over and shed make nothing of slapping her maids about and begging their pardons afterwards if they took it patiently otherwise she used to say the creatures were even with her ay said i i have been a many creatures and wenches and i know not what for these were the names she gave me and i thought i ought to act up to the part her dear brother has given me and so i have but just escaped a good cuffing miss boroughs said to her sister as i overheard but she did not design i should what a sweet creature is this and then she takes so little upon her is so free so easy and owns the honour done her so obligingly said mr perry softly the loveliest person i ever saw who could have the heart to be angry with her one moment says miss darnford here my dearest neighbour these gentry are admiring you strangely and mr perry says you are the loveliest lady he ever saw and he says it to his own mistresss face too ill assure you or else says miss boroughs i should think he much flattered me o madam you are exceedingly obliging but your kind opinion ought to teach me humility and to reverence so generous a worth as can give a preference against yourself where it is so little due indeed madam said miss nanny boroughs i love my sister well but it would be a high compliment to any lady to be deemed worthy a second or third place after you there is no answering such politeness said i i am sure lady davers was very cruel to keep me from such company twas our loss madam says miss darnford ill allow it said i in degree for you have all been deprived several hours of an humble admirer mr perry said i never before saw so young a lady shine forth with such graces of mind and person alas sir said i my master coming up mine is but a borrowed shine like that of the moon here is the sun to whose fervent glow of generosity i owe all the faint lustre that your goodness is pleased to look upon with so much kind distinction mr perry was pleased to hold up his hands and the ladies looked upon one another and my master said hearing part of the last sentence whats the pretty subject that my pamela is displaying so sweetly her talents upon oh sir said mr perry i will pronounce you the happiest man in england and so said they all my master said most generously thank ye thank ye thank ye all round my dear friends i know not your subject but if you believe me so for a single instance of this dear girls goodness what must i think myself when blessed with a thousand instances and experiencing it in every single act and word i do assure you my pamelas person all lovely as you see it is far short of her mind that indeed first attracted my admiration and made me her lover but they were the beauties of her mind that made me her husband and proud my sweet dear said he pressing my hand am i of that title well said mr perry very kindly and politely excellent as your lady is i know not the gentleman that could deserve her but that one who could say such just and such fine things i was all abashed and took miss darnfords hand and said save me dear miss by your sweet example from my rising pride but could i deserve half these kind things what a happy creature should i be said miss darnford you deserve them all indeed you do the greatest part of the company having sat down to loo my master being pressed said he would take one game at whist but had rather be excused too having been up all night and i asked how his friend did well talk of that said he another time which and his seriousness made me fear the poor gentleman was dead as it proved we cast in and miss boroughs and my master were together and mr perry and i and i had all four honours the first time and we were up at one deal said my master an honourable hand pamela should go with an honourable heart but youd not have been up if a knave had not been one whist sir said mr perry you know was a court game originally and the knave i suppose signified always the prime minister tis well said my master if now there is but one knave in a court out of four persons take the court through the king and queen sir said mr perry can do no wrong you know so there are two that must be good out of four and the ace seems too plain a card to mean much hurt we compliment the king said my master in that manner and tis well to do so because there is something sacred in the character but yet if force of example be considered it is going a great way for certainly a good master makes a good servant generally speaking one thing added he i will say in regard to the ace i have always looked upon that plain and honest looking card in the light you do and have considered whist as an english game in its original which has made me fonder of it than of any other for by the ace i have always thought the laws of the land denoted and as the ace is above the king or queen and wins them i think the law should be thought so too though may be i shall be deemed a whig for my opinion i shall never play whist said mr perry without thinking of this and shall love the game the better for the thought though i am no partyman nor i said my master for i think the distinctions of whig and tory odious and love the one or the other only as they are honest and worthy men and have never nor never shall hope given a vote but according to what i thought was for the public good let either whig or tory propose it i wish sir replied mr perry all gentlemen in your station would act so if there was no undue influence said my master i am willing to think so well of all mankind that i believe they generally would but you see said he by my pamelas hand when all the courtcards get together and are acted by one mind the game is usually turned accordingly though now and then too it may be so circumstanced that honours will do them no good and they are forced to depend altogether upon tricks i thought this way of talking prettier than the game itself but i said though i have won the game i hope i am no trickster no said my master god forbid but courtcards should sometimes win with honour but you see for all that your game is as much owing to the knave as the king and you my fairone lost no advantage when it was put into your power else sir said i i should not have done justice to my partner you are certainly right pamela replied he though you thereby beat your husband sir said i you may be my partner next and i must do justice you know well said he always choose so worthy a friend as chance has given you for a partner and i shall never find fault with you do what you will mr perry said you are very good to me sir and miss boroughs i observed seemed pleased with the compliment to her humble servant by which i saw she esteemed him as he appears to deserve dear sir said i how much better is this than to be locked in by lady davers the supper was brought in sooner on my account because i had had no dinner and there passed very agreeable compliments on the occasion lady darnford would help me first because i had so long fasted as she said sir simon would have placed himself next me and my master said he thought it was best where there was an equal number of ladies and gentlemen that they should sit intermingled that the gentlemen might be employed in helping and serving the ladies lady darnford said she hoped sir simon would not sit above any ladies at his own table especially well said he i shall sit overagainst her however and thats as well my dearest sir could not keep his eyes off me and seemed generously delighted with all i did and all i said and every one was pleased to see his kind and affectionate behaviour to me lady jones brought up the discourse about lady davers again and my master said i fear pamela you have been hardly used more than youll say i know my sisters passionate temper too well to believe she could be overcivil to you especially as it happened so unluckily that i was out if added he she had no pique to you my dear yet what has passed between her and me has so exasperated her that i know she would have quarrelled with my horse if she had thought i valued it and nobody else was in her way dear sir said i dont say so of good lady davers why my dear said he i know she came on purpose to quarrel and had she not found herself under a very violent uneasiness after what had passed between us and my treatment of her lords letter she would not have offered to come near me what sort of language had she for me pamela o sir very good only her wellmannered brother and such as that only said he tis taking up the attention of the company disagreeably or i could tell you almost every word she said lady jones wished to hear a further account of my ladys conduct and most of the company joined with her particularly mrs peters who said that as they knew the story and lady daverss temper though she was very good in the main they could wish to be so agreeably entertained if he and i pleased because they imagined i should have no difficulties after this tell me then pamela said he did she lift up her hand at you did she strike you but i hope not a little slap of the hand said i or so insolent woman she did not i hope offer to strike your face why said i i was a little saucy once or twice and she would have given me a cuff on the ear if her woman and mrs jewkes had not interposed why did you not come out at the door because said i her ladyship sat in the chair against it one while and another while locked it else i offered several times to get away she knew i expected you here you say you shewed her my letter to you yes sir said i but i had better not for she as then more exasperated and made strange comments upon it i doubt it not said he but did she not see by the kind epithets in it that there was no room to doubt of our being married o sir replied i and made the company smile she said for that very reason she was sure i was not married thats like my sister said he exactly like her and yet she lives very happily herself for her poor lord never contradicts her indeed he dares not you were a great many wenches were you not my dear for thats a great word with her yes sir said i wenches and creatures out of number and worse than all that what tell me my dear sir said i i must not have you angry with lady davers while you are so good to me tis all nothing only the trouble i have that i cannot be suffered to shew how much i honoured her ladyship as your sister well said he you need not be afraid to tell me i must love her after all though i shall not be pleased with her on this occasion i know it is her love for me though thus oddly expressed that makes her so uneasy and after all she comes im sure to be reconciled to me though it must be through a good hearty quarrel first for she can shew a good deal of sunshine but it must be always after a storm and ill love her dearly if she has not been and will not be too hard upon my dearest mr peters said sir you are very good and very kind i love to see this complaisance to your sister though she be in fault so long as you can shew it with so much justice to the sweetest innocence and merit in the world by all thats good mr peters said he id present my sister with a thousand pounds if she would kindly take my dear pamela by the hand and wish her joy and call her sister and yet i should be unworthy of the dear creature that smiles upon me there if it was not principally for her sake and the pleasure it would give her that i say this for i will never be thoroughly reconciled to my sister till she does for i most sincerely think as to myself that my dear wife there she sits does me more honour in her new relation than she receives from me sir said i i am overwhelmed with your goodness and my eyes were filled with tears of joy and gratitude and all the company with one voice blessed him and lady jones was pleased to say the behaviour of you two happy ones to each other is the most edifying i ever knew i am always improved when i see you how happy would every good lady be with such a gentleman and every good gentleman with such a lady in short you seem made for one another o madam said i you are so kind so good to me that i know not how to thank you enough said she you deserve more than i can express for to all that know your story you are a matchless person you are an ornament to our sex and your virtue though mr b is so generous as he is has met with no more than its due reward god long bless you together you are said my dearest sir very good to me madam i am sure i have taken liberties in my former life that deserved not so much excellence i have offended extremely by trials glorious to my pamela but disgraceful to me against a virtue that i now consider as almost sacred and i shall not think i deserve her till i can bring my manners my sentiments and my actions to a conformity with her own in short my pamela continued he i want you to be nothing but what you are and have been you cannot be better and if you could it would be but filling me with despair to attain the awful heights of virtue at which you have arrived perhaps added the dear gentleman the scene i have beheld within these twelve hours has made me more serious than otherwise i should have been but ill assure you before all this good company i speak the sentiments of my heart and those not of this day only what a happy daughter is yours o my dear father and mother i owe it all to gods grace and to yours and my good ladys instructions and to these let me always look back with grateful acknowledgments that i may not impute to myself and be proud my inexpressible happiness the company were so kindly pleased with our concern and my dear masters goodness that he observing their indulgence and being himself curious to know the further particulars of what had passed between my lady and me repeated his question what she had called me besides wench and creature and i said my lady supposing i was wicked lamented over me very kindly my depravity and fall and said what a thousand pities it was so much virtue as she was pleased to say was so destroyed and that i had yielded after so noble a stand as she said excuse me gentlemen and ladies said i you know my story it seems and i am commanded by one who has a title to all my obedience to proceed they gave all of them bows of approbation that they might not interrupt me and i continued my story the menservants withdrawing at a motion of mr b on my looking towards them and then at lady darnfords coming in i proceeded i told her ladyship that i was still innocent and would be so and it was injurious to suppose me otherwise why tell me wench said she but i think i must not tell you what she said yes do said my master to clear my sister we shall think it very bad else i held my hand before my face why she said tell me wench hast thou not been hesitating a very free creature with thy master that she said or to that effect and when i said she asked strange questions and in strange words she ridiculed my delicacy as she called it and said my niceness would not last long she said i must know i was not really married that my ring was only a sham and all was my cunning to cloak my yielding and get better terms she said she knew the world as much at thirtytwo as i did at sixteen and bid me remember that i took the liberty to say but i got a good way off that i scorned her ladyships words and was as much married as her ladyship and then i had certainly been cuffed if her woman had not interposed and told her i was not worthy her anger and that i was as much to be pitied for my credulity as despised for my vanity my poor pamela said my master this was too too hard upon you o sir said i how much easier it was to me than if it had been so that would have broken my heart quite for then i should have deserved it all and worse and these reproaches added to my own guilt would have made me truly wretched lady darnford at whose righthand i sat kissed me with a kind of rapture and called me a sweet exemplar for all my sex mr peters said very handsome things so did mr perry and sir simon with tears in his eyes said to my master why neighbour neighbour this is excellent by my troth i believe there is something in virtue that we had not well considered on my soul there has been but one angel come down for these thousand years and you have got her well my dearest said my master pray proceed with your story until we have done supper since the ladies seem pleased with it why sir said i her ladyship went on in the same manner but said one time and held me by the hand she would give me an hundred guineas for one provoking word or if i would but say i believed myself married that she might fell me at her foot but sir you must not be angry with her ladyship she called me painted dirt babyface waitingmaid beggars brat and beggarborn but i said as long as i knew my innocence i was easy in every thing but to have my dear parents abused they were never beggars nor beholden to any body nor to any thing but gods grace and their own labour that they once lived in credit that misfortunes might befall any body and that i could not bear they should be treated so undeservedly then her ladyship said ay she supposed my masters folly would make us set up for a family and that the heralds office would shortly be searched to make it out exactly my sister again said he so you could not please her any way no indeed sir when she commanded me to fill her a glass of wine and would not let her woman do it she asked if i was above it i then said if to attend your ladyship at table or even kneel at your feet was required of me i would most gladly do it were i only the person you think me but if it be to triumph over one who has received honours which she thinks require from her another part that she may not be utterly unworthy of them i must say i cannot do it this quite astonished her ladyship and a little before her kinsman brought me the bottle and glass and required me to fill it for my lady at her command and called himself my deputy and i said tis in a good hand help my lady yourself so sir added i you see i could be a little saucy upon occasion you please me well my pamela said he this was quite right but proceed her ladyship said she was astonished adding she supposed i would have her look upon me as her brothers wife and asked me what in the name of impudence possessed me to dare to look upon myself as her sister and i said that was a question better became her most worthy brother to answer than me and then i thought i should have had her ladyship upon me but her woman interposed i afterwards told mrs jewkes at the window that since i was hindered from going to you i believed it was best to let robert go with the chariot and say lady davers was come and i could not leave her ladyship but this did not please and i thought it would too for she said no no hell think i make the creature my companion and know not how to part with her exactly said he my sister again and she said i knew nothing what belonged to people of condition how should i what shall i say madam said i nothing at all answered she let him expect his dearest love alluding to your kind epithet in your letter and be disappointed it is but adding a few more hours to this heavy absence and every one will become a day in his amorous account so to be short i saw nothing was to be done and i feared sir you would wonder at my stay and be angry and i watched my opportunity till my lady who was walking about the room was at the further end and the parlour being a groundfloor in a manner i jumped out at the window and ran for it her ladyship called after me so did her woman and i heard her say i flew like a bird and she called two of her servants in sight to stop me but i said touch me at your peril fellows and mr colbrand having been planted at hand by mrs jewkes who was very good in the whole affair and incurred her ladyships displeasure once or twice by taking my part seeing how i was used put on a fierce look cocked his hat with one hand and put tother on his sword and said he would chine the man who offered to touch his lady and so he ran alongside of me and could hardly keep pace with me and here my dear sir concluded i i am at yours and the good companys service they seemed highly pleased with my relation and my master said he was glad mrs jewkes behaved so well as also mr colbrand yes sir said i when mrs jewkes interposed once her ladyship said it was hard she who was born in that house could not have some privilege in it without being talked to by the saucy servants and she called her another time fatface and womaned her most violently well said my master i am glad my dear you have had such an escape my sister was always passionate as mrs peters knows and my poor mother had enough to do with us both for we neither of us wanted spirit and when i was a boy i never came home from school or college for a few days but though we longed to see one another before yet ere the first day was over we had a quarrel for she being seven years older than i was always for domineering over me and i could not bear it and i used on her frequently quarrelling with the maids and being always at a word and a blow to call her captain bab for her name is barbara and when my lord davers courted her my poor mother has made up quarrels between them three times in a day and i used to tell her she would certainly beat her husband marry whom she would if he did not beat her first and break her spirit yet has she continued he very good qualities she was a dutiful daughter is a good wife she is bountiful to her servants firm in her friendships charitable to the poor and i believe never any sister better loved a brother than she me and yet she always loved to vex and tease me and as i would bear a resentment longer than she shed be one moment the most provoking creature in the world and the next would do any thing to be forgiven and i have made her when she was the aggressor follow me all over the house and garden to be upon good terms with me but this case piques her more because she had found out a match for me in the family of a person of quality and had set her heart upon bringing it to effect and had even proceeded far in it without my knowledge and brought me into the ladys company unknowing of her design but i was then averse to matrimony upon any terms and was angry at her proceeding in it so far without my privity or encouragement and she cannot for this reason bear the thoughts of my being now married and to her mothers waitingmaid too as she reminds my dear pamela when i had declined her proposal with the daughter of a noble earl this is the whole case said he and allowing for the pride and violence of her spirit and that she knows not as i do the transcendent excellencies of my dear pamela and that all her view in her own conception is mine and the family honour she is a little to be allowed for though never fear my pamela but that i who never had a struggle with her wherein i did not get the better will do you justice and myself too this account of lady davers pleased every body and was far from being to her ladyships disadvantage in the main and i would do any thing in the world to have the honour to be in her good graces yet i fear it will not be easily if at all effected but i will proceed after supper nothing would serve miss darnford and miss boroughs but we must have a dance and mr peters who plays a good fiddle urged it forward my dear master though in a ridingdress took out miss boroughs sir simon for a man of his years danced well and took me out but put on one of his free jokes that i was fitter to dance with a younger man and he would have it though i had not danced since my dear ladys death to signify except once or twice to please mrs jervis and indeed believed all my dancing days over that as my master and i were the best dancers we should dance once together before folks as the odd gentleman said and my dear sir was pleased to oblige him and afterwards danced with miss darnford who has much more skill and judgment than i though they compliment me with an easier shape and air we left the company with great difficulty at about eleven my dear master having been up all night before and we being at the greatest distance from home though they seemed inclinable not to break up so soon as they were neighbours and the ladies said they longed to hear what would be the end of lady daverss interview with her brother my master said he feared we must not now think of going next day to bedfordshire as we had intended and perhaps might see them again and so we took leave and set out for home where we arrived not till twelve oclock and found lady davers had gone to bed about eleven wanting sadly that we should come home first but so did not i mrs jewkes told us that my lady was sadly fretted that i had got away so and seemed a little apprehensive of what i would say of the usage i had received from her she asked mrs jewkes if she thought i was really married and mrs jewkes telling her yes she fell into a passion and said begone bold woman i cannot bear thee see not my face till i send for thee thou hast been very impudent to me once or twice today already and art now worse than ever she said she would not have told her ladyship if she had not asked her and was sorry she had offended she sent for her at supper time said she i have another question to ask thee woman and tell me yes if thou darest was ever any thing so odd why then said mrs jewkes i will say no before your ladyship speaks my master laughed poor woman said he she called her insolent and assurance and said begone bold woman as thou art but come hither dost thou know if that young harlot is to be with my brother tonight she said she knew not what to answer because she had threatened her if she said yes but at last my lady said i will know the bottom of this iniquity i suppose they wont have so much impudence to be together while im in the house but i dare say they have been bedfellows said she i will lie tonight in the room i was born in so get that bed ready that room being our bedchamber mrs jewkes after some hesitation replied madam my master lies there and has the key i believe woman said she thou tellest me a story indeed madam said she he does and has some papers there he will let nobody see for mrs jewkes said she feared she would beat her if she went up and found by my clothes and some of my masters how it was so she said i will then lie in the best room as it is called and jackey shall lie in the little green room adjoining to it has thy master got the keys of those no madam said mrs jewkes i will order them to be made ready for your ladyship and where dost thou lay they pursy sides said she up two pair of stairs madam next the garden and where lies the young harlotry continued she sometimes with me madam said she and sometimes with thy virtuous master i suppose said my lady ha woman what sayest thou i must not speak said mrs jewkes well thou mayest go said she but thou hast the air of a secret keeper of that sort i dare say thoult set the good work forward most cordially poor mrs jewkes said my master and laughed most heartily this talk we had whilst we were undressing so she and her woman lay together in the room my master lay in before i was happy i said dear sir pray in the morning let me lock myself up in the closet as soon as you rise and not be called down for ever so much for i am afraid to see her ladyship and i will employ myself about my journal while these things are in my head dont be afraid my dear said he am not i with you mrs jewkes pitied me for what i had undergone in the day and i said we wont make the worst of it to my dear master because we wont exasperate where we would reconcile but added i i am much obliged to you mrs jewkes and i thank you said my master i hope she did not beat your lady mrs jewkes not much sir said she but i believe i saved my lady once yet added she i was most vexed at the young lord ay mrs jewkes said my master let me know his behaviour i can chastise him though i cannot my sister who is a woman let me therefore know the part he acted nothing my dear sir said i but impertinence if i may so say and foolishness that was very provoking but i spared him not and so there is no room sir for your anger no sir said mrs jewkes nothing else indeed how was her woman said my master pretty impertinent replied mrs jewkes as ladies women will be but said i you know she saved me once or twice very true madam returned mrs jewkes and she said to me at table that you were a sweet creature she never saw your equal but that you had a spirit and she was sorry you answered her lady so who never bore so much contradiction before i told her added mrs jewkes that if i was in your ladyships place i should have taken much more upon me and that you were all sweetness and she said i was got over she saw tuesday morning the sixth of my happiness my master had said to mrs jewkes that he should not rise till eight or nine as he had sat up all the night before but it seems my lady knowing he usually rose about six got up soon after that hour raised her woman and her nephew having a whimsical scheme in her head to try to find whether we were in bed together and about half an hour after six she rapped at our chamber door my master was waked at the noise and asked who was there open the door said she open it this minute i said clinging about his neck dear dear sir pray pray dont o save me save me dont fear pamela said he the womans mad i believe but he called out who are you what do you want you know my voice well enough said she i will come in pray sir said i dont let her ladyship in dont be frightened my dear said he she thinks we are not married and are afraid to be found abed together ill let her in but she shant come near my dearest so he slipt out of bed and putting on some of his clothes and gown and slippers he said what bold body dare disturb my repose thus and opened the door in rushed she ill see your wickedness said she i will in vain shall you think to hide it from me what should i hide said he how dare you set a foot into my house after the usage i have received from you i had covered myself over head and ears and trembled every joint he looked and spied her woman and kinsman in the room she crying out bear witness jackey bear witness beck the creature is now in his bed and not seeing the young gentleman before who was at the feet of the bed he said how now sir whats your business in this apartment begone this moment and he went away directly beck said my lady you see the creature is in his bed i do madam answered she my master came to me and said ay look beck and bear witness here is my pamela my dear angel my lovely creature dont be afraid look up and see how frantickly this woman of quality behaves at that i just peeped and saw my lady who could not bear this coming to me and she said wicked abandoned wretch vile brother to brave me thus ill tear the creature out of bed before your face and expose you both as you deserve at that he took her in his arms as if she had been nothing and carrying her out of the room she cried out beck beck help me beck the wretch is going to fling me down stairs her woman ran to him and said good sir for heavens sake do no violence to my lady her ladyship has been ill all night he sat her down in the chamber she lay in and she could not speak for passion take care of your lady said he and when she has rendered herself more worthy of my attention ill see her till then at her peril and yours too come not near my apartment and so he came to me and with all the sweet soothing words in the world pacified my fears and gave me leave to go to write in my closet as soon as my fright was over and to stay there till things were more calm and so he dressed himself and went out of the chamber permitting me at my desire to fasten the door after him at breakfasttime my master tapped at the door and i said whos there i my dearest said he oh then replied i i will open it with pleasure i had written on a good deal but i put it by when i ran to the door i would have locked it again when he was in but he said am not i here dont be afraid said he will you come down to breakfast my love o no dear sir said i be pleased to excuse me said he i cannot bear the look of it that the mistress of my house should breakfast in her closet as if she durst not come down and i at home o dearest sir replied i pray pass that over for my sake and dont let my presence aggravate your sister for a kind punctilio then my dear said he i will breakfast with you here no pray dear sir answered i breakfast with your sister that my dear replied he will too much gratify her pride and look like a slight to you dear sir said i your goodness is too great for me to want punctilious proofs of it pray oblige her ladyship she is your guest surely sir you may be freest with your dutiful wife she is a strange woman said he how i pity her she has thrown herself into a violent fit of the colic through passion and is but now her woman says a little easier i hope sir said i when you carried her ladyship out you did not hurt her no replied he i love her too well i set her down in the apartment she had chosen and she but now desires to see me and that i will breakfast with her or refuses to touch any thing but if my dearest please i will insist it shall be with you at the same time o no no dear sir said i i should not forgive myself if i did i would on my knees beg her ladyships goodness to me now i am in your presence though i thought i ought to carry it a little stiff when you were absent for the sake of the honour you have done me and dear sir if my deepest humility will please permit me to shew it you shall do nothing returned he unworthy of my wife to please the proud woman but i will however permit you to breakfast by yourself this once as i have not seen her since i have used her in so barbarous a manner as i understand she exclaims i have and as she will not eat any thing unless i give her my company so he saluted me and withdrew and i locked the door after him again for fear mrs jewkes soon after rapped at the door whos there said i only i madam so i opened the door tis a sad thing madam said she you should be so much afraid in your own house she brought me some chocolate and toast and i asked her about my ladys behaviour she said she would not suffer any body to attend but her woman because she would not be heard what she had to say but she believed she said her master was very angry with the young lord as she called her kinsman for as she passed by the door she heard him say in a high tone i hope sir you did not forget what belongs to the character you assume or to that effect about one oclock my master came up again and he said will you come down to dinner pamela when i send for you whatever you command sir i must do but my lady wont desire to see me no matter whether she will or no but i will not suffer that she shall prescribe her insolent will to my wife and in your own house too i will by my tenderness to you mortify her pride and it cannot be done so well as to her face dearest sir said i pray indulge me and let me dine here by myself it will make my lady but more inveterate said he i have told her we are married she is out of all patience about it and yet pretends not to believe it upon that i tell her then she shall have it her own way and that i am not and what has she to do with it either way she has scolded and begged commanded and prayed blessed me and cursed me by turns twenty times in these few hours and i have sometimes soothed her sometimes raged and at last left her and took a turn in the garden for an hour to compose myself because you should not see how the foolish woman has ruffled me and just now i came out seeing her coming in just as he had said so i cried oh my lady my lady for i heard her voice in the chamber saying brother brother one word with you stopping in sight of the closet where i was he stepped out and she went up to the window that looks towards the garden and said mean fool that i am to follow you up and down the house in this manner though i am shunned and avoided by you you a brother you a barbarian is it possible we could be born of one mother why said he do you charge me with a conduct to you that you bring upon yourself is it not surprising that you should take the liberty with me that the dear mother you have named never gave you an example for to any of her relations was it not sufficient that i was insolently taken to task by you in your letters but my retirements must be invaded my house insulted and if i have one person dearer to me than another that that person must be singled out for an object of your violence ay said she that one person is the thing but though i came with a resolution to be temperate and to expostulate with you on your avoiding me so unkindly yet cannot i have patience to look upon that bed in which i was born and to be made the guilty scene of your wickedness with such a hush said he i charge you call not the dear girl by any name unworthy of her you know not as i told you her excellence and i desire youll not repeat the freedoms you have taken below she stamped with her foot and said god give me patience so much contempt to a sister that loves you so well and so much tenderness to a vile he put his hand before her mouth be silent said he once more i charge you you know not the innocence you abuse so freely i ought not neither will i bear it she sat down and fanned herself and burst into tears and such sobs of grief or rather passion that grieved me to hear and i sat and trembled sadly he walked about the room in great anger and at last said let me ask you lady davers why i am thus insolently to be called to account by you am i not independent am i not of age am i not at liberty to please myself would to god that instead of a woman and my sister any man breathing had dared whatever were his relation under that of a father to give himself half the airs you have done why did you not send on this accursed errand your lord who could write me such a letter as no gentleman should write nor any gentleman tamely receive he should have seen the difference we all know said she that since your italian duel you have commenced a bravo and all your airs breathe as strongly of the manslayer as of the libertine this said he i will bear for i have no reason to be ashamed of that duel nor the cause of it since it was to save a friend and because it is levelled at myself only but suffer not your tongue to take too great a liberty with my pamela she interrupted him in a violent burst of passion if i bear this said she i can bear any thing o the little strumpet he interrupted her then and said wrathfully begone rageful woman begone this moment from my presence leave my house this instant i renounce you and all relation to you and never more let me see your face or call me brother and took her by the hand to lead her out she laid hold of the curtains of the window and said i will not go you shall not force me from you thus ignominiously in the wretchs hearing and suffer her to triumph over me in your barbarous treatment of me not considering any thing i ran out of the closet and threw myself at my dear masters feet as he held her hand in order to lead her out and i said dearest sir let me beg that no act of unkindness for my sake pass between so worthy and so near relations dear dear madam said i and clasped her knees pardon and excuse the unhappy cause of all this evil on my knees i beg your ladyship to receive me to your grace and favour and you shall find me incapable of any triumph but in your ladyships goodness to me creature said she art thou to beg an excuse for me art thou to implore my forgiveness is it to thee i am to owe the favour that i am not cast headlong from my brothers presence begone to thy corner wench begone i say lest thy paramour kill me for trampling thee under my foot rise my dear pamela said my master rise dear life of my life and expose not so much worthiness to the ungrateful scorn of so violent a spirit and so he led me to my closet again and there i sat and wept her woman came up just as he had led me to my closet and was returning to her lady and she very humbly said excuse my intrusion good sir i hope i may come to my lady yes mrs worden said he you may come in and pray take your lady down stairs with you for fear i should too much forget what belongs either to my sister or myself i began to think seeing her ladyship so outrageous with her brother what a happy escape i had had the day before though hardly enough used in conscience too as i thought her woman begged her ladyship to walk down and she said beck seest thou that bed that was the bed that i was born in and yet that was the bed thou sawest as well as i the wicked pamela in this morning and this brother of mine just risen from her true said he you both saw it and it is my pride that you could see it tis my bridal bed and tis abominable that the happiness i knew before you came hither should be so barbarously interrupted swear to me but thou bold wretch said she swear to me that pamela andrews is really and truly thy lawful wife without sham without deceit without doublemeaning and i know what i have to say ill humour you for once said he and then swore a solemn oath that i was and said he did i not tell you so at first i cannot yet believe you said she because in this particular i had rather have called you knave than fool provoke me not too much said he for if i should as much forget myself as you have done youd have no more of a brother in me than i have a sister in you who married you said she tell me that was it not a broken attorney in a parsons habit tell me truly in the wenchs hearing when shes undeceived shell know how to behave herself better thank god thought i it is not so no said he and ill tell you that i bless god i abhorred that project before it was brought to bear and mr williams married us nay then said she but answer me another question or two i beseech you who gave her away parson peters said he where was the ceremony performed in my little chapel which you may see as it was put in order on purpose now said she i begin to fear there is something in it but who was present said she methinks replied he i look like a fine puppy to suffer myself to be thus interrogated by an insolent sister but if you must know mrs jewkes was present o the procuress said she but nobody else yes said he all my heart and soul wretch said she and what would thy father and mother have said had they lived to this day their consents replied he i should have thought it my duty to ask but not yours madam suppose said she i had married my fathers groom what would you have said to that i could not have behaved worse replied he than you have done and would you not have thought said she i had deserved it said he does your pride let you see no difference in the case you put none at all said she where can the difference be between a beggars son married by a lady or a beggars daughter made a gentlemans wife then ill tell you replied he the difference is a man ennobles the woman he takes be she who she will and adopts her into his own rank be it what it will but a woman though ever so nobly born debases herself by a mean marriage and descends from her own rank to his she stoops to when the royal family of stuart allied itself into the low family of hyde comparatively low i mean did any body scruple to call the lady royal highness and duchess of york and did any body think her daughters the late queen mary and queen anne less royal for that when the brokenfortuned peer goes into the city to marry a rich tradesmans daughter be he duke or earl does not his consort immediately become ennobled by his choice and who scruples to call her lady duchess or countess but when a duchess or countess dowager descends to mingle with a person of obscure birth does she not then degrade herself and is she not effectually degraded and will any duchess or countess rank with her now lady davers do you not see a difference between my marrying my dear mothers beloved and deserving waitingmaid with a million of excellencies about her and such graces of mind and person as would adorn any distinction and your marrying a sordid groom whose constant train of education conversation and opportunities could possibly give him no other merit than that which must proceed from the vilest lowest taste in his sordid dignifier o the wretch said she how he finds excuses to palliate his meanness again said he let me observe to you lady davers when a duke marries a private person is he not still her head by virtue of being her husband but when a lady descends to marry a groom is not the groom her head being her husband and does not the difference strike you for what lady of quality ought to respect another who has made so sordid a choice and set a groom above her for would not that be to put that groom upon a par with themselves call this palliation or what you will but if you see not the difference you are blind and a very unfit judge for yourself much more unfit to be a censurer of me id have you said she publish your fine reasons to the world and they will be sweet encouragements to all the young gentlemen who read them to cast themselves away on the servantwenches in their families not at all lady davers replied he for if any young gentleman stays till he finds such a person as my pamela so enriched with the beauties of person and mind so well accomplished and so fitted to adorn the degree she is raised to he will stand as easily acquitted as i shall be to all the world that sees her except there be many more lady davers than i apprehend can possibly be met with and so returned she you say you are actually and really married honestly or rather foolishly married to this slut i am indeed says he if you presume to call her so and why should i not if i please who is there ought to contradict me whom have i hurt by it have i not an estate free and independent am i likely to be beholden to you or any of my relations and why when i have a sufficiency in my own single hands should i scruple to make a woman equally happy who has all i want for beauty virtue prudence and generosity too i will tell you she has more than any lady i ever saw yes lady davers she has all these naturally they are born with her and a few years education with her genius has done more for her than a whole life has done for others no more no more i beseech you said she thou surfeitest me honest man with thy weak folly thou art worse than an idolater thou hast made a graven image and thou fallest down and worshippest the works of thy own hands and jeroboamlike wouldst have every body else bow down before thy calf well said lady davers whenever your passion suffers you to descend to witticism tis almost over with you but let me tell you though i myself worship this sweet creature that you call such names i want nobody else to do it and should be glad you had not intruded upon me to interrupt me in the course of our mutual happiness well said well said my kind my wellmannered brother said she i shall after this very little interrupt your mutual happiness ill assure you i thought you a gentleman once and prided myself in my brother but ill say now with the burial service ashes to ashes and dirt to dirt ay said he lady davers and there we must all end at last you with all your pride and i with my plentiful fortune must come to it and then where will be your distinction let me tell you except you and i both mend our manners though you have been no duellist no libertine as you call me this amiable girl whom your vanity and folly so much despise will outsoar us both infinitely outsoar us and he who judges best will give the preference where due without regard to birth or fortune egregious preacher said she what my brother already turned puritan see what marriage and repentance may bring a man to i heartily congratulate this change well said she and came towards me and i trembled to see her coming but her brother followed to observe her and i stood up at her approach and she said give me thy hand mrs pamela mrs andrews mrs what shall i call thee thou hast done wonders in a little time thou hast not only made a rake a husband but thou hast made a rake a preacher but take care added she after all in ironical anger and tapped me on the neck take care that thy vanity begins not where his ends and that thou callest not thyself my sister she shall i hope lady davers said he when she can make as great a convert of you from pride as she has of me from libertinism mrs jewkes just then came up and said dinner was ready come my pamela said my dear master you desired to be excused from breakfasting with us but i hope youll give lady davers and me your company to dinner how dare you insult me thus said my lady how dare you said he insult me by your conduct in my own house after i have told you i am married how dare you think of staying here one moment and refuse my wife the honours that belong to her as such merciful god said she give me patience and held her hand to her forehead pray sir dear sir said i excuse me dont vex my lady be silent my dear love said he you see already what you have got by your sweet condescension you have thrown yourself at her feet and insolent as she is she has threatened to trample upon you shell ask you presently if she is to owe her excuse to your interposition and yet nothing else can make her forgiven poor lady she could not bear this and as if she was discomposed she ran to her poor grieved woman and took hold of her hand and said lead me down lead me down beck let us instantly quit this house this cursed house that once i took pleasure in order the fellows to get ready and i will never see it nor its owner more and away she went down stairs in a great hurry and the servants were ordered to make ready for their departure i saw my master was troubled and i went to him and said pray dear sir follow my lady down and pacify her tis her love to you poor woman said he i am concerned for her but i insist upon your coming down since things are gone so far her pride will get new strength else and we shall be all to begin again dearest dear sir said i excuse my going down this once indeed my dear i wont replied he what shall it be said that my sister shall scare my wife from my table and i present no i have borne too much already and so have you and i charge you come down when i send for you he departed saying these words and i durst not dispute for i saw he was determined and there is as much majesty as goodness in him as i have often had reason to observe though never more than on the present occasion with his sister her ladyship instantly put on her hood and gloves and her woman tied up a handkerchief full of things for her principal matters were not unpacked and her coachman got her chariot ready and her footmen their horses and she appeared resolved to go but her kinsman and mr colbrand had taken a turn together somewhere and she would not come in but sat fretting on a seat in the foreyard with her woman by her and at last said to one of the footmen do you james stay to attend my nephew and well take the road we came mrs jewkes went to her ladyship and said your ladyship will be pleased to stay dinner tis just coming upon table no said she i have enough of this house i have indeed but give my service to your master and i wish him happier than he has made me he had sent for me down and i came though unwillingly and the cloth was laid in the parlour i had jumped out of and there was my master walking about it mrs jewkes came in and asked if he pleased to have dinner brought in for my lady would not come in but desired her service and wished him happier than he had made her he seeing her at the window when he went to that side of the room all ready to go stept out to her and said lady davers if i thought you would not be hardened rather than softened by my civility i would ask you to walk in and at least let your kinsman and servants dine before they go she wept and turned her face from him to hide it he took her hand and said come sister let me prevail upon you walk in no said she dont ask me i wish i could hate you as much as you hate me you do said he and a great deal more ill assure you or else youd not vex me as you do come pray walk in dont ask me said she her kinsman just then returned why madam said he your ladyship wont go till you have dined i hope no jackey said she i cant stay im an intruder here it seems think said my master of the occasion you gave for that word your violent passions are the only intruders lay them aside and never sister was dearer to a brother dont say such another word said she i beseech you for i am too easy to forgive you any thing for one kind word you shall have one hundred said he nay ten thousand if they will do my dear sister and kissing her he added pray give me your hand john said he put up the horses you are all as welcome to me for all your ladys angry with me as at any inn you can put up at come mr h said he lead your aunt in for she wont permit that honour to me this quite overcame her and she said giving her brother her hand yes i will and you shall lead me any where and kissed him but dont think said she i can forgive you neither and so he led her into the parlour where i was but said she why do you lead me to this wench tis my wife my dear sister and if you will not love her yet dont forget common civilities to her for your own sake pray madam said her kinsman since your brother is pleased to own his marriage we must not forget common civilities as mr b says and sir added he permit me to wish you joy thank you sir said he and may i said he looking at me yes sir replied my master so he saluted me very complaisantly and said i vow to gad madam i did not know this yesterday and if i was guilty of a fault i beg your pardon my lady said thourt a goodnatured foolish fellow thou mightst have saved this nonsensical parade till i had given thee leave why aunt said he if they are actually married theres no help for it and we must not make mischief between man and wife but brother said she do you think ill sit at table with the creature no contemptuous names i beseech you lady davers i tell you she is really my wife and i must be a villain to suffer her to be ill used she has no protector but me and if you will permit her she will always love and honour you indeed indeed i will madam said i i cannot i wont sit down at table with her said she pamela i hope thou dost not think i will indeed madam said i if your good brother will permit it i will attend your chair all the time you dine to shew my veneration for your ladyship as the sister of my kind protector see said he her condition has not altered her but i cannot permit in her a conduct unworthy of my wife and i hope my sister will not expect it neither let her leave the room replied she if i must stay indeed you are out of the way aunt said her kinsman that is not right as things stand said my master no madam that must not be but if it must be so well have two tables you and your nephew shall sit at one and my wife and i at the other and then see what a figure your unreasonable punctilio will make you cut she seemed irresolute and he placed her at the table the first course which was fish being brought in where said she to me wouldst thou presume to sit wouldst have me give place to thee too wench come come said my master ill put that out of dispute and so set himself down by her ladyship at the upper end of the table and placed me at his left hand excuse me my dear said he this once excuse me oh your cursed complaisance said she to such a hush sister hush said he i will not bear to hear her spoken slightly of tis enough that to oblige your violent and indecent caprice you make me compromise with you thus come sir added he pray take your place next your gentle aunt beck said she do you sit down by pamela there since it must be so well be hail fellow all with all my heart replied my master i have so much honour for all the sex that i would not have the meanest person of it stand while i sit had i been to have made the custom mrs worden pray sit down sir said she i hope i shall know my place better my lady sat considering and then lifting up her hands said lord what will this world come to to nothing but whats very good replied my master if such spirits as lady daverss do but take the rule of it shall i help you sister to some of the carp help your beloved said she thats kind said he now thats my good lady davers here my love let me help you since my sister desires it mighty well returned she mighty well but sat on one side turning from me as it were dear aunt said her kinsman lets see you buss and be friends since tis so what signifies it hold thy fools tongue said she is thy tone so soon turned since yesterday said my master i hope nothing affronting was offered yesterday to my wife in her own house she hit him a good smart slap on the shoulder take that impudent brother said she ill wife you and in her own house she seemed half afraid but he in very good humour kissed her and said i thank you sister i thank you but i have not had a blow from you before for some time fore gad said her kinsman tis very kind of you to take it so well her ladyship is as good a woman as ever lived but ive had many a cuff from her myself i wont put it up neither said my master except youll assure me you have seen her serve her lord so i pressed my foot to his and said softly dont dear sir what said she is the creature begging me off from insult if his manners wont keep him from outraging me i wont owe his forebearance to thee wench said my master and put some fish on my ladys plate well does lady davers use the word insult but come let me see you eat one mouthful and ill forgive you and he put the knife in one of her hands and the fork in the other as i hope to live said he i cannot bear this silly childishness for nothing at all i am quite ashamed of it she put a little bit to her mouth but laid it down in her plate again i cannot eat said she i cannot swallow im sure it will certainly choak me he had forbid his menservants to come in that they might not behold the scene he expected and rose from table himself and filled a glass of wine her woman offering and her kinsman rising to do it meantime his seat between us being vacant she turned to me how now confidence said she darest thou sit next me why dost thou not rise and take the glass from thy property sit still my dear said he ill help you both but i arose for i was afraid of a good cuff and said pray sir let me help my lady so you shall replied he when shes in a humour to receive it as she ought sister said he with a glass in his hand pray drink youll perhaps eat a little bit of something then is this to insult me said she no really returned he but to incite you to eat for youll be sick for want of it she took the glass and said god forgive you wicked wretch for your usage of me this day this is a little as it used to be i once had your love and now it is changed and for whom that vexes me and wept so she was forced to set down the glass you dont do well said he you neither treat me like your brother nor a gentleman and if you would suffer me i would love you as well as ever but for a woman of sense and understanding and a finebred woman as i once thought my sister you act quite a childish part come added he and held the glass to her lips let your brother that you once loved prevail on you to drink this glass of wine she then drank it he kissed her and said oh how passion deforms the noblest minds you have lost a good deal of that loveliness that used to adorn my sister and let me persuade you to compose yourself and be my sister again for lady davers is indeed a fine woman and has a presence as majestic for a lady as her dear brother has for a gentleman he then sat down between us again and said when the second course came in let abraham come in and wait i touched his toe again but he minded it not and i saw he was right for her ladyship began to recollect herself and did not behave half so ill before the servants as she had done and helped herself with some little freedom but she could not forbear a strong sigh and a sob now and then she called for a glass of the same wine she had drank before said he shall i help you again lady davers and rose at the same time and went to the sideboard and filled her a glass indeed said she i love to be soothed by my brother your health sir said my master to me with great sweetness my dear now im up ill fill for you i must serve both sisters alike she looked at the servant as if he were a little check upon her and said to my master how now sir not that you know of he whispered her dont shew any contempt before my servants to one i have so deservedly made their mistress consider tis done ay said she thats the thing that kills me he gave me a glass my good ladys health sir said i that wont do said she leaning towards me softly and was going to say wench or creature or some such word and my master seeing abraham look towards her her eyes being red and swelled said indeed sister i would not vex myself about it if i was you about what said she why replied he about your lords not coming down as he had promised he sat down and she tapped him on the shoulder ah wicked one said she nor will that do neither why to be sure added he it would vex a lady of your sense and merit to be slighted if it was so but i am sure my lord loves you as well as you love him and you know not what may have happened she shook her head and said thats like your art this makes one amazed you should be so caught who my lord caught said he no no hell have more wit than so but i never heard you were jealous before nor said he have you any reason to think so now honest friend you need not wait said she my woman will help us to what we want yes let him replied he abraham fill me a glass come said my master lord davers to you madam i hope hell take care he is not found out youre very provoking brother said she i wish you were as good as lord davers but dont carry your jest too far well said he tis a tender point i own ive done by these kind managements the dinner passed over better than i expected and when the servants were withdrawn my master said still keeping his place between us i have a question to ask you lady davers and that is if youll bear me company to bedfordshire i was intending to set out thither tomorrow but ill tarry your pleasure if youll go with me is thy wife as thou callest her to go along with thee friend said she yes to be sure answered he my dear quaker sister and took her hand and smiled and wouldst have me parade it with her on the road hey and make one to grace her retinue hey tell me how thoudst chalk it out if i would do as thou wouldst have me honest friend he clasped his arms about her and kissed her you are a dear saucy sister said he but i must love you why ill tell you how id have it here shall you and my pamela leave out my i desire you if youd have me sit patiently no replied he i cant do that here shall you and my pamela go together in your chariot if you please and she will then appear as one of your retinue and your nephew and i will sometimes ride and sometimes go into my chariot to your woman shouldst thou like this creature said she to me if your ladyship think it not too great an honour for me madam said i yes replied she but my ladyship does think it would be too great an honour now i think of it said he this must not be neither for without youd give her the hand in your own chariot my wife would be thought your woman and that must not be why that would may be said she be the only inducement for me to bear her near me in my chariot but how then why then when we came home wed get lord davers to come to us and stay a month or two and what if he was to come why i would have you as i know you have a good fancy give pamela your judgment on some patterns i expect from london for clothes provoking wretch said she now i wish i may keep my hands to myself i dont say it to provoke you said he nor ought it to do so but when i tell you i am married is it not a consequence that we must have new clothes hast thou any more of these obliging things to say to me friend said she i will make you a present returned he worth your acceptance if you will grace us with your company at church when we make our appearance take that said she if i die for it wretch that thou art and was going to hit him a great slap but he held her hand her kinsman said dear aunt i wonder at you why all these are things of course i begged leave to withdraw and as i went out my good master said theres a person theres a shape theres a sweetness o lady davers were you a man you would doat on her as i do yes said the naughty lady so i should for my harlot but not for my wife i turned on this and said indeed your ladyship is cruel and well may gentlemen take liberties when ladies of honour say such things and i wept and added your ladyships inference if your good brother was not the most generous of men would make me very unhappy no fear wench no fear said she thoult hold him as long as any body can i see that poor sally godfrey never had half the interest in him ill assure you stay my pamela said he in a passion stay when i bid you you have now heard two vile charges upon me i love you with such a true affection that i ought to say something before this malicious accuser that you may not think your consummate virtue linked to so black a villain her nephew seemed uneasy and blamed her much and i came back but trembled as i stood and he set me down and said taking my hand i have been accused my dear as a dueller and now as a profligate in another sense and there was a time i should not have received these imputations with so much concern as i now do when i would wish by degrees by a conformity of my manners to your virtue to shew every one the force your example has upon me but this briefly is the case of the first i had a friend who had been basely attempted to be assassinated by bravoes hired by a man of title in italy who like many other persons of title had no honour and at padua i had the fortune to disarm one of these bravoes in my friends defence and made him confess his employer and him i own i challenged at sienna we met and he died in a month after of a fever but i hope not occasioned by the slight wounds he had received from me though i was obliged to leave italy upon it sooner than i intended because of his numerous relations who looked upon me as the cause of his death though i pacified them by a letter i wrote them from inspruck acquainting them with the baseness of the deceased and they followed me not to munich as they intended this is one of the goodnatured hints that might shock your sweetness on reflecting that you are yoked with a murderer the other nay brother said she say no more tis your own fault if you go further she shall know it all said he and i defy the utmost stretch of your malice when i was at college i was well received by a widow lady who had several daughters and but small fortunes to give them and the old lady set one of them a deserving good girl she was to draw me into marriage with her for the sake of the fortune i was heir to and contrived many opportunities to bring us and leave us together i was not then of age and the young lady not half so artful as her mother yielded to my addresses before the mothers plot could be ripened and so utterly disappointed it this my pamela is the sally godfrey this malicious woman with the worst intentions has informed you of and whatever other liberties i may have taken for perhaps some more i have which had she known you had heard of as well as this i desire heaven will only forgive me till i revive its vengeance by the like offences in injury to my pamela and now my dear you may withdraw for this worthy sister of mine has said all the bad she knows of me and what at a proper opportunity when i could have convinced you that they were not my boast but my concern i should have acquainted you with myself for i am not fond of being thought better than i am though i hope from the hour i devoted myself to so much virtue to that of my death my conduct shall be irreproachable she was greatly moved at this and the noble manner in which the dear gentleman owned and repented of his faults and gushed out into tears and said no dont yet go pamela i beseech you my passion has carried me too far a great deal and coming to me she shook my hand and said you must stay to hear me beg his pardon and so took his hand but to my concern for i was grieved for her ladyships grief he burst from her and went out of the parlour into the garden in a violent rage that made me tremble her ladyship sat down and leaned her head against my bosom and made my neck wet with her tears holding me by the hands and i wept for company her kinsman walked up and down the parlour in a sad fret and going out afterwards he came in and said mr b has ordered his chariot to be got ready and wont be spoken to by any body where is he said she walking in the garden till it is ready replied he well said she i have indeed gone too far i was bewitched and now said she malicious as he calls me will he not forgive me for a twelvemonth for i tell you pamela if ever you offend he will not easily forgive i was all delighted though sad to see her ladyship so good to me will you venture said she to accompany me to him dare you follow a lion in his retreats ill attend your ladyship said i wherever you command well wench said she pamela i mean thou art very good in the main i should have loved thee as well as my mother did if but tis all over now indeed you should not have married my brother but come i must love him lets find him out and yet will he use me worse than a dog i should not added she have so much exasperated him for whenever i have i have always had the worst of it he knows i love him in this manner her ladyship talked to me leaning on my arm and walking into the garden i saw he was still in a tumult as it were and he took another walk to avoid us she called after him and said brother brother let me speak to you one word with you and as we made haste towards him and came near to him i desire said he that youll not oppress me more with your follies and your violence i have borne too much with you and i will vow for a twelvemonth from this day hush said she dont vow i beg you for too well will you keep it i know by experience if you do you see said she i stoop to ask pamela to be my advocate sure that will pacify you indeed said he i desire to see neither of you on such an occasion and let me only be left to myself for i will not be intruded upon thus and was going away but said she one word first i desire if youll forgive me ill forgive you what said the dear man haughtily will you forgive me why said she for she saw him too angry to mention his marriage as a subject that required her pardon i will forgive you all your bad usage of me this day i will be serious with you sister said he i wish you most sincerely well but let us from this time study so much one anothers quiet as never to come near one another more never said she and can you desire this barbarous brother can you i can i do said he and i have nothing to do but to hide from you not a brother but a murderer and a profligate unworthy of your relation and let me be consigned to penitence for my past evils a penitence however that shall not be broken in upon by so violent an accuser pamela said he and made me tremble how dare you approach me without leave when you see me thus disturbed never for the future come near me when i am in these tumults unless i send for you dear sir said i leave me interrupted he i will set out for bedfordshire this moment what sir said i without me what have i done you have too meanly said he for my wife stooped to this furious sister of mine and till i can recollect i am not pleased with you but colbrand shall attend you and two other of my servants and mrs jewkes shall wait upon you part of the way and i hope youll find me in a better disposition to receive you there than i am at parting with you here had i not hoped that this was partly put on to intimidate my lady i believe i could not have borne it but it was grievous to me for i saw he was most sincerely in a passion i was afraid said she he would be angry at you as well as me for well do i know his unreasonable violence when he is moved but one word sir said she pardon pamela if you wont me for she has committed no offence but that of goodnature to me and at my request i will be gone myself directly as i was about to do had you not prevented me i prevented you said he through love but you have strung me for it through hatred but as for my pamela i know besides the present moment i cannot be angry with her and therefore i desire her never to see me on such occasions till i can see her in the temper i ought to be in when so much sweetness approaches me tis therefore i say my dearest leave me now but sir said i must i leave you and let you go to bedfordshire without me oh dear sir how can i said my lady you may go to morrow both of you as you had designed and i will go away this afternoon and since i cannot be forgiven will try to forget i have a brother may i sir said i beg all your anger on myself and to be reconciled to your good sister presuming pamela replied he and made me start art thou then so hardy so well able to sustain a displeasure which of all things i expected from thy affection and thy tenderness thou wouldst have wished to avoid now said he and took my hand and as it were tossed it from him begone from my presence and reflect upon what you have said to me i was so frightened for then i saw he took amiss what i said that i took hold of his knees as he was turning from me and i said forgive me good sir you see i am not so hardy i cannot bear your displeasure and was ready to sink his sister said only forgive pamela tis all i ask youll break her spirit quite youll carry your passion as much too far as i have done i need not say said he how well i love her but she must not intrude upon me at such times as these i had intended as soon as i could have quelled by my reason the tumults you had caused by your violence to have come in and taken such a leave of you both as might become a husband and a brother but she has unbidden broke in upon me and must take the consequence of a passion which when raised is as uncontrollable as your own said she did i not love you so well as sister never loved a brother i should not have given you all this trouble and did i not said he love you better than you are resolved to deserve i should be indifferent to all you say but this last instance after the duelling story which you would not have mentioned had you not known it is always matter of concern for me to think upon of poor sally godfrey is a piece of spite and meanness that i can renounce you my blood for well said she i am convinced it was wrong i am ashamed of it myself twas poor twas mean twas unworthy of your sister and tis for this reason i stoop to follow you to beg your pardon and even to procure one for my advocate who i thought had some interest in you if i might have believed your own professions to her which now i shall begin to think made purposely to insult me i care not what you think after the meanness you have been guilty of i can only look upon you with pity for indeed you have fallen very low with me tis plain i have said she but ill begone and so brother let me call you for this once god bless you and pamela said her ladyship god bless you and kissed me and wept i durst say no more and my lady turning from him he said your sex is the d l how strangely can you discompose calm and turn as you please us poor weathercocks of men your last kind blessing to my pamela i cannot stand kiss but each other again and then he took both our hands and joined them and my lady saluting me again with tears on both sides he put his kind arms about each of our waists and saluted us with great affection saying now god bless you both the two dearest creatures i have in the world well said she you will quite forget my fault about miss he stopt her before she could speak the name and said for ever forget it and pamela ill forgive you too if you dont again make my displeasure so light a thing to you as you did just now said my lady she did not make your displeasure a light thing to her but the heavier it was the higher compliment she made me that she would bear it all rather than not see you and me reconciled no matter for that said he it was either an absence of thought or a slight by implication at least that my niceness could not bear from her tenderness for looked it not presuming that she could stand my displeasure or was sure of making her terms when she pleased which fond as i am of her i assure her will not be always in wilful faults in her power nay said my lady i can tell you pamela you have a gentleman here in my brother and you may expect such treatment from him as that character and his known good sense and breeding will always oblige him to shew but if you offend the lord have mercy upon you you see how it is by poor me and yet i never knew him to forgive so soon i am sure said i i will take care as much as i can for i have been frightened out of my wits and had offended before i knew where i was so happily did this storm blow over and my lady was quite subdued and pacified when we came out of the garden his chariot was ready and he said well sister i had most assuredly gone away towards my other house if things had not taken this happy turn and if you please instead of it you and i will take an airing and pray my dear said he to me bid mrs jewkes order supper by eight oclock and we shall then join you sir added he to her nephew will you take your horse and escort us i will said he and am glad at my soul to see you all so good friends so my dear lord and master handed my lady into his chariot and her kinsman and his servants rode after them and i went up to my closet to ruminate on these things and foolish thing that i am this poor miss sally godfrey runs into my head how soon the name and quality of a wife gives one privileges in ones own account yet methinks i want to know more about her for is it not strange that i who lived years in the family should have heard nothing of this but i was so constantly with my lady that i might the less hear of it for she i dare say never knew it or she would have told me but i dare not ask him about the poor lady yet i wonder what became of her whether she be living and whether any thing came of it may be i shall hear full soon enough but i hope not to any bad purpose as to the other unhappy case i know it was talked of that in his travels before i was taken into the family long he had one or two broils and from a youth he was always remarkable for courage and is reckoned a great master of his sword god grant he may never be put to use it and that he may be always preserved in honour and safety about seven oclock my master sent word that he would have me not expect him to supper for that he and my lady his sister and nephew were prevailed upon to stay with lady jones and that lady darnford and mr peterss family had promised to meet them there i was glad they did not send for me and the rather as i hoped those good families being my friends would confirm my lady a little in my favour and so i followed my writing closely about eleven oclock they returned i had but just come down having tired myself with my pen and was sitting talking with mrs jewkes and mrs worden whom i would though unwillingly on their sides make sit down which they did over against me mrs worden asked my pardon in a good deal of confusion for the part she had acted against me saying that things had been very differently represented to her and that she little thought i was married and that she was behaving so rudely to the lady of the house i said i took nothing amiss and very freely forgave her and hoped my new condition would not make me forget how to behave properly to every one but that i must endeavour to act not unworthy of it for the honour of the gentleman who had so generously raised me to it mrs jewkes said that my situation gave me great opportunities of shewing the excellence of my nature that i could forgive offences against me so readily as she for her own part must always she said acknowledge with confusion of face people said i mrs jewkes dont know how they shall act when their wills are in the power of their superiors and i always thought one should distinguish between acts of malice and of implicit obedience though at the same time a person should know how to judge between lawful and unlawful and even the great though at present angry they are not obeyed will afterwards have no ill opinion of a person for withstanding them in their unlawful commands mrs jewkes seemed a little concerned at this and i said i spoke chiefly from my own experience for that i might say as they both knew my story that i had not wanted both for menaces and temptations and had i complied with the one or been intimidated by the other i should not have been what i was ah madam replied mrs jewkes i never knew any body like you and i think your temper sweeter since the happy day than before and that if possible you take less upon you why a good reason said i may be assigned for that i thought myself in danger i looked upon every one as my enemy and it was impossible that i should not be fretful uneasy jealous but when my dearest friend had taken from me the ground of my uneasiness and made me quite happy i should have been very blamable if i had not shewn a satisfied and easy mind and a temper that should engage every ones respect and love at the same time if possible and so much the more as it was but justifying in some sort the honour i had received for the fewer enemies i made myself the more i engaged every one to think that my good benefactor had been less to blame in descending as he has done this way of talking pleased them both very much and they made me many compliments upon it and wished me always to be happy as they said i so well deserved we were thus engaged when my master and his sister and her nephew came in and they made me quite alive in the happy humour in which they all returned the two women would have withdrawn but my master said dont go mrs worden mrs jewkes pray stay i shall speak to you presently so he came to me and saluting me said well my dear love i hope i have not trespassed upon your patience by an absence longer than we designed but it has not been to your disadvantage for though we had not your company we have talked of nobody else but you my lady came up to me and said ay child you have been all our subject i dont know how it is but you have made two or three good families in this neighbourhood as much your admirers as your friend here my sister said he has been hearing your praises pamela from half a score mouths with more pleasure than her heart will easily let her express my good lady daverss favour said i and the continuance of yours sir would give me more pride than that of all the rest of the world put together well child said she proud hearts dont come down all at once though my brother here has this day set mine a good many pegs lower than i ever knew it but i will say i wish you joy with my brother and so kissed me my dear lady said i you for ever oblige me i shall now believe myself quite happy this was all i wanted to make me so and i hope i shall always through my life shew your ladyship that i have the most grateful and respectful sense of your goodness but child said she i shall not give you my company when you make your appearance let your own merit make all your bedfordshire neighbours your friends as it has done here by your lincolnshire ones and youll have no need of my countenance nor any bodys else now said her nephew tis my turn i wish you joy with all my soul madam and by what i have seen and by what i have heard fore gad i think you have met with no more than you deserve and so all the company says where we have been and pray forgive all my nonsense to you sir said i i shall always i hope respect as i ought so near a relation of my good lord and lady davers and i thank you for your kind compliment gad beck said he i believe youve some forgiveness too to ask for we were all to blame to make madam here fly the pit as she did little did we think we made her quit her own house thou always said my lady sayest too much or too little mrs worden said i have been treated with so much goodness and condescension since you went that i have been beforehand sir in asking pardon myself so my lady sat down with me half an hour and told me that her brother had carried her a fine airing and had quite charmed her with his kind treatment of her and had much confirmed her in the good opinion she had begun to entertain of my discreet and obliging behaviour but continued she when he would make me visit without intending to stay my old neighbours for said she lady jones being nearest we visited her first and she scraped all the rest of the company together they were all so full of your praises that i was quite borne down and truly it was saul among the prophets you may believe how much i was delighted with this and i spared not my due acknowledgments when her ladyship took leave to go to bed she said goodnight to you heartily and to your good man i kissed you when i came in out of form but i now kiss you out of more than form ill assure you join with me my dear parents in my joy for this happy turn the contrary of which i so much dreaded and was the only difficulty i had to labour with this poor miss sally godfrey i wonder whats become of her poor soul i wish he would of his own head mention her again not that i am very uneasy neither youll say i must be a little saucy if i was my dear master gave me an account when we went up of the pains he had taken with his beloved sister as he himself styled her and of all the kind things the good families had said in my behalf and that he observed she was not so much displeased with hearing them as she was at first when she would not permit any body to speak of me as his wife and that my health as his spouse being put when it came to her she drank it but said come brother heres your pamela to you but i shall not know how to stand this affair when the countess and the young ladies come to visit me one of these young ladies was the person she was so fond of promoting a match for with her brother lady betty i know she said will rally me smartly upon it and you know brother she wants neither wit nor satire he said i hope lady betty whenever she marries will meet with a better husband than i should have made her for in my conscience i think i should hardly have made a tolerable one to any but pamela he told me that they rallied him on the stateliness of his temper and said they saw he would make an exceeding good husband where he was but it must be owing to my meekness more than to his complaisance for said miss darnford i could see well enough when your ladyship detained her though he had but hinted his desire of finding her at our house he was so out of humour at her supposed noncompliance that mine and my sisters pity for her was much more engaged than our envy ay said my lady he is too lordly a creature by much and cant bear disappointment nor ever could said he well lady davers you should not of all persons find fault with me for i bore a great deal from you before i was at all angry yes replied she but when i had gone a little too far as i own i did you made me pay for it severely enough you know you did saucebox and the poor thing too added she that i took with me for my advocate so low had he brought me he treated her in such a manner as made my heart ache for her but part was art i know to make me think the better of her indeed sister said he there was very little of that for at that time i cared not what you thought nor had complaisance enough to have given a shilling for your good or bad opinion of her or me and i own i was displeased to be broken in upon after your provocations by either of you and she must learn that lesson never to come near me when i am in those humours which shall be as little as possible for after a while if let alone i always come to myself and am sorry for the violence of a temper so like my dear sisters here and for this reason think it is no matter how few witnesses i have of its intemperance while it lasts especially since every witness whether they merit it or not as you see in my pamelas case must be a sufferer by it if unsent for they come in my way he repeated the same lesson to me again and enforced it and owned that he was angry with me in earnest just then though more with himself afterwards for being so but when pamela said he you wanted to transfer all my displeasure upon yourself it was so much braving me with your merit as if i must soon end my anger if placed there or it was making it so light to you that i was truly displeased for continued he i cannot bear that you should wish on any occasion whatever to have me angry with you or not to value my displeasure as the heaviest misfortune that could befall you but sir said i you know that what i did was to try to reconcile my lady and as she herself observed it was paying her a high regard it was so replied he but never think of making a compliment to her or any body living at my expense besides she had behaved herself so intolerably that i began to think you had stooped too much and more than i ought to permit my wife to do and acts of meanness are what i cant endure in any body but especially where i love and as she had been guilty of a very signal one i had much rather have renounced her at that time than have been reconciled to her sir said i i hope i shall always comport myself so as not wilfully to disoblige you for the future and the rather do i hope this as i am sure i shall want only to know your pleasure to obey it but this instance shews me that i may much offend without designing it in the least now pamela replied he dont be too serious i hope i shant be a very tyrannical husband to you yet do i not pretend to be perfect or to be always governed by reason in my first transports and i expect from your affection that you will bear with me when you find me wrong i have no ungrateful spirit and can when cool enter as impartially into myself as most men and then i am always kind and acknowledging in proportion as i have been out of the way but to convince you my dear continued he of your fault i mean with regard to the impetuosity of my temper for there was no fault in your intention that i acknowledge ill observe only that you met when you came to me while i was so out of humour a reception you did not expect and a harsh word or two that you did not deserve now had you not broken in upon me while my anger lasted but staid till i had come to you or sent to desire your company youd have seen none of this but that affectionate behaviour which i doubt not youll always merit and i shall always take pleasure in expressing and in this temper shall you always find a proper influence over me but you must not suppose whenever i am out of humour that in opposing yourself to my passion you oppose a proper butt to it but when you are so good like the slender reed to bend to the hurricane rather than like the sturdy oak to resist it you will always stand firm in my kind opinion while a contrary conduct would uproot you with all your excellencies from my soul sir said i i will endeavour to conform myself in all things to your will i make no doubt but you will and ill endeavour to make my will as conformable to reason as i can and let me tell you that this belief of you is one of the inducements i have had to marry at all for nobody was more averse to this state than myself and now we are upon this subject ill tell you why i was so averse we people of fortune or such as are born to large expectations of both sexes are generally educated wrong you have occasionally touched upon this pamela several times in your journal so justly that i need say the less to you we are usually so headstrong so violent in our wills that we very little bear control humoured by our nurses through the faults of our parents we practise first upon them and shew the gratitude of our dispositions in an insolence that ought rather to be checked and restrained than encouraged next we are to be indulged in every thing at school and our masters and mistresses are rewarded with further grateful instances of our boisterous behaviour but in our wise parents eyes all looks well all is forgiven and excused and for no other reason but because we are theirs our next progression is we exercise our spirits when brought home to the torment and regret of our parents themselves and torture their hearts by our undutiful and perverse behaviour to them which however ungrateful in us is but the natural consequence of their culpable indulgence to us from infancy upwards and then next after we have perhaps half broken their hearts a wife is looked out for convenience or birth or fortune are the first motives affection the last if it is at all consulted and two people thus educated thus trained up in a course of unnatural ingratitude and who have been headstrong torments to every one who has had a share in their education as well as to those to whom they owe their being are brought together and what can be expected but that they should pursue and carry on the same comfortable conduct in matrimony and join most heartily to plague one another and in some measure indeed this is right because hereby they revenge the cause of all those who have been aggrieved and insulted by them upon one another the gentleman has never been controlled the lady has never been contradicted he cannot bear it from one whose new relation he thinks should oblige her to shew a quite contrary conduct she thinks it very barbarous now for the first time to be opposed in her will and that by a man from whom she expected nothing but tenderness so great is the difference between what they both expect from one another and what they both find in each other that no wonder misunderstandings happen that these ripen to quarrels that acts of unkindness pass which even had the first motive to their union been affection as usually it is not would have effaced all manner of tender impressions on both sides appeals to parents or guardians often ensue if by mediation of friends a reconciliation takes place it hardly ever holds for why the fault is in the minds of both and neither of them will think so so that the wound not permitted to be probed is but skinned over and rankles still at the bottom and at last breaks out with more pain and anguish than before separate beds are often the consequence perhaps elopements if not an unconquerable indifference possibly aversion and whenever for appearancesake they are obliged to be together every one sees that the yawning husband and the vapourish wife are truly insupportable to one another but separate have freer spirits and can be tolerable company now my dear i would have you think and i hope you will have no other reason that had i married the first lady in the land i would not have treated her better than i will my pamela for my wife is my wife and i was the longer in resolving on the state because i knew its requisites and doubted my conduct in it i believe i am more nice than many gentlemen but it is because i have been a close observer of the behaviour of wedded folks and hardly ever have seen it to be such as i could like in my own case i shall possibly give you instances of a more particular nature of this as we are longer and perhaps i might say better acquainted had i married with the views of many gentlemen and with such as my good sister supplying the place of my father and mother would have recommended i had wedded a fine lady brought up pretty much in my own manner and used to have her will in every thing some gentlemen can come into a compromise and after a few struggles sit down tolerably contented but had i married a princess i could not have done so i must have loved her exceedingly well before i had consented to knit the knot with her and preferred her to all her sex for without this pamela indifferences if not disgusts will arise in every wedded life that could not have made me happy at home and there are fewer instances i believe of mens loving better after matrimony than of womens the reason of which tis not my present purpose to account for then i must have been morally sure that she preferred me to all men and to convince me of this she must have lessened not aggravated my failings she must have borne with my imperfections she must have watched and studied my temper and if ever she had any points to carry any desire of overcoming it must have been by sweetness and complaisance and yet not such a slavish one as should make her condescension seem to be rather the effect of her insensibility than judgment or affection she should not have given cause for any part of my conduct to her to wear the least aspect of compulsion or force the word command on my side or obedience on hers i would have blotted from my vocabulary for this reason i should have thought it my duty to have desired nothing of her that was not significant reasonable or just and that then she should on hers have shewn no reluctance uneasiness or doubt to oblige me even at half a word i would not have excused her to let me twice enjoin the same thing while i took so much care to make her compliance with me reasonable and such as should not destroy her own free agency in points that ought to be allowed her and if i was not always right that yet she would bear with me if she saw me set upon it and expostulate with me on the right side of compliance for that would shew me supposing small points in dispute from which the greatest quarrels among friends generally arise that she differed from me not for contradictionsake but desired to convince me for my own and that i should another time take better resolutions this would be so obliging a conduct that i should in justice have doubled my esteem for one who to humour me could give up her own judgment and i should see she could have no other view in her expostulations after her compliance had passed than to rectify my motions for the future and it would have been impossible then but i must have paid the greater deference to her opinion and advice in more momentous matters in all companies she must have shewn that she had whether i deserved it altogether or not a high regard and opinion of me and this the rather as such a conduct in her would be a reputation and security to herself for if we rakes attempt a married lady our first encouragement exclusive of our own vanity arises from the indifferent opinion slight or contempt she expresses of her husband i should expect therefore that she should draw a kind veil over my faults that such as she could not hide she would extenuate that she would place my better actions in an advantageous light and shew that i had her good opinion at least whatever liberties the world took with my character she must have valued my friends for my sake been cheerful and easy whomsoever i had brought home with me and whatever faults she had observed in me have never blamed me before company at least with such an air of superiority as should have shewn she had a better opinion of her own judgment than of mine now my pamela this is but a faint sketch of the conduct i must have expected from my wife let her quality have been what it would or have lived with her on bad terms judge then if to me a lady of the modish taste could have been tolerable the perverseness and contradiction i have too often seen in some of my visits even among people of sense as well as condition had prejudiced me to the married state and as i knew i could not bear it surely i was in the right to decline it and you see my dear that i have not gone among this class of people for a wife nor know i indeed where in any class i could have sought one or had one suitable to my mind if not you for here is my misfortune i could not have been contented to have been but moderately happy in a wife judge you from all this if i could very well bear that you should think yourself so well secured of my affection that you could take the faults of others upon yourself and by a supposed supererogatory merit think your interposition sufficient to atone for the faults of others yet am i not perfect myself no i am greatly imperfect yet will i not allow that my imperfections shall excuse those of my wife or make her think i ought to bear faults in her that she can rectify because she bears greater from me upon the whole i may expect that you will bear with me and study my temper till and only till you see i am capable of returning insult for obligation and till you think that i shall be of a gentler deportment if i am roughly used than otherwise one thing more i will add that i should scorn myself if there was one privilege of your sex that a princess might expect as my wife to be indulged in that i would not allow to my pamela for you are the wife of my affections i never wished for one before you nor ever do i hope to have another i hope sir said i my future conduct pardon me said he my dear for interrupting you but it is to assure you that i am so well convinced of your affectionate regard for me that i know i might have spared the greatest part of what i have said and indeed it must be very bad for both of us if i should have reason to think it necessary to say so much but one thing has brought on another and i have rather spoken what my niceness has made me observe in other families than what i fear in my own and therefore let me assure you i am thoroughly satisfied with your conduct hitherto you shall have no occasion to repent it and you shall find though greatly imperfect and passionate on particular provocations which yet i will try to overcome that you have not a brutal or ungenerous husband who is capable of offering insult for condescension or returning evil for good i thanked him for these kind rules and generous assurances and assured him that they had made so much impression on my mind that these and his most agreeable injunctions before given me and such as he should hereafter be pleased to give me should be so many rules for my future behaviour and i am glad of the method i have taken of making a journal of all that passes in these first stages of my happiness because it will sink the impression still deeper and i shall have recourse to them for my better regulation as often as i shall mistrust my memory let me see what are the rules i am to observe from this awful lecture why these that i must not when he is in great wrath with any body break in upon him without his leave well ill remember it i warrant but yet i think this rule is almost peculiar to himself that i must think his displeasure the heaviest thing that can befall me to be sure i shall and so that i must not wish to incur it to save any body else ill be further if i do that i must never make a compliment to any body at his expense that i must not be guilty of any acts of wilful meanness there is a great deal meant in this and ill endeavour to observe it all to be sure the occasion on which he mentions this explains it that i must say nothing though in anger that is spiteful or malicious that is disrespectful or undutiful and suchlike that i must bear with him even when i find him in the wrong this is a little hard as the case may be i wonder whether poor miss sally godfrey be living or dead that i must be as flexible as the reed in the fable lest by resisting the tempest like the oak i be torn up by the roots well ill do the best i can there is no great likelihood i hope that i should be too perverse yet sure the tempest will not lay me quite level with the ground neither that the education of young people of condition is generally wrong memorandum that if any part of childrens education fall to my lot i never indulge and humour them in things that they ought to be restrained in that i accustom them to bear disappointments and control that i suffer them not to be too much indulged in their infancy nor at school nor spoil them when they come home for that children generally extend their perverseness from the nurse to the schoolmaster from the schoolmaster to the parents and in their next step as a proper punishment for all make their ownselves unhappy that undutiful and perverse children make bad husbands and wives and collaterally bad masters and mistresses that not being subject to be controlled early they cannot when married bear one another that the fault lying deep and in the minds of each other neither will mend it whence follow misunderstandings quarrels appeals ineffectual reconciliations separations elopements or at best indifference perhaps aversion memorandum a good image of unhappy wedlock in the words yawning husband and vapourish wife when together but separate both quite alive few married persons behave as he likes let me ponder this with awe and improvement some gentlemen can compromise with their wives for quietness sake but he cant indeed i believe thats true i dont desire he should that love before marriage is absolutely necessary that there are fewer instances of mens than womens loving better after marriage but why so i wish he had given his reasons for this i fancy they would not have been to the advantage of his own sex that a woman give her husband reason to think she prefers him before all men well to be sure this should be so that if she would overcome it must be by sweetness and complaisance that is by yielding he means no doubt yet not such a slavish one neither as should rather seem the effect of her insensibility than judgment or affection that the words command and obey shall be blotted out of the vocabulary very good that a man should desire nothing of his wife but what is significant reasonable just to be sure that is right but then that she must not shew reluctance uneasiness or doubt to oblige him and that too at half a word and must not be bid twice to do one thing but may not there be some occasions where this may be a little dispensed with but he says afterwards indeed that this must be only while he took care to make her compliance reasonable and consistent with her free agency in points that ought to be allowed her come this is pretty well considering that if the husband be set upon a wrong thing she must not dispute with him but do it and expostulate afterwards good sirs i dont know what to say to this it looks a little hard methinks this would bear a smart debate i fancy in a parliament of women but then he says supposing they are only small points that are in dispute well this mends it a little for small points i think should not be stood upon that the greatest quarrels among friends and wives and husbands are or should be friends arise from small matters i believe this is very true for i had like to have had anger here when i intended very well that a wife should not desire to convince her husband for contradiction sake but for his own as both will find their account in this if one does i believe tis very just that in all companies a wife must shew respect and love to her husband and this for the sake of her own reputation and security for that rakes cannot have a greater encouragement to attempt a married ladys virtue than her slight opinion of her husband to be sure this stands to reason and is a fine lesson that a wife should therefore draw a kind veil over her husbands faults that such as she could not conceal she should extenuate that his virtues she should place in an advantageous light and shew the world that he had her good opinion at least that she must value his friends for his sake that she must be cheerful and easy in her behaviour to whomsoever he brings home with him that whatever faults she sees in him she never blame him before company at least with such an air of superiority as if she had a less opinion of his judgment than her own that a man of nice observation cannot be contented to be only moderately happy in a wife that a wife take care how she ascribe supererogatory merit to herself so as to take the faults of others upon her indeed i think it is well if we can bear our own this is of the same nature with the third and touches upon me on the present occasion for this wholesome lecture that his imperfections must not be a plea for hers to be sure tis no matter how good the women are but tis to be hoped men will allow a little but indeed he says that a husband who expects all this is to be incapable of returning insult for obligation or evil for good and ought not to abridge her of any privilege of her sex well my dear parents i think this last rule crowns the rest and makes them all very tolerable and a generous man and a man of sense cannot be too much obliged and as i have this happiness i shall be very unworthy if i do not always so think and so act yet after all youll see i have not the easiest task in the world but i know my own intentions that i shall not wilfully err and so fear the less not one hint did he give that i durst lay hold of about poor miss sally godfrey i wish my lady had not spoken of it for it has given me a curiosity that is not quite so pretty in me especially so early in my nuptials and in a case so long ago past yet he intimated too to his sister that he had had other faults of this sort i suppose that had not come to her knowledge but i make no doubt he has seen his error and will be very good for the future i wish it and pray it may be so for his own dear sake wednesday the seventh when i arose in the morning i went to wait on lady davers seeing her door open and she was in bed but awake and talking to her woman i said i hope i dont disturb your ladyship not at all said she i am glad to see you how do you do well added she when do you set out for bedfordshire i said i cant tell madam it was designed as to day but i have heard no more of it sit down said she on the bedside i find by the talk we had yesterday and last night you have had but a poor time of it pamela i must call you so yet said she since you were brought to this house till within these few days and mrs jewkes too has given beck such an account as makes me pity you indeed madam said i if your ladyship knew all you would pity me for never poor creature was so hard put to it but i ought to forget it all now and be thankful why said she as far as i can find tis a mercy you are here now i was sadly moved with some part of your story and you have really made a noble defence and deserve the praises of all our sex it was god enabled me madam replied i why said she tis the more extraordinary because i believe if the truth was known you loved the wretch not a little while my trials lasted madam said i i had not a thought of any thing but to preserve my innocence much less of love but tell me truly said she did you not love him all the time i had always madam answered i a great reverence for my master and thought all his good actions doubly good and for his naughty ones though i abhorred his attempts upon me yet i could not hate him and always wished him well but i did not know that it was love indeed i had not the presumption sweet girl said she thats prettily said but when he found he could not gain his ends and began to be sorry for your sufferings and to admire your virtue and to profess honourable love to you what did you think think indeed madam i did not know what to think could neither hope nor believe so great an honour would fall to my lot and feared more from his kindness for some time than i had done from his unkindness and having had a private intimation from a kind friend of a sham marriage intended by means of a man who was to personate a minister it kept my mind in too much suspense to be greatly overjoyed at his kind declaration said she i think he did make two or three attempts upon you in bedfordshire yes madam said i he was very naughty to be sure and here he proposed articles to you i understand yes madam replied i but i abhorred so much the thoughts of being a kept creature that i rejected them with great boldness and was resolved to die before i would consent to them he afterwards attempted you i think did he not o yes madam said i a most sad attempt he made and i had like to have been lost for mrs jewkes was not so good as she should have been and so i told her ladyship that sad affair and how i fell into fits and that they believing me dying forbore any attempts after this base one she said he was not so good as he should have been returned i once in the garden afterwards but i was so watchful and so ready to take the alarm but said she did he not threaten you at times and put on his stern airs every now and then threaten madam replied i yes i had enough of that i thought i should have died for fear several times how could you bear that said she for he is a most daring and majestic mortal he has none of your puny hearts but is as courageous as a lion and boy and man never feared any thing i myself said she have a pretty good spirit but when i have made him truly angry i have always been forced to make it up with him as well as i could for child he is not one that is easily reconciled i assure you but after he had professed honourable love to you did he never attempt you again no indeed madam he did not but he was a good while struggling with himself and with his pride as he was pleased to call it before he could stoop so low and considered and considered again and once upon my saying but two or three words that displeased him when he was very kind to me he turned me out of doors in a manner at an hours warning for he sent me above a days journey towards my fathers and then sent a man and horse posthaste to fetch me back again and has been exceedingly kind and gracious to me ever since and made me happy that sending you away said she one hour and sending after you the next is exactly like my brother and tis well if he dont turn you off twice or thrice before a year comes about if you vex him and he would have done the same by the first lady in the land if he had been married to her yet has he his virtues as well as his faults for he is generous nay he is noble in his spirit hates little dirty actions he delights in doing good but does not pass over a wilful fault easily he is wise prudent sober and magnanimous and will not tell a lie nor disguise his faults but you must not expect to have him all to yourself i doubt but ill no more harp upon this string you see how he was exasperated at me and he seemed to be angry at you too though something of it was art i believe indeed madam said i he has been pleased to give me a most noble lecture and i find he was angry with me in earnest and that it will not be an easy task to behave unexceptionably to him for he is very nice and delicate in his notions i perceive but yet as your ladyship says exceeding generous well said she im glad thou hadst a little bit of his anger else i should have thought it art and i dont love to be treated with low art any more than he and i should have been vexed if he had done it by me but i understand child said she that you keep a journal of all matters that pass and he has several times found means to get at it should you care i should see it it could not be to your disadvantage for i find it had no small weight with him in your favour and i should take great pleasure to read all his stratagems attempts contrivances menaces and offers to you on one hand and all your pretty counterplottings which he much praises your resolute resistance and the noble stand you have made to preserve your virtue and the steps by which his pride was subdued and his mind induced to honourable love till you were made what you now are for it must be a rare and uncommon story and will not only give me great pleasure in reading but will entirely reconcile me to the step he has taken and that let me tell you is what i never thought to be for i had gone a great way in bringing about a match with him and lady betty and had said so much of it that the earl her father approved of it and so did the duke of her uncle and lady betty herself was not averse and now i shall be hunted to death about it and this has made me so outrageous as you have seen me upon the matter but when i can find by your writings that your virtue is but suitably rewarded it will be not only a good excuse for me but for him and make me love you there is nothing that i would not do said i to oblige your ladyship but my poor father and mother who would rather have seen me buried quick in the earth than to be seduced by the greatest of princes have them in their hands at present and your dear brother has bespoken them when they have done reading them but if he gives me leave i will shew them to your ladyship with all my heart not doubting your generous allowances as i have had his though i have treated him very freely all the way while he had naughty views and that your ladyship would consider them as the naked sentiments of my heart from time to time delivered to those whose indulgence i was sure of and for whose sight only they were written give me a kiss now said her ladyship for your cheerful compliance for i make no doubt my brother will consent i shall see them because they must needs make for your honour and i see he loves you better than any one in the world i have heard continued her ladyship a mighty good character of your parents as industrious honest sensible good folks who know the world and as i doubt not my brothers generosity i am glad they will make no ill figure in the worlds eye madam said i they are the honestest the lovingest and the most conscientious couple breathing they once lived creditably and brought up a great family of which i am the youngest but had misfortunes through their doing beyond their power for two unhappy brothers who are both dead and whose debts they stood bound for and so became reduced and by harsh creditors where most of the debts were not of their own contracting turned out of all and having without success tried to set up a little countryschool for my father understood a little of accounts and wrote a pretty good hand forced to take to hard labour but honest all the time contented never repining and loving to one another and in the midst of their poverty and disappointments above all temptation and all their fear was that i should be wicked and yield to temptation for the sake of worldly riches and to gods grace and their good lessons and those i imbibed from my dear good lady your ladyships mother it is that i owe the preservation of my innocence and the happy station i am exalted to she was pleased to kiss me again and said there is such a noble simplicity in thy story such an honest artlessness in thy mind and such a sweet humility in thy deportment notwithstanding thy present station that i believe i shall be forced to love thee whether i will or not and the sight of your papers i dare say will crown the work will disarm my pride banish my resentment on lady bettys account and justify my brothers conduct and at the same time redound to your own everlasting honour as well as to the credit of our sex and so i make no doubt but my brother will let me see them worden said my lady i can say any thing before you and you will take no notice of our conversation but i see you are much touched with it did you ever hear any thing prettier more unaffected sincere free easy no never madam answered she in my life and it is a great pleasure to see so happy a reconciliation taking place where there is so much merit i said i have discovered so much prudence in mrs worden that as well for that as for the confidence your ladyship places in her i have made no scruple of speaking my mind freely before her and of blaming my dear master while he was blameworthy as well as acknowledging his transcendent goodness to me since which i am sure exceeds all i can ever deserve may be not said my lady i hope youll be very happy in one another and ill now rise and tell him my thoughts and ask him to let me have the reading of your papers for i promise myself much pleasure in them and shall not grudge a journey and a visit to you to the other house to fetch them your ladyships favour said i was all i had to wish for and if i have that and the continuance of your dear brothers goodness to me i shall be easy under whatever else may happen and so i took my leave and withdrew and she let me hear her say to mrs worden tis a charming creature worden i know not which excels her person or her mind and so young a creature too well may my brother love her i am afraid my dear father and mother i shall now be too proud indeed i had once a good mind to have asked her ladyship about miss sally godfrey but i thought it was better let alone since she did not mention it herself may be i shall hear it too soon but i hope not i wonder though whether she be living or dead we breakfasted together with great good temper and my lady was very kind and asking my good master he gave leave very readily she should see all my papers when you returned them to me and he said he was sure when she came to read them she would say that i had well deserved the fortune i had met with and would be of opinion that all the kindness of his future life would hardly be a sufficient reward for my virtue and make me amends for my sufferings my lady resolving to set out the next morning to return to her lord my master ordered every thing to be made ready for his doing the like to bedfordshire and this evening our good neighbours will sup with us to take leave of my lady and us wednesday night nothing particular having passed at dinner or supper but the most condescending goodness on my ladys side to me and the highest civilities from mr peterss family from lady jones from sir simons family etc and reciprocal good wishes all around and a promise obtained from my benefactor that he would endeavour to pass a fortnight or three weeks in these parts before the winter set in i shall conclude this day with observing that i disposed of the money my master was so good to put into my hands in the manner he was pleased to direct and i gave mrs jewkes hers in such a manner as highly pleased her and she wished me with tears all kinds of happiness and prayed me to forgive her all her wickedness to me as she herself called it i begged leave of my master to present mrs worden with five guineas for a pair of gloves which he said was well thought of i should have mentioned that miss darnford and i agreed upon a correspondence which will be no small pleasure to me for she is an admirable young lady whom i prefer to every one i have seen and i shall i make no doubt improve by her letters for she is said to have a happy talent in writing and is well read for so young a lady saturday on thursday morning my lady set out for her own seat and my best friend and i attended by mr colbrand abraham and thomas for this dear house her ladyship parted with her brother and me with great tenderness and made me promise to send her my papers which i find she intends to entertain lady betty with and another lady or two her intimates as also her lord and hopes to find as i believe in the reading of them some excuse for her brothers choice my dearest master has been all love and tenderness on the road as he is in every place and on every occasion and oh what a delightful change was this journey to that which so contrary to all my wishes and so much to my apprehensions carried me hence to the lincolnshire house and how did i bless god at every turn and at every stage we did not arrive here till yesterday noon abraham rode before to let them know we were coming and i had the satisfaction to find every body there i wished to see when the chariot entered the courtyard i was so strongly impressed with the favour and mercies of god almighty on remembering how i was sent away the last time i saw this house the leave i took the dangers i had encountered a poor castoff servant girl and now returning a joyful wife and the mistress through his favour of the noble house i was turned out of that i was hardly able to support the joy i felt in my mind on the occasion he saw how much i was moved and tenderly asked me why i seemed so affected i told him and lifted his dear hand to my lips and said o sir gods mercies and your goodness to me on entering this dear dear place are above my expression i can hardly bear the thoughts of them he said welcome thrice welcome joy of my life to your own house and kissed my hand in return all the common servants stood at the windows as unseen as they could to observe us he took my hand with the most condescending goodness in the world and with great complaisance led me into the parlour and kissed me with the greatest ardour welcome again my dearest life said he a thousand times welcome to the possession of a house that is not more mine than yours i threw myself at his feet permit me dear sir thus to bless god and thank you for all his mercies and your goodness o may i so behave as not to be utterly unworthy and then how happy shall i be god give me my dearest said he life and health to reward all your sweetness and no man can be so blest as i where said he to abraham who passed by the door where is mrs jervis she bolted in here good sir said she here good madam am i waiting impatiently till called for to congratulate you both i ran to her and clasped my arms about her neck and kissed her o my dear mrs jervis said i my other dear mother receive your happy happy pamela and join with me to bless god and bless our master for all these great things i was ready to sink in her arms through excess of joy to see the dear good woman who had been so often a mournful witness of my distress as now of my triumph dearest madam said she you do me too much honour let my whole life shew the joy i take in your deserved good fortune and in my duty to you for the early instance i received of your goodness in your kind letter o mrs jervis replied i there all thanks are due both from you and me for our dear master granted me this blessing as i may justly call it the very first moment i begged it of him your goodness sir said she i will for ever acknowledge and i beg pardon for the wrong step i made in applying to my lady davers he was so good as to salute her and said all is over now mrs jervis and i shall not remember you ever disobliged me i always respected you and shall now more and more value you for the sake of that dear good creature whom with joy unfeigned i can call my wife god bless your honour for ever said she and many many happy years may ye live together the envy and wonder of all who know you but where said my dear master is honest longman and where is jonathan come mrs jervis said i you shall shew me them and all the good folks presently and let me go up with you to behold the dear apartments which i have seen before with such different emotions to what i shall now do we went up and in every room the chamber i took refuge in when my master pursued me my ladys chamber her dressingroom mrs jerviss room not forgetting her closet my own little bedchamber the green room and in each of the others i blessed god for my past escapes and present happiness and the good woman was quite affected with the zeal and pleasure with which i made my thankful acknowledgments to the divine goodness o my excellent lady said she you are still the same good pious humble soul i knew you and your marriage has added to your graces as i hope it will to your blessings dear mrs jervis said i you know not what i have gone through you know not what god has done for me you know not what a happy creature i am now i have a thousand thousand things to tell you and a whole week will be too little every moment of it spent in relating to you what has befallen me to make you acquainted with it all we shall be sweetly happy together i make no doubt but i charge you my dear mrs jervis whatever you call me before strangers that when we are by ourselves you call me nothing but your pamela for what an ungrateful creature should i be who have received so many mercies if i attributed them not to the divine goodness but assumed to myself insolent airs upon them no i hope i shall be more and more thankful as i am more and more blest and more humble as god the author of all my happiness shall more distinguish me we went down again to the parlour to my dear master said he call longman in again he longs to see you my dear he came in god bless you my sweet lady said he as now heaven be praised i may call you did i not tell you madam that providence would find you out o mr longman said i god be praised for all his mercies i am rejoiced to see you and i laid my hand on his and said good mr longman how do you do i must always value you and you dont know how much of my present happiness i owe to the sheets of paper and pens and ink you furnished me with i hope my dear sir and you are quite reconciled o madam said he how good you are why i cannot contain myself for joy and then he wiped his eyes good man said my master yes i have been telling longman that i am obliged to him for his ready return to me and that i will entirely forget his appeal to lady davers and i hope hell find himself quite as easy and happy as he wishes my dear partner here mr longman i dare promise you will do all she can to make you so heaven bless you both together said he tis the pride of my heart to see this i returned with double delight when i heard the blessed news and i am sure sir said he mark old longmans words god will bless you for this every year more and more you dont know how many hearts you have made happy by this generous deed i am glad of it said my dear master i am sure i have made my own happy and longman though i must think you somebody yet as you are not a young man and so wont make me jealous i can allow you to wish my dear wife joy in the tenderest manner adad sir said he i am sure you rejoice me with your favour tis what i longed for but durst not presume my dear said my master receive the compliment of one of the honestest hearts in england that always revered your virtues and the good man saluted me with great respect and said god in heaven bless you both and kneeled on one knee i must quit your presence indeed i must and away he went your goodness sir said i knows no bounds o may my gratitude never find any i saw said my master when the good man approached you that he did it with so much awe and love mingled together that i fancied he longed to salute my angel and i could not but indulge his honest heart how blessed am i said i and kissed his hand and indeed i make nothing now of kissing his dear hand as if it was my own when honest old mr jonathan come in to attend at dinner so clean so sleek and so neat as he always is with his silver hair i said well mr jonathan how do you do i am glad to see you you look as well as ever thank god o dear madam said he better than ever to have such a blessed sight god bless you and my good master and i hope sir said he youll excuse all my past failings ay that i will jonathan said he because you never had any but what your regard for my dear wife here was the occasion of and now i can tell you you can never err because you cannot respect her too much o sir said he your honour is exceeding good im sure i shall always pray for you both after dinner mr longman coming in and talking of some affairs under his care he said afterwards all your honours servants are now happy for robert who left you had a pretty little fortune fallen to him or he never would have quitted your service he was here but yesterday to inquire when you and my lady returned hither and hoped he might have leave to pay his duty to you both ay said my master i shall be glad to see honest robert for thats another of your favourites pamela it was high time i think i should marry you were it but to engage the respects of all my family to myself there are sir said i ten thousand reasons why i should rejoice in your goodness but i was going to say said mr longman that all your honours old servants are now happy but one you mean john arnold said my master i do indeed said he if youll excuse me sir o said i i have had my prayer for poor john answered as favourably as i could wish why said mr longman to be sure poor john has acted no very good part take it altogether but he so much honoured you sir and so much respected you madam that he would have been glad to have been obedient to both and so was faithful to neither but indeed the poor fellows heart is almost broke and he wont look out for any other place and says he must live in your honours service or he must die wretched very shortly mrs jervis was there when this was said indeed said she the poor man has been here every day since he heard the tidings that have rejoiced us all and he says he hopes he shall yet be forgiven is he in the house now said my master he is sir and was here when your honour came in and played at hide and seek to have one look at you both when you alighted and was ready to go out of his wits for joy when we saw your honour hand my lady in pamela said my dear master youre to do with john as you please you have full power then pray sir said i let poor john come in the poor fellow came in with so much confusion that i have never seen a countenance that expressed so lively a consciousness of his faults and mingled joy and shame how do you do john said i i hope you are very well the poor fellow could hardly speak and looked with awe upon my master and pleasure upon me said my master well john there is no room to say any thing to a man that has so much concern already i am told you will serve me whether i will or not but i turn you over altogether to my spouse here and she is to do by you as she pleases you see john said i your good masters indulgence well may i forgive that have so generous an example i was always persuaded of your honest intentions if you had known how to distinguish between your duty to your master and your goodwill to me you will now have no more puzzles on that account from the goodness of your dear master i shall be but too happy i said the poor man god bless your honour god bless you madam i now have the joy of my soul in serving you both and i will make the best of servants to my power well then john said i your wages will go on as if you had not left your master may i not say so sir said i yes surely my dear replied he and augment them too if you find his duty to you deserves it a thousand millions of thanks said the poor man i am very well satisfied and desire no augmentation and so he withdrew overjoyed and mrs jervis and mr longman were highly pleased for though they were incensed against him for his fault to me when matters looked badly for me yet they and all his fellow servants always loved john when mr longman and mrs jervis had dined they came in again to know if he had any commands and my dear master filling a glass of wine said longman i am going to toast the happiest and honestest couple in england my dear pamelas father and mother thank you dear sir said i i think continued he that little kentish purchase wants a manager and as it is a little out of your way longman i have been purposing if i thought mr andrews would accept it that he should enter upon hodges farm that was and so manage for me that whole little affair and we will well stock the farm for him and make it comfortable and i think if he will take that trouble upon him it will be an ease to you and a favour to me your honour said he cannot do a better thing and i have had some inkling given me that you may if you please augment that estate by a purchase of equal amount contiguous to it and as you have so much money to spare i cant see your honour can do better well said he let me have the particulars another time and we will consider about it but my dear added he youll mention this to your father if you please i have too much money longman continued he lies useless though upon this occasion i shall not grudge laying out as much in liveries and other things as if i had married a lady of a fortune equal if possible to my pamelas merit and i reckon you have a good deal in hand yes sir said he more than i wish i had but i have a mortgage in view if you dont buy that kentish thing that i believe will answer very well and when matters are riper will mention it to your honour i took with me to lincolnshire said my master upwards of six hundred guineas and thought to have laid most of them out there thank god thought i you did not for he offered me five hundred of them you know but i have not laid out above two hundred and fifty of them so two hundred i left there in my escritoire because i shall go again for a fortnight or so before winter and two hundred i have brought with me and i have money i know not what in three places here the account of which is in my pocketbook in my library you have made some little presents pamela to my servants there on our nuptials and these two hundred that i have brought up i will put into your disposal that with some of them you shall do here as you did there i am ashamed good sir said i to be so costly and so worthless pray my dear replied he say not a word of that said mr longman why madam with money in stocks and one thing or another his honour could buy half the gentlemen around him he wants not money and lays up every year and it would have been pity but his honour should have wedded just as he has very true longman said my master and pulling out his purse said tell out my dear two hundred guineas and give me the rest i did so now said he take them yourself for the purposes i mentioned but mr longman do you before sunset bring my dear girl fifty pounds which is due to her this day by my promise and every three months from this day pay her fifty pounds which will be two hundred pounds per annum and this is for her to lay out at her own discretion and without account in such a way as shall derive a blessing upon us all for she was my mothers almoner and shall be mine and her own too ill go for it this instant said mr longman when he was done i looked upon my dear generous master and on mrs jervis and he gave me a nod of assent and i took twenty guineas and said dear mrs jervis accept of this which is no more than my generous master ordered me to present to mrs jewkes for a pair of gloves on my happy nuptials and so you who are much better entitled to them by the love i bear you must not refuse them said she mrs jewkes was on the spot madam at the happy time yes said my master but pamela would have rejoiced to have had you there instead of her that i should sir replied i or instead of any body except my own mother she gratefully accepted them and thanked us both but i dont know what she should thank me for for i was not worth a fourth of them myself id have you my dear said he in some handsome manner as you know how oblige longman to accept of the like present mr longman returned from his office and brought me the fifty pounds saying i have entered this new article with great pleasure to my lady fifty pounds to be paid the same sum quarterly o sir said i what will become of me to be so poor in myself and so rich in your bounty it is a shame to take all that your profuse goodness would heap upon me thus but indeed it shall not be without account make no words my dear said he are you not my wife and have i not endowed you with my goods and hitherto this is a very small part mr longman said i and mrs jervis you both see how i am even oppressed with unreturnable obligations god bless the donor and the receiver too said mr longman i am sure they will bring back good interest for madam you had ever a bountiful heart and i have seen the pleasure you used to take to dispense my late ladys alms and donations ill warrant mr longman said i notwithstanding you are so willing to have me take large sums for nothing at all i should affront you if i asked you to accept from me a pair of gloves only on account of my happy nuptials he seemed not readily to know how to answer and my master said if longman refuse you my dear he may be said to refuse your first favour on that i put twenty guineas in his hand but he insisted upon it that he would take but five i said i must desire you to oblige me mr longman or i shall think i have affronted you well if i must said he i know what i know what is that mr longman said i why madam said he i will not lay it out till my young masters birthday which i hope will be within this twelvemonth not expecting anything like this from the old gentleman i looked at my master and then blushed so i could not hold up my head charmingly said longman said my master and clasped me in his arms o my dear life god send it may be so you have quite delighted me longman though i durst not have said such a thing for the world madam said the old gentleman i beg your pardon i hope no offence but id speak it ten times in a breath to have it so take it how you please as long as my good master takes it so well mrs jervis said my master this is an overnice dear creature you dont know what a life i have had with her even on this side matrimony said mrs jervis i think mr longman says very well i am sure i shall hope for it too mr longman who had struck me of a heap withdrawing soon after my master said why my dear you cant look up the old man said nothing shocking i did not expect it though from him said i i was not aware but of some innocent pleasantry why so it was said he both innocent and pleasant and i wont forgive you if you dont say as he says come speak before mrs jervis may every thing happen sir said i that will give you delight thats my dearest love said he and kissed me with great tenderness when the servants had dined i desired to see the maidens and all four came up together you are welcome home madam said rachel we rejoice all to see you here and more to see you our lady o my good old acquaintances said i i joy to see you how do you do rachel how do you all do and i took each of them by the hand and could have kissed them for said i to myself i kissed you all last time i saw you in sorrow why should i not kiss you all with joy but i forbore in honour of their masters presence they seemed quite transported with me and my good master was pleased with the scene see here my lasses said he your mistress i need not bid you respect her for you always loved her and shell have it as much in her power as inclination to be kind to the deserving indeed said i i shall always be a kind friend to you and your dear master has ordered me to give each of you this that you may rejoice with me on my happiness and so i gave them five guineas apiece and said god bless you every one i am overjoyed to see you and they withdrew with the greatest gratitude and pleasure praying for us both i turned to my dear master tis to you dear sir said i next to god who put it into your generous heart that all my happiness is owing that my mind thus overflows with joy and gratitude and i would have kissed his hand but he clasped me in his arms and said you deserve it my dear you deserve it all mrs jervis came in said she i have seen a very affecting sight you have made your maidens quite happy madam with your kindness and condescension i saw them all four as i came by the halldoor just got up from their knees praising and praying for you both dear good bodies said i and did jane pray too may their prayers be returned upon themselves i say my master sent for jonathan and i held up all the fingers of my two hands and my master giving a nod of approbation as he came in i said well mr jonathan i could not be satisfied without seeing you in form as it were and thanking you for all your past goodwill to me youll accept of that for a pair of gloves on this happy occasion and i gave him ten guineas and took his honest hand between both mine god bless you said i with your silver hairs so like my dear father i shall always value such a good old servant of the best of masters he said o such goodness such kind words it is balm to my heart blessed be god i have lived to this day and his eyes swam in tears and he withdrew my dear said my master you make every one happy o sir said i tis you tis you and let my grateful heart always spring to my lips to acknowledge the blessings you heap upon me then in came harry and isaac and benjamin and the two grooms of this house and arthur the gardener for my dear master had ordered them by mrs jervis thus to be marshalled out and he said wheres john poor john was ashamed and did not come in till he heard himself called for i said to them how do you do my old friends and fellowservants i am glad to see you all my master said i have given you a mistress my lads that is the joy of my heart you see her goodness and condescension let your respects to her be but answerable and shell be proportionately as great a blessing to you all as she is to me harry said in the names of all your servants sir i bless your honour and your good lady and it shall be all our studies to deserve her ladyships favours as well as your honours and so i gave every one five guineas to rejoice as i said in my happiness when i came to john i said i saw you before john but i again tell you i am glad to see you he said he was quite ashamed and confounded o said i forget every thing thats past john your dear good master will and so will i for god has wonderfully brought about all these things by the very means i once thought most grievous let us therefore look forward and be only ashamed to commit faults for the time to come for they may not always be attended with like happy consequences arthur said my master i have brought you a mistress that is a great gardener shell shew you a new way to plant beans and never any body had such a hand at improving a sunflower as she o sir sir said i but yet a little dashed all my improvements in every kind of thing are owing to you i am sure and so i think i was even with the dear man and yet appeared grateful before his servants they withdrew blessing us both as the rest had done and then came in the postilion and two helpers for my master has both here and at lincolnshire fine hunting horses and it is the chief sport he takes delight in as also the scullionboy and i said how do all of you and how dost do tommy i hope youre very good here your dear master has ordered you something apiece in honour of me and my master holding three fingers to me i gave the postilion and helpers three guineas each and the little boy two and bid him let his poor mother lay it out for him for he must not spend it idly mr colbrand abraham and thomas i had before presented at tother house and when they were all gone but mrs jervis i said and now dearest sir permit me on my knees thus to bless you and pray for you and oh may god crown you with length of days and increase of honour and may your happy happy pamela by her grateful heart appear always worthy in your dear eyes though she cannot be so in her own nor in those of any others mrs jervis said my master you see the excellency of this sweet creature and when i tell you that the charms of her person all lovely as she is bind me not so strongly to her as the graces of her mind congratulate me that my happiness is built on so stable a basis indeed i do most sincerely sir said she this is a happy day to me i stept into the library while he was thus pouring out his kindness for me to mrs jervis and blessed god there on my knees for the difference i now found to what i had once known in it and when i have done the same in the first scene of my fears the once frightful summerhouse i shall have gone through most of my distressful scenes with gratitude but shall never forbear thanking god in my mind for his goodness to me in every one mrs jervis i find had whispered him what i had done above and he saw me upon my knees with my back towards him unknown to me but softly put to the door again as he had opened it a little way and i said not knowing he had seen me you have some charming pictures here sir yes said he my dear life so i have but none equal to that which your piety affords me and may the god you delight to serve bless more and more my dear angel sir said i you are all goodness i hope replied he after your sweet example i shall be better and better do you think my dear father and mother there ever was so happy a creature as i to be sure it would be very ungrateful to think with uneasiness or any thing but compassion of poor miss sally godfrey he ordered jonathan to let the evening be passed merrily but wisely as he said with what every one liked whether wine or october he was pleased afterwards to lead me up stairs and gave me possession of my ladys dressingroom and cabinet and her fine repeatingwatch and equipage and in short of a complete set of diamonds that were his good mothers as also of the two pair of diamond earrings the two diamond rings and diamond necklace he mentioned in his naughty articles which her ladyship had intended for presents to miss tomlins a rich heiress that was proposed for his wife when he was just come from his travels but which went off after all was agreed upon on both the friends sides because he approved not her conversation and she had as he told his mother too masculine an air and he never could be brought to see her but once though the lady liked him very well he presented me also with her ladyships books pictures linen laces etc that were in her apartments and bid me call those apartments mine o give me my good god humility and gratitude sunday night this day as matters could not be ready for our appearance at a better place we staid at home and my dear master employed himself a good deal in his library and i have been taken up pretty much i hope as i ought to be in thankfulness prayer and meditation in my newlypresented closet and i hope god will be pleased to give a blessing to me for i have the pleasure to think i am not puffed up with this great alteration and yet am i not wanting to look upon all these favours and blessings in the light wherein i ought to receive them both at the hands of heaven and my dear benefactor we dined together with great pleasure and i had in every word and action all the instances of kindness and affection that the most indulged heart could wish he said he would return to his closet again and at five oclock would come and take a walk with me in the garden and so retired as soon as he had dined and i went up to mine about six he was pleased to come up to me and said now my dear i will attend you for a little walk in the garden and i gave him my hand with great pleasure this garden is much better cultivated than the lincolnshire one but that is larger and has nobler walks in it and yet there is a pretty canal in this and a fountain and cascade we had a deal of sweet conversation as we walked and after we had taken a turn round i bent towards the little garden and when i came near the summerhouse took the opportunity to slip from him and just whipt up the steps of this once frightful place and kneeled down and said i bless thee o god for my escapes and for thy mercies o let me always possess a grateful humble heart and i whipt down again and joined him and he hardly missed me several of the neighbouring gentry sent their compliments to him on his return but not a word about his marriage particularly mr arthur mr towers mr brooks and mr martin of the grove monday i had a good deal of employment in choosing patterns for my new clothes he thought nothing too good but i thought every thing i saw was and he was so kind to pick out six of the richest for me to choose three suits out of saying we would furnish ourselves with more in town when we went thither one was white flowered with silver most richly and he was pleased to say that as i was a bride i should make my appearance in that the following sunday and so we shall have in two or three days from several places nothing but mantuamakers and tailors at work bless me what a chargeable and what a worthless hussy i am to the dear gentleman but his fortune and station require a great deal of it and his value for me will not let him do less than if he had married a fortune equal to his own and then as he says it would be a reflection upon him if he did and so i doubt it will be as it is for either way the world will have something to say he made me also choose some very fine laces and linen and has sent a message on purpose with his orders to hasten all down what can be done in town as the millinery matters etc to be completed there and sent by particular messengers as done all to be here and finished by saturday afternoon without fail i sent away john this morning with some more of my papers to you and with the few he will give you separate my desire is that you will send me all the papers you have done with that i may keep my word with lady davers to beg the continuance of your prayers and blessings to hope you will give me your answer about my dear benefactors proposal of the kentish farm to beg you to buy two suits of clothes each of the finest cloth for you my dear father and of a creditable silk for my dear mother and good linen and every thing answerable and that you will as my best friend bid me say let us see you here as soon as possible and he will have his chariot come for you when you tell john the day oh how i long to see you both my dear good parents and to share with you my felicities you will have im sure the goodness to go to all your creditors which are chiefly those of my poor unhappy brothers and get an account of all you are bound for and every one shall be paid to the utmost farthing and interest besides though some of them have been very cruel and unrelenting but they are entitled to their own and shall be thankfully paid now i think of it john shall take my papers down to this place that you may have something to amuse you of your dear childs instead of those you part with and i will continue writing till i am settled and you are determined and then i shall apply myself to the duties of the family in order to become as useful to my dear benefactor as my small abilities will let me if you think a couple of guineas will be of use to mrs mumford who i doubt has not much aforehand pray give them to her from me and i will return them to you as for a pair of gloves on my nuptials and look through your poor acquaintances and neighbours and let me have a list of such honest industrious poor as may be true objects of charity and have no other assistance particularly such as are blind lame or sickly with their several cases and also such poor families and housekeepers as are reduced by misfortunes as ours was and where a great number of children may keep them from rising to a state of tolerable comfort and i will choose as well as i can for i long to be making a beginning with the kind quarterly benevolence my dear good benefactor has bestowed upon me for such good purposes i am resolved to keep account of all these matters and mr longman has already furnished me with a vellum book of white paper some sides of which i hope soon to fill with the names of proper objects and though my dear master has given me all this without account yet shall he see but nobody else how i lay it out from quarter to quarter and i will if any be left carry it on like an accomptant to the next quarter and strike a balance four times a year and a general balance at every years end and i have written in it humble returns for divine mercies and locked it up safe in my newlypresented cabinet i intend to let lady davers see no farther of my papers than to her own angry letter to her brother for i would not have her see my reflections upon it and shell know down to that place all thats necessary for her curiosity as to my sufferings and the stratagems used against me and the honest part i have been enabled to act and i hope when she has read them all she will be quite reconciled for she will see it is all god almightys doings and that a gentleman of his parts and knowledge was not to be drawn in by such a poor young body as me i will detain john no longer he will tell you to read this last part first and while he stays and so with my humble duty to you both and my dear mr bs kind remembrance i rest your everdutiful and gratefully happy daughter wednesday evening honoured father and mother i will now proceed with my journal on tuesday morning my dear sir rode out and brought with him to dinner mr martin of the grove and mr arthur and mr brooks and one mr chambers and he stept up to me and said he had rode out too far to return to breakfast but he had brought with him some of his old acquaintance to dine with me are you sorry for it pamela said he i remembered his lessons and said no sure sir i cannot be angry at any thing you are pleased to do said he you know mr martins character and have severely censured him in one of your letters as one of my brother rakes and for his three lyingsin he then gave me the following account how he came to bring them said he i met them all at mr arthurs and his lady asked me if i was really married i said yes really and to whom said mr martin why replied i bluntly to my mothers waitingmaid they could not tell what to say to me hereupon and looked one upon another and i saw i had spoiled a jest from each mrs arthur said you have indeed sir a charming creature as ever i saw and she has mighty good luck ay said i and so have i but i shall say the less because a man never did any thing of this nature that he did not think he ought if it were but in policy to make the best of it nay said mr arthur if you have sinned it is with your eyes open for you know the world as well as any gentleman of your years in it why really gentlemen said i i should be glad to please all my friends but i cant expect till they know my motives and inducements that it will be so immediately but i do assure you i am exceedingly pleased myself and that you know is most to the purpose said mr brooks i have heard my wife praise your spouse that is so much for person and beauty that i wanted to see her of all things why replied i if youll all go and take a dinner with me you shall see her with all my heart and mrs arthur will you bear us company no indeed sir said she what ill warrant my wife will not be able to reconcile you to my mothers waitingmaid is not that it tell truth mrs arthur nay said she i shant be backward to pay your spouse a visit in company of the neighbouring ladies but for one single woman to go on such a sudden motion too with so many gentlemen is not right but that need not hinder you gentlemen so said he the rest sent that they should not dine at home and they and mr chambers a gentleman lately settled in these parts one and all came with me and so my dear concluded he when you make your appearance next sunday youre sure of a party in your favour for all that see you must esteem you he went to them and when i came down to dinner he was pleased to take me by the hand at my entrance into the parlour and said my dear i have brought some of my good neighbours to dine with you i said you are very good sir my dear this gentleman is mr chambers and so he presented every one to me and they saluted me and wished us both joy i for my part said mr brooks wish you joy most heartily my wife told me a good deal of the beauties of your person but i did not think we had such a flower in our country sir said i your lady is very partial to me and you are so polite a gentleman that you will not contradict your good lady ill assure you madam returned he you have not hit the matter at all for we contradict one another twice or thrice a day but the devils int if we are not agreed in so clear a case said mr martin mr brooks says very true madam in both respects meaning his wifes and his own contradiction to one another as well as in my favour for added he they have been married some years as i had not the best opinion of this gentleman nor his jest i said i am almost sorry sir for the gentlemans jest upon himself and his lady but i think it should have relieved him from a greater jest your pleasant confirmation of it but still the reason you give that it may be so i hope is the reason that may be given that it is not so to wit that they have been married some years said mr arthur mr martin i think the lady has very handsomely reproved you i think so too said mr chambers and it was but a very indifferent compliment to a bride said mr martin compliment or not gentlemen i have never seen a matrimony of any time standing that it was not so little or much but i dare say it will never be so here to be sure sir said i if it was i must be the ungratefullest person in the world because i am the most obliged person in it that notion said mr arthur is so excellent that it gives a moral certainty it never can sir said mr brooks to my dear master softly you have a most accomplished lady i do assure you as well in her behaviour and wit as in her person call her what you please why my dear friend said my master i must tell you as i have said before now that her person made me her lover but her mind made her my wife the first course coming in my dear sir led me himself to my place and set mr chambers as the greatest stranger at my right hand and mr brooks at my left and mr arthur was pleased to observe much to my advantage on the ease and freedom with which i behaved myself and helped them and said he would bring his lady to be a witness and a learner both of my manners i said i should be proud of any honour mrs arthur would vouchsafe to do me and if once i could promise myself the opportunity of his good ladys example and those of the other gentlemen present i should have the greater opinion of my worthiness to sit in the place i filled at present with much insufficiency mr arthur drank to my health and happiness and said my wife told your spouse madam you had very good luck in such a husband but i now see who has the best of it said mr brooks come come lets make no compliments for the plain truth of the matter is our good neighbours generosity and judgment have met with so equal a match in his ladys beauty and merit that i know not which has the best luck but may you be both long happy together say i and so he drank a glass of wine my best friend who always takes delight to have me praised seemed much pleased with our conversation and he said the kindest tenderest and most respectful things in the world to me insomuch that the rough mr martin said did you ever think our good friend here who used to ridicule matrimony so much would have made so complaisant a husband how long do you intend sir that this shall hold as long as my good girl deserves it said he and that i hope will be for ever but continued the kind gentleman you need not wonder i have changed my mind as to wedlock for i never expected to meet with one whose behaviour and sweetness of temper were so well adapted to make me happy after dinner and having drank good healths to each of their ladies i withdrew and they sat and drank two bottles of claret apiece and were very merry and went away full of my praises and vowing to bring their ladies to see me john having brought me your kind letter my dear father i told my good master after his friends were gone how gratefully you received his generous intentions as to the kentish farm and promised your best endeavours to serve him in that estate and that you hoped your industry and care would be so well employed in it that you should be very little troublesome to him as to the liberal manner in which he had intended to add to a provision that of itself exceeded all you wished he was very well pleased with your cheerful acceptance of it i am glad your engagements in the world lie in so small a compass as soon as you have gotten an account of them exactly you will be pleased to send it me with the list of the poor folks you are so kind to promise to procure me i think as my dear master is so generous you should account nothing that is plain too good pray dont be afraid of laying out upon yourselves my dear sir intends that you shall not when you come to us return to your old abode but stay with us till you set out for kent and so you must dispose of yourselves accordingly and i hope my dear father you have quite left off all slavish business as farmer jones has been kind to you as i have heard you say pray when you take leave of them present them with three guineas worth of good books such as a family bible a common prayer a whole duty of man or any other you think will be acceptable for they live a great way from church and in winter the ways from their farm thither are impassable he has brought me my papers safe and i will send them to lady davers the first opportunity down to the place i mentioned in my last my dear mr b just now tells me that he will carry me in the morning a little airing about ten miles off in his chariot and four to breakfast at a farmhouse noted for a fine dairy and where now and then the neighbouring gentry of both sexes resort for that purpose thursday we set out at about half an hour after six accordingly and driving pretty smartly got at this truly neat house at half an hour after eight and i was much pleased with the neatness of the good woman and her daughter and maid and he was so good as to say he would now and then take a turn with me to the same place and on the same occasion as i seemed to like it for that it would be a pretty exercise and procure us appetites to our breakfasts as well as our return would to our dinners but i find this was not though a very good reason the only one for which he gave me this agreeable airing as i shall acquaint you we were prettily received and entertained here and an elegancy ran through every thing persons as well as furniture yet all plain and my master said to the good housewife do your young boardingschool ladies still at times continue their visits to you mrs dobson yes sir said she i expect three or four of them every minute there is my dear said he within three miles of this farm a very good boardingschool for ladies the governess of it keeps a chaise and pair which is to be made a double chaise at pleasure and in summer time when the misses perform their tasks to satisfaction she favours them with an airing to this place three or four at a time and after they have breakfasted they are carried back and this serves both for a reward and for exercise and the misses who have this favour are not a little proud of it and it brings them forward in their respective tasks a very good method sir said i and just as we were talking the chaise came in with four misses all pretty much of a size and a maidservant to attend them they were shewn another little neat apartment that went through ours and made their honours very prettily as they passed by us i went into the room to them and asked them questions about their work and their lessons and what they had done to deserve such a fine airing and breakfasting and they all answered me very prettily and pray little ladies said i what may i call your names one was called miss burdoff one miss nugent one miss booth and the fourth miss goodwin i dont know which said i is the prettiest but you are all best my little dears and you have a very good governess to indulge you with such a fine airing and such delicate cream and bread and butter i hope you think so too my master came in and i had no mistrust in the world and he kissed each of them but looked more wishfully on miss goodwin than on any of the others but i thought nothing just then had she been called miss godfrey i had hit upon it in a trice when we went from them he said which do you think the prettiest of those misses really sir replied i it is hard to say miss booth is a pretty brown girl and has a fine eye miss burdoff has a great deal of sweetness in her countenance but is not so regularly featured miss nugent is very fair and miss goodwin has a fine black eye and is besides i think the genteelest shaped child but they are all pretty the maid led them into the garden to shew them the beehives and miss goodwin made a particular fine courtesy to my master and i said i believe miss knows you sir and taking her by the hand i said do you know this gentleman my pretty dear yes madam said she it is my own dear uncle i clasped her in my arms o why did you not tell me sir said i that you had a niece among these little ladies and i kissed her and away she tript after the others but pray sir said i how can this be you have no sister nor brother but lady davers how can this be he smiled and then i said o my dearest sir tell me now the truth does not this pretty miss stand in a nearer relation to you than as a niece i know she does i know she does and i embraced him as he stood tis even so my dear replied he and you remember my sisters good natured hint of miss sally godfrey i do well sir answered i but this is miss goodwin her mother chose that name for her said he because she should not be called by her own well said i excuse me sir i must go and have a little prattle with her ill send for her in again replied he and in she came in a moment i took her in my arms and said o my charming dear will you love me will you let me be your aunt yes madam answered she with all my heart and i will love you dearly but i mustnt love my uncle why so said he because replied she you would not speak to me at first and because you would not let me call you uncle for it seems she was bid not that i might not guess at her presently and yet said the pretty dear i had not seen you a great while so i hadnt well pamela said he now can you allow me to love this little innocent allow you sir replied i you would be very barbarous if you did not and i should be more so if i did not further it all i could and love the little lamb myself for your sake and for her own sake and in compassion to her poor mother though unknown to me and tears stood in my eyes said he why my love are your words so kind and your countenance so sad i drew to the window from the child and said sad it is not sir but i have a strange grief and pleasure mingled at once in my breast on this occasion it is indeed a twofold grief and a twofold pleasure as how my dear said he why sir replied i i cannot help being grieved for the poor mother of this sweet babe to think if she be living that she must call her chiefest delight her shame if she be no more that she must have had such remorse on her poor mind when she came to leave the world and her little babe and in the second place i grieve that it must be thought a kindness to the dear little soul not to let her know how near the dearest relation she has in the world is to her forgive me dear sir i say not this to reproach you in the least indeed i dont and i have a twofold cause of joy first that i have had the grace to escape the like unhappiness with this poor gentlewoman and next that this discovery has given me an opportunity to shew the sincerity of my grateful affection for you sir in the love i will always express to this dear child and then i stept to her again and kissed her and said join with me my pretty love to beg your dear uncle to let you come and live with your new aunt indeed my little precious ill love you dearly will you sir said the little charmer will you let me go and live with my aunt you are very good my pamela said he and i have not once been deceived in the hopes my fond heart has entertained of your prudence but will you sir said i will you grant me this favour i shall most sincerely love the little charmer and all i am capable of doing for her both by example and affection shall most cordially be done my dearest sir added i oblige me in this thing i think already my heart is set upon it what a sweet employment and companionship shall i have well talk of this some other time replied he but i must in prudence put some bounds to your amiable generosity i had always intended to surprise you into this discovery but my sister led the way to it out of a poorness in her spite that i could not brook and though you have pleased me beyond expression in your behaviour on this occasion yet i cant say that you have gone much beyond my expectations for i have such a high opinion of you that i think nothing could have shaken it but a contrary conduct to this you have expressed on so tender a circumstance well sir said the dear little miss then you will not let me go home with my aunt will you i am sure she will love me when you break up next my dear said he if you are a good girl you shall pay your new aunt a visit she made a low courtesy thank you sir answered she yes my dear said i and i will get you some fine things against the time i would have brought you some now had i known i should have seen my pretty love thank you madam returned she how old sir said i is miss between six and seven answered he was she ever sir said i at your house my sister replied he carried her thither once as a near relation of her lords i remember sir said i a little miss and mrs jervis and i took her to be a relation of lord davers my sister returned he knew the whole secret from the beginning and it made her a great merit with me that she kept it from the knowledge of my father who was then living and of my mother to her dyingday though she descended so low in her rage to hint the matter to you the little misses took their leaves soon after and i know not how but i am strangely affected with this dear child i wish he would be so good as to let me have her home it would be a great pleasure to have such a fine opportunity obliged as i am to shew my love for himself in my fondness for his dear miss as we came home together in the chariot he gave me the following particulars of this affair additional to what he had before mentioned that this lady was of a good family and the flower of it but that her mother was a person of great art and address and not altogether so nice in the particular between himself and miss as she ought to have been that particularly when she had reason to find him unsettled and wild and her daughter in more danger from him than he was from her yet she encouraged their privacies and even at last when she had reason to apprehend from their being surprised together in a way not so creditable to the lady that she was far from forbidding their private meetings on the contrary that on a certain time she had set one that had formerly been her footman and a halfpay officer her relation to watch an opportunity and to frighten him into a marriage with the lady that accordingly when they had surprised him in her chamber just as he had been let in they drew their swords upon him and threatened instantly to kill him if he did not promise marriage on the spot and that they had a parson ready below stairs as he found afterwards that then he suspected from some strong circumstances that miss was in the plot which so enraged him with their menaces together that he drew and stood upon his defence and was so much in earnest that the man he pushed into the arm and disabled and pressing pretty forward upon the other as he retreated he rushed in upon him near the top of the stairs and pushed him down one pair and he was much hurt by the fall not but that he said he might have paid for his rashness but that the business of his antagonists was rather to frighten than to kill him that upon this in the sight of the old lady the parson she had provided and her other daughters he went out of their house with bitter execrations against them all that after this designing to break off all correspondence with the whole family and miss too she found means to engage him to give her a meeting at woodstock in order to clear herself that poor lady she was there obliged naughty creature as he was to make herself quite guilty of a worse fault in order to clear herself of a lighter that they afterwards met at godstow often at woodstock and every neighbouring place to oxford where he was then studying as it proved guilty lessons instead of improving ones till at last the effect of their frequent interviews grew too obvious to be concealed that the young lady then when she was not fit to be seen for the credit of the family was confined and all manner of means were used to induce him to marry her that finding nothing would do they at last resolved to complain to his father and mother but that he made his sister acquainted with the matter who then happened to be at home and by her management and spirit their intentions of that sort were frustrated and seeing no hopes they agreed to lady daverss proposals and sent poor miss down to marlborough where at her expense which he answered to her again she was provided for and privately layin that lady davers took upon herself the care of the little one till it came to be fit to be put to the boardingschool where it now is and that he had settled upon the dear little miss such a sum of money as the interest of it would handsomely provide for her and the principal would be a tolerable fortune fit for a gentlewoman when she came to be marriageable and this my dear said he is the story in brief and i do assure you pamela added he i am far from making a boast of or taking a pride in this affair but since it has happened i cant say but i wish the poor child to live and be happy and i must endeavour to make her so sir said i to be sure you should and i shall take a very great pride to contribute to the dear little souls felicity if you will permit me to have her home but added i does miss know any thing who are her father and mother i wanted him to say if the poor lady was living or dead no answered he her governess has been told by my sister that she is the daughter of a gentleman and his lady who are related at a distance to lord davers and now live in jamaica and she calls me uncle only because i am the brother to lady davers whom she calls aunt and who is very fond of her as is also my lord who knows the whole matter and they have her at all her little school recesses at their house and are very kind to her i believe added he the truth of the matter is very little known or suspected for as her mother is of no mean family her friends endeavour to keep it secret as much as i and lady davers till her wrath boiled over tother day has managed the matter very dexterously and kindly the words mother is of no mean family gave me not to doubt the poor lady was living and i said but how sir can the dear misss poor mother be content to deny herself the enjoyment of so sweet a child ah pamela replied he now you come in i see you want to know whats become of the poor mother tis natural enough you should but i was willing to see how the little suspense would operate upon you dear sir said i nay replied he tis very natural my dear i think you have had a great deal of patience and are come at this question so fairly that you deserve to be answered you must know then there is some foundation for saying that her mother at least lives in jamaica for there she does live and very happily too for i must observe that she suffered so much in childbed that nobody expected her life and this when she was up made such an impression upon her that she dreaded nothing so much as the thoughts of returning to her former fault and to say the truth i had intended to make her a visit as soon as her month was well up and so unknown to me she engaged herself to go to jamaica with two young ladies who were born there and were returning to their friends after they had been four years in england for their education and recommending to me by a very moving letter her little baby and that i would not suffer it to be called by her name but goodwin that her shame might be the less known for hers and her familys sake she got her friends to assign her five hundred pounds in full of all her demands upon her family and went up to london and embarked with her companions at gravesend and so sailed to jamaica where she is since well and happily married passing to her husband for a young widow with one daughter which her husbands friends take care of and provide for and so you see pamela that in the whole story on both sides the truth is as much preserved as possible poor lady said i how her story moves me i am glad she is so happy at last and my dear said he are you not glad she is so far off too as to that sir said i i cannot be sorry to be sure as she is so happy which she could not have been here for sir i doubt you would have proceeded with your temptations if she had not gone and it shewed she was much in earnest to be good that she could leave her native country leave all her relations leave you whom she so well loved leave her dear baby and try a new fortune in a new world among quite strangers and hazard the seas and all to preserve herself from further guiltiness indeed indeed sir said i i bleed for what her distresses must be in this case i am grieved for her poor minds remorse through her childbed terrors which could have so great and so worthy an effect upon her afterwards and i honour her resolution and would rank such a returning dear lady in the class of those who are most virtuous and doubt not god almightys mercy to her and that her present happiness is the result of his gracious providence blessing her penitence and reformation but sir said i did you not once see the poor lady after her lyingin i did not believe her so much in earnest answered he and i went down to marlborough and heard she was gone from thence to calne i went to calne and heard she was gone to reading to a relations there thither i went and heard she was gone to oxford i followed and there she was but i could not see her she at last received a letter from me begging a meeting with her for i found her departure with the ladies was resolved on and that she was with her friends only to take leave of them and receive her agreed on portion and she appointed the saturday following and that was wednesday to give me a meeting at the old place at woodstock then added he i thought i was sure of her and doubted not i should spoil her intended voyage i set out on thursday to gloucester on a party of pleasure and on saturday i went to the place appointed at woodstock but when i came thither i found a letter instead of my lady and when i opened it it was to beg my pardon for deceiving me expressing her concern for her past fault her affection for me and the apprehension she had that she should be unable to keep her good resolves if she met me that she had set out on the thursday for her embarkation for that she feared nothing else could save her and had appointed this meeting on saturday at the place of her former guilt that i might be suitably impressed upon the occasion and pity and allow for her and that she might get three or four days start of me and be quite out of my reach she recommended again as upon the spot where the poor little one owed its being my tenderness to it for her sake and that was all she had to request of me she said but would not forget to pray for me in all her own dangers and in every difficulty she was going to encounter i wept at this moving tale and did not this make a deep impression upon you sir said i surely such an affecting lesson as this on the very guilty spot too i admire the dear ladys pious contrivance must have had a great effect upon you one would have thought sir it was enough to reclaim you for ever all your naughty purposes i make no doubt were quite changed why my dear said he i was much moved you may be sure when i came to reflect but at first i was so assured of being a successful tempter and spoiling her voyage that i was vexed and much out of humour but when i came to reflect as i said i was quite overcome with this instance of her prudence her penitence and her resolution and more admired her than i ever had done yet i could not bear she should so escape me neither so much overcome me as it were in an heroical bravery and i hastened away and got a bill of credit of lord davers upon his banker in london for five hundred pounds and set out for that place having called at oxford and got what light i could as to where i might hear of her there when i arrived in town which was not till monday morning i went to a place called crosbysquare where the friends of the two ladies lived she had set out in the flyingcoach on tuesday got to the two ladies that very night and on saturday had set out with them for gravesend much about the time i was expecting her at woodstock you may suppose that i was much affected my dear with this however i got my bill of credit converted into money and i set out with my servant on monday afternoon and reached gravesend that night and there i understood that she and the two ladies had gone on board from the very inn i put up at in the morning and the ship waited only for the wind which then was turning about in its favour i got a boat directly and went on board the ship and asked for mrs godfrey but judge you my dear pamela her surprise and confusion when she saw me she had like to have fainted away i offered any money to put off the sailing till next day but it would not be complied with and fain would i have got her on shore and promised to attend her if she would go over land to any part of england the ship would touch at but she was immovable every one concluded me her humble servant and were touched at the moving interview the young ladies and their female attendants especially with great difficulty upon my solemn assurances of honour she trusted herself with me in one of the cabins and there i tried what i could to prevail upon her to quit her purpose but all in vain she said i had made her quite unhappy by this interview she had difficulties enough upon her mind before but now i had embittered all her voyage and given her the deepest distress i could prevail upon her but for one favour and that with the greatest reluctance which was to accept of the five hundred pounds as a present from me and she promised at my earnest desire to draw upon me for a greater sum as a person that had her effects in my hands when she arrived if she should find it convenient for her in short this was all the favour i could procure for she would not promise so much as to correspond with me and was determined on going and i believe if i would have married her which yet i had not in my head she would not have deviated from her purpose but how sir said i did you part i would have sailed with her answered he and been landed at the first port in england or ireland i cared not which they should put in at but she was too full of apprehensions to admit it and the rough fellow of a master captain they called him but in my mind i could have thrown him overboard would not stay a moment the wind and tide being quite fair and was very urgent with me to go ashore or to go the voyage and being impetuous in my temper spoiled you know my dear by my mother and not used to control i thought it very strange that wind or tide or any thing else should be preferred to me and my money but so it was i was forced to go and so took leave of the ladies and the other passengers wished them a good voyage gave five guineas among the ships crew to be good to the ladies and took such a leave as you may better imagine than i express she recommended once more to me the dear guest as she called her the ladies being present and thanked me for all these instances of my regard which she said would leave a strong impression on her mind and at parting she threw her arms about my neck and we took such a leave as affected every one present men as well as ladies so with a truly heavy heart i went down the ships side to my boat and stood up in it looking at her as long as i could see her and she at me with her handkerchief at her eyes and then i gazed at the ship till and after i had landed as long as i could discern the least appearance of it for she was under sail in a manner when i left her and so i returned highly disturbed to my inn i went to bed but rested not returned to london the next morning and set out that afternoon again for the country and so much my dear for poor sally godfrey she sends i understand by all opportunities with the knowledge of her husband to learn how her child by her first husband does and has the satisfaction to know she is happily provided for and about half a year ago her spouse sent a little negro boy of about ten years old as a present to wait upon her but he was taken ill of the smallpox and died in a month after he was landed sure sir said i your generous mind must have been long affected with this melancholy case and all its circumstances it hung upon me indeed some time said he but i was full of spirit and inconsideration i went soon after to travel a hundred new objects danced before my eyes and kept reflection from me and you see i had five or six years afterwards and even before that so thoroughly lost all the impressions you talk of that i doubted not to make my pamela change her name without either act of parliament or wedlock and be sally godfrey the second o you dear naughty man said i this seems but too true but i bless god that it is not so i bless god for your reformation and that for your own dear sake as well as mine well my dear said he and i bless god for it too i do most sincerely and tis my greater pleasure because i have as i hoped seen my error so early and that with such a stock of youth and health on my side in all appearance i can truly abhor my past liberties and pity poor sally godfrey from the same motives that i admire my pamelas virtues and resolve to make myself as worthy of them as possible and i will hope my dear your prayers for my pardon and my perseverance will be of no small efficacy on this occasion these agreeable reflections on this melancholy but instructive story brought us in view of his own house and we alighted and took a walk in the garden till dinner was ready and now we are so busy about making ready for our appearance that i shall hardly have time to write till that be over monday morning yesterday we set out attended by john abraham benjamin and isaac in fine new liveries in the best chariot which had been new cleaned and lined and new harnessed so that it looked like a quite new one but i had no arms to quarter with my dear lord and masters though he jocularly upon my taking notice of my obscurity said that he had a good mind to have the olivebranch which would allude to his hopes quartered for mine i was dressed in the suit i mentioned of white flowered with silver and a rich headdress and the diamond necklace earrings etc i also mentioned before and my dear sir in a fine laced silk waistcoat of blue paduasoy and his coat a pearlcoloured fine cloth with gold buttons and buttonholes and lined with white silk and he looked charmingly indeed i said i was too fine and would have laid aside some of the jewels but he said it would be thought a slight to me from him as his wife and though as i apprehended it might be that people would talk as it was yet he had rather they should say any thing than that i was not put upon an equal footing as his wife with any lady he might have married it seems the neighbouring gentry had expected us and there was a great congregation for against my wish we were a little of the latest so that as we walked up the church to his seat we had abundance of gazers and whisperers but my dear master behaved with so intrepid an air and was so cheerful and complaisant to me that he did credit to his kind choice instead of shewing as if he was ashamed of it and as i was resolved to busy my mind entirely with the duties of the day my intentness on that occasion and my thankfulness to god for his unspeakable mercies to me so took up my thoughts that i was much less concerned than i should otherwise have been at the gazings and whisperings of the ladies and gentlemen as well as of the rest of the congregation whose eyes were all turned to our seat when the sermon was ended we staid the longer because the church should be pretty empty but we found great numbers at the churchdoors and in the churchporch and i had the pleasure of hearing many commendations as well of my person as my dress and behaviour and not one reflection or mark of disrespect mr martin who is single mr chambers mr arthur and mr brooks with their families were all there and the four gentlemen came up to us before we went into the chariot and in a very kind and respectful manner complimented us both and mrs arthur and mrs brooks were so kind as to wish me joy and mrs brooks said you sent mr brooks madam home tother day quite charmed with a manner which you have convinced a thousand persons this day is natural to you you do me great honour madam replied i such a good ladys approbation must make me too sensible of my happiness my dear master handed me into the chariot and stood talking with sir thomas atkyns at the door of it who was making him abundance of compliments and is a very ceremonious gentleman a little too extreme in that way and i believe to familiarize me to the gazers which concerned me a little for i was dashed to hear the praises of the countrypeople and to see how they crowded about the chariot several poor people begged my charity and i beckoned john with my fan and said divide in the further churchporch that money to the poor and let them come tomorrow morning to me and i will give them something more if they dont importune me now so i gave him all the silver i had which happened to be between twenty and thirty shillings and this drew away from me their clamorous prayers for charity mr martin came up to me on the other side of the chariot and leaned on the very door while my master was talking to sir thomas from whom he could not get away and said by all thats good you have charmed the whole congregation not a soul but is full of your praises my neighbour knew better than any body could tell him how to choose for himself why said he the dean himself looked more upon you than his book o sir said i you are very encouraging to a weak mind i vow said he i say no more than is truth id marry tomorrow if i was sure of meeting with a person of but onehalf the merit you have you are continued he and tis not my way to praise too much an ornament to your sex an honour to your spouse and a credit to religion every body is saying so added he for you have by your piety edified the whole church as he had done speaking the dean himself complimented me that the behaviour of so worthy a lady would be very edifying to his congregation and encouraging to himself sir said i you are very kind i hope i shall not behave unworthy of the good instructions i shall have the pleasure to receive from so worthy a divine he bowed and went on sir thomas then applied to me my master stepping into the chariot and said i beg pardon madam for detaining your good spouse from you but i have been saying he is the happiest man in the world i bowed to him but i could have wished him further to make me sit so in the notice of every one which for all i could do dashed me not a little mr martin said to my master if youll come to church every sunday with your charming lady i will never absent myself and shell give a good example to all the neighbourhood o my dear sir said i to my master you know not how much i am obliged to good mr martin he has by his kind expressions made me dare to look up with pleasure and gratitude said my master my dear love i am very much obliged as well as you to my good friend mr martin and he said to him we will constantly go to church and to every other place where we can have the pleasure of seeing mr martin mr martin said gad sir you are a happy man and i think your ladys example has made you more polite and handsome too than i ever knew you before though we never thought you unpolite neither and so he bowed and went to his own chariot and as we drove away the people kindly blessed us and called us a charming pair as i have no other pride i hope in repeating these things than in the countenance the general approbation gives to my dear master for his stooping so low you will excuse me for it i know in the afternoon we went again to church and a little early at my request but the church was quite full and soon after even crowded so much does novelty the mores the pity attract the eyes of mankind mr martin came in after us and made up to our seat and said if you please my dear friend i will take my seat with you this afternoon with all my heart said my master i was sorry for it but was resolved my duty should not be made second to bashfulness or any other consideration and when divine service began i withdrew to the farther end of the pew and left the gentlemen in the front and they behaved quite suitably both of them to the occasion i mention this the rather because mr martin was not very noted for coming to church or attention when there before the dean preached again which he was not used to do out of compliment to us and an excellent sermon he made on the relative duties of christianity and it took my particular attention for he made many fine observations on the subject mr martin addressed himself twice or thrice to me during the sermon but he saw me so wholly engrossed with hearkening to the good preacher that he forbore interrupting me yet i took care according to the lessons formerly given me to observe to him a cheerful and obliging behaviour as one of mr bs friends and intimates my master asked him to give him his company to supper and he said i am so taken with your lady that you must not give me too much encouragement for i shall be always with you if you do he was pleased to say you cannot favour us with too much of your company and as i have left you in the lurch in your single state i think you will do well to oblige us as much as you can and who knows but my happiness may reform another rake who knows said mr martin why i know for i am more than half reformed already at the chariot door mrs arthur mrs brooks and mrs chambers were brought to me by their respective spouses and presently the witty lady towers who bantered me before as i once told you joined them and mrs arthur said she wished me joy and that all the good ladies my neighbours would collect themselves together and make me a visit this said i will be an honour madam that i can never enough acknowledge it will be very kind so to countenance a person who will always study to deserve your favour by the most respectful behaviour lady towers said my dear neighbour you want no countenance your own merit is sufficient i had a slight cold that kept me at home in the morning but i heard you so much talked of and praised that i resolved not to stay away in the afternoon and i join in the joy every one gives you she turned to my master and said you are a sly thief as i always thought you where have you stolen this lady and now how barbarous is it thus unawares in a manner to bring her here upon us to mortify and eclipse us all you are very kind madam said he that you and all my worthy neighbours see with my eyes but had i not known she had so much excellency of mind and behaviour as would strike every body in her favour at first sight i should not have dared to class her with such of my worthy neighbours as now so kindly congratulate us both i own said she softly i was one of your censurers but i never liked you so well in my life as for this action now i see how capable your bride is of giving distinction to any condition and coming to me my dear neighbour said she excuse me for having but in my thought the remembrance that i have seen you formerly when by your sweet air and easy deportment you so much surpass us all and give credit to your present happy condition dear good madam said i how shall i suitably return my acknowledgments but it will never be a pain to me to look back upon my former days now i have the kind allowance and example of so many worthy ladies to support me in the honours to which the most generous of men has raised me sweetly said she was pleased to say if i was in another place i would kiss you for that answer oh happy happy mr b said she to my master what reputation have you not brought upon your judgment i wont be long before i see you added she ill assure you if i come by myself that shall be your own fault madam said mrs brooks and so they took leave and i gave my hand to my dear master and said how happy have you made me generous sir and the dean who had just come up heard me and said and how happy you have made your spouse ill venture to pronounce is hard to say from what i observe of you both i courtesied and blushed not thinking any body heard me and my master telling him he should be glad of the honour of a visit from him he said he would pay his respects to us the first opportunity and bring his wife and daughter to attend me i said that was doubly kind and i should be very proud of cultivating so worthy an acquaintance i thanked him for his kind discourse and he thanked me for my attention which he called exemplary and so my dear master handed me into the chariot and we were carried home both happy and both pleased thank god mr martin came in the evening with another gentleman his friend one mr dormer and he entertained us with the favourable opinion he said every one had of me and of the choice my good benefactor had made this morning the poor came according to my invitation and i sent them away with glad hearts to the number of twentyfive there were not above twelve or fourteen on sunday that john divided the silver among which i gave him for that purpose but others got hold of the matter and made up to the above number tuesday my generous master has given me this morning a most considerate but yet from the nature of it melancholy instance of his great regard for my unworthiness which i never could have wished hoped for or even thought of he took a walk with me after breakfast into the garden and a little shower falling he led me for shelter into the little summerhouse in the private garden where he formerly gave me apprehensions and sitting down by me he said i have now finished all that lies on my mind my dear and am very easy for have you not wondered that i have so much employed myself in my library been so much at home and yet not in your company no sir said i i have never been so impertinent as to wonder at any thing you please to employ yourself about nor would give way to a curiosity that should be troublesome to you and besides i know your large possessions and the method you take of looking yourself into your affairs must needs take up so much of your time that i ought to be very careful how i intrude upon you well said he but ill tell you what has been my last work i have taken it into my consideration that at present my line is almost extinct and that the chief part of my maternal estate in case i die without issue will go to another line and great part of my personal will fall into such hands as i shall not care my pamela should he at the mercy of i have therefore as human life is uncertain made such a disposition of my affairs as will make you absolutely independent and happy as will secure to you the power of doing a great deal of good and living as a person ought to do who is my relict and shall put it out of any bodys power to molest your father and mother in the provision i design them for the remainder of their days and i have finished all this very morning except to naming trustees for you and if you have any body you would confide in more than another i would have you speak i was so touched with this mournful instance of his excessive goodness to me and the thoughts necessarily flowing from the solemn occasion that i was unable to speak and at last relieved my mind by a violent fit of weeping and could only say clasping my arms around the dear generous man how shall i support this so very cruel yet so very kind dont my dear said he be concerned at what gives me pleasure i am not the nearer my end for having made this disposition but i think the putting off these material points when so many accidents every day happen and life is so precarious is one of the most inexcusable things in the world and there are many important points to be thought of when life is drawing to its utmost verge and the mind may be so agitated and unfit that it is a most sad thing to put off to that time any of those concerns which more especially require a considerate and composed frame of temper and perfect health and vigour to give directions about my poor friend mr carlton who died in my arms so lately and had a mind disturbed by worldly considerations on one side a weakness of body through the violence of his distemper on another and the concerns of still as much more moment as the soul is to the body on a third made so great an impression upon me then that i was the more impatient to come to this house where were most of my writings in order to make the disposition i have now perfected and since it is grievous to my dear girl i will myself think of such trustees as shall be most for her benefit i have only therefore to assure you my dear that in this instance as i will do in any other i can think of i have studied to make you quite easy free and independent and because i shall avoid all occasions for the future which may discompose you i have but one request to make which is that if it please god for my sins to separate me from my dearest pamela you will only resolve not to marry one person for i would not be such a herod as to restrain you from a change of condition with any other however reluctantly i may think of any other persons succeeding me in your esteem i could not answer and thought my heart would have burst and he continued to conclude at once a subject that is so grievous to you i will tell you my pamela that this person is mr williams and now i will acquaint you with my motive for this request which is wholly owing to my niceness and to no dislike i have for him or apprehension of any likelihood that it will be so but methinks it would reflect a little upon my pamela if she was to give way to such a conduct as if she had married a man for his estate when she had rather have had another had it not been for that and that now the world will say she is at liberty to pursue her inclination the parson is the man and i cannot bear even the most distant apprehension that i had not the preference with you of any man living let me have been what i would as i have shewn my dear life that i have preferred her to all her sex of whatever degree i could not speak might i have had the world and he took me in his arms and said i have now spoken all my mind and expect no answer and i see you too much moved to give me one only forgive me the mention since i have told you my motive which as much affects your reputation as my niceness and offer not at an answer only say you forgive me and i hope i have not one discomposing thing to say to my dearest for the rest of my life which i pray god for both our sakes to lengthen for many happy years grief still choaked up the passage of my words and he said the shower is over my dear let us walk out again he led me out and i would have spoken but he said i will not hear my dear creature say any thing to hearken to your assurance of complying with my request would look as if i doubted you and wanted it i am confident i needed only to speak my mind to be observed by you and i shall never more think on the subject if you dont remind me of it he then most sweetly changed the discourse dont you with pleasure my dear said he take in the delightful fragrance that this sweet shower has given to these banks of flowers your presence is so enlivening to me that i could almost fancy that what we owe to the shower is owing to that and all nature methinks blooms around me when i have my pamela by my side you are a poetess my dear and i will give you a few lines that i made myself on such an occasion as this i am speaking of the presence of a sweet companion and the fresh verdure that after a shower succeeding a long drought shewed itself throughout all vegetable nature and then in a sweet and easy accent with his dear arms about me as we walked he sung me the following verses of which he afterwards favoured me with a copy i all nature blooms when you appear the fields their richest livries wear oaks elms and pines blest with your view shoot out fresh greens and bud anew the varying seasons you supply and when youre gone they fade and die ii sweet philomel in mournful strains to you appeals to you complains the towring lark on rising wing warbles to you your praise does sing he cuts the yielding air and flies to heavn to type your future joys iii the purple violet damask rose each to delight your senses blows the lilies ope as you appear and all the beauties of the year diffuse their odours at your feet who give to evry flowr its sweet iv for flowrs and women are allied both natures glory and her pride of evry fragrant sweet possest they bloom but for the fair ones breast and to the swelling bosom borne each other mutually adorn thus sweetly did he palliate the woes which the generosity of his actions mixed with the solemness of the occasion and the strange request he had vouchsafed to make me had occasioned and all he would permit me to say was that i was not displeased with him displeased with you dearest sir said i let me thus testify my obligations and the force all your commands shall have upon me and i took the liberty to clasp my arms about his neck and kissed him but yet my mind was pained at times and has been to this hour god grant that i may never see the dreadful moment that shall shut up the precious life of this excellent generous benefactor of mine and but i cannot bear to suppose i cannot say more on such a deep subject oh what a poor thing is human life in its best enjoyments subjected to imaginary evils when it has no real ones to disturb it and that can be made as effectually unhappy by its apprehensions of remote contingencies as if it was struggling with the pangs of a present distress this duly reflected upon methinks should convince every one that this world is not a place for the immortal mind to be confined to and that there must be an hereafter where the whole soul shall be satisfied but i shall get out of my depth my shallow mind cannot comprehend as it ought these weighty subjects let me only therefore pray that after having made a grateful use of gods mercies here i may with my dear benefactor rejoice in that happy state where is no mixture no unsatisfiedness and where all is joy and peace and love for evermore i said when we sat at supper the charming taste you gave me sir of your poetical fancy makes me sure you have more favours of this kind to delight me with if you please and may i beg to be indulged on this agreeable head hitherto said he my life has been too much a life of gayety and action to be busied so innocently some little essays i have now and then attempted but very few have i completed indeed i had not patience nor attention enough to hold me long to any one thing now and then perhaps i may occasionally shew you what i have essayed but i never could please myself in this way friday we were yesterday favoured with the company of almost all the neighbouring gentlemen and their ladies who by appointment with one another met to congratulate our happiness nothing could be more obliging more free and affectionate than the ladies nothing more polite than the gentlemen all was performed for they came to supper with decency and order and much to every ones satisfaction which was principally owing to good mrs jerviss care and skill who is an excellent manager for my part i was dressed out only to be admired as it seems and truly if i had not known that i did not make myself as you my dear father once hinted to me and if i had had the vanity to think as well of myself as the good company was pleased to do i might possibly have been proud but i know as my lady davers said though in anger yet in truth that i am but a poor bit of painted dirt all that i value myself upon is that god has raised me to a condition to be useful in my generation to better persons than myself this is my pride and i hope this will be all my pride for what was i of myself all the good i can do is but a poor thirdhand good for my dearest master himself is but the secondhand god the allgracious the allgood the allbountiful the allmighty the allmerciful god is the first to him therefore be all the glory as i expect the happiness the unspeakable happiness my everdear and everhonoured father and mother of enjoying you both here under this roof so soon and pray let it be as soon as you can i will not enter into the particulars of the last agreeable evening for i shall have a thousand things as well as that to talk to you upon i fear you will be tired with my prattle when i see you i am to return these visits singly and there were eight ladies here of different families dear heart i shall find enough to do i doubt my time will not be so well filled up as i once promised my dear master but he is pleased cheerful kind affectionate o what a happy creature am i may i be always thankful to god and grateful to him when all these tumultuous visitings are over i shall have my mind i hope subside into a family calm that i may make myself a little useful to the household of my dear master or else i shall be an unprofitable servant indeed lady davers sent this morning her compliments to us both very affectionately and her lords good wishes and congratulations and she desired my writings per bearer and says she will herself bring them to me again with thanks as soon as she has read them and she and her lord will come and be my guests that was her particularly kind word for a fortnight i have now but one thing to wish for and then methinks i shall be all ecstasy and that is your presence both of you and your blessings which i hope you will bestow upon me every morning and night till you are settled in the happy manner my dear mr b has intended methinks i want sadly your list of the honest and worthy poor for the money lies by me and brings me no interest you see i am become a mere usurer and want to make use upon use and yet when i have done all i cannot do so much as i ought god forgive my imperfections i tell my dear spouse i want another dairyhouse visit to be sure if he wont at present permit it i shall if it please god to spare us tease him like any overindulged wife if as the dear charmer grows older he wont let me have the pleasure of forming her tender mind as well as i am able lest poor little soul she fall into such snares as her unhappy dear mother fell into i am providing a power of pretty things for her against i see her next that i may make her love me if i can just now i have the blessed news that you will set out for this happy house on tuesday morning the chariot shall be with you without fail god give us a happy meeting o how i long for it forgive your impatient daughter who sends this to amuse you on your journey and desires to be ever most dutifully yours here end at present the letters of pamela to her father and mother they arrived at their daughters house on tuesday evening in the following week and were received by her with the utmost joy and duty and with great goodness and complaisance by mr b and having resided there till every thing was put in order for them at the kentish estate they were carried down thither by himself and their daughter and put into possession of the pretty farm he had designed for them the reader will here indulge us in a few brief observations which naturally result from the story and characters and which will serve as so many applications of its most material incidents to the minds of youth of both sexes first then in the character of the gentleman may be seen that of a fashionable libertine who allowed himself in the free indulgence of his passions especially to the fair sex and found himself supported in his daring attempts by an affluent fortune in possession a personal bravery as it is called readier to give than take offence and an imperious will yet as he betimes sees his errors and reforms in the bloom of youth an edifying lesson may be drawn from it for the use of such as are born to large fortunes and who may be taught by his example the inexpressible difference between the hazards and remorse which attend a profligate course of life and the pleasures which flow from virtuous love and benevolent actions in the character of lady davers let the proud and the highborn see the deformity of unreasonable passion and how weak and ridiculous such persons must appear who suffer themselves as is usually the case to be hurried from the height of violence to the most abject submission and subject themselves to be outdone by the humble virtue they so much despise let good clergymen in mr williams see that whatever displeasure the doing of their duty may give for a time to their proud patrons providence will at last reward their piety and turn their distresses to triumph and make them even more valued for a conduct that gave offence while the violence of passion lasted than if they had meanly stooped to flatter or soothe the vices of the great in the examples of good old andrews and his wife let those who are reduced to a low estate see that providence never fails to reward their honesty and integrity and that god will in his own good time extricate them by means unforeseen out of their present difficulties and reward them with benefits unhoped for the upper servants of great families may from the odious character of mrs jewkes and the amiable ones of mrs jervis mr longman etc learn what to avoid and what to choose to make themselves valued and esteemed by all who know them and from the double conduct of poor john the lower servants may learn fidelity and how to distinguish between the lawful and unlawful commands of a superior the poor deluded female who like the once unhappy miss godfrey has given up her honour and yielded to the allurements of her designing lover may learn from her story to stop at the first fault and by resolving to repent and amend see the pardon and blessing which await her penitence and a kind providence ready to extend the arms of its mercy to receive and reward her returning duty while the prostitute pursuing the wicked courses into which perhaps she was at first inadvertently drawn hurries herself into filthy diseases and an untimely death and too probably into everlasting perdition let the desponding heart be comforted by the happy issue which the troubles and trials of pamela met with when they see in her case that no danger nor distress however inevitable or deep to their apprehensions can be out of the power of providence to obviate or relieve and which as in various instances in her story can turn the most seemingly grievous things to its own glory and the reward of suffering innocence and that too at a time when all human prospects seem to fail let the rich and those who are exalted from a low to a high estate learn from her that they are not promoted only for a single good but that providence has raised them that they should dispense to all within their reach the blessings it has heaped upon them and that the greater the power is to which god hath raised them the greater is the good that will be expected from them from the low opinion she every where shews of herself and her attributing all her excellencies to pious education and her ladys virtuous instructions and bounty let persons even of genius and piety learn not to arrogate to themselves those gifts and graces which they owe least of all to themselves since the beauties of person are frail and it is not in our power to give them to ourselves or to be either prudent wise or good without the assistance of divine grace from the same good example let children see what a blessing awaits their duty to their parents though ever so low in the world and that the only disgrace is to be dishonest but none at all to be poor from the economy she purposes to observe in her elevation let even ladies of condition learn that there are family employments in which they may and ought to make themselves useful and give good examples to their inferiors as well as equals and that their duty to god charity to the poor and sick and the different branches of household management ought to take up the most considerable portions of their time from her signal veracity which she never forfeited in all the hardships she was tried with though her answers as she had reason to apprehend would often make against her and the innocence she preserved throughout all her stratagems and contrivances to save herself from violation persons even sorely tempted may learn to preserve a sacred regard to truth which always begets a reverence for them even in the corruptest minds in short her obliging behaviour to her equals before her exaltation her kindness to them afterwards her forgiving spirit and her generosity her meekness in every circumstance where her virtue was not concerned her charitable allowances for others as in the case of miss godfrey for faults she would not have forgiven in herself her kindness and prudence to the offspring of that melancholy adventure her maiden and bridal purity which extended as well to her thoughts as to her words and actions her signal affiance in god her thankful spirit her grateful heart her diffusive charity to the poor which made her blessed by them whenever she appeared abroad the cheerful ease and freedom of her deportment her parental conjugal and maternal duty her social virtues are all so many signal instances of the excellency of her mind which may make her character worthy of the imitation of her sex and the editor of these sheets will have his end if it inspires a laudable emulation in the minds of any worthy persons who may thereby entitle themselves to the rewards the praises and the blessings by which pamela was so deservedly distinguished the end
