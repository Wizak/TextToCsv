carolyn keene hit and run holiday chapter one вђњwe made itвђќ nancy drew said with a grin вђњfort lauderdale here we areвђќ gripping the wheel in eager anticipation nancy turned the rental car onto route aa a coastal highway lined with tall swaying palm trees to the left was a seemingly endless string of hotels and motels fastfood places restaurants and discos to the right shimmering in the late morning sun was a broad beach of nearly white sand and beyond that the sparkling bluegreen waters of the atlantic ocean beside nancy george fayne gazed out the window at the beach вђњi canвђt wait to get into that waterвђќ she said вђњi may never come out except to eatвђќ вђњwho cares about the waterвђќ bess marvin georgeвђs cousin said with a giggle вђњjust look at all those tan male bodies out there iвђve already counted nine that i could fall in love withвђќ as their car passed a group of boys crossing the street bess turned around and looked out the back window вђњmake that twelveвђќ she said excitedly nancy glanced into the rearview mirror and laughed вђњhelp me find our hotel firstвђќ she suggested вђњthen you can check out the boysвђќ early that morning the three friends had left the cold march sleets of river heights and flown to the south of florida joining thousands of other young people on spring break who poured into fort lauderdale in search of sun sand fun and romance actually bess was the only one who was looking to fall in love george was still attached to jon berntsen a boy sheвђd met on a ski trip and nancyвђs relationship with ned nickerson was in good shape at the moment nancy knew that bess with her blond hair and pretty figure would probably have a date in fifteen minutes flat while slender athletic darkhaired george was sure to set some kind of swimming volleyball or surfing record as for herself nancy was looking just to have fun and go home with a great tan in her last case smile and say murder sheвђd discovered that the world of publishing could be deadly when sheвђd exposed a clever plot that included murder so a florida vacation seemed the perfect way to unwind вђњthere it isвђќ she said pointing to a gleaming white stucco building вђњthe surfside inn they were rightвђevery room has a window facing the oceanвђќ вђњand the boysвђќ bess said with a sigh вђњletвђs hurry and change so we can hit the beachвђќ nancy suggested as she pulled the car into a tight parking space on a side street next to the hotel вђњwhat do you mean вђweвђвђќ george asked with a laugh вђњyouвђve got a case to solve rememberвђќ nancy laughed too вђњitвђs not a caseвђќ claimed the young detective вђњiвђm just checking up on kim itвђll take me all of five minutesвђќ kim baylor a friend of all three girls had been in fort lauderdale for ten days just before nancy left river heights kimвђs mother had called and told her that kim had decided to stay on an extra week mrs baylor wasnвђt really worried she said she simply wanted nancy to drop by kimвђs hotel and see that everything was all right sheвђd felt that kim had sounded odd over the phone but thought she was probably just being an overprotective parent вђњi bet i can solve your mystery for you without even talking to kimвђќ bess told nancy as they piled out of the car вђњitвђs simpleвђkim met a fabulous guy and sheвђs staying on because sheвђs madly in loveвђќ bess tugged two canvas bags from the back of the car then stared across the street at a tall wellmuscled boy running toward the ocean вђњjust look at himвђќ she said dreamily вђњwhat couldnвђt i do with an extra week down hereвђќ вђњstop drooling and help us carry the bags insideвђќ george joked вђњthe sooner we get changed the sooner you can start looking for mr rightвђќ the hotel room wasnвђt large or luxurious but it had everything the girls needed and besides none of them planned to spend much time in it in ten minutes they had changed out of their travel clothes and into their swimsuits bess had brought six and for her first trip to the sun and sand she put on a blazing pink bikini that showed off her figure perfectly george who was wearing a blueandwhitestriped tank suit cut very high on the legs gave bess a wry smile вђњnobodyвђs going to have any trouble seeing youвђќ she commented вђњnot in that colorвђќ вђњthatвђs the whole pointвђќ bess replied seriously then she sighed as she looked at nancy whose bluegreen bikini was the perfect color for her reddish blond hair and made her slim legs look miles long вђњi just wish i had your figureвђќ bess told her enviously вђњyou donвђt have to worryвђќ nancy assured her вђњiвђm not down here for the guys remember and even if i were you have half an hour before i even show up on the beachвђќ bess grabbed a large beach towel вђњwhat do you meanвђќ вђњiвђve decided to drop by kimвђs hotel firstвђќ nancy explained she found her beach bag and tossed in everything she could possibly need on the beach sunglasses suntan lotion a book her walkman and even an extra bikini then she threw on a short coverup made of soft white cotton she started toward the door вђњi thought iвђd solve my вђcaseвђ firstвђќ she said with a grin вђњbut after thatвђlook out lauderdaleвђќ kimвђs hotel the vistamar turned out to be just three blocks away from the surfside and it should have taken nancy about two minutes to reach it instead it took closer to ten the sidewalks were jammed with kids heading for the beach or just strolling along stopping to strike up a conversation with anyone who caught their eye girls were checking out boys boys were checking out girls and nancy lost count of how many surfing swimming and disco dates she turned down she saw plenty of greatlooking guys she wouldnвђt have minded spending time with but because of ned she wasnвђt really tempted still it was fun just being in the middle of it all and as she spotted kimвђs hotel she thought that bess was probably rightвђkim must have met somebody special and she wanted to be with him for as long as possible the vistamar was on a narrow side street just off the main road it was lime green five stories high and when nancy went in she just missed the elevator however since kimвђs room was on the second floor she climbed the stairs she found room easily and was just about to knock when she heard kimвђs voice through the partially open door вђњdonвђt blame me ricardoвђќ kim cried urgently вђњi donвђt know how they found out but they didвђќ there was a pause and when she didnвђt hear ricardo answer nancy figured kim must be talking on the phone she tried not to eavesdrop but kim sounded so frantic it was hard not to hear her вђњi told her not to leaveвђќ kim went on вђњshe knew she wasnвђt supposed to but i donвђt know ricardo maybe she got cabin fever or something what difference does it make sheвђs goneвђќ nancy wasnвђt even trying not to listen anymore who was gone she wondered kim hadnвђt come down with a girlfriend nancy knew that but even if sheвђd taken on a roommate what was the business about not leaving the room kim lowered her voice and nancy leaned closer to the door that was when she noticed itвђnot only was the door ajar but the lock had obviously been broken it hadnвђt been a very smooth job either the metal looked as if it had been gouged with a screwdriver and the wood around it was splintered whoever had broken it must have wanted to get inside in a hurry nancy didnвђt have a clue as to what was going on and she waited impatiently for kim to finish talking so she could find out вђњdonвђt say that youвђre scaring meвђќ kim protested she waited then sighed вђњall right okay iвђll meet you at your perch in ten minutesвђќ perch nancy almost smiled was ricardo a boy or a bird when she heard kim say goodbye she started to knock again but the door was flung open before she had a chance and a very startled kim baylor was staring at her вђњnancyвђќ kimвђs brown eyes widened in surprise вђњwhat are you doing hereвђќ вђњi told you i might come down rememberвђќ nancy said вђњbesides yourвђвђќ вђњoh thatвђs rightвђќ kim interrupted вђњso much has been going on i guess i forgotвђќ she was already out the door and hurrying down the hall toward the elevator вђњlisten i canвђt talk now iвђm in a rush but i really do want to see you maybe when iвђвђќ вђњhey whereвђs the fireвђќ nancy joked as kim kept jabbing at the elevator button вђњletвђs take the stairs and then iвђll walk you wherever youвђre going we can talk on the wayвђќ she hurried to keep up with her friend who was already at the stairs вђњkim whatвђs going on you look freaked to say the leastвђќ kim hurried down the stairs her rubber beach sandals slapping on the cement вђњi am freakedвђќ she called over her shoulder вђњyou just wonвђt believe whatвђs been happeningвђќ вђњtry meвђќ nancy suggested вђњi will i will but nancy itвђs just too complicated to get into right now iвђve got something really important to do but i promise iвђll tell you everything as soon as i canвђќ frustrated nancy followed kim through the hotelвђs small deserted lobby toward the street door kim dashed outside nancy ran after her but her sandal chose that moment to slip off her foot she bent over put it back on and hurried after her friend kim was standing impatiently on the curb her long brown hair blowing in the sea breeze she reached up pulled a strand of hair out of her eyes and stepped into the street nancy was just leaving the hotel when she heard the sound of a carвђs engine firing and the squeal of tires as the car peeled away she saw that kim had reached the middle of the street nancy started after her but it was at that second that she noticed the dark blue car racing toward kim nancy yelled but it was too late the car was barreling down the street at a crazy speed kim opened her mouth to scream but her voice was drowned out by the sound of the impact the car never slowed down its tires squealed again as it sped around the corner and out of sight chapter two in a second nancy was at kimвђs side it was impossible to tell how badly her friend was hurt all nancy could see were cuts and scrapes but she didnвђt dare move her she wasnвђt even going to take the chance of putting her friendвђs head in her lap she knelt down took kimвђs hand and leaned close to her вђњkimвђќ nancy tried to keep her voice from shaking вђњitвђs going to be okay just donвђt moveвђќ gripping nancyвђs hand kim licked her lips and tried to say something her voice was so weak that nancy could barely hear her вђњrositaвђќ kim whispered вђњthe it was rositaвђќ she took another breath and started to say something more but then her eyelids fluttered closed and she was silent nancy looked up and was surprised to see that a crowd of ten or fifteen people had gathered sheвђd been concentrating so hard on kim that she hadnвђt even noticed them вђњcould someone call an ambulance pleaseвђќ nancy asked an elderly man nodded his head вђњof courseвђќ he said and hurried away a voice close to nancy asked вђњis she deadвђќ the person whoвђd asked about kim was a young woman wearing the uniform of a hotel maid nancy swallowed hard and shook her head вђњno sheвђs not deadвђќ she told her вђњsheвђs breathing but she passed outвђќ the woman nodded and started to leave вђњwaitвђќ nancy called вђњdid you see what happenedвђќ вђњno i didnвђtвђќ the woman said вђњi was inside i heard a scream but thatвђs all i came out to see and on the way i told my boss to call the police it sounded like a bad accidentвђќ вђњit was badвђќ nancy agreed grimly вђњbut it wasnвђt an accidentвђќ вђњi wouldnвђt know about that missвђќ the woman said backing away вђњi have to go to work nowвђќ in the distance nancy could hear the wail of a siren and she knew help was on the way still holding kimвђs hand she glanced up at the other people вђњdid anyone see it happenвђќ she asked вђњdid anyone see who was driving the carвђќ a few people shook their heads but no one said anything i couldnвђt have been the only one on the sidewalk nancy thought in frustration somebody must have seen something she knew they couldnвђt have gotten the license plate number though in those few awful seconds before the car hit kim nancy had noticed that it didnвђt have a front plate and as it tore off down the street she realized that the back plate was missing too but sheвђd been in such a hurry to get to kim that she hadnвђt taken the time to look for anything else вђњhow about the make of car or the yearвђќ nancy asked the onlookers вђњor whether it had two doors or four doorsвђќ a few more heads were shaken вђњanythingвђќ nancy asked desperately вђњthis is important didnвђt anyone see anythingвђќ nancy scanned the crowd trying to catch a sympathetic eye at the edge of the group she noticed a young guy about nineteen or twenty wearing a black swimsuit he was one of the handsomest boys nancy had ever seen with black hair and eyes and smooth dark gold skin but it wasnвђt his looks that caught her attentionвђit was the expression in his eyes heвђd been staring at kim but as nancy watched he raised his head and glanced down the street in the direction the car had gone his eyes glittered and his lips curled into a tight smile what kind of smile nancy wondered an angry smile a satisfied one but nancy didnвђt have time to do more than wonder its siren shrill and piercing a police car rounded the corner followed by an ambulance the moment they came into sight the crowd scattered leaving nancy alone with kim вђњit was a hit and runвђќ she told the officer who hurried over to her вђњthe car didnвђt bother to slow down for a secondвђќ the policeman nodded and began firing questions at nancy what was kimвђs name where was she staying where was she from nancy answered and then told him all she could about the accident which wasnвђt much вђњthere were a lot of people aroundвђќ she finished вђњbut they all split the minute they saw your carвђќ closing his pad the policeman nodded again вђњillegals probablyвђќ he said вђњafraid to get involvedвђќ nancy suddenly understood if people were in the country illegally theyвђd rather keep their mouths shut than come forward and tell what they saw because if they had to testify in court theyвђd be discovered and then it would be goodbye usa nancy looked over at kim who was being lifted gently onto a stretcher вђњi canвђt believe this is happeningвђќ she said feeling both sorry for the illegals and frustrated with them вђњmy friend gets run down in front of half a dozen witnesses but iвђm the only one who sees anythingвђќ вђњyeah itвђs toughвђќ the officer agreed вђњthereвђs a lot of ugly business going on down here in paradiseвђќ kim was being loaded into the ambulance by then one of the medics jumped in after her вђњwhat about the carвђќ nancy asked вђњdo you think youвђll find itвђќ вђњthereвђs not much to go onвђќ the officer replied frankly вђњbut weвђll give it our best shotвђќ вђњokayвђќ said nancy she climbed into the back of the ambulance and settled herself next to kim the medic closed the doors and the ambulance pulled away its siren going full blast nancy thought about what the officer had meantвђthat if the car ever did turn up it would probably be weeks later in a junkyard somewhere if they were lucky but nancy wasnвђt going to put her trust in luck she might return to river heights with her skin as winterpale as when she left but she was going to find out why her friend was deliberately run over on a bright sunny day in the middle of paradise it was two oвђclock by the time nancy left the hospital kim was still unconscious but the doctors were almost certain sheвђd be okayвђthe worst they could find were a bad concussion and a broken wrist nancy had called kimвђs mother and mrs baylor had said sheвђd be down later that afternoon if she had to hijack a plane to get there as nancy walked down the street she suddenly realized she was famished she bought a hot dog from a stand on a street corner and wolfed it down while she headed toward kimвђs hotel what she really wanted to do was jump in the ocean and swim until her nerves stopped jangling but she couldnвђt relax not then there was too much to find out what kind of dangerous business had kim gotten mixed up in why had the lock on her door been broken who was ricardo who was rosita nancy knew that kimвђs room just might hold some of the answers to those questions so she tried to ignore the gorgeous beach only yards away from her she also tried to ignore the gorgeous boys around her but it wasnвђt easy вђњheyвђќ one of them said вђњyou look frazzled i just happen to know a nice secluded little spot half a mile down the beach вђќ вђњhey youвђre going to look like a cooked lobster soon if youвђre not carefulвђќ another one told her вђњiвђll be glad to rub in your suntan lotion personallyвђќ nancy turned them down but even though she was worried about kim she couldnвђt help smiling bess must be in absolute heaven she thought she glanced over at the crowded beach and realized that bess and george didnвђt even know about kim yet iвђll tell them later she thought first iвђve got to get a look at that hotel room remembering the broken lock she figured it wouldnвђt be too hard nancy bounded up the stairs again instead of waiting for the elevator quietly she pushed open the door and stepped into the hall good it was empty nancy kept her ringers crossed that it would stay that way the last thing she wanted was to be seen nosing around kimвђs room she didnвђt have any idea yet whom she was up against and until she found out she couldnвђt trust a soul when nancy reached room she checked to make sure she was still alone then put her hand on the doorknob expecting it to turn easily the knob didnвђt turn at all the door was locked great nancy thought just what i donвђt needвђan efficient hotel she didnвђt have her credit cards with her so she couldnвђt force the lock that way she rummaged through her beach bag trying to find something thin and made out of metal no luck the only hardware she had was the small hook in the top of her extra bikini well why not she thought it took five minutes but finally nancy had the metal hook free of the cloth she spent another minute unbending it and at last she held a thin metal probe about as long as her little finger if this works she told herself you will have set some sort of record for ingenuity grinning nancy gently slid the вђњpickвђќ into the keyhole suddenly the knob turned and the door started to open nancy was about to congratulate herself when she realized that she didnвђt have anything to do with it someoneвђwho probably didnвђt belong thereвђwas inside kimвђs room and nancy and the intruder were about to come facetoface chapter three quickly nancy dropped her pick into her beach bag stepped away from the door and put on a confused expression as if she were having trouble finding her room the door opened a little more and a young man stuck his head out in his left hand he held a very long pointed screwdriver when he saw nancy his jaw hardened and his blue eyes turned icy nancy considered asking him what he was doing in the room but his look stopped her he might be involved in kimвђs вђњaccidentвђќ and if he was nancy didnвђt want him suspicious of her вђњoh hiвђќ she said casually вђњcan you tell me where room threetwelve isвђќ opening the door just wide enough to let himself out the guy gave nancy a long cold look then finally raised his chin and glanced at the ceiling nancy looked up too pretending she didnвђt understand what he was trying to tell her she noticed that he was wearing dark green pants and a matching shirt the kind of uniform maintenance people wear he must work for the hotel nancy thought which was why heвђd been in kimвђs room heвђd probably just fixed the lock вђњohвђќ she said as if the light had finally dawned on her вђњpm on the wrong floor huhвђќ nodding briefly the guy pulled the door shut behind him and then stood there obviously waiting for her to leave nancy heard the lock click and was glad sheвђd been prepared smiling brightly she said вђњno wonder i couldnвђt find threetwelve thanksвђќ вђњmr friendlyвђќ glared at her again and finally headed for the stairs so nancy stood in front of the elevator pretending to push the button when she heard the last echo of his footsteps she rushed back to room fished out her pick and went to work in just a couple of minutes nancy was inside kimвђs room it was a total disaster clothes were everywhereвђhanging out of drawers strewn across the floor even spilling from the wastepaper basket postcards paperbacks makeup and skin lotion were ripped scattered or overturned the sheets were on the floor and the mattress was half off the bed it was not the mess made by someone who was having too good a vacation to bother picking things up it wasnвђt even the mess made by a slob nancy thought it was the kind of mess made by somebody who was looking for something nancy didnвђt have to wonder who had searched the room it must have been handsome вђњmr friendlyвђќ the stonefaced maintenance man no wonder heвђd given her such a dirty look when he found her lurking outside the room obviously he didnвђt work for the hotel but just who did he work for ricardo rosita for a moment nancy was tempted to go after him but then she decided it would be a waste of time people who trashed hotel rooms didnвђt wait around to answer questions mr friendly was long gone she hoped the thing to do was figure out what heвђd been looking for afraid that somebody might be watching the hotel room nancy left the shades down and the lights off the fluorescent bulb in the bathroom was enough to see by not even sure where to begin she started wading through the piles of clothes and paperbacks on the floor a piece of newspaper caught in her sandal as she picked it up she noticed the headline of a story about illegal aliens the story had been circled in red ink and nancy figured kim had done it kim was like thatвђalways interested in the underdog if i keep my eyes peeled nancy thought with a smile iвђll probably find a letter she wrote to the editor saying what a rotten situation the illegals are in but nancy wasnвђt getting anywhere she tossed the paper toward the wastebasket and headed for the bathroom medicine cabinets were such obvious hiding places maybe mr friendly hadnвђt bothered to look there no luck the вђњmaintenanceвђќ man had pulled out every jar bottle and lube and left them piled in the sink even the toothbrushes were out of their holders lying like two pickup sticks on the fake marble vanity top nancy was halfway out the bathroom when it hit herвђtwo toothbrushes she walked back in and took another look right two of themвђone blue and obviously well used the other red without a single bent bristle kim didnвђt have a roommate she reminded herself or did she nancy looked more carefully at the countertop one bottle each of shampoo and conditioner one tube of toothpaste one can of deodorant two hairbrushes one full of light brown strands the other with several strands of long black hair caught in it okay nancy thought kim might have bought a second toothbrush but there was no way she could have used that other hairbrush and if she hadnвђt come to florida with a roommate then sheвђd invited some girl to stay with her once she got there nancy walked back into the main room looking for more evidence of that roommate and she found it in the wastepaper basket a skirt and blouseвђcotton homemade no labels muddy and wrinkled they must have been pretty once but nancy knew they didnвђt belong to kim for one thing they werenвђt her style kim would never have worn them for another kim hated sewing sheвђd wait until every last button had fallen off a blouse before picking up a needle and thread nancy was frowning at the skirt and blouse when she heard footsteps in the hall when they stopped outside the door she sank down behind the bed as quietly as possible listening was it the maintenance man had he gotten suspicious of her and come back the footsteps shuffled around then faded away as nancy let her breath out her head dropped and she found herself staring at a strip of photobooth snapshots lying on the rug at her feet picking it up gingerly as if it might suddenly disintegrate nancy studied the strip of photos the first was of kim alone mugging for the camera the second was of kim and another girl all the rest were of the second girl who was very pretty with long black hair but who never smiled and who looked into the camera with frightened suspicious dark eyes вђњrositaвђќ nancy whispered to herself вђњshe has to be rositaвђќ nancy examined the photograph intently as if by staring hard enough she could bring rosita to life and ask her all the questions that were spinning through her mind how did you meet kim why did kim share her room with you whoвђs ricardo who was that phony maintenance man just exactly what did kim mean when she lay in the street and whispered вђњit was rositaвђњ frustrated nancy stood up and began pacing the hotel room still holding the strip of photos where was she going to find the answers to those questions who was she going to ask kim was still unconscious and the only other person she thought might be involved was mr friendly she could hardly ask him if she ever saw him again well at least she had something to go on she thought looking at the photograph if she had to sheвђd wander up and down the beach asking anybody and everybody if theyвђd seen that girl iвђll find you rosita nancy thought and when i do youвђd better have some good answers dropping the strip of photos into her beach bag nancy took one last look around the tornup room and then headed for the door her hand was on the knob when she heard footsteps in the hall again nancy dropped her hand figuring sheвђd rather not be seen no matter who was out there the footsteps came closer and then stopped right outside room nancy stepped backward her eyes on the door it could be somebody who really does work for the hotel she told herself a maid maybe coming to clean up the room the doorknob jiggled then nancy heard the sound of a key sliding slowly into the lock no maid would unlock a door like that nancy thought besides a maid would knock first whoever was unlocking that door was probably looking up and down the hall making sure no one was watching whoever was out there didnвђt want to be seen the doorknob turned in three quick strides nancy was across the room and in the closet hiding behind the few clothes that were left hanging there just as the outer door swung open nancy pulled the closet door closed leaving a halfinch crack to see through because the room was so dim all nancy could glimpse at first was a tall shadowy figure silhouetted against the pale wall it stood there for a few seconds obviously sizing up the situation then slowly it moved away from the door and into the center of the room nancy held her breath as it passed the closet and walked cautiously toward the bathroom whoever it was didnвђt turn on any lights and nancy knew sheвђd been rightвђthe person didnвђt work for the hotel even though he or she had a key and definitely didnвђt want to be discovered for an instant the figure was framed in the bathroom light and nancy saw it from the back it was the figure of a darkhaired boy wearing a black bathing suit and a tshirt and carrying what looked like a small canvas bag nancy opened the closet door a little wider hoping to get a better look but by then the boy was out of the light in that instant though nancy decided that he looked uncomfortably familiar something about his build and the way he held his head reminded her of the handsome boy at the scene of the hit and run the one whoвђd smiled so mysteriously and then disappeared was the intruder really the same boy nancy wondered then she realized that it didnвђt matter not at the moment what mattered was that the boy who had walked all around the room and had been in and out of the bathroom was headed for the closet in which nancy was hiding his hand was outstretched reaching for the doorknob chapter four nancy stayed absolutely still not even daring to breathe at the last second the boy shook his head apparently changing his mind about the closet and returned to the bathroom nancy exhaled a long shaky silent breath she had gathered one more important piece of information the intruder was definitely the same handsome boy she had seen after kimвђs accident nancy could hear him rummaging around in the bathroom picking things up and putting them down again were he and the maintenance man working together had the maintenance man seen nancy enter kimвђs room and told the boy to follow her silently nancy eased back into the darkness of the closet she couldnвђt let herself get caught and she wished her heart would stop beating so hard the boy left the bathroom dropping a few things into the canvas bag they clattered against each other as they landed and nancy thought they must be jars makeup lotion what would he want with kimвђs makeup and hand lotion again the intruder stepped toward the closet nancy took her hand off the knob afraid she might shake the door and held her breath again what would he do if he found her what would she do the boy stopped in front of the closet and nancy gripped the strap of her beach bag figuring she could swing it at his face and make a run for it if she had to her hand was sweaty and a muscle in her leg started jumping she wished heвђd do whatever he was going to do so she could move anything was better than waiting finally he did move but not to the closet nancy heard a strange shuffling sound and she peered through the opening the boy was bending over grabbing a few pieces of scattered clothing and stuffing them into his bag as nancy watched he straightened up his back still to her and then swiftly walked to the door opened it and stepped outside nancy forced herself to count slowly to five she wanted to give him enough time to reach the stairs or the elevator and think he was safe then sheвђd follow him and try to find out who he was and what he was doing in kimвђs room at the count of five she let herself out of the stuffy closet crossed the room and opened the door the hall was empty the elevator was stopped on the third floor nancy raced for the stairs and paused listening two flights below she heard a door open noises from the lobby drifted up to her before it closed again thatвђs him nancy thought rushing down the stairs he wonвђt be any farther than the street door by the time i get there on the ground floor she shoved open the door nearly collided with a bellboy and dashed across the lobby and out to the sidewalk the street looked almost the same as it had earlier that day bright with sunlight and busy with vacationers heading for the ocean nancy glanced quickly in both directions thought she saw the blacksuited intruder turn onto the main avenue that ran along the beach and swiftly made her way through the happy suntanned crowds at the corner nancy stopped short looking wildly in every direction the main street was packed the beach was packed she counted at least fifteen guys in brief black bathing suits and was standing there wondering which one to go after first when someone called her name вђњnancy nancy over hereвђќ nancy looked across the street and saw bess and george waving to her from the edge of the beach only a few hours had gone by since theyвђd all been together changing into their swimsuits but it seemed like days she took another look at the crowded beach suddenly it seemed as if every boy was wearing a black bathing suit shaking her head nancy crossed the street and joined her friends вђњi thought you said youвђd solve your вђcaseвђ in ten minutesвђќ george teased вђњwhat happened couldnвђt you find kimвђќ вђњi found herвђќ nancy said вђњkimвђsвђвђќ вђњwell itвђs about time you got hereвђќ bess broke in вђњwe thought youвђd decided to spend your entire vacation indoors nancyвђќ she went on with a big smile вђњmeet dirk bowman he owns a boat and heвђs promised to take us all along on a midnight cruise doesnвђt that sound fantasticвђќ nancy turned and smiled distractedly at dirk she hadnвђt noticed him at first but she should have guessed that bess would have found someone by then вђњi donвђt actually own the boat i just work for the lady who doesвђќ dirk explained as he smiled back at nancy he was a fabulouslooking guyвђsandy blond hair deep blue eyes and a perfect tan on a nearly perfect body вђњbut the invitation for the cruise is good you have my wordвђќ вђњit sounds greatвђќ nancy told him вђњbut i donвђt think iвђll be ableвђвђќ вђњoh come on nanвђќ bess protested вђњwe came down here to have fun right what could be more fun than a midnight cruiseвђќ вђњreally it sounds greatвђќ nancy said again вђњbutвђвђќ вђњwhat is it nancyвђќ george asked вђњyou hardly look like somebody whoвђs having a terrific timeвђќ nancy brushed her hair back and took a deep breath вђњyouвђre right iвђm not having a terrific timeвђќ she said вђњbut iвђm afraid kimвђs having a worse oneвђќ she glanced at the three of them and then went on to tell what had happened to their friend that morning вђњoh how awfulвђќ bess said in a horrified voice вђњwhat kind of creep would run over somebody and keep on goingвђќ вђњi donвђt knowвђќ nancy replied вђњbut i plan to find out i donвђt think it was just some jerk who hit kim and then panicked i think it was deliberate i think kim got mixed up in something dangerous down here and she nearly paid for it with her lifeвђќ вђњwhat could she have gotten mixed up inвђќ george asked вђњi donвђt know yetвђќ nancy admitted вђњbut i plan to soon some very strange things have been going onвђќ she told them about kimвђs hotel room and the mess it was in about the phony maintenance man the snapshots of the pretty girl and the guy whoвђd broken into the room and taken some clothes as she talked nancy noticed that dirk bowman was becoming extremely interested in what she was saying вђњsounds like your vacationвђs not exactly turning out the way you expectedвђќ he commented when nancy finished вђњnot exactlyвђќ nancy agreed вђњwell from what bess and george have told me about youвђќ he went on вђњiвђd bet youвђre not going to give up until you have all the answersвђќ he smiled at bess and nancy noticed that he had a dimple just to the left of his mouth bess looked enchanted вђњdonвђt worryвђќ dirk went on вђњthey didnвђt talk about you that much they just said that youвђre a detective and you donвђt give up without a fightвђќ вђњi guess i donвђtвђќ nancy said вђњand i sure wonвђt give up on this case not when one of my friends is lying in a hospitalвђќ she turned to bess and george вђњkimвђs mother is flying down later today i think we ought to be at the hospital when she gets there donвђt youвђќ вђњabsolutelyвђќ george said and bess nodded and sighed вђњpoor kimвђќ she exclaimed вђњi just canвђt believe itвђќ вђњlistenвђќ dirk said to nancy вђњif thereвђs anything i can do i wish youвђd let me knowвђќ he put a hand on nancyвђs shoulder and flashed his dimple at her вђњi know my way around fort lauderdale pretty well besidesвђќ he added вђњiвђm sort of a mystery nut iвђd really like to help youвђќ вђњwell thanksвђќ nancy was aware that dirk still had his hand on her shoulder and she tried to shrug it off but it stayed put вђњlistenвђќ said dirk вђњthat midnight cruise is probably out for you tonight nancy i know youвђve got to be with your friend but maybe you and i could get together tomorrow sometime and talk about this iвђd really like to helpвђќ вђњi iвђm not sureвђќ nancy said suddenly uncomfortable вђњi donвђt know what iвђll be doing tomorrowвђќ вђњi understandвђќ dirk replied with another charming sympathetic smile вђњbut iвђd really like to talk to you about all thisвђќ вђњwell iвђll have to seeвђќ nancy frowned dirk seemed to have forgotten about bess it wasnвђt exactly cool she thought to dump somebody so fast bess obviously didnвђt think it was too cool either her eyes were flashing as she looked angrily at dirk fortunately george caught the look and decided that bess better leave before she exploded вђњcome onвђќ she said вђњletвђs get back to the hotel and change so we can go to the hospitalвђќ вђњall rightвђќ bess agreed вђњhey iвђm free all morning tomorrowвђќ dirk said softly to nancy вђњwhy donвђt i give you a callвђќ nancy felt more and more uncomfortable she was just about to give dirk a real brushoff when he pulled her around to face him вђњi do know my way around lauderdaleвђќ he said seriously and nancy noticed his sexy smile was gone вђњif we can get togetherвђprivatelyвђi think i might be able to give you a few tips about this mystery you want to help your friend donвђt youвђќ вђњof course i doвђќ nancy said вђњbut right now youвђre the one whoвђs being mysterious if you know something why donвђt you just tell meвђќ dirk shook his head вђњi would believe me but itвђs just not the right time or place besides first i have to know everything you knowвђќ glancing past nancy dirk seemed to see someone he recognized he raised his arm in a greeting then brought his hand down so that it was resting on the back of nancyвђs neck it was like a caress nancy thought but there was nothing romantic about the look in his eyes вђњtomorrow rightвђќ he asked intently nancy wasnвђt sure if dirk was making a pass at her or if he really did know something about kim but she had to find out вђњokayвђќ she finally agreed вђњtomorrowвђќ вђњgoodвђќ dirkвђs smile returned and giving nancyвђs neck a gentle squeeze he sauntered off to meet whomever it was heвђd waved to nancy watched him for a second then turned to catch up with george and bess george was almost at the street but bess hadnвђt moved sheвђd obviously been watching the whole thing because she gave nancy a confused look then she strode across the beach completely ignoring the dozens of boys who tried to get her attention nancy sighed and slipped off her sandals she jogged across the warm sand toward bess trying to decide how to tell her that she didnвђt likeвђor trustвђdirk bowman one bit nancy was only a few yards from bess when she suddenly stopped short completely forgetting about bess and dirk for the moment in front of her was a lifeguardвђs chair and sitting in that chair was a handsome bronzeskinned darkhaired boy in a small black bathing suit nancy knew he was the guy sheвђd seen at the hit and run and rummaging around kimвђs hotel room not half an hour earlier nancy hoped nobody was drowning at the moment because the guy sure wouldnвђt be any helpвђhe couldnвђt take his eyes off her the only place heвђs seen you is at the hitandrun scene she reminded herself he doesnвђt know you were in that hotel room watching him tossing her hair back nancy curved her lips in a slow smile and walked over to the lifeguardвђs chair вђњhi thereвђќ the lifeguard said when she reached him вђњhelloвђќ nancy noticed a small canvas beach bag at the foot of the chair she would have given anything to see what was inside it still smiling she said вђњthis is my first day in lauderdale got any suggestions about how i should spend my timeвђќ the lifeguard raised his eyebrows вђњmost people come here for the sun and the waterвђќ he said in a slight hispanic accent вђњisnвђt that what you came forвђќ вђњwell sureвђќ nancy told him вђњsun surf and new friends rightвђќ вђњmaybeвђќ he gave her a teasing grin вђњif youвђre luckyвђќ вђњspeaking of luckвђќ nancy went on вђњone of my friends ran into a bad streak of it this morning or rather it ran into herвђќ вђњohвђќ вђњyes she was hit by a car right in front of the vistamarвђќ nancy kept her smile in place trying not to sound too serious вђњa lot of people were around maybe iвђm wrong but i thought i saw you thereвђќ the lifeguard shifted in his chair glanced out at the water and then back at nancy his smile was gone and his dark eyes were hard вђњyouвђre rightвђќ he said coldly вђњyou are wrongвђќ вђњoh wellвђќ nancy said with a shrug вђњmy mistakeвђќ the lifeguard didnвђt answer he just stared at her a moment longer then shifted his gaze back to the water he was lying nancy was sure but there was no way she could prove it not yet figuring sheвђd only make him suspicious if she asked any more questions she decided to drop the subject for the time being she hitched her beach bag onto her shoulder and turned to leave nancy was only about three feet away from the lifeguardвђs chair when she felt itвђa sharp burning pain in her left foot as if sheвђd stepped on a redhot needle gasping she jerked her foot away and fell onto the sand as she fell she glanced up at the lifeguard he was watching her and his smile was back chapter five biting her lip to keep from crying out nancy grabbed her foot and looked around to see what sheвђd stepped on a few inches away she saw a large bluish slimy object partly covered by sand it was a jellyfish obviously and as nancy rubbed her foot she wondered what kind it was and whether its poison was going to do any more damage than it already had a boy whoвђd seen her fall trotted over and prodded the jellyfish with a stick вђњportuguese manofwarвђќ he told her вђњugly looking huhвђќ nancy nodded вђњwhatвђs going to happen nowвђќ she asked вђњis my foot going to shrivel up and fall offвђќ she was trying to joke but the pain she felt was anything but funny the boy didnвђt look too amused either вђњwell i donвђt want to scare youвђќ he said вђњbut i think you ought to hotfoot it to a doctor excuse the punвђќ nancy suddenly remembered some stories about things like shock and unconsciousness itвђs a good thing iвђm on my way to the hospital she thought the boy offered her a hand and she got to her feet wincing вђњthanksвђќ вђњany timeвђќ he told her glancing up at the lifeguard he cupped his hands and called out вђњhey ricardo youвђre falling down on the job man why didnвђt you warn her these things are all over the beach todayвђќ stunned nancy looked at the lifeguard too so he was ricardo and his chair was the вђњperchвђќ kim had mentioned no wonder heвђd clammed up when she mentioned seeing him at the hitandrun site she wondered what he would have done if sheвђd told him about overhearing kimвђs phone conversation with him or seeing him sneaking around kimвђs hotel room instead of letting me step on a jellyfish heвђd probably have tried to feed me to the sharks she thought with a shudder at least she knew who the enemy was all she had to do was find out why he was the enemy looking at ricardo who had made no apology and no move to help her nancy realized that deliberately letting her step on the manofwar was his way of telling her to keep her nose out of his business you blew it ricardo nancy thought scaring me off doesnвђt work and if you hadnвђt tried it i might not have learned your name and then i wouldnвђt come after you but i will now nancy started to walk away stumbled and nearly fell again her foot was beginning to go numb вђњhey you okayвђќ asked the boy whoвђd helped her up вђњno but iвђm sure i will beвђќ nancy told him then she raised her voice so that ricardo could hear her вђњiвђll be fine iвђll be back too you can count on itвђќ as quickly as she could nancy made her way up the beach to her hotel bess and george had already changed and when nancy told them what had happened they helped her change then hustled her into the car and rushed her to the hospital emergency room as fast as possible by the time they got there the bottom of nancyвђs foot was red and swollen and the pain went clear up to her knee but after checking her over the doctor on duty said sheвђd be fine вђњyouвђre luckyвђќ she told her as she rubbed some salve on nancyвђs foot вђњyou must have stepped on just one of its tentacles if youвђd been badly stung your friends might have had to carry you in hereвђќ nancy smiled in relief as the medicine started to ease the stinging the doctor gave her the tube of salve and after thanking her nancy bess and george took the elevator to kimвђs room kimвђs mother had just arrived and she greeted the three girls with tears in her eyes вђњi just donвђt understand how this could have happenedвђќ mrs baylor pulled a fresh tissue from the box on kimвђs bedside table and wiped her eyes вђњi was against this trip in the first place i should never have let her comeвђќ nancy reached out to touch mrs baylorвђs arm вђњyou canвђt blame yourselfвђќ she said gently вђњoh i knowвђќ mrs baylor smoothed back her hair and blew her nose вђњiвђm just so worried the police donвђt seem to be very hopeful about finding the driver or the car they were nice but i can tell theyвђre not going to spend a lot of time on this meanwhile my daughterвђs lying here unconsciousвђќ nancy bess and george stared at kim not knowing what to say the doctors had told them that kim was stable that things looked very promising for her but she still hadnвђt wakened and it was hard to sit and just watch her it made them feel helpless and that made them feel edgy nancy was especially edgy first of all kimвђs mother couldnвђt seem to stop crying not that nancy blamed her her daughter had been run down she had every right to cry but all the sniffing and noseblowing and sobbing made it hard to think and nancy needed to think she was still in the dark about what was going on despite the fact that she had two good leadsвђthe picture of the girl and ricardo he was obviously mixed up in it but how and exactly what was he mixed up in maybe dirk bowman knew his notsosubtle hint made nancy very curious and she wished she could be with him at that very moment but one glance at bess told nancy that sheвђd better keep that wish to herself between the manofwar sting and visiting kim at the hospital nancy hadnвђt had a chance to explain things to her not that she had much explaining to do she hadnвђt come on to the guy heвђd come on to her bess would realize that actually when nancy thought about it dirk had started coming on to her as soon as she had mentioned what had happened to kim perhaps he had more than just information for her nancy couldnвђt pass up a chance to learn something sheвђd talk to bess as soon as she could about the only thing not annoying nancy was her foot it was feeling better by the minute so she knew she could make good on her promise to ricardoвђsheвђd be back that was what was really making her edgyвђshe wanted to get out of the hospital and back on the trail вђњoh how lovelyвђќ mrs baylor exclaimed suddenly nancy glanced up and saw that a goodlooking guy had just entered kimвђs room carrying a big arrangement of flowers he was wearing a brown uniform so he must have been from a flower shop he set the basket on the table gave kim a close look then quickly left the room вђњthat was so nice of you girlsвђќ mrs baylor said tearfully george looked embarrassed вђњdonвђt thank usвђќ she said вђњiвђm afraid we didnвђt send themвђќ вђњthen who didвђќ mused kimвђs mother nancy reached over and carefully pushed aside the daisies and carnations but she could find no card strange she thought why would somebody send flowers without a card and just who had sent them kimвђs mother started to cry again вђњthis is like a nightmareвђќ she sobbed вђњwho on earth would want to hurt my daughterвђќ вђњi donвђt know mrs baylorвђќ nancy told her вђњbut i promise you iвђm going to find outвђќ when dirk bowman arrived at the surfside inn the next morning to pick her up nancy was sure of one thingвђbess was no longer upset with her she understood what nancy had to do however she was still hurt and she was furious with dirk for dumping her so rudely nancy dressed casually in light cotton pants and a cotton shirt with a wild island print over her bikini she wished she could wear her new sandals but she put on her sneakers instead since she wasnвђt sure what dirk would end up showing her at precisely eleven oвђclock dirk lean and tan showed up nancy greeted him then stepped out with him into the fresh morning air вђњever been windsurfingвђќ dirk asked taking her hand and leading her toward a red sports car parked at the curb вђњnoвђќ nancy told him вђњiвђve surfed and iвђve sailed but never at the same timeвђќ she liked his car and she couldnвђt help admitting that she also liked the feel of his hand bess has great taste she thought вђњwell then youвђll probably catch on quicklyвђќ dirk said with a dimpled smile he put the car in gear and drove quickly down the street вђњitвђs really terrific once you get the hang of itвђќ for the next ten minutes he kept up a steady onesided conversation about the joys of windsurfing it was all very interesting nancy thought but it wasnвђt the information she was after if dirk really wanted to turn nancy on heвђd tell her what he knew about kim вђњlistenвђќ she said finally interrupting him вђњi donвђt want to be rude but you said you might be able to help me out on this case that you might have some information for meвђќ вђњthatвђs rightвђќ dirk answered with an easy smile вђњi might but i told you i need to know everything you know firstвђќ nancy was trying to decide what to tell him when dirk parked the car got out and led her to a dock where an outboard boat loaded with two surfboards was tied they jumped on dirk started the engine and as they sped away nancy glanced back at the dock ricardo was standing there watching them nancy felt a chill as she watched his figure grow smaller and smaller what was ricardo doing there anyway had he followed her and dirk were he and dirk connected in some way it was impossible to talk over the buzz of the motor and the thumping of the waves as the boat plowed through the ocean but nancy did manage to ask dirk where they were going when he answered herвђtelling her they were headed for a small islandвђhe leaned so close she could smell his aftershave he reminded her of daryl gray a guy sheвђd almost fallen for in fact there was a lot about dirk that reminded her of daryl he was gorgeous and friendly and would be easy to fall for too but nancy wasnвђt about to do that she was after information not involvement after twenty minutes dirk cut the motor and let the boat drift gently toward a sandy island dotted with palm trees it shimmered in the sun like a beautiful mirage вђњthis is where we bring all the partygoersвђќ he explained вђњwe drop them off around midnight and pick them up a few hours later itвђs wild sort of a big bash in the middle of nowhereвђќ nancy nodded remembering that he worked for some kind of excursion boat as they beached the motorboat she asked if he liked the job вђњitвђs greatвђќ he said вђњand my boss lila templeton is one fun lady running these parties to nowhere isnвђt a job for herвђshe doesnвђt need one her boat is just a big toy ever eat a templeton orangeвђќ вђњprobablyвђќ nancy said вђњwell every time you do youвђre putting money in lilaвђs pocket her family owns half the citrus and sugarcane farms in floridaвђќ nancy looked around the island really is in the middle of nowhere she thought вђњwhere does the party boat go after you drop everybody offвђќ she asked вђњoh it just cruises aroundвђќ dirk took nancyвђs hand again and smiled at her вђњiвђm really glad you came out with me you know i wanted to be alone with you the minute i laid eyes on you detectiveвђќ again nancy noticed the warmth of his hand and the dimple alongside his mouth dirk bowman was a real charmer all right but charm wasnвђt what she was after вђњyou called me вђdetectiveвђ вђќ she pointed out вђњso letвђs do some detecting okayвђќ with a laugh dirk agreed so while they stripped down to their bathing suits unloaded the surfboards and unfurled the brightly colored sails nancy told him what had gone on the day before without giving away any important details by the time she finished they were on the boards paddling away from the shore вђњitвђs your turnвђќ she said вђњtell me what you knowвђќ dirk sighed and shook his head вђњsorry detective iвђm afraid i came up with a great big zeroвђќ stunned nancy sat up straddling the board he never knew anything in the first place she told herself furiously it was just a line to get you out here and you fell for it as if he read her mind dirk reached out and touched her knee вђњaw come on detective donвђt be mad i did ask around but nobody knew anything if iвђd told you that this morning you wouldnвђt have come with me rightвђќ вђњrightвђќ nancy agreed instantly but dirk didnвђt look insulted instead he laughed вђњlook at it this way youвђre already in the water so why not relax and let me teach you how to windsurf itвђs the least i can doвђќ his laugh was hard for nancy to resist even with the thoughts of ricardo and kim and rosita whirling through her mind but she managed to keep a straight face вђњone lesson one rideвђќ she said seriously вђњthatвђs it then we go backвђќ вђњyou got it detectiveвђќ dirk promised he went on to give her instructions about how to handle the board how to pull up the sail when to turn the boom and how to bail out вђњalways bail out backward right onto your backsideвђќ he said вђњthat way the board wonвђt break your skullвђќ soon nancy was on her own in deep water carefully she eased up from her stomach to her knees reached into the water and pulled up the sail keeping a tight grip on the boom she got to her feet found her balance and stood up straight wind filled the sail and suddenly nancy felt as if she were flying over the water she heard dirk shouting encouragement and found herself laughing out loud as the board slapped over the waves for just a moment she forgot about everything but the sun and the wind and the salt spray just when nancy thought she was going as fast as it was possible to go the board picked up speed she wasnвђt sure if she could handle it so she turned the boom hoping to slow down but she must have turned it the wrong way because the sail was so full it looked ready to rip nancy decided to try one more time to slow down if that didnвђt work then sheвђd bail out nancy turned the boom instantly the pole fell over as if it had been snapped in two the board tipped pushing nancy forward and before she had time to react she found herself hitting the water behind her the heavy surfboard rose up like a sailfish leaping from the ocean then it started to fallвђheading straight for nancyвђs head chapter six nancy tossed her head back and desperately gulped in a mouthful of air the hoard was falling fast in a few seconds it would be on top of her nancy flipped sideways kicked up with her legs and felt the lethal board graze her thigh as she pulled herself deep under the water the current was strong it somersaulted her over and over until she couldnвђt tell which way was up her lungs felt ready to burst and for a second she almost panicked sheвђd escaped the surfboard she realized frantically but she was in danger of drowning just as she thought she might never make it nancy caught sight of the sky above her the undercurrent tried to spin her over again but she fought it and pulled herself up through the water until her head broke the surface gratefully nancy filled her lungs with air pushed her streaming hair out of her face and looked around just a few feet away her surfboard bobbed peacefully on the waves nancy swam over to it and climbed on then spotted her sail it was spread out on the water like a giant magenta scarf and nancy remembered that awful snap sheвђd felt when sheвђd turned the boom what had happened those poles had to be sturdy they couldnвђt just snap in two when the wind got strong or could they off in the distance dirk bowman was stretched out on his board pulling himself against the current to reach nancy she waved to let him know she was okay then caught hold of her sail and dragged it from the water hand over hand she pulled the pole up when she saw the end of it where it had snapped she shivered in spite of the hot sun beating down on her back there was a clean slice three quarters of the way through the pole and then a ragged edge where the wind had done the rest of the job someone had sawed partway through it and nancy shivered again remembering ricardo standing at the dock that morning watching her climb into the boat nancy raised her head and looked at dirk who was still bucking the waves to get to her maybe he and ricardo knew each other why not their jobs brought them to the same beach every day and maybe dirk had mentioned that he was taking her windsurfing so ricardo had decided to try to get rid of her making it look like an accident just like kim nancy thought first the manofwar then the windsurfing incident ricardo wasnвђt exactly subtle with the messages he was sending her and nancy wondered how many more вђњaccidentsвђќ sheвђd have to survive before she found out what he was involved in she was still staring at the pole fingering the ragged edge when she heard the buzz of a motor close by looking up she saw a sleek raspberryandturquoise speedboat heading toward her it zipped past making choppy waves so that nancy had to drop the pole and clutch the board with both hands the driver made a sharp turn and then sped back cutting the twin engines at the last possible second вђњhi thereвђќ the driver called out she was a beautiful woman just a couple of years older than nancy with golden skin silky blond hair and a smile in her wide green eyes вђњneed a liftвђќ she asked вђњit looks that way doesnвђt itвђќ nancy said laughing вђњiвђm not really stranded thoughвђќ she pointed to dirk вђњbut thanks for the offerвђќ the woman pulled her dark glasses down from the top of her head and peered through them at dirk вђњoh are you with him well let me tell you heвђs cute but heвђs a klutz if you know what i mean i should knowвђiвђm his bossвђќ with a delightful smile she stuck her hand over the side of the boat вђњiвђm lila templetonвђќ so she was the fun lady dirk had mentioned shaking lilaвђs outstretched hand nancy glanced over her shoulder at dirk who was closer but still struggling with the waves he lied to get me out here she thought and now itвђs time to pay him back laughing again she hauled herself into lilaвђs boat вђњi think iвђll take you up on that offer after allвђќ she said вђњif you donвђt mind stopping at the island a moment so i can get my thingsвђќ grinning lila templeton started the engines and the boat took off with a roar as they passed dirk lila slowed long enough to shout вђњi want to talk to you the minute you get backвђќ she and nancy made a fast stop at the island then lila put the boat into high gear and sped off leaving dirk bowman floundering in its wake as they sped back to the mainland lila kept up a steady stream of chatter about where nancy should go and what she should do while she was in florida mostly though she gave a sales pitch for her party to nowhere вђњitвђs absolutely the wildest party youвђll ever go toвђќ she shouted вђњyou ought to try it while youвђre down here you wonвђt forget it i promise you thatвђќ nancy started to say that dirk had already invited her but she changed her mind lila seemed genuinely friendly and nancy didnвђt want to disappoint her she was pretty sure she wouldnвђt have time for any wild island parties she had other things to do she thought grimly and other people to see beginning with ricardo вђњso what brings you to lauderdaleвђќ lila asked as they approached the docks вђњlet me guessвђspring break rightвђќ вђњrightвђќ nancy said she didnвђt like lying but even though lila seemed harmless and emptyheaded nancy decided she shouldnвђt trust anyone sheвђd talked to dirk and look what had happened dirk had probably mentioned her to ricardo and it was just luck that her surfboard hadnвђt cracked open her skull half an hour ago when lila docked the boat nancy thanked her for the ride and climbed out вђњdonвђt forget the party nancyвђќ lila called after her and nancy said she wouldnвђt but she knew that that night she wouldnвђt be at any party twenty minutes later nancy had grabbed a bite to eat and was back on fort lauderdale beach looking for ricardo she had a strong urge to use one of georgeвђs most painful judo moves on him but she knew that instead she would simply have to be patient she would have to watch him see where he went whom he talked to if she was careful he just might lead her to rosita the first place nancy checked was ricardoвђs lifeguard chair but he wasnвђt in it she strolled along the beach keeping one eye out for ricardo and the other out for stray menofwar two of a kind she thought with a grim smile finally nancy spotted the lifeguard standing ankledeep in the surf beside him holding his hand was a blond girl in a red string bikini it was bess nancy stopped trying to figure out what to do if ricardo found out she and bess were friends he might decide that bess should be the victim of a few accidents too but if he thought that bess was just another pretty girl out for a good time he might relax with her and bess might learn something important about him nancy dropped back trying to blend in with a group of sunbathers вђњwell hi there howвђs your footвђќ a voice shouted вђњi see you survived your encounter with the deadly manofwarвђќ wishing heвђd keep his voice down nancy smiled at the boy whoвђd helped her up the day before вђњyes iвђm fineвђќ she said softly вђњgreat i gotta hand it to you you said youвђd be back and here you areвђќ the boy didnвђt lower his voice a notch вђњrightвђќ nancy replied watching as ricardo turned his head and looked straight at her without a word to bess he dropped her hand and trotted down the beach through the mass of sunbathing bodies and out of sight here i am and there he goes nancy thought bess looked at nancy her expression puzzled nancy waved goodbye to the boy and went to join bess вђњgoshвђќ said bess вђњthat was weird that guy took one look at you and leftвђќ nancy started to explain that his name was ricardo and that he was the one sheвђd seen snooping around kimвђs hotel room but bess was off on another subject вђњyouвђre back awfully soonвђќ she remarked вђњdidnвђt your date with dirk work outвђќ вђњas a matter of fact it was a real washoutвђќ nancy admitted вђњi shouldnвђt have gone with him he didnвђt know a thing about the caseвђќ вђњso now i guess heвђs through with you rightвђќ bess said sarcastically вђњgee maybe i still have a chanceвђќ вђњcome on bessвђќ nancy sighed вђњiвђm sorry things got messed up for you but you know iвђm trying to find out what happened to kimвђќ вђњoh and speaking of kimвђќ bess said вђњshe still hasnвђt come to while you were off with dirk i was at the hospital george is there now but she has to leave in about an hourвђќ bess waded out of the water and onto the hardpacked sand вђњmaybe you should go visit her so this ricardo is really the same guy you saw in kimвђs hotel roomвђќ nancy nodded вђњdonвђt take this the wrong way bess but be careful around him okayвђќ вђњokayвђќ replied bess wideeyed вђњall right iвђll see you around iвђve got more investigating to doвђќ for a while nancy wandered along the beach hoping sheвђd see ricardo but after an hour had gone by she realized she was wasting her time he probably wasnвђt on duty that day and she knew he wouldnвђt put in an appearance unless he had to not if he thought she was hanging around nancy gave up and decided to go to the hospital maybe kim would be awake by then that would solve everything she thought hopefully when she got to the hospital nancy saw mrs baylor standing outside kimвђs room and for a moment nancy really was hopefulвђmrs baylor wasnвђt crying keeping her fingers crossed nancy rushed down the hall but as she got closer to kimвђs mother she realized that if mrs baylor wasnвђt crying it was only because she was too shocked and frightened for tears вђњmrs baylorвђќ nancy was breathless afraid of what she might hear вђњis kim is she вђќ вђњsheвђs worseвђќ mrs baylor whispered вђњsheвђs growing weaker and the doctors are worried she might slip into a coma or вђќ or die nancy thought and if that happens then youвђll be trying to solve more than a hit and run it will be murder chapter seven it was early evening when nancy let herself into her room at the surfside inn she felt slightly guilty about leaving the hospital but mrs baylor had insisted вђњyouвђll help kim more by finding out why this happened to herвђќ sheвђd said and nancy knew she was right what she didnвђt know yet was how to solve the case she had two leadsвђricardo and rositaвђand so far she hadnвђt been able to follow either of them maybe a shower will help clear your head she thought as she flicked on the lights she stepped into the bathroom and was peeling off her clothes when she noticed the note stuck in the mirror nanвђi promised bess iвђd go with her on the partytonowhere boat so thatвђs where we areвђnowhere bess still likes dirk which is why she insisted on going sheвђs also still ticked off at him for brushing her off and going out with you instead but i know she understands that you have to do everything possible to solve the case george sighing nancy turned the shower on full blast and stepped into the warm spray if all she had to worry about was bess being mad at her things would be great instead things were about as rotten as they could be sheвђd fallen for dirkвђs line and spent an entire morning following a phony lead and sheвђd really goofed with ricardo she should never have even hinted to him that she knew who he was sheвђd probably be a lot closer to solving the case if sheвђd just kept her eyes open and her mouth shut with another sigh nancy stepped out of the shower and wrapped a towel around herself she left the bathroom and stood in front of the window staring out at the beach already campfires were blazing here and there as groups of kids gathered for the next round of allnight parties nancy couldnвђt help thinking that sheвђd much rather be out there having fun than holed up alone in her hotel room then it hit herвђif sheвђd rather be out somewhere maybe ricardo and rosita would too if not that night then surely theyвђd been out on other nights she had rositaвђs picture and of the hundreds of kids on the beach and in the discos there had to be at least one whoвђd seen her itвђs worth a try nancy thought as she put on a flashy sundress and her new sandals after all you said yesterday that if you had to youвђd walk up and down the beach asking anyone and everyone if theyвђd seen this girl well now it looks as if you have to it was eight oвђclock by the time nancy set out on her search she was already on the beach when she realized she hadnвђt eaten anything since noon there were plenty of fastfood places around she could grab some food and ask a few questions at the same time asking questions turned out to be easier than sheвђd anticipated halfway through a slice of pepperoni pizza nancy noticed that a cute boy in the next booth was paying more attention to her than to his pizza which was getting cold fast nancy swallowed a bite of cheese wiped her mouth and raised her can of soda that was all it took in two seconds the boy was sitting next to her вђњhi thereвђќ he said with a grin вђњhow you doingвђќ вђњiвђm not sureвђќ nancy replied trying to look confused вђњwhatвђs the problemвђќ вђњoh well this is going to sound weird but i was supposed to meet a friend of a friend when i got to lauderdaleвђќ nancy explained making it up as she went along вђњbut i get here and what happens i canвђt find her sheвђs not at the hotel sheвђs not on the beach sheвђs not anywhereвђќ вђњsoвђќ the boy moved over in the booth and casually slid his arm across the back of it вђњmy nameвђs mike by the way and i donвђt think your storyвђs weird at all your friendвђs friend is probably having a blast and just forgot about you my advice is to enjoy yourself and forget about herвђќ вђњwell i would except for one thingвђќ nancy noticed that mikeвђs hand was now resting on her bare shoulder вђњi was supposed to give her something some money and i just know i canвђt have a good time until i find her and get that cash off my handsвђќ вђњwell a good timeвђs definitely what itвђs all aboutвђќ mike said tightening his fingers on her shoulder вђњwhy donвђt you let me help youвђќ вђњi was hoping youвђd say thatвђќ nancy reached into her straw shoulder bag and took out the photo вђњhere she is her nameвђs rositaвђќ вђњprettyвђќ mike said barely glancing at the picture вђњbut not as pretty as youвђќ вђњthanksвђќ nancy replied вђњbut have you seen herвђќ вђњafraid not now what are you and i going to do for fun tonightвђќ mike scooted even closer to nancy and bent his head down as if he were going to kiss her at the last second nancy ducked under his arms and left him sitting alone in the booth her plans for the night just didnвђt include mike вђњsorryвђќ she told him вђњbut until i find rosita iвђm afraid i wonвђt have any fun at allвђќ abandoning her pizza nancy went out into the warm breezy night mike frowning after her from now on she told herself no more warmup conversations just show the picture and ask the question if you get stuck with any more mikes this search will take forever unfortunately fort lauderdale was full of mikes looking to have fun some were nice some came on a little too strong a few actually took her questions seriously all of them were interested in nancy and none of them had seen rosita by tenthirty nancy was starting to feel discouraged sheвђd hit every fastfood place on the strip and turned down invitations to dance in at least half the discosвђand still no rosita what was the girl anyway a phantom somebody has to have seen her nancy thought by that time the beach parties were going strong campfires were blazing and radios and cassettes were blasting up and down the shoreline carrying her sandals nancy strolled along the soft cool sand stopping at every gathering to ask if anyone had seen the girl in the picture one girl thought she looked just like a girl from her dorm вђњbut she didnвђt come to lauderdale so it couldnвђt be the same one could itвђќ no nancy agreed it couldnвђt she was getting so many вђњsorrysвђќ and вђњnever saw hersвђќ and вђњforget about her stick with mesвђќ that when she finally heard the words вђњoh sureвђќ she thought sheвђd imagined them вђњwhat did you sayвђќ she asked the boy whoвђd spoken вђњi said sure i saw her about twenty minutes agoвђќ he took a closer look at the photograph вђњyeah thatвђs the one she was with one of the lifeguards ricardo i think his name isвђќ suddenly nancy wasnвђt tired anymore her luck was changing вђњwhere were theyвђќ she asked вђњover that wayвђќ the boy said pointing down the beach вђњthey were leaning against some trees talkingвђќ he smiled and gave nancy a long look вђњhey if you donвђt find them come on back why donвђt you i plan to be here all night longвђќ вђњthanksвђќ nancy replied smiling вђњbut i donвђtвђќ she trotted down the beach keeping her ringers crossed that ricardo and rosita would still be there as nancy approached a grove of palm trees she saw two shadowy figures emerge and begin walking along the wet sand close to the water toward the docks where dirk had taken her that morning the tide was still out and the moon was full nancy could see clearly that one of the figures was ricardo the other oneвђshorter and with long dark hairвђhad to be rosita nancy followed them keeping a safe distance sticking to the trees wherever there were any ricardo and rosita seemed to be having a very intense conversation and nancy was sure they had no idea she was behind them she was looking ahead not really watching where she was going when she stepped into another grove of palms tripped over two reclining bodies and went sprawling head first into the sand a girl gave a piercing shriek and a boy grumbled вђњhey give us a break huh things were just getting romantic hereвђќ вђњsorry sorryвђќ nancy said trying not to laugh it would have been funny but she was worried had ricardo and rosita heard the shriek not wanting to lose sight of themвђor ruin the little love sceneвђnancy stepped out of the trees and into the bright moonlight ricardo and rosita had stopped they were looking in nancyвђs direction as soon as ricardo saw her he grabbed rositaвђs hand and the two of them took off running nancy tore after them not bothering to hide anymore all she wanted was to catch up with them running on the wet hardpacked sand she saw them round a bend in the shoreline and pushed herself even harder not wanting to lose them the music from the beach parties was growing fainter as nancy rounded the bend she realized sheвђd left the crowds behind she stopped suddenly and looked around panting from her dash along the beach in front of her were the docks she saw a few boats tied up and heard soft thuds as they bumped against the pilings but that was all nancy was alone still breathing hard nancy kicked at the sand in frustration then she headed for the docks thinking that ricardo and rosita might be hiding in one of the boats of course the way her luck was running theyвђd probably doubled back they could be sitting around a campfire at that very minute she told herself roasting hot dogs and having a good laugh nancy had dropped her sandals somewhere along the way and as she stepped onto the wooden pier she reminded herself to be careful of splinters but before sheвђd taken two steps she gaspedвђnot because she felt a splinter sliding into her foot but because a hand reaching out from the shadows was closing tightly on her arm chapter eight nancy whirled around ready to fight as hard as she had to and found herself facing the pretty blackhaired girl whose photograph sheвђd been carrying with her for the past four hours nancy glanced around nervously no ricardo in sight but she figured he was lurking somewhere close by watching still on edge nancy looked at the girl again and was surprised to see that she was nervous too her eyes were wide with fear sheвђd dropped nancyвђs arm and was clenching her hands together tightly вђњrositaвђќ nancy said вђњyouвђre rosita arenвђt youвђќ the name turned the girlвђs fear to terror she backed away and shook her head vehemently вђњmariaвђќ she stammered вђњmariaвђќ nancy was confused for one thing the girl whom sheвђd thought was her enemy was hardly acting like an enemyвђone loud вђњbooвђќ from nancy and sheвђd probably collapse furthermore her name wasnвђt rosita вђњokayвђќ nancy said вђњyouвђre maria my nameвђs nancy drew now that the introductionвђs out of the way why donвђt you tell me what you and ricardo and rosita are up to whatever you got kim involved in just might have killed her and вђќ the girl was shaking her head again holding out her hand for nancy to stop talking вђњpleaseвђќ she said in spanish вђњi can explain everything but i speak very little englishвђќ nancy nodded вђњthatвђs all rightвђќ she said also in spanish вђњi know your language so go ahead and explain iвђm listeningвђќ maria breathed a sigh of relief and began to talk nancy did know spanish but after two sentences she realized she didnвђt know mariaвђs spanish still frightened maria was talking away a mile a minute and she was speaking in a dialect that nancy could hardly follow nancy followed mariaвђs story as best she could though and did manage to learn that maria was an illegal alien her country was in the middle of a violent revolution and lots of people were escaping to the united states to start a new life kim had been hiding her in her hotel room вђњfrom the policeвђќ nancy asked вђњkim was hiding you from the immigration policeвђќ maria shook her head and spoke rapidly again saying something about the people sheвђd paid to bring her to florida вђњthey were evilвђќ she said they didnвђt let her go as theyвђd promised they were going to make her work for them for nothing вђњlike a slaveвђќ she was running from them and kim had helped her maria said something about ricardo but nancy didnвђt understand she decided to let maria finish talking then sheвђd ask questions kim had made maria promise to stay in the hotel room but after many days maria had had to get out she was followed and ran back to the hotel someone broke in later while she was in the room but she escaped thatвђs how they found out about kim nancy thought but who were вђњtheyвђњ kim definitely had been talking to ricardo that morning on the phone but why he had to be one of the вђњevil onesвђќ and kim just didnвђt know it sheвђd trusted him for some reason and heвђd doublecrossed her вђњwhat about ricardoвђќ nancy asked вђњwhatвђs he got to do with all this and who else is involved maria donвђt be afraid to tell me i promise iвђll help you if i canвђќ maria latched on to the name ricardo and said a lot of things none of which nancy understood except that he had a bad temper nancy didnвђt need to be told that вђњbut what about the othersвђќ she asked вђњricardo canвђt be the only one you talked about evil people who are the rest of them please tell meвђќ maria nodded eagerly вђњone of them isвђвђќ she stopped in midsentence her eyes widening in terror вђњoh noвђќ she cried pointing behind nancy вђњnoвђќ nancy heard a scuffling sound in back of her and started to turn but it was too late something hardвђa rock a clubвђcame crashing down on her head she heard maria scream but it sounded muffled and distant then she saw the wooden slats of the dock as she fell they were fuzzy because a dark mist was rising in front of her eyes she blinked but the mist kept rising she tried to listen but her ears were filled with a low roar like highway traffic heard from far away finally the mist closed over her completely and she couldnвђt see or hear anything at all when nancy came to the first thing she felt was pain she hurt all over but her head was the worst she started to open her eyes then shut them tightly gasping at the pain if only she could move her hand to the back of her head to rub it and ease some of the throbbing something was stopping her though she wasnвђt sure what she must have been lying on her arms because they were tingling as if theyвђd been asleep she tried to stretch one arm then the other to make the needles go away but all she could move were her fingers suddenly she became aware of another sensationвђwater her feet and legs were wet and every few seconds water splashed against her thighs had she fallen asleep on the beach then she remembered sheвђd been talking to rosita no not rosita maria maria had screamed and then everything had gone black nancy hadnвђt fallen asleep sheвђd been knocked out and whoever had done itвђsheвђd put her money on ricardoвђhad dragged her onto the beach and left her there with the waves lapping at her legs funny sheвђd always thought the sand would make a nice soft bed so why did she feel as if she were lying on cement time to get up nancy she told herself forget the pain just get up and go after him she tried to stretch her arms again and suddenly realized that they were above her head and she wasnвђt lying on soft sand either in fact she wasnвђt lying at all she was leaning against something very hard something that had absolutely no give to it nancy forced her eyes open and waited for her vision to clear it was still nightвђpitch blackвђbut if she craned her neck back she could see the moon up above she could also see where her hands were they were up above too tied over her head no wonder her arms ached nancy turned her head scraping her cheek against something rough and cold then she felt the water wash against her thighs again and realized that her feet were tied too she peered down trying to see where she was the night breeze was warm but nancy started shivering violently when she realized that sheвђd been tied hand and foot to one of the pier pilings a rough wooden pillar shooting straight out of the water she was somewhere in the middle of it if she tilted her head back far enough she could just see the lip of the pier but what made her shiver what made her want to scream was that she could also see the waterline on the piling it was a foot above her head already the water was lapping against her thighs soon it would be at her waist then at her shoulders the tide was coming in and nancy was trapped in its path she heard a low moaning sound and realized it was coming from her scream she told herself you got hit on the head not in the throat she tried to take a deep breath and thatвђs when she felt the gag in her mouth and the tape on her cheek there was no way she could scream the only sound she could make was a soft moan nobody would hear sheвђd been tied gagged and left to drown chapter nine nancy fought to keep from panicking but she lost the battle sheвђd never been so trapped the feelings of terror and helplessness were overwhelming she was at the end of the pier which was far enough out in the water to give her a tantalizing view of the bonfires around the bend in the beach she could even see the shadows of the people around those bonfires and every once in a while she heard shouts of laughter frantically nancy pulled and twisted against the ties that held her to the pier she didnвђt know how long she kept it up but when she finally stopped she was limp with exhaustion and her skin was burning from being scraped against the piling if she could have screamed her throat would have been raw if they wanted to kill you she thought tiredly why didnвђt they just dump you in the middle of the ocean while you were still unconscious why put you through this kind of torture theyвђd even tied her hands with the sash of her sundress an extraevil touch evil thatвђs what maria had called them and sheвђd been right for a moment nancy wondered what had happened to the frightened girl ricardo must have gotten her she thought then as the water washed up hitting the middle of her back nancy began struggling and twisting again but she was too tired and too sore to keep it up for very long sagging against the piling she rubbed her forehead on the back of her wrist and closed her eyes breathless halfcovered with water nancy thought of how she must lookвђlike a huge barnacle in a dress the thought made her want to laugh youвђre getting hysterical she warned herself her head was throbbing violently and when she opened her eyes she saw that the dark mist was closing in if she passed out she knew sheвђd never make it nancy closed her eyes again and thatвђs when she heard the footsteps on the pier looking up she saw two faces bending over the edge staring down at her nancy blinked fighting back the mist and realized that she recognized the faces one belonged to the handsome вђњmaintenanceвђќ man from kimвђs hotel room the other was the guy whoвђd delivered the flowers to the hospital not bothering to wonder what they were doing there nancy moaned as loudly as she could begging them with her eyes to help her the two faces lingered above her for a moment then faded away like ghosts into the darkness ghosts nancy thought thatвђs what they were youвђre so far gone youвђre hallucinating she let her head drop and felt a wave splash high on her back hitting her shoulder blades then nancy felt something else something that made the dark mist evaporateвђher feet were loose whatever they were tied with had stretched and nancy was almost able to uncross her ankles if she could do that she could get her feet free what sheвђd do then she wasnвђt sure but she didnвђt care one thing at a time she told herself and started to wiggle her feet ignoring the scrapes on her knees and the ache in her arms it seemed to take forever but finally nancy did it her feet were side by side and she was able to slip one and then the other out of the binding her arms felt as if they were going to rip out at the shoulders and she managed to wrap her legs around the piling then what the water lapped at her neck and nancy instinctively gripped the piling with her knees and tried to push herself up the sash binding her hands moved up too just a fraction thatвђs it nancy told herself youвђve climbed enough trees now shinny up this pole inch by inch nancy pushed herself up the piling the tide kept coming in and she must have swallowed half the ocean but finally her head was above the waterline and even though she was still trapped she knew she was going to make it she couldnвђt use her teeth on the sash but when she saw that the cloth wasnвђt completely soaked nancy began to scrape it up and down on a corner of the piling at last she felt the cloth begin to give with a final burst of strength nancy pulled her hands free shinnied the rest of the way up the piling and hauled herself onto the pier the first thing she did was rip the gag from her mouth then she lay still gasping and listening to the water swirl below her she told herself to get moving but her body wouldnвђt budge her mind was working though and when she thought of maria she was finally able to sit up for all nancy knew maria was dead no maria had said something about being made to work like a slave whoever wanted her wanted her alive and ricardo must have taken her to that person ricardo nancy had to find him not just for mariaвђs sake but for her own she had a personal score to settle with him but she wasnвђt going to do it on her own not again she wanted the police backing her up the next time it was safer and besides sheвђd need them to keep her from setting fire to ricardoвђs chair while he was in it nancy felt the adrenaline pumping as she pushed herself to her feet and stumbled away from the pier she even managed to trot a little as she rounded the bend in the beach and came within sight of the allnight partiers the bonfires were still glowing but not so brightly and the radios and cassette recorders were playing softer music it was getting late no it was getting early nancy reminded herself morning couldnвђt be far away as soon as she reached the main beach nancy headed for the street looking for a public phone sheвђd thought of calling from her hotel and then cleaning up while she waited for the police but she wanted them to see her first she knew she looked like the survivor of a shipwreck and if the police saw what ricardo had done theyвђd work that much harder when she was halfway down the beach she spotted a string of phone booths the adrenaline wasnвђt pumping so hard by then and she felt exhausted as if she were trekking across a desert and the phone booth was her oasis nancy had almost reached the booth when a scream rang out at first she took it to be a goodnatured partytype scream but then she heard other screams and saw people running toward the water the tide had washed something ashore what was it a shark a jellyfish вђњitвђs a bodyвђќ a boy shouted rushing by nancy вђњitвђs a bodyвђќ maria nancy thought instantly maria put up too big a fight and ricardo or whoever he worked with killed her forgetting about the police for the moment nancy joined the rest of the crowd heading toward the water she didnвђt want to see a dead body but she had to find out if it was maria there must have been a hundred people gathered around and nancy had to push through them until she was able to see someone had thrown a large beach towel over the body nancy broke free of the crowd and moved quickly to the towel wanting to get it over with вђњpoor guyвђќ a voice said and nancy stopped вђњyeahвђќ someone else said вђњdrowningвђwhat a way for a lifeguard to go huhвђќ вђњlifeguardвђќ nancy asked вђњyeahвђќ a boy nodded grimly вђњwhat was his name ricardo thatвђs it ricardoвђќ chapter ten nancy stepped back from the toweldraped body вђњare you sure itвђs ricardoвђќ she asked вђњhey i helped pull him out of the waterвђќ the boy replied вђњand iвђve talked to him every day since iвђve been here i know what he looks likeвђќ the boy paused вђњhey you look sick were you a friend of hisвђќ he asked nancy shook her head вђњno but i knew who he wasвђќ вђњyeah well itвђs too bad huh and you want to know something he didnвђt drownвђhe was shotвђќ the boy held up his hand вђњand yes iвђm sure i pulled him out of the water rememberвђќ stunned nancy pushed her way through the crowd and stumbled back up the beach trying to figure out what had happened why had ricardo been shot had he lost maria and had the people he worked with killed him for if when she reached the street nancy heard the wail of a siren in the distance the police coming to investigate ricardoвђs murder she knew she should talk to them but what would she say the last time she saw him he was with a girl named maria but she had no idea where maria was she had no idea who ricardo worked for or who killed him you donвђt really know anything at all nancy told herself your main suspect is dead and youвђre back to square one the surfside inn was just across the street and nancy decided to go there first to shower and change then sheвђd return to the beach and talk to the police but after she got the key from the desk and let herself into the room nancy realized she was too tired to take a shower she was so wiped out she was actually staggering her eyes were playing tricks on her too instead of two single beds she saw four then two then four again stumbling across the room she bumped into the cot that bess used fell onto it and was asleep before her head hit the pillow вђњlook at thisвђќ a voice was saying вђњthereвђs a body on my cotвђќ nancy burrowed her face deeper into the crook of her elbow вђњgo awayвђќ she mumbled another voice said вђњlook she didnвђt even bother to change howвђs that for lazyвђќ вђњpleaseвђќ nancy groaned вђњnot so loudвђќ she yawned and tried to slip back into sleep but someone sat down on the cot making it jiggle back and forth вђњhey nanвђќ bess said laughing вђњi donвђt mind if you sleep here but donвђt you think youвђd be more comfortable without my makeup kit poking you in the neckвђќ nancy moaned and shook her head but it was too lateвђshe was awake she opened one eye and peered up through her tangled hair bess and george were staring down at her looking extremely amused вђњwhatвђs happeningвђќ she asked вђњwhy donвђt you tell usвђќ george suggested вђњyeahвђќ bess said grinning вђњwe thought we had a wild night but it looks like yours was wilder couldnвђt even bother to take off your clothes before you fell asleep huhвђќ вђњwild nightвђќ nancy croaked her throat was bone dry and her tongue felt too big for her mouth swallowing she pushed herself up on her elbows and turned onto her back вђњit was wild all rightвђќ when bess and george saw how scratched and bruised she was their teasing grins disappeared and their mouths dropped open вђњnan what happened to youвђќ bess cried in horror вђњthat must have been some battleвђќ george said вђњare you okayвђќ вђњi will be once i shower and eat and drink about a gallon of waterвђќ nancy sat up slowly and rubbed her neck вђњyouвђre right georgeвђќ she remarked вђњit was some battleвђќ вђњwell tell usвђќ bess demanded george went to the vending machine in the hall and brought back a soda and a package of peanut butter crackers nancy ate first then told them everything that had happened the night before вђњwe heard about ricardo when we got inвђќ bess told her вђњthatвђs all anybodyвђs talking about on the beachвђќ вђњit looks like he wasnвђt a bad guy after allвђќ george said вђњwhat do you meanвђќ вђњwell he was an illegal himselfвђќ hmm thought nancy just like maria вђњyeahвђќ bess said вђњthe police tried to check up on him and found out heвђd been working with a fake green card ever since he reached florida and it seems that a lot of people around here knew about itвђќ george nodded вђњone of the other lifeguards told me that ricardo tried to help other illegalsвђyou know get them cards and find them work stuff like thatвђќ вђњso he must have been helping maria all alongвђќ nancy said that explained why heвђd smiled when kim got hit she thought it was a smile of angerвђheвђd been challenged and he was ready to fight вђњbut why did he have it in for meвђќ she wondered aloud remembering the satisfied look on his face when sheвђd stepped on the manofwar вђњwhy shouldnвђt he he didnвђt know who you wereвђќ bess pointed out вђњkim didnвђt know you were coming down and she probably never even mentioned you he probably thought you were going to turn him over to the authorities or somethingвђќ вђњrightвђќ nancy agreed вђњhe didnвђt trust anyoneвђќ she ran her fingers through her hair and sighed вђњboy iвђm really stuck now i donвђt have the vaguest idea what to do nextвђќ bess took nancyвђs hand and pulled her off the bed вђњtake a shower and then put something in your stomach besides soda and crackersвђќ she told her вђњonce you feel human again youвђll be able to thinkвђќ nancy couldnвђt help noticing that bess was back to her old friendly self dirk must have made all the right moves she thought then she thought of something else вђњkimвђќ she cried вђњi completely forgotвђќ she quickly told bess and george about kimвђs condition while she dialed the hospital room the line was busy ten minutes and three calls later it was still busy вђњlookвђќ george said вђњgo shower weвђll keep trying the hospital anyway who knows kim might have recovered she could be running up a long distance phone bill right nowвђќ вђњletвђs hope soвђќ nancy said and headed for the shower even though the sharp spray stung every cut and scratch the water felt wonderful and nancy thought she might never come out she was soaping her hair for the second time when bess walked in вђњnanвђќ she called вђњi just wanted to apologize for the way i acted about dirk i was really mad at him not at you i hope you know thatвђќ вђњitвђs okayвђќ nancy called back over the hiss of the water then she poked her head out of the shower curtain and grinned вђњi take it you two got together again last nightвђќ вђњwe sure didвђќ bess ran a brush through her hair and laughed вђњheвђs absolutely incredibleвђќ вђњwell iвђm glad somebody had funвђќ nancy joked вђњdid you meet lila templetonвђќ bess nodded вђњshe was really nice she asked why you werenвђt there but i just said something had come upвђќ вђњthatвђs for sureвђќ nancy ducked back in the shower and started rinsing her hair вђњi wouldnвђt mind being in lilaвђs shoesвђќ bess went on with a giggle вђњeverybody who works for her is tan male and gorgeous and when they drop the partiers off at the island she gets to take off in that boat with ten beautiful menвђќ nancy laughed and poured some conditioner on her hair вђњsounds greatвђќ вђњit isвђќ bess agreed вђњbut iвђm starting to feel a little guiltyвђќ вђњguilty what forвђќ вђњwell i mean there we were cruising along in the rosita having a terrific time while you were tied to that piling fighting for your life andвђвђќ вђњthe whatвђќ nancy turned the water off and stuck her head out again вђњwhat did you sayвђќ вђњi said i was feeling a little guilty about having such a good time whenвђвђќ вђњi heard that partвђќ nancy interrupted вђњyou said you were cruising along in the the whatвђќ вђњthe boatвђќ bess said looking confused вђњlila templetonвђs boatвђthe rositaвђќ chapter eleven вђњi missed itвђќ nancy said вђњi completely missed itвђќ she stepped into her new yellow drawstring shorts pulled on a stretchy yellowstriped tank top and reached for the blowdryer вђњkim said вђthe it was rositaвђ i kept thinking she meant a girl and all the time she meant a boatвђќ вђњyou really think lila templeton brings people in illegallyвђќ bess asked вђњi think she does more than thatвђќ nancy said over the whine of the blowdryer вђњi think she brings them in takes their money and then ships them off to her familyвђs orange groves to work for nothingвђќ вђњcheap laborвђќ george remarked вђњthe cheapestвђќ nancy agreed вђњno wonder sheвђs got so much money no wonder the rosita is just a big water toy to her except it isnвђt really a toyвђќ she added вђњitвђs a perfect front for what sheвђs doingвђќ вђњyou mean while everybodyвђs partying on the islandвђќ bess said вђњlila takes the boat picks up the immigrants and hides them somewhere on the boat until she gets back to fort lauderdaleвђќ вђњwhy notвђќ george asked вђњthe rositaвђs big enoughвђќ nancy turned off the dryer вђњi donвђt think itвђs just lila thoughвђќ she said вђњremember the guys i told you aboutвђthe вђmaintenanceвђ man and the one who dropped off the flowers at the hospital when i was out on that pier i thought iвђd imagined them but now iвђm positive they were thereвђќ вђњyou think they work for lilaвђќ george said вђњright it makes sense doesnвђt itвђќ nancy asked вђњthat maintenance guy was as phony as a threedollar bill i just didnвђt know what he was doing there but he was probably checking the room to make sure there wasnвђt any evidence against lila and the florist guy must have been checking to make sure kim wasnвђt spilling the beansвђќ вђњiвђll bet they followed you around last nightвђќ george told her вђњand you led them right to maria and ricardoвђќ nancy nodded вђњlilaвђs got a whole fleet of gorgeous men doing her dirty workвђќ her feet still sore she limped over to the cot and wincing slipped on a pair of thongs the sandals sheвђd worn the night before were lost forever on the beach вђњand bessвђќ she said вђњremember what happened when you first introduced me to dirkвђќ вђњhow could i forget he practically tripped over his own feet to stand next to youвђќ bess rolled her eyes and shook her head вђњthe minute he met you it was like i didnвђt existвђќ вђњnot the minute he met meвђќ nancy reminded her вђњit was the minute i started talking about kimвђќ вђњthatвђs rightвђќ george said вђњhe said he was вђsort of a mystery nutвђ and heвђd like to help youвђќ bess shook her head again вђњwhat a lineвђќ вђњyeah but he wasnвђt using that line because he was interested in meвђќ nancy said вђњthe only one he was interested in was kim and thatвђs becauseвђвђќ вђњbecause he works for lila templetonвђќ bess finished with a groan вђњhow come i always fall for the wrong guyвђќ she asked plopping down on one of the beds вђњthis time i really really thought iвђd found somebody special and he turns out to be a creep the creepвђќ nancy couldnвђt help laughing вђњdonвђt feel too bad bess i fell for him tooвђќ grinning she told them about the broken pole on her windsurfing sail вђњi mean i really fell for himвђќ вђњwell now that weвђve got it all figured outвђќ george said вђњwhat are we going to do about itвђќ вђњgood questionвђќ bess remarked вђњthe only one who can prove anything is maria and who knows where she isвђќ вђњkim could prove itвђќ nancy said вђњif sheвђs still вђќ instead of finishing the awful thought nancy reached for the phone and dialed kimвђs hospital room вђњnow thereвђs no answer at allвђќ she reported вђњwhat could that meanвђќ bess asked вђњi donвђt knowвђќ nancy suddenly jumped up and headed for the door вђњcome on letвђs get to the hospital and find outвђќ half an hour later nancy bess and george were standing nervously outside the door to kimвђs hospital room they looked at each other for a moment then nancy took a deep breath and pushed it open kim was gone the bed was empty and freshly made ready for a new patient the only reminders of kim were two flower arrangementsвђone was dried and drooping but the second looked as if it had just been delivered bessвђs eyes filled with tears вђњweвђre too lateвђќ she whispered george bit her lip вђњi canвђt believe sheвђsвђвђќ вђњwait a minuteвђќ nancy broke in вђњthis doesnвђt have to mean sheвђs dead maybe they moved her to a different room or took her for tests or x rays or something come onвђќ the three friends dashed out of the room and headed down the hall as they turned a corner they heard a loud commotion at the nursesвђ station вђњi never authorized any such thingвђќ a voice cried вђњhow could you possibly think i wouldвђќ it was kimвђs mother but she didnвђt look griefstricken she looked furious вђњmrs baylorвђќ nancy rushed up to her вђњwhatвђs going onвђќ вђњiвђd like to know myselfвђќ mrs baylor exclaimed вђњi leave my daughterвђs room for all of twenty minutes to get a cup of coffee in the cafeteria and what do i find when i come back an empty bed thatвђs what i find with no daughter in itвђќ вђњiвђm sorry mrs baylorвђќ the nurse said nervously вђњbut the doctor who signed her out said you wanted her taken back to river heights as soon as possibleвђќ вђњthatвђs ridiculous why would i have her moved at such a crucial timeвђќ вђњyou mean kim had gotten even worseвђќ nancy asked вђњno she was getting better just a couple of hours ago she actually woke upвђќ mrs baylor explained вђњshe didnвђt say anything of course she was too weak but she knew who i wasвђshe smiled at me before she went back to sleep the doctors said it would be just a matter of days before sheвђd be back on her feetвђќ she turned to the nurse again вђњthey also told me it was very important to keep her quiet and calmвђќ she said accusingly вђњit would be the most ridiculous thing in the world for me to take her back to river heights right nowвђќ the nurse started to say something but mrs baylor didnвђt give her a chance вђњiвђm going to see your supervisor right this minuteвђќ she told her вђњand youвђd better hope she has some answers for me if she doesnвђt heads are going to roll around hereвђќ without a backward glance mrs baylor strode to the elevator and furiously punched the button when she was gone the redfaced nurse puffed out about a gallon of air вђњthis is definitely not my dayвђќ she complained вђњiвђm new here and all i did was follow a doctorвђs orders and now my jobвђs on the lineвђќ nancy barely heard her вђњif weвђd just gotten here an hour ago this whole thing would never have happenedвђќ she muttered вђњwhat are you talking aboutвђќ bess asked вђњthose flowersвђќ nancy said pacing back and forth in front of the desk вђњwhat flowersвђќ вђњin kimвђs room remember one of the bouquets was drooping and the other was fresh iвђll bet you a brandnew string bikini that they were both sent by the same personвђќ вђњlilaвђќ george asked вђњlilaвђќ nancy stopped pacing and shook her head вђњlila templeton has been one step ahead of me ever since i got here that tan hunk who works for her probably delivered those flowers so he could find out what shape kim was in when he realized she was recovering he called lila thatвђs why the phone was busy and lila decided that kim better disappearвђќ nancy thought for a moment then suddenly turned to the nurse вђњthat doctorвђќ she said вђњthe one who signed kim baylor out who was heвђќ вђњit wasnвђt a he honeyвђќ the nurse replied вђњthat doctor was a she and she had two of the cutest orderlies with her that i ever saw in my lifeвђќ вђњlila templetonвђќ nancy said again вђњthe doctor had blond hair rightвђќ she asked вђњblond hair and big green eyesвђќ the nurse replied вђњshe was real friendly smiled a lotвђќ вђњa great bedside manner huhвђќ nancy asked with a wry smile without waiting for an answer she looked at bess and george вђњweвђve got to get goingвђќ she said вђњwhereвђќ bess wanted to know вђњto the rositaвђќ вђњyou think lila has kim on her boatвђќ george asked вђњkim and mariaвђќ nancy said вђњit makes sense doesnвђt it theyвђre the only two people who can point a ringer at lila she knows she has to get rid of them and the rosita is a perfect way to do itвђќ bessвђs face turned pale under its tan вђњyou mean sheвђll kill them and dump them in the oceanвђќ nancy nodded вђњdonвђt forget ricardoвђќ she said вђњlila templeton has killed before and unless we stop her sheвђs going to kill againвђќ chapter twelve at seventhirty that night the rosita sat peacefully at the dock swaying slightly in the breeze it was a beautiful boat sleek and trim but with enough deck space for close to fifty people to dance on its rails were strung with brightly colored lights and from somewhere on board powerful speakers blasted rock music into the evening air it was scheduled to leave at eight oвђclock and already the decks were filling with laughing joking people eager to party the night away as nancy bess and george joined a crowd of kids heading for the gangplank nancy raised her eyes and scanned the crew on the small upper deck вђњi just spotted my friend the maintenance manвђќ she whispered вђњthe florist is up there tooвђќ вђњand thereвђs dirk the jerkвђќ bess hissed вђњis it my imagination or does he look nervousвђќ dirk bowman wearing white cotton shorts and a musclehugging tshirt was standing at the rail his eyes roving over the approaching partiers вђњiвђd be nervous tooвђќ george said вђњif i had kim and maria hidden away in the hold somewhereвђќ вђњlila probably ordered them all to keep an eye out for meвђќ nancy said вђњbut she thinks youвђre deadвђќ bess reminded her вђњshe canвђt be sureвђќ nancy told her вђњif she sent one of her goons to check all he would have found is the sash from my sundress until she hears about my body being washed ashore she canвђt take any chancesвђќ вђњweвђre the ones taking a chance right nowвђќ george remarked вђњif dirk spots the three of us together heвђs going to see right through our вђdisguisesвђ вђќ nancy nodded she wished they really could have disguised themselves but after all they had to wear clothes that were right for a party to nowhere george had on a long striped caftan with a hood that covered her hair and shadowed her face bess whose figure was a dead giveaway especially to dirk had reluctantly decided on a pair of baggy cotton pants rolled to the knees and topped with an oversized shirt patterned with gaudy palm trees вђњi look like a touristвђќ sheвђd complained tucking her blond hair under a widebrimmed straw hat nancy was wearing a caftan too but it didnвђt have a hood sheвђd wrapped her hair in a bright paisley scarf like a turban and put on so much makeup that her face itched and her eyelids felt weighted down she knew she and her friends looked completely different but she also knew they had to be careful вђњyouвђre rightвђќ she said to george вђњweвђd better split up as soon as the rosita gets going we can meet somewhereвђhow about the bowвђand start looking for kim and mariaвђќ the minute the three friends parted nancy felt a hand on her arm вђњheyвђќ a voice said in her ear вђњwant some companyвђќ nancy turned and found herself looking into the brown eyes of a boy wearing a fishnet shirt a gold neck chain and a selfsatisfied grin that didnвђt attract her at all but she smiled at him anyway вђњi sure doвђќ she said softly вђњi donвђt know anybody at all and i was starting to feel a little lonelyвђќ вђњwell now you donвђt have to because you know me and i have a feeling that before the nightвђs over weвђll be real close friendsвђќ he squeezed her hand and grinned again nancy forced herself to laugh and as they walked up the gangplank she glanced over her shoulder george tall and mysteriouslooking in her hooded caftan was in deep conversation with two guys and bess had attached herself to a group of giggling dateless girls she must be miserable nancy thought smiling to herself вђњwelcomeвђќ a sultry voice called out вђњwelcome aboard the rositaвђќ it was lila templeton dressed in a long robe of shimmering sea green silk that opened in the front to reveal an extremely small bikini her honey blond hair spilled over her bare shoulders like a lionвђs mane and she was flashing her toothpastead smile to everyone coming up the gangplank вђњif thereвђs anything my boys or i can do for you just let us knowвђќ she called out вђњbecause we want each and every one of you to have the most fantastic night of your livesвђќ each and every one of us except two nancy said to herself thinking of kim and maria turning to her вђњdateвђќ she flashed a smile of her own ducking her head and pretending to be fascinated with whatever he was babbling about that got her safely past lila but she knew sheвђd still have to be careful of lilaвђs вђњboysвђќ who were patrolling the deck like sentries fortunately the party to nowhere was booked solid and nancy soon found herself on the jampacked deck trying to dance and make conversation with her new friend whose name she still didnвђt know she was hot and sweaty and sheвђd lost sight of bess and george but at least she was inconspicuous at eight oвђclock a cheer went up as the rosita pulled smoothly away from the dock in twenty minutes theyвђd left the lights of fort lauderdale behind and were moving swiftly through the water under a starlit sky nancy decided sheвђd better start exploring it wouldnвђt take long to reach the island and she knew she had to find kim and maria before then or it might be too late вђњlistenвђќ she said when there was a break in the music вђњiвђm going to collapse if i donвђt get some breathing space i think iвђll just wander around a little bit okayвђќ вђњaww come onвђќ her date said вђњthe partyвђs just getting startedвђњgrabbing her hand he pulled nancy close to him as a slow number began playing вђњi thought you and i were going to spend the whole night togetherвђќ he whispered in her ear вђњyou thought wrongвђќ nancy whispered back she slipped down out of the circle of his arms and turned him around until he was facing another girl вђњsorry but iвђm sure you wonвђt have any trouble finding a partnerвђќ obviously not heartbroken the boy immediately asked the other girl if she wanted to dance and nancy left them together threading her way quickly through the crowd until she reached the deck rail then she craned her neck around trying to find bess and george she spotted george standing near the entrance to the galley which was roped off sipping a can of soda and watching the dancers bess was still attached to the group of unattached girls tapping her foot to the music and looking frustrated lila was nowhere to be seen but her boys were all over the place carrying trays of drinks mingling with the crowd and keeping their eyes wide open nancy noticed casually nancy raised her hands above her head as if she were stretching bess and george both caught the movement and just as casually started making their way toward the rositaвђs bow nancy lowered her hands pretending to be adjusting her turban but instead of the silk of the scarf her hands came down on her hair what had happened to her scarf nancyвђs reddish blond hair was as big a clue to her identity as a fabulous figure was to bessвђs with her telltale hair swirling around her shoulders and her thick makeup dissolving in sweat nancy knew sheвђd be recognized by anyone whoвђd spent even five minutes with her and that includes lila dirk and at least two more of lilaвђs boys she thought frantically nancy realized it was too late to go searching for her scarf it must have come loose when she broke free from her dateвђs arms and had probably already been trampled by at least eighty feet she grabbed her hair in both hands and swept it back tying it in a loose knot that she knew wouldnвђt hold for long but it was the best she could do hoping to get lost in the crowd she moved into the mass of dancing bodies and thatвђs when she saw lilaвђs вђњmaintenanceвђќ man he was heading straight toward nancy one hand in his pocket and both eyes on her face whirling around nancy grabbed the hands of the nearest boy not caring if he was with anyone else or not and started dancing with him when she sensed that the maintenance man was drawing close to her she spun around again so that her back was to him by that time sheвђd lost her dance partner but it didnвђt matter what mattered was that the maintenance man had recognized her she was sure of it just keep dancing she told herself at least itвђs rock and you can move fast with a few quick dance steps nancy reached the other side of the rosita only then did she dare look back she expected to spot the maintenance man somewhere in the crowd but she found that was impossible there were too many people bouncing clapping and swirling around the deck nancy took a deep breath tightened the knot in her hair and headed toward the bow the water was becoming rougher and she clung to the rail bumping into a few romantic couples on the way but finally she reached the bow the deck was narrow there and in spite of the lights on the rail it was dark nancy stepped into the shadows expecting to find bess and george waiting for her no one was there nancy edged her way around the bow toward the other side of the boat but before she reached it a voiceвђthroaty and sultryвђcalled out вђњlooking for someone miss drewвђќ chapter thirteen turning slowly nancy found herself facetoface with lila templeton her silk robe billowing gently in the breeze her green eyes glittering as brightly as the barrel of the gun she held in her hand вђњi saidвђќ lila repeated вђњare you looking for someoneвђќ nancy didnвђt bother to answer вђњi have a question tooвђќ she said keeping her eyes on the gun вђњis that the same gun that killed ricardoвђќ lila laughed softly вђњiвђm afraid i donвђt know what youвђre talking about but i suggest that you be careful or it just might kill you i also suggest that you be cooperativeвђќ she went on вђњi want you to turn around and walk slowly and calmly back to the main deckвђќ вђњthen whatвђќ nancy asked вђњi guess you donвђt understandвђќ lila told her stepping so close to nancy that she felt the gun barrel pressing against her stomach вђњiвђm in charge you donвђt ask questions you donвђt make comments you just do what i tell you now moveвђќ nancy turned raised her hands above her head and started walking behind her lila hissed вђњput your hands downвђќ and when nancy felt the gun prodding her in the back she decided not to push lila any further she lowered her arms and walked slowly around the bow heading back to the main deck the music and laughter were still going strong and for a second nancy was tempted to break away and try to lose herself in the dancing crowd but then what she wondered it wouldnвђt get her any closer to kim and maria or to bess and george wherever they were if she let lila call the shots for a while she might learn something besides with a gun at her back she figured she didnвђt have much choice вђњthe galleyвђќ lila ordered вђњi thought it would be off limitsвђќ nancy quipped figuring that that might be where kim and maria were hidden lila laughed again вђњnot for you miss drew consider the rosita your home the last home youвђll ever haveвђќ with the gun barrel nestled between her shoulder blades nancy went down the steps and into the narrow galley but lila didnвђt stop there she urged nancy through it and past some bunk beds at last nancy stopped thinking there was nowhere else to go but lila shoved her roughly aside and still aiming the gun at nancy dropped to her knees took hold of a brass ring on the floor and pulled up a section of the floor looking down nancy saw a steep metal staircase leading to the bottom of the boat вђњafter youвђќ lila said nancy lowered herself through the hole found her footing and stepped backward down the staircase when she reached the bottom she looked up hoping that lila would back down too so she could grab her ankle and get the gun but lila came down facing forward holding the gun in front of her aimed at nancyвђs chest they were in a very narrow dimly lit passageway with two doors on each side obviously not firstclass accommodations nancy thought вђњlook i know all about your operationвђќ she said to lila вђњi know you bring in illegal aliens and then force them to work on your familyвђs farms they donвђt have any id cards not even fake ones and they donвђt have any money because you charged them so much to bring them into the country if they escape you they get caught by the immigration police theyвђre trappedвђќ вђњthatвђs rightвђќ lila agreed вђњtheyвђre trapped and so are youвђќ вђњthen you admit itвђќ nancy asked lila shrugged вђњwhy not youвђre not going to tell anyone in a few hours youвђll be food for the fishвђќ reaching into her pocket she pulled out a key and slid it into the lock on one of the doors вђњone of my boys will be down soon to take care of youвђќ she said opening the righthand door вђњuntil then i suggest you and your friends enjoy the time you have leftвђќ my friends nancy barely had time to wonder whether she meant kim and maria or bess and george before lila shoved her inside and slammed the door shut вђњnanвђќ bess raced across the small stuffy room and hugged her friend вђњthank goodness youвђre okayвђќ she pulled nancy farther into the room вђњcome on join the partyвђќ nancy looked around the dim room and couldnвђt help smiling all her friends were there george kim and maria were sitting on storage crates a single can of soda on the floor in front of them with a slight grin george pointed to it вђњweвђve been passing it aroundвђќ she said вђњhelp yourselfвђќ nancy shook her head вђњsome partyвђќ she joked everyone laughed and the tension was broken for a moment then nancy crossed the room and looked closely at kim who was wearing bessвђs baggy pants and print shirt bess she noticed looked much more comfortable since she had stripped down to the bikini sheвђd brought alongвђfor fun on the island вђњare you all rightвђќ nancy asked kim gently вђњphysically iвђm okay except for thisвђќ kim replied quietly holding up her plastercasted arm вђњmentally iвђm terrifiedвђќ вђњthat makes two of usвђќ nancy admitted the room was incredibly hot so she slipped out of her caftan and instructed george to do the same if they ended up in the water nancy didnвђt want them bogged down by unnecessary clothing feeling slightly cooler in her bikini she sat down on a crate and took a sip of the soda вђњkim why didnвђt you tell me what was going on when i came to your room the other dayвђќ вђњi didnвђt think there was timeвђќ kim said вђњi was freaking outвђmaria was gone and ricardo was yelling at me to meet him i just panickedвђќ nancy nodded вђњdid george and bess tell you what happened to ricardoвђќ kim took a deep breath and lowered her eyes вђњyesвђќ she said softly вђњi still canвђt believe it i feel terrible about it we werenвђt in loveвђќ she admitted with a sigh вђњbut he was specialвђќ вђњhow did you get involved in all thisвђќ bess asked вђњby the time maria escaped from lila ricardo and i were good friendsвђќ kim explained вђњheвђd told me all about himselfвђhow he tried to help illegalsвђand he knew i was sympathetic so when maria needed a place to stay i was the obvious one to askвђќ вђњhow come you didnвђt go to the policeвђќ george asked вђњi wanted toвђќ kim told her вђњi knew ricardo couldnвђt because he was an illegal too but there was nothing to stop me he didnвђt trust the police though he asked me to wait and i did but i should have gone anywayвђќ maria who had been quiet until then brushed her long hair back from her face and spoke rapidly in spanish kim nodded вђњmaria wants me to tell you that sheвђd tried to get ricardo to talk to you iвђd told maria about you when she was hiding out in my hotel room i guess i said something about having a friend who was a detective and wishing you were hereвђќ kim said with a smile вђњbut ricardo wouldnвђt listen to her he just didnвђt trust anyone he didnвђt let her talk to you until last nightвђќ вђњwe really canвђt blame him for thatвђќ nancy said softly вђњi donвђt think we should be talking about blame at allвђќ bess pointed out вђњi think we should be talking about how to get out of hereвђќ nancy laughed вђњyouвђre right itвђs a good thing the five of us are here too because we need all the brainpower we can get to figure this one outвђќ springing to her feet nancy started exploring the room which took her all of two minutes вђњthereвђs not even a closet to hide inвђќ she remarked вђњnot that hiding would do us any goodвђќ вђњhow about the cratesвђќ george said вђњis there something we could do with themвђhide in them block the door with themвђќ вђњi was thinking the same thingвђќ nancy said вђњtheyвђd find us anywayвђќ bess told her вђњi mean nobody but lila and her crew knows weвђre in here so what if we blocked the door theyвђd just wait until everybodyвђs partying on the island and then break it down weвђre trappedвђќ nancy knew that bess was right hiding or blocking the door would only postpone whatever was going to happen it was a stopgap and they needed an escape hatch but lila had made certain they didnвђt have one sheвђd backed them into a corner and she was closing in fast suddenly nancy felt a change in the rhythm of the rosita it seemed to slow down the five girls steadied themselves as the boat began rocking from side to side вђњwhatвђs happeningвђќ kim asked вђњweвђve almost reached the islandвђќ george said вђњthe rositaвђs too big to go all the way to shore so they take everybody in on little speedboats weвђll be stopping any minuteвђќ вђњand after everybodyвђs ashore the rosita sails awayвђќ bess continued вђњwith us on itвђќ вђњyeahвђќ nancy said with a grim smile вђњthen lilaвђs private party beginsвђќ the girls looked at each other fearfully they knew what was going to happen but they didnвђt know how to stop it at that moment the door handle clicked everyone jumped and then bess gasped standing in the open doorway was dirk bowman a dimpled smile on his face and a shiny revolver in his hand chapter fourteen in a flash bess darted across the room stopping just a couple of feet in front of dirk вђњlisten to me dirk please listenвђќ she cried вђњi know what you think but itвђs not true itвђs really not i donвђt know whatвђs going on here i donвђt know anything and even if i did i wouldnвђt tell you have to believe meвђќ вђњwait a minuteвђќ dirk said frowning вђњiвђвђќ вђњthereвђs no time to waitвђќ bess interrupted frantically вђњi know what lila plans to do with us and you have to get me out of here please dirk iвђll do anything you want iвђll say anything you want if youвђll just let me goвђќ as the other four listened in amazement bess kept on pleading with dirk bowman to save her kim and maria stared at her in horror obviously they thought she was so panicked that she was willing to say anything to save her own neck nancy was amazed too but for a different reason she knew that bess was actingвђand it was working dirk couldnвђt get a word in edgewise heвђd try to say something but bess would immediately interrupt him pleading whining shouting whispering doing anything to distract him from the look on georgeвђs face nancy could tell that she hadnвђt been fooled either if the situation hadnвђt been so serious the two of them might have started clapping it was a beautiful performance and it was up to nancy to take advantage of it slowly but smoothly nancy moved closer to dirk bowman bess was saying something about how she and dirk could spend the rest of their lives together вђњitвђll be fantastic just the two of us i promise youвђќ she pleaded her voice almost cracking dirk was completely distracted he didnвђt notice anything but the nearhysterical girl in front of him nancy was less than a foot away from him it was time to make her move without warning she pivoted into a powerful spinning back kick her heel hitting dirkвђs hand the gun went flying upward and nancy moved in slamming her shoulder into dirkвђs stomach pushing him across the room and into a stack of storage crates вђњsomebody get the gunвђќ nancy shouted scrambling off of dirk вђњgot itвђќ george called triumphantly holding the revolver up вђњnice work nancyвђќ вђњyou taught me that move rememberвђњ nancy said turning to bess she grinned вђњi think you missed your calling you should go on the stageвђќ bess laughed вђњi just hope i donвђt have to give any encores iвђve never been so scared in my lifeвђќ kim and maria were standing over dirk вђњheвђs out coldвђќ kim reported she put an arm around maria and hugged her вђњweвђre freeвђќ she said вђњyeah but now whatвђќ george asked вђњwhat do you meanвђќ bess said вђњnow we splitвђќ вђњno waitвђќ nancy thought a minute вђњitвђs not such a great idea for all of us to go trooping up on deck together i think iвђd better scout around first and see whatвђs happening maybe i can figure out a way to get us off this boatвђќ вђњwhat about himвђќ george asked pointing to dirk вђњsit on him if you have toвђќ nancy replied вђњand donвђt forget if anybody comes knocking youвђve got the gunвђќ nancy drew in a deep breath and pushed the door open she checked the hall then gave the others a thumbsup signal and slipped into the empty corridor she ran silently up the metal stairs the rosita had come to a complete stop nancy could feel it she hoped that meant that everybody was gathered on one side of the deck waiting to be taken to the island if someone was in the galley nancy knew sheвђd be a sitting duck when she raised that trap door but there was no way to tell sheвђd just have to take her chances cautiously nancy pushed the door up about half an inch and waited nothing she pushed some more until the opening was big enough for her head from a distance she heard the laughter and shouts of people waiting for the launches but she didnвђt see anyone in the galley itвђs now or never she thought and pushed the door up until the opening was wide enough for her to crawl through she lowered the door as quietly as possible and then crouched on the floor waiting nancy didnвђt know how long the galley would remain empty she had to get moving or sheвђd be trapped again she crept forward until she could peer around the edge of the entrance the partiers were gathered at the railing milling around joking nancy didnвђt see lila or any of her boys and figured that they were either directing traffic or driving the launches suddenly nancy realized that a launch was her answer if she could just get her hands on one of those speedboats then the five of them might have a chance of breaking free for good for a second nancy was tempted to join the crowd and lower herself over the side of the rosita but then she saw one of lilaвђs boysвђthe guy who had delivered the flowersвђmaking his way through the partygoers he moved slowly and casually smiling at everyone but his eyes darted swiftly over the faces of the crowd and nancy knew that lila had posted him as a lookout if nancy tried to lose herself in the group heвђd spot her she could just see herself halfway down the rope ladder trapped in the glare of a powerful flashlight like an animal paralyzed by the headlights of a car but a launch was the only way off the rosita and nancy knew she had to get her hands on one she was trying to figure how when she saw the вђњfloristвђќ making his way toward the galley he was fifteen feet away and nancy knew there was no going back in one quick move she stepped through the galley entrance and slid around to the far side of the deck then she waited heart pounding listening for a shout for rapid footsteps that meant he had seen her and was coming after her nothing nancy slumped against the outer wall of the galley knowing she was safeвђfor the moment but she couldnвђt hang around much longer she had to find a way to get herself and four other people off the boat or that fancy move she had used to flatten dirk would turn out to be a total waste the noise of the crowd was dying down it wouldnвђt be long before everyone was off the boat and on the island suddenly over the sound of the fading laughter nancy heard footsteps approaching the galley move she told herself and slipped quickly along the rail glancing over her shoulder every step of the way she had to find someplace to hide fast or she might as well go back down and join the others it was as she neared the bow that nancy saw the metal ladder leading to the top deck she raced for it her bare feet almost silent on the deck and scampered up she reached the top rung glanced back and saw the florist rounding the galley nancy gripped the ladder and willed him not to look up but apparently lilaвђs florist was just looking for stray partiers and only glanced carelessly down the passageway before disappearing nancy let her breath out and climbed onto the top deck immediately flattening herself out on her stomach the deck was deserted but nancy wasnвђt taking any chances still on her stomach she elbowed her way to the other side and peered over the rail toward the island several bonfires had already been started on the beach and in the glow nancy could see a single speedboat heading for the shore two others were already tied up just off the beach the one she was watching must be the last and she knew it wouldnвђt be long before the rosita would take off with its human cargo she had to get her hands on one of those launches and that meant she had to get to the islandвђunseen nancy heard a cough and looking down saw the florist pacing the deck below she scrambled back to the far rail and waited to see if he was going to patrol the other side too as she looked out over the water it suddenly occurred to her that she could swim to the island it wasnвђt too far away and once she got there she could steal one of the speedboats and zip back to the rosita she wished she could tell the others to be ready and waiting for her but she couldnвђt take the chance of going back down to the hold she told herself that if the rosita took off before she got back to it sheвђd head for fort lauderdale and get the police but she didnвђt think sheвђd have to do that nancy figured that lila would need at least half an hour to make sure the island party was going strong before she returned to the rosita you can do it nancy thought you have to do it so donвђt waste any more time she got to her knees and looked over the rail checking to make sure the lower deck was clear no one was in sight so nancy stood up and put her foot on the top rail gripping it with her toes she brought her other foot up found her balance and slowly straightened to her full height the water was at least twenty feet below her donвђt think about it she told herself just do it nancy raised her arms above her head and pushed out and off the rail diving headfirst into the dark waters of the atlantic the ocean hit her like a cold slap in the face and it seemed as if she sank forever before she was able to start pulling herself up finally though she broke the surface gasping she tossed her hair out of her face and then pulled herself toward the rositaвђs stern with strong steady strokes when nancy reached it she stopped treading water the rail lights and the glow from the bonfires sent a faint path of light along the water and in that path about fifteen feet away nancy saw a dark triangular shape gliding smoothly through the waves she wiped her eyes again and blinked trying to tell herself that she was seeing things but she wasnвђt the black triangle was a sharkвђs fin and as nancy watched frozen she saw it swerve sharply and begin to slice through the water heading straight for her chapter fifteen nancy felt panic wash over her colder than the water lapping at her throat sheвђd done her share of detective work but sheвђd never had to deal with a shark before and she didnвђt want to start then the shark was swimming closer nancy clamped her lips together forcing back the scream that was threatening to break loose it would surely attract attention either the sharkвђs or lilaвђs and nancy wasnвђt sure which would be worse for several minutes nancy treaded water deciding to wait until the shark did whatever it was going to do but she had no idea what it was going to do and it probably didnвђt either so what was the point besides waiting was just too scary she had to move or that scream was going to escape her lips not wanting to make any waves nancy used just her arms to pull herself smoothly toward the shore after a moment she realized she didnвђt know where the shark was anymoreвђin front of her behind her or below her somehow not knowing was more frightening than knowing and for a while she kept looking around trying to locate the telltale fin but after a few minutes she simply concentrated on getting ashore the sharkвђs got the whole ocean to fish in she kept telling herself why should it pick on you avoiding the paths of light cast by the bonfires nancy swam in a wide arc heading for a deserted part of the beach she thought that once she got there she could find a subtle way to join the crowd pretending sheвђd always been part of it if you get there she reminded herself and looked over her shoulder again she didnвђt see the shark but that didnвђt mean it wasnвђt lurking somewhere biding its time but nancy couldnвђt afford to bide her time she realized she couldnвђt keep up the slow pace she was taking forever to reach the island and she didnвђt want to risk letting the rosita get away sure she could send the police after it eventually but by then it might be too late for the four friends sheвђd left behind forcing herself to forget every shark movie ever made nancy put her head down started a strong steady kick with her legs and shot through the water like an olympic swimmer going for the gold she didnвђt stop until she felt sand grazing her thighs and even then she didnвђt stand up instead she crawled out of the water her stomach brushing the sand and then flopped down hoping no one had seen her emerging from the ocean when she raised her head and looked toward the party nancy realized her fear of being seen was ridiculous absolutely nobody was looking her way they were all too involved in dancing eating flirting and splashing in the water it would be simple to join them and since the speedboats were beached close to the party nancy knew that was what she had to do confident that no one was watching nancy stood up brushed the sand from her body and picked the seaweed out of her hair then she began a slow saunter toward the bonfires trying to look like sheвђd been for a solitary stroll along the beach and had decided to rejoin the party it was simple just as sheвђd thought it would be the party to nowhere was nothing more than a fancier version of the parties on the fort lauderdale beach the food was a lot better than hot dogs and potato chips but other than that it was really just a bunch of people having too good a time to pay any attention to a single girl striding along the sand when nancy reached the thick of the crowd she put on a smile and started dancing with no one in particular as she spun to her left she spotted three of lilaвђs boys one was wrapping ears of corn to be roasted in the coals one was stationed at a table serving drinks and the third oneвђhandsome вђњmr friendlyвђќ the maintenance manвђwas leaning against one of the speedboats his eyes roving over the crowd there was no sign of lila and nancy wondered suddenly if she was still on the rosita spinning again so that her back was to the maintenance man nancy realized that she had to do something fast if lila was still on the rosita then the boat might be taking off sooner than nancy had anticipated nancy knew she had to get her hands on one of those launches but there was no way she could slip past the watchful eye of mr friendly somehow she had to make him leave his post suddenly the group she was with began moving toward the water and nancy found herself swept along with them until she was kneedeep in the surf splashing each other and laughing as they tried to dance on the shifting sand beneath their feet they kept moving into deeper water they were getting farther from the shore and farther nancy noticed from the light cast by the bonfires no one was trying to dance anymore they were all diving under the waves or swimming lazily that was when nancy got her idea she needed a major distraction something to get that maintenance man away from the speedboats and she was going to create it herself a wave was rolling in and nancy dived under it surfacing about ten feet from the rest of her group she checked to make sure no one was paying any attention to her and then she let out a highpitched bloodcurdling scream вђњsharkвђќ she shrieked at the top of her lungs вђњi see a sharkвђќ in seconds everyone had taken up the cry it didnвђt seem to matter whether there really was a shark all that mattered was getting out of the water screaming and shouting nancyвђs group started swimming frantically for the island while the people on shore raced to the waterвђs edge yelling for everyone to hurry when the two groups met on the sand they all stared out over the dark water still screaming in fear and excitement вђњi think i see itвђќ a girl called out вђњlookвђis that itвђќ вђњit must beвђќ nancy answered not bothering to look вђњmy gosh itвђs hugeвђќ while everyone stared at the water nancy was checking out the launches and she saw exactly what sheвђd hoped to seeвђno maintenance man no florist none of lilaвђs boys the entire party to nowhere was gathered at the shore craning their necks for a glimpse of a shark this is your chance nancy told herself and it might be the only one youвђll get вђњthere it isвђќ she shouted and waited until everyone was looking the other way then she turned and raced along the beach toward the speedboats when she reached the first one nancy ducked behind it and glanced back the crowd was still at the edge of the water but no one was screaming anymore and she knew it would only be a minute or two before they lost interest and started partying again two minutes she thought thatвђs all youвђve got her heart pounding nancy straightened up and looked into the speedboat in the glow of the bonfires she saw something glittering just to the right of the wheel and let out her breath in a sigh of relief it was the key she hadnвђt even thought about the key but there it was thank goodness ready to ignite the engine keeping low on the sand nancy crept to the front of the boat and started pushing it didnвђt budge she shoved harder and when it still didnвђt move she realized sheвђd have to stand up straight if she wanted to shove as hard as she could she knew sheвђd be in the full glow of the firelight and if anyone looked over they couldnвђt miss seeing her but she didnвђt have a choice she had to push the boat into the water and get going nancy straightened up and shoved against the boat as hard as she could it slid two feet forward nancy rubbed her palms together and got ready to push again suddenly someone was shouting and before nancy had a chance to move the shout rang out again loud and clear and furious it was lila standing on the deck of the rosita and pointing straight at nancy вђњstop herвђќ lila screamed вђњsheвђs got a boat stop herвђќ nancy spun around to face the crowd of partiers they were still milling around at the waterвђs edge all but one that oneвђthe maintenance manвђhad broken away from the group and was loping across the sand toward nancy nancy knew there was no longer any sense in trying to get the boat in the water sheвђd never make it sheвђd been caught and as she watched the maintenance man closing the gap between them she wondered if sheвђd been caught for good for a split second nancy stood rooted to the spot and ready to give up but when she actually heard the sharp steady breathing of the man she snapped to attention come on she told herself you can probably outrun that creep and if not you can certainly outthink him in a flash nancy was off her heels sending out sprays of sand as she headed away from the boats and the bonfires toward the dark center of the island she had no idea what sheвђd find there but it couldnвђt be any more dangerous than what she was leaving behind nancy kept running plunging through the sand until finally the broad empty stretch of beach gave way to palm trees and undergrowth it was suddenly very dark which was good but she couldnвђt see a thing and the tangled vines and bushes made it impossible to run quietly which wasnвђt so good she knew she sounded like a scared deer crashing through a forest she also knew that if mr friendly couldnвђt see her he could hear her since she could certainly hear him crashing along right behind her and he was much too close for comfort after a few minutes the clumps of trees started to thin out and nancy realized she was heading uphill she forced herself to keep going thinking that at least lila wouldnвђt take off she couldnвђt take that chance not as long as nancy was on the run nancy ran until she was no longer under the safe cover of the trees she burst out into an open space under a bright moon and looked around wildly if she didnвђt find someplace to hide soon the maintenance man could just bide his time until she collapsed he might already be doing that nancy thought she couldnвђt hear him anymore but she knew he couldnвђt be far behind struggling to keep her balance nancy scrambled up a steep incline and then she stopped gasping more from fear than from exhaustion she was on some kind of cliff and below herвђin a sheer thirtyfoot dropвђwas a smooth stretch of sand sparkling in the moonlight unless she managed to turn herself into a mountain goat there was no way she could get down and at that moment nancy heard heavy gasping sounds the maintenance man he was closing in fast and she knew she was too tired to go through another chase scene with him she would have to face him glancing frantically aroundвђќ she saw three large rocks grouped together as the breathing grew louder nancy rushed over and hid herself behind them in seconds the maintenance man was on the cliff as nancy watched peering between two of the rocks he stopped to get his breath then turned and began walking slowly in nancyвђs direction looking everywhere for signs of the girl heвђd been chasing her heart pounding nancy made herself wait until he was so close to her hiding place that she could reach out and touch him then in one swift move her leg shot out sweeping his feet out from under him sending him sprawling on the ground the maintenance man was caught completely by surprise and nancy was just trying to decide what to do with him when she heard a shout she looked up and there on the edge of the cliff in the bright moonlight stood dirk bowman chapter sixteen the moment nancy paused the maintenance man took action throwing her aside in one strong movement nancy was outnumbered but she wasnвђt about to give up she and the maintenance man faced each other squaring off like boxers in the ring out of the corner of her eye nancy saw dirk bowman rushing toward them lashing out at the maintenance man with a kick she spun around to face dirk but dirk bowman ignored nancy instead he caught the maintenance man with his left hand and swinging his right arm up from somewhere around his knees crashed his fist squarely into the manвђs jaw lilaвђs boy gasped sank to his knees then pitched forward onto his face he wouldnвђt be chasing anybody for quite a while stunned nancy looked at dirk who was rubbing his knuckles and grinning at her вђњiвђve been wanting to do that for a long timeвђќ he said вђњwho are youвђќ nancy asked warily вђњhow did you get away and what happened to my friendsвђќ вђњyour friends helped me get awayвђќ dirk told her вђњand theyвђre safe theyвђre waiting for us right now in the launch we stole now come onвђќ he said reaching for her hand вђњletвђs get going iвђd love to take a nice romantic stroll in the moonlight but we just donвђt have timeвђќ nancy pulled her hand away вђњiвђm not going anywhere until you tell me who you areвђќ вђњiвђm a police detectiveвђќ dirk said calmly вђњiвђve been working undercover for two months trying to get enough evidence against lila to stop her operation for goodвђќ he started walking again вђњwhy donвђt you walk behind meвђќ he suggested grinning at her over his shoulder вђњif you think iвђm leading you into a trap you can always jump me again the way you did on the rositaвђќ nancy didnвђt think she had enough energy left to jump anybody she really wanted to believe dirk but she was still suspicious of him so she followed his advice and stayed about five feet behind him вђњwhy didnвђt you tell me who you were when we first metвђќ she called out вђњi couldnвђt risk itвђќ he said вђњif my cover had been blown there would have been no way to stop lila besides the lady would probably have killed meвђќ вђњbut you knew what was going onвђќ nancy reminded him вђњwasnвђt that enough evidenceвђќ вђњwe suspected we didnвђt know for sure we needed witnessesвђќ he explained вђњand even after i started working for lila it was a long time before she trusted me with her little secret in factвђќ he said with a laugh вђњyou and your friends were my first assignmentвђќ вђњme and my friendsвђќ nancy asked вђњwhat about before that what about my windsurfing accident you didnвђt have anything to do with thatвђќ вђњnope my guess is that one of lilaвђs boys saw us together and reported it to her and she told him to take care of youвђќ dirk said вђњshe still didnвђt trust me then but i put on a pretty convincing act and finally she decided i was okayвђќ вђњso tonight when you came down to the hold you were supposed to kill us rightвђќ nancy asked вђњrightвђќ dirk stopped and turned looking at nancy вђњi wasnвђt going to follow lilaвђs orders of course but bess never gave me a chance to tell you that and when i came to youвђd already taken off for the island how did you get here anywayвђќ вђњi swamвђќ quickly nancy told him everything that had happened since sheвђd escaped from the rosita as dirk listened his eyes lit up in admiration and when she finished he gave a low whistle вђњyouвђre really something detectiveвђќ he held out his hand and nancy shook it вђњbut just thinkвђќ he went on his eyes twinkling mischievously вђњif you hadnвђt knocked me out you could have saved yourself that swimвђќ nancy started to argue but when she caught the look in his eyes she found herself laughing instead he grabbed her other hand and the two of them began running together soon they were back in the trees and it wasnвђt long before nancy heard the distant strains of rock music and laughter from the party to nowhere halfway back to the shore dirk started heading to the right вђњthe launch is around a curve in the beachвђќ he told nancy вђњweвђll use the trees for coverвђќ вђњhow did you get it there without anyone hearing the motorвђќ nancy asked вђњkim navigated and the rest of us paddledвђќ dirk replied with a laugh вђњwe made a great team the only thing we really had to worry about was lila spotting us from the rosita but i guess she was too busy making sure you were brought back to notice usвђќ вђњshe must be wondering whatвђs taking that guy so longвђќ nancy said вђњsheвђs probably getting very antsyвђќ dirk laughed again вђњwaitвђll i come after her with four or five other cops then sheвђll know what antsy really isвђќ nancy began to forget about sore feet and sore muscles she forgot about everything but leaving the island and when they finally caught sight of the sleek little speedboat waiting a few feet from the shoreline she grabbed dirkвђs hand again and pulled him along behind her as she broke into a run вђњfinallyвђќ bessвђs voice cried out вђњweвђve been sitting in this boat so long i was beginning to grow barnaclesвђќ nancy laughed and splashed into the water вђњyou think youвђve had it badвђќ she joked as she reached the boat вђњwaitвђll you hear what iвђve been throughвђќ there was no time to exchange stories though in spite of what dirk had said he and nancy knew that lila wouldnвђt wait forever if she discovered that theyвђd escaped she might just take off maybe for another country that would leave the police with no one to arrest but her troop of handsome boys dirk didnвђt want that and neither did nancy they both wanted lila templeton caught quickly nancy dirk and george pushed the speedboat far enough out so they could lower the engine into the water when they climbed in dirk slid into the driverвђs seat and turned the key the engine caught with a roar and as the boat pulled smoothly away from the island the six passengers laughed with relief вђњi never thought iвђd say itвђќ bess admitted вђњbut iвђll actually be glad to get back to river heightsвђќ вђњbut you havenвђt fallen in love yetвђќ george teased вђњare you sure you donвђt want to stick aroundвђќ вђњno thanksвђќ bess said вђњthere are plenty of guys at homeвђќ вђњhey what about meвђќ dirk joked вђњi thought you said youвђd spend the rest of your life with me if i just got you off the rositaвђќ bess giggled and leaning forward planted a kiss on his cheek вђњyouвђre fantastic dirkвђќ she told him вђњbut iвђm afraid that was a promise i just canвђt keepвђќ everyone laughed again but nancy stopped suddenly as she became aware of another sound even over the whine of the speedboat she could hear itвђa heavy throbbing almost a rumbling like a powerful motor she glanced around maria was staring out the back of the boat her eyes wide with fear вђњmariaвђќ nancy said вђњwhat is it what do you seeвђќ вђњlookвђќ maria said pointing вђњsheвђs found usвђќ straining to see nancy could just make out a large dark shape looming behind them it didnвђt stay dark for long though as nancy watched the deck and rail lights of the rosita flashed on the rosita was only about a hundred feet away its powerful engines louder than ever as lila templeton aimed it straight at the tiny speedboat bess stood halfway up and let out a scream вђњsheвђs going to ram usвђќ вђњiвђm afraid thatвђs exactly what she has in mindвђќ dirk agreed вђњand if she gets close enough sheвђll probably take a few shots at us too the lady is definitely desperateвђќ вђњi thought the party was overвђќ george said grimly вђњbut it looks like itвђs just getting startedвђќ the speedboat was fast but so was the rosita and as the six of them watched lilaвђs powerful boat surged through the water shortening the gap between them вђњcanвђt we go any fasterвђќ nancy called to dirk вђњnot muchвђќ he told her slipping an arm around her shoulder he pulled her head close to his lips speaking quietly so the others wouldnвђt hear вђњweвђre low on gasвђќ he said вђњand iвђm not sure how long weвђll last if she decides to chase us all over the atlanticвђќ shivering with tension nancy stared at the gas gauge the arrow was hovering around the onequarter mark it might be enough to get them back to fort lauderdale but only if they made a beeline for it if they had to do many fancy maneuvers to get away from lila theyвђd never make it at that moment nancy heard a faint popping sound something like a firecracker she turned and saw one of lilaвђs boys on the top deck of the rosita he was braced against the rail like a sharpshooter aiming a longbarreled rifle at the six people in the speedboat вђњeverybody downвђќ nancy shouted вђњif they get much closer heвђll be able to pick us off one by oneвђќ bess cried out as she huddled in the bottom of the boat вђњus or the engineвђќ george exclaimed вђњand if he hits the engine there wonвђt be anything left of us to pick offвђќ dirk fumbled around on the floor and pulled up the revolver that nancy had kicked out of his hand a few hours before вђњitвђs hardly a rifleвђќ he commented wryly вђњbut itвђs better than nothingвђќ nancy nodded and reached for his hand pulling him up вђњyou deal with lilaвђќ she suggested вђњand leave the driving to meвђќ dirk nodded and crawled to the back of the boat while nancy slid into the driverвђs seat the fuel gauge was just under the quarter mark by then and she knew she didnвђt have much time glancing back she saw that the rosita hadnвђt gained on them but she also saw that lila wasnвђt directly behind them anymore sheвђd pulled the rosita out so that it was between the speedboat and the mainland wiping the spray from her face nancy pushed the stick up a notch giving the boat more power it slapped over the water like a rollercoaster car but nancy could still hear the throbbing of the rositaвђs engines and she knew that lila was keeping up with her вђњi could go around behind themвђќ she shouted to dirk вђњthe rosita canвђt turn as fast as we canвђќ вђњtry itвђќ he called back вђњjust be careful of sandbars theyвђre all over the placeвђќ now he tells me nancy thought she checked the fuel again and decided to risk the extra mileage getting a good grip on the wheel she cut it sharply turning the boat so that it was heading back toward the rosita as they passed the rositaвђs bow nancy saw lilaвђs boy leave his post and scramble toward the stern rifle in hand suddenly the rosita began to turn toward the mainland she knows what iвђm trying to do nancy thought sheвђs going to cut me off if she can nancy turned the wheel again and felt the boat begin to bounce wildly as it cut across the rositaвђs wake both boats were heading for the mainland but lilaвђs had a slight lead and sheвђd angled it toward the speedboat if she managed to get much farther ahead she would be able to cut them off and nancy knew they didnвђt have enough gas left to try any more tricks the spray was practically blinding her and her hands were so wet they kept slipping off the wheel but nancy wiped her face and eyes and tried frantically to see exactly what was ahead of her all she had to light her way were the moon and the dim glow from the rosita suddenly though they were all nancy needed ahead of her stretching across the water like a pale ribbon was one of the sandbars dirk had warned her about it seemed to go on forever and nancy knew that if she tried to zip around it sheвђd crash into the rosita going one way or run out of gas going the other bess had crawled up beside her and nancy could tell from the look on her face that sheвђd seen the sandbar too her teeth chattering with fear bess tried to smile вђњwouldnвђt it be nice if this boat had wingsвђќ she asked вђњthatвђs itвђќ nancy cried out вђњwhatвђs itвђќ вђњwingsвђќ nancy grinned and pushed bess back down вђњhang on everybodyвђќ she shouted вђњweвђre going to flyвђќ nancy gripped the wheel and eased the stick up to full speed as the little boat shot forward with all the power its engine could give it nancy gritted her teeth and aimed it straight for the sandbar chapter seventeen the front of the speedboat hit the sand with a bonejarring thump then its blade stirring the air it sailed up and over the sandbar splashed down hard on the other side and sped on toward the lights of fort lauderdale as soon as they caught their breath everyone turned to look behind them and what they saw made them cheer out loud lila was trying to avoid the sandbar but she was moving too fast and as the six people in the speedboat looked on the rosita plowed straight into it its engines grinding uselessly lilaвђs boat came to a dead stop lila was trapped and her party was finally over вђњnancy you did itвђќ george shouted вђњthat was one nice piece of driving detectiveвђќ dirk said with a grin nancy laughed вђњthanks just donвђt ask me to do it againвђќ вђњbeing stuck out there serves lila rightвђќ bess said вђњi just hope thereвђs no way she can escapeвђќ вђњuhoh i just thought of somethingвђќ nancy said вђњiвђll bet the rosita has lifeboats that means lila does have a way to escape and you can bet sheвђll use itвђќ вђњshe couldnвђt get very far but youвђre right nancyвђќ dirk agreed вђњsheвђs not the kind to give up until every last doorвђs been slammed in her faceвђќ вђњi donвђt think even that would make her give upвђќ george commented вђњnot when sheвђs as desperate as she is right nowвђќ there was no time to waste as soon as they were safely back to shore dirk raced for the nearest phone and called in his backup team to help capture lila and her crew nancy and the others hopped into their rental car and rushed kim back to the hospital вђњi wanted to stick around and see them bring lila inвђќ kim protested on the way вђњhonestly iвђm perfectly fineвђќ вђњyou might be fineвђќ nancy told her вђњbut your motherвђs probably having a nervous breakdown by nowвђќ вђњthatвђs rightвђќ bess said вђњshe wasnвђt even with us when we left the hospital before so sheвђs still completely in the dark she must be franticвђќ bess was right when they got to the hospital they found mrs baylor still frantic with worry and the entire staff in an uproar over the missing patient as soon as kim appeared the doctors whisked her away to check on her condition and finally her mother calmed down enough to listen to what had happened when nancy finished telling the story mrs baylor sighed in relief вђњthank goodness you were here nancy and that itвђs overвђќ вђњthatвђs exactly what i was thinkingвђќ bess said with a yawn вђњwell itвђs not quite overвђќ nancy reminded them вђњweвђll all have to give statements to the police and if thereвђs a trial kim and maria will probably have to testifyвђќ вђњi will be very happy to do thatвђќ maria said вђњeven if it means that i canвђt stay here i want to see lila templeton get вђќ she searched for the right words вђњget whatвђs coming to herвђќ bess finished with a laugh вђњyouвђre very brave mariaвђќ nancy said вђњi hope things work out for you so you donвђt have to go back to your country if you donвђt want toвђќ one of the doctors came in then and gave them the good newsвђkim was weak and worn out but otherwise she seemed to be fine they just wanted to keep her in the hospital for a couple of days to make sure leaving maria at the hospital with kimвђs mother nancy bess and george sped back to the docks just in time to see the police patrol boat arrive a very happy looking dirk bowman waved to them from the deck then pointed to a small group of peopleвђit was lila templeton and her handsome deadly crew looking very unhappy the sun was just coming up as nancy bess and george let themselves into their room at the surfside inn they took turns in the shower and then george and nancy started packing but bess wrapped a towel around her wet head and flopped down on the cot вђњiвђve never been so exhausted in my entire lifeвђќ she yawned вђњnobody wake me for at least twelve hoursвђќ вђњsorryвђќ george told her вђњbut our plane leaves in four hours you donвђt want to miss it do youвђќ вђњi donвђt knowвђќ bess said вђњnow that everythingвђs over i wouldnвђt mind sticking around for a couple of days there are a lot of cute guys around and iвђd hate to miss outвђќ nancy laughed вђњi thought you said there were plenty of guys back homeвђќ she teased вђњthat was when i thought i was going to dieвђќ bess protested вђњbut now that lila and her crew are behind bars i figure i might as well enjoy the rest of spring breakвђќ вђњi would have given anything to see the look on lilaвђs face when the police came to вђrescueвђ herвђќ george said вђњi wonder if she tried to lie her way out of itвђќ вђњif she did it didnвђt do her any goodвђќ nancy said вђњnot with kim and maria and dirk as witnesses against herвђќ вђњspeaking of dirkвђќ george said peering out the window вђњhe just pulled up in that fancy red car of his and it looks like heвђs heading this wayвђќ nancy opened the door and smiled as she watched dirk bowman come down the hall вђњi thought youвђd at least take the rest of the day offвђќ she said вђњthe day iвђm taking a week offвђќ he replied with a grin вђњbut i knew you were leaving and i had a couple of things i wanted to tell you how about a quick walkвђќ nancy slipped on a pair of sandals and together she and dirk strolled down the sidewalk in the early morning sun вђњfirstвђќ dirk said reaching for nancyвђs hand вђњiвђve got some good news kimвђs mother agreed to vouch for maria and get her a job with some friends here in fort lauderdale so sheвђll be staying on and she says sheвђs going to start college as soon as she can she wants to be an engineerвђќ вђњthatвђs greatвђќ nancy said with relief вђњi was worried that sheвђd be sent backвђќ she stifled a yawn and then laughed вђњsorry iвђm completely wiped outвђќ вђњwell thatвђs the second thing i wanted to talk to you aboutвђќ dirk said he stopped walking and put his hands on her shoulders вђњi wanted to thank you detective you were fantastic and if you ever come back to fort lauderdale let me knowвђќ bending down he touched his lips softly to nancyвђs вђњthanks to you lila templeton wonвђt be throwing any more partiesвђќ for a moment nancy leaned her head against his shoulder smiling then with a gasp she suddenly pulled away вђњwhatвђs wrongвђќ dirk asked вђњi just rememberedвђќ nancy said trying not to laugh вђњthe party the party to nowhere all those people are still stranded out there on that islandвђќ dirkвђs blue eyes widened in shock and he shook his head вђњi guess iвђll start my vacation this afternoonвђќ he said he gave nancy a quick kiss and then raced off to his car вђњsee what i meanвђќ he called back over his shoulder вђњi could use you down here detectiveвђќ laughing nancy watched the red car speed down the palmlined street then she headed back to her hotel it was time to go home
