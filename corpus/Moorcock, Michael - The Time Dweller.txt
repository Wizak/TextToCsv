the time dweller a short stories collection by michael moorcock the time dweller dusk had come to the universe albeit the small universe inhabited by man the sun of earth had dimmed the moon had retreated and salt clogged the sluggish oceans filled the rivers that toiled slowly between white crystalline banks beneath darkened moody skies that slumbered in eternal evening of course in the suns long life this stage was merely one interlude in perhaps a few thousand years it would flare to full splendour again but for the meantime it kept its light in close rein grumbling in its mighty depths and preparing itself for the next step in its evolution it had taken time in its fading and those few creatures who had remained on its planets had managed to adapt among them was man indefatigable undeserving really considering the lengths he had gone to in previous epochs to dispose of him self but here he was in his small universe consisting of one planet without even the satellite which had slid away into space long since and in its passing left legends on his lips brown clouds brown light brown rocks and brown ocean flecked with white a pale rider on a pale beast thumping along the shore the dry taste of ocean salt in his mouth the stink of a dead oozer in his nostrils his name was the scarfaced brooder son of the sleepy eyed smiler his father and the pinchcheeked worrier his mother the sealbeast he rode was called urge its glossy coat was still sleek with the saltrain that had recently ceased its snout pointed eagerly forward and its two strong legfins thwacked the encrusted shore as it galloped along dragging its razoredged tail with scant effort the scarfaced brooder was supported on his steeds sloping back by a builtup saddle of polished silicon that flashed whenever it reflected the salt patches studding the ground like worn teeth in his head held at its butt by a stirrup grip was his long gun the piercer with an everlasting ruby as its life he was dressed in sealskin dyed in sombre rustred and dark yellow behind him the scarfaced brooder heard the sound of another rider one whom he had tried to avoid since morning now as evening quietly flowed brown and misty into black night she still followed he turned his calm face to look his mouth tight and white as the scar which rose from its corner to follow his left cheekbone she was in the distance still but gaining he increased his speed brown clouds boiled low like foam across the dark sand of the flat and their seals slapped loudly over the damp shore as she neared him he came to a pool of saltthick water and urge splashed into it it was warm still she followed him even into the water so that he turned his steed and waited halftrembling until she rode up a tall wellformed woman with light brown hair long and loose in the breeze dearest tall laugher he told his sister for me there is no amusement in this game frowning she smiled he pressed his point disturbed his calm face earnest in the fading brown light that was all the clouds would let pass i wish to ride alone where would you go alone when together we might be carried to more exotic adventure he paused unwilling and unable to answer will you come back i would prefer not to a cold silent wind began to buffet them as it came in sud denly from the sea urge moved nervously you fear what the chronarch might do the chronarch has no love for mebut neither has he hatred he would prefer me gone from lanjis liho to cross the great salt plains of the west and seek my fortune in the land of fronds he would not trust me with a small part of the future as you know nor give a fraction of the past into my safekeeping i go to shape my own destiny so you sulk she cried as the wind began to mewl you sulk because the chronarch delegates no honours meanwhile your loving sister aches and is miserable marry the bigbrained boaster he has trust of past and future both he forced his restless sealbeast through the thick water and into the night as it moved he reached into the saddle sheath and took out his torch to light his way he depressed its grip and it blazed out illuminating the surrounding beach for several yards around turning he saw her for a moment in the circle of light motionless her eyes aghast as if he had betrayed her oh i am lonely now he thought as the wind blew cold and strong against his body he headed inland over the saltrocks towards the west he rode all night until his eyes were heavy with tiredness but still he rode away from lanjis liho where chronarch lord of time ruled past and present and watched the future come away from family home and city his heart racked with the strain of the breaking his mind fevered fire and his body all stiff from the demands he made of it into the night into the west with his torch burning in his saddle and loyal urge responding to his affectionate whisper ing to the west until dawn came slowly up from behind him and covered the barren land with soft light a little further through the morning he heard a sound as of cloth flapping in the wind and when he turned his head he saw a green tent pitched beside a shallow crevasse its front flap dancing he readied his long piercer and halted urge drawn out perhaps by the noise of the sealbeasts move ment a mans head poked from the tent like a tortoise emerg ing from the recesses of its shell he had a beak of a nose and a fishlike pecker of a mouth his large eyes were heavylidded and a tightfitting hood hid hair and neck aha said the scarfaced brooder in recognition hmm said the hooknosed wanderer also recognizing the mounted man confronting him you are some distance from lanjis liho where are you bound for the land of fronds he resheathed his piercer and clambered down from the high saddle he passed the tent its occupants head craning round to follow him and stared into the crevasse it had been widened and deepened by human tools revealing pieces of ancient wreckage whats this nothing but the remains of a crashed spaceship replied the hooknosed wanderer in such obvious disappointment that he could not have been lying my metal diviner found it and i had hoped for a capsule with books or film there were never many of those id say they had all been gathered by now thats my belief too but one hopes have you break fasted no thank you the hooded head withdrew into the tent and a thin hand held back the flap the scarfaced brooder bent and entered the cluttered tent there was a great deal of equipment therein the hooknosed wanderers livelihood for he sustained himself by bartering some of the objects he found with his metal diviner and other instruments apparently you have no riding animal said the scarfaced brooder as he sat down and crossed his legs between a soft bundle and an angular statuette of steel and concrete it was necessary to abandon her when my water was exhausted and i could find none to replace it that is why i was heading for the sea i am exceedingly thirsty am suffer ing from saltdeficiency since i have no liking for the salt which grows in these parts i have plenty in my saddle barrel he said help yourself good salt water slightly diluted with fresh if that suits your taste he leant back on the bundle as the wanderer nodding sharply scrambled up claspinga canteen and left the tent he returned smiling thanks i can last for several days now he pushed aside his clutter of antiques discovering a small stove he activated it placed a pan on top and began frying the legfish he had trapped recently which city was your destination brooder only two are in easy reach from hereand both lie still many leagues hence is it barbart or piorha barbart in the land of fronds i think for i should like to see green vegetation instead of grey or brown and the ancient places thereabouts have i must admit romantic connotations for me i should like to go and wallow in racial memory sense the danger of uncontrolled past insignificant present and ran dom future some feel it as that the wanderer smiled shuffling the legfish on to plates especially those from lanjis liho where the chronarchy holds sway but remember much will be in your mind you may see barbart and the land of fronds but its significance will be decided by you not by it try to do as i do make no judgments or descriptions of this world of ours do that and it will treat you better your words seem wise wanderer but i have no precedents by which to judge them perhaps when i have placed some of the future in the past i will know you seem tired said the wanderer when they were finished eating would you like to sleep i would thanks and while the hooknosed wanderer went about his business the brooder slept he rose in the mellow afternoon roused urge who had taken advantage of his masters slumber to rest also and wished the wanderer goodbye may your blood stay thick said the wanderer formally and your mind remain open he rode away and by dusk had come to the moss which was primarily grey and brown but tinted in places with patches of light green he took out his torch and fixed it in its saddle bracket unwilling to sleep at night because of the potential danger of predatory life once the light from his torch showed him a school of oozers moving at right angles to his path they were far inland for their kind these great white slugcreatures that raised their heads to observe him he felt he could hear them sniffing at his body salt as perhaps their leech ancestors had sniffed out the blood of his own forefathers urge without prompting increased his speed as he left them he felt that the oozers represented the true native of earth now mans place was no longer easy to define but it seemed that he had been superseded by remaining alive on the saltheavy earth he was outstaying his welcome if there was another home for man it did not lie here but in some other region perhaps not even the region of space at all but in dimensions where natural evolution could not affect him brooding as was his bent he continued to ride for barbart and by the following day had reached the delicate frond forests that waved golden green in the soft sunlight all silence and sweet scent urges bounding gait became almost merry as they fled over the cushions of moss between the shaded spaces left by the webthin fronds waving and flowing in the gusts of air which occasionally swept the forest he dismounted soon and lay back on a bank of comfortable moss breathing the scented breeze in luxurious selfindulgence his mind began to receive disjointed images he heard his sisters voice the sonorous tones of the chronarch denying him a function in the house of timea function which he had expected as of right for had not his granduncle been the previous chronarch he saw the twisting many dimensioned tower of time that wonderwork of an ancient architect with its colours and strange moving angles and curves and then he slept when he awoke it was night and urge was hooting at him to wake he got up sleepily and hauled himself into the saddle settled himself reached for his torch and adjusting it rode through what seemed to be a network of black and stirring threads that were the fronds seen in the cold torchlight the next morning he could see the lowroofed houses of barbart lying in a valley walled by gentle hills high above the roofs a great contrivance of burnished brass glowered like rich red gold he speculated momentarily upon its function now a road became evident a hard track winding among the moss dimes and leading towards the city as he followed it he heard the muffled thud of a rider approaching and somewhat wary for he knew little of barbart or its inhabitants reined in urge his piercer ready riding towards him on a heavy old walrus came a young man longhaired and pleasantfeatured in a jerkin of light blue that matched his eyes he stopped the walrus and looked quizzi cally at the scarfaced brooder stranger he said cheerfully it is a pleasant morning yes it isand a pleasant land you dwell in is that city barbart barbart certainly theres none other hereabouts from where are you from lanjis liho by the sea i had the inkling that men from lanjis liho never travelled far i am the first my name is the scarfaced brooder mine is domm and i welcome you to barbart i would escort you there save for the fact that i have a mission from my mother to seek herbs among the fronds i am already late i fear what time is it time why the present of course ha ha but the hour what is that what is the hour asked the brooder greatly puzzled thats my question i am afraid your local vernacular is beyond me said the brooder politely but nonplussed the lads question had been strange to begin with but now it had become incomprehen sible no matter domm decided with a smile i have heard you people of lanjis liho have some peculiar customs i will not delay you follow the road and you should be in barbart in less than an hour hour the word again was it some division of the league used here he gave up wondering and wished the youth thick blood as he rode on the mosaiced buildings of barbart were built in orderly geometric patterns about the central quadrangle in which lay the towering machine of burnished brass with its ridges and knobs and curlicues set in the centre of the machine was a great round plaque divided into twelve units with each unit of twelve divided into a further five units from the centre arose two pointers one shorter than the other and the scarfaced brooder saw them move slowly as he rode through barbart he noticed that facsimiles of this object were everywhere and he judged at last that it was some holy object or heraldic device barbart seemed a pleasant place though with a somewhat restless atmosphere epitomized by the frantic marketplace where men and women rushed from stall to stall shouting at one another tugging at bales of bright cloth fingering saltfree fruits and vegetables pawing meats and confectioneries amid the constant babble of the vendors crying their wares enjoying the scene the scarfaced brooder led his sealbeast through the square and discovered a tavern in one of the side plazas the plaza itself contained a small fountain in its centre and benches and tables had been placed close by outside the tavern the brooder seated himself upon one of these and gave his order to the fat girl who came to ask it beer she said folding her plump brown arms over her red bodice we have only a little and it is expensive the fermented peach juice is cheaper then bring me that he said pleasantly and turned to watch the thin fountain water noting that it smelt of brine hardly at all hearing perhaps a strange accent a man emerged from the shadowy doorway of the tavern and tankard in hand stood looking down at the scarfaced brooder an amiable expression on his face where are you from traveller he asked the brooder told him and the barbartian seemed surprised he seated himself on another bench you are the second visitor from strange parts we have had here in a week the other was an emissary from moon they have changed much those moonites you know tall they are and thin as a frond with aesthetic faces they dress in cloth of metal he told us he had sailed space for many weeks to reach us at this second reference to the unfamiliar word week the brooder turned his head to look at the barbartian forgive me he said but as a stranger i am curious at certain words i have heard here what would you mean by week exactly why a week seven days what else the brooder laughed apologetically there you are you see another word days what is a days the barbartian scratched his head a wry expression on his face he was a middleaged man with a slight stoop dressed in a robe of yellow cloth he put down his tankard and raised his hand come with me and i will do my best to show you that would please me greatly said the brooder gratefully he finished his wine and called for the girl when she appeared he asked her to take care of his steed and to make him up a bed since he would be staying through the next darkness the barbartian introduced himself as mokof took the brooders arm and led him through the series of squares triangles and circles formed by the buildings to come at length to the great central plaza and stare up at the pulsing monstrous machine of burnished bronze this machine supplies thecity with its life mokof informed him and also regulates our lives he pointed at the disc which the brooder had noted earlier do you know what that is my friend no i am afraid i do not could you explain its a clock it measures the hours of the day he broke off noting the brooders puzzlement that is to say it measures time ah i am with you at last but a strange device surely for it cannot measure a great deal of time with that little circular dial how does it note the flow we call a period of sunlight day and a period of darkness night we divide each into twelve hours then the period of sunlight and the period of darkness are equal i had thought no we call them equal for convenience since they vary the twelve divisions are called hours when the hands reach twelve they begin to count around again fantastic the brooder was astounded you mean you recycle the same period of time round and round again a marvellous idea wonderful i had not thought it possible not exactly mokof said patiently however the hours are divided into sixty units these are called minutes the minutes are also divided into sixty units each unit is called a second the seconds are stop stop i am confounded bewildered dazzled how do you control the flow of time that you can thus manipulate it at will you must tell me the chronarch in lanjis liho would be overawed to learn of your discoveries you fail to understand my friend we do not control time if anything it controls us we simply measure it you dont controlbut if thats so why the brooder broke off unable to see the logic of the barbartians words you tell me you recycle a given period of time which you divided into twelve and yet you then tell me you recycle a shorter period and then an even shorter period it would soon become apparent if this were true for you would be performing the same action over and over again and i see you are not or if you were using the same time without being in its power the sun would cease to move across the sky and i see it still moves given that you can release yourself from the influence of time why am i not conscious of it since that instrument he pointed at the dock exerts its influence over the entire city or again if it is a natural talent why are we in lanjis liho so busily concerned with categorizing and investigating our researches into the flow if you have mastered it so completely a broad smile crossed the face of mokof he shook his head i told youwe have no mastery over it the instrument merely tells us what time it is that is ridiculous the brooder said dazed his brain fought to retain its sanity there is only the present your words are illogical mokof stared at his face in concern are you unwell im well enough thank you for the trouble you have taken i will return to the tavern now before i lose all hold of sanity the clutter in his head was too much mokof made a state ment and then denied it in the same breath he decided he would cogitate it over a meal when he reached the tavern he found the door closed and no amount of banging could get those inside to open it he noticed that his saddle and saddlebags were resting outside and he knew he had some food in one of the bags so he sat on the bench and began to munch on a large hunk of bread suddenly from above him he heard a cry and looking up he saw an old womans head regarding him from a topstorey window ah she cried aah what are you doing why eating this piece of bread madame he said in sur prise filthy she shrieked filthy immoral pig really i fail to watch watch the old woman cried from the window very swiftly three armed men came running into the plaza they screwed up their faces in disgust when they saw the scar faced brooder a disgusting exhibitionist as well as a pervert said the leader they seized the startled brooder whats happening he gasped what have i done ask the judge snarled one of his captors and they hauled him towards the central plaza and took him to a tall house which appeared to be their headquarters there he was flung into a cell and they went away an overdressed youth in the next cell said with a grin greetings stranger whats your offence i have no idea said the brooder i merely sat down to have my lunch when all at once your lunch but it is not lunchtime for another ten minutes lunchtime you mean you set aside a special period to eat oh this is too much for me the overdressed youth drew away from the bars and went to the other side of his cell his nose wrinkling in disgust ugh you deserve the maximum penalty for a crime like that sadly puzzled the brooder sat down on his bench com pletely mystified and hopeless evidently the strange customs of these people were connected with their clock which seemed to be a virtual deity to them if the hands did not point to a certain figure when you did something then that act became an offence he wondered what the maximum penalty would be very much later the guards came to him and made him walk through a series of corridors and into a room where a man in a long purple gown wearing a metallic mask was seated at a carved table the guards made the brooder sit before the man and then they went and stood by the door the masked man said in a sonorous voice you have been accused of eating outside the proper hour and of doing it in a public place for all to see a serious charge what is your defence only that i am a stranger and do not understand your customs said the brooder a poor excuse where are you from from lanjis liho by the sea i have heard rumours of the immoralities practised there you will learn that you cannot bring your filthy habits to another city and hope to continue with them i will be lenient with you however and sentence you to one year in the antique mines but it is unjust unjust is it watch your tongue or i will extend the sentence depressed and without hope the brooder allowed the guards to take him back to his cell the night passed and morning came and then the guards arrived get up said the leader the judge wishes to see you again does he intend to increase my sentence after all ask him the judge was tapping his desk nervously as the brooder and his guards entered you know of machines in lanjis liho do you not you have some strange ones ive heard do you wish to be released i wish to be released of course yes we know something of machines but our great regulator is out of control i would not be sur prised if your crime did not provide the shock which caused it to behave erratically something has gone wrong with its life core and we may have to evacuate barbart if it cannot be adjusted we have forgotten our old knowledge of machines if you adjust the great regulator we shall let you go without it we do not know when to sleep eat or perform any of our other functions we shall go mad if we lose its guidance scarcely understanding the rest of the judges statement the brooder heard only the fact that he was to be released if he mended their machine on the other hand he had left lanjis liho for the very reason that the chronarch would not give him trust of any instruments he had little experience yet if it meant his release he would try when he arrived again in the central plaza he noted that the machine of burnished bronze the great regulator they called it was making a peculiar grumbling noise and shaking mightily around it trembling in unison stood a dozen old men waving their hands here is the man from lanjis liho called the guard they looked anxiously at the scarfaced brooder the lifecore it must certainly be the lifecore said an ancient tugging at his jerkin let me see said the scarfaced brooder not at all sure that he could be of help they wound off several of the machines outer plates and he stared through thick glass and looked at the luminous lifecore he had seen them before and knew a little about them he knew enough certainlyto understand that this should not be glow ing bright purple and showering particles with such constancy he knew suddenly that in an exceedingly short space of time one of these peoples minutes perhaps the lifecore would reach a critical state it would swell and burst from its confines and its radiation would destroy everything living but he ignored their shouts as he became lost in the problem he would need considerably longer than that if he was to deal with it soon he realized helplessly they would all be dead he turned to tell them this and then it struck him why could not he as he had guessed these citizens capable of recycle that moment personally since the previous day his mind had been trying to see the logic in what mokof had told him and using parts of things the chronarch had told him he had constructed an idea of what the process must be like experimentally he eased himself backwards in time yes it worked the core was now as he had first seen it he had never thought of doing this before but now he saw that it was easy requiring merely a degree of concentration he was grateful for the barbartians with their weird time device for giving him the idea all he had to do was to remember what the chronarch had taught him about the nature of timehow it constantly and imperceptibly to ordinary beings reformed its constituents to give it the apparently forward movement which affected so broadly the organization of matter shifting himself into the timearea he had occupied a short while before he began to study the temporal coordinates of the lifecore he could think of no physical means of stopping it but if he could in some manner lock it in time it would then cease to be a danger but he would still have to work speedily since sooner or later the temporal structure would fail to hold and he would sweep onwards losing time continuously until he was brought to the moment when the lifecore began to spread its radiation again and again he let himself drift up almost to the ultimate moment shifting himself backwards losing a few grains of time with every shift then at last he understood the temporal construction of the core with an effort of will he reduced the temporal coordinates to zero it could not progress through time it was frozen and no longer a danger he fell back into his normal timestream his body wet with sweat they crowded about him questioning in shrill excited voices what have you done what have you done are we safe you are safe he said they seized him thanking him with generous words his earlier crime forgotten you must be rewarded but he scarcely heard them as they bore him back to the judge for he was brooding on what he had just accomplished as a man might step backwards to regain lost ground he had stepped backwards to regain lost time he had his reward he was most grateful to these people now for with their weird ideas about time they had shown him that it was possible to exist at will in a point in timejust as it was possible to exist in a point in space it was he realized merely a matter of knowing such a thing was possible then it became easy the judge had doffed his mask and smiled his gratitude the wise men tell me that you worked a miracle they saw your body flickering like a candle flame disappearing and appearing constantly how did you achieve this he spread his hands it was extraordinarily simple until i came to barbart and saw the thing you call clock i did not realize the possibilities of moving through time as i could move through space it seemed to me that since you appeared capable of recycling the same period of time i could do likewise this i did then i studied the lifecore and saw that by manipula tion of its time structure i could fix it in a certain point thus arresting its progress so simpleand yet it might never have occurred to me if i had not come here the judge passed a hand over his puzzled eyes ah he said and now the brooder said cheerfully i thank you for your hospitality i intend to leave barbart immediately since i shall obviously never understand your customs i return to lanjis liho to tell the chronarch of my discoveries farewell he left the courtroom crossed the plaza through crowds of grateful citizens and was soon saddling urge and riding away from barbart in the land of fronds two days later he came upon the hooknosed wanderer grubbing in a ditch he had just dug greetings wanderer he called from the saddle the wanderer looked up wiping salty earth from his face oh tis you brooder i thought you had decided to journey to the land of fronds i did i went to barbart and there briefly the brooder explained what had happened aha nodded the wanderer so the chronarch is edu cating his people well after all i frankly considered what he was doing impossible but you have proved me wrong what do you mean i think i can tell you come into my tent and drink some wine willingly the brooder said dismounting from a plastic flask the wanderer poured wine into two cutglass goblets lanjis liho he said was founded in ancient times as an experimental village where newborn children were taken and educated according to the teachings of a certain philosopher called rashin rashin regarded peoples attitude towards time as being imposed on their consciousness by their method of recording and measuring itby the state of mind which said the past is the past and cannot be changed we cannot know what the future holds and so forth our minds he decided were biased and while we continued to think in this way we should never be free of the shackles of time it was he felt the most necessary shackle to cast off he said for instance that when the temperature becomes too hot a man devises a means of keeping himself cool when it rains he enters a shelter or devises a shelter he can transport with him if he comes to a river he builds a bridge or if to the seaa boat physical difficulties of a certain intensity can be overcome in a physical way but what if the difficulties intensify to the degree where physical means can no longer work against them the brooder shrugged we perishor find some means other than physical to combat them exactly rashin said that if time moves too swiftly for a man to accomplish what he desires he accepts the fact passively rashin thought that with reeducation man might rid himself of his reconception and take as easily to adjusting time to his requirements as he adjusts nature a nonphysical means you see i think i understand a little of what you mean said the scarfaced brooder but why is it necessary i wonder the question was rhetorical but the wanderer chose to answer on this world he said we must admit it man is an anachronism he has adapted to a degree but not sufficiently to the point where he could sustain himself without artifice the planet has never been particularly suitable for him of course but it has never been so inhospitable as now the chronarchy as i have said is a conscious experiment time and matter are both ideas matter makes a more im mediate impression on man but times effects are longer last ing therefore the chronarchy down the ages has sought to educate its people into thinking of time in a similar way as they think of matter in this way it has been possible to produce a science of time like the science of physics but it has only been possible to study time until now not manipulate it we may soon master time as we once mastered the atom and our mastery will give us far greater freedom than did our nuclear science time may be explored as our ancestors ex plored space your descendants scarfaced brooder shall be heir to continents of time as we have continents of space they shall travel about in time the old view of past present and future abolished even now you regard these in an entirely different lightmerely as convenient classifications for the study of time that is true he nodded i had never considered them anything else but now i am unsure what to do for i fled to barbart originally to settle and forget lanjis liho where i went unhonoured the wanderer smiled a little i do not think you will go unhonoured now my friend he said the brooder saw the point and smiled also perhaps not he agreed the wanderer sipped his wine your journeyings in space are all but ended anyway for space is becoming increasingly hostile to man and will soon refuse to sustain him however much he adapts physically you and your like must enter the new dimensions youve discovered and dwell there go back to lanjis liho of your birth and tell the chronarch what you did in barbart show him what you did and he will wel come you your reason for leaving no longer exists you are the first of the time dwellers and i salute you as the salva tion of mankind the wanderer drained his glass somewhat overwhelmed by this speech the brooder bade the wanderer farewell and thick blood left the tent and climbed upon the back of urge the wanderer stood beside the tent smiling at him one day you must tell me how you did it he said it is such a simple thing you just live through the same period of time instead of different ones perhaps this is just the start and soon i will be able to explore further abroad or is the word atime but now i will be off for im impatient to tell my news to the chronarch the wanderer watched him ride away feeling a trifle like the last dinosaur must have felt so many millions of years before once again the scarfaced brooder rode along the seashore staring over the sluggish waves at the brown sky beyond salt shone everywhere across the land perhaps heralding an age where crystalline lifeforms would develop in conditions absolutely unsuitable for animal life as he knew it yes the period when man must change his environment radically had come if man were to survive at all the earth would cease to support him soon the sun cease to warm him he had the choice of living for a while in artificial conditions such as the moonites already did or of completely changing his environment from a physical one to a temporal one definitely the latter was the better choice as the sky darkened over the sea he took out his torch depressed the handle and sent a great blaze of light spreading across the inhospitable earth the first of the time dwellers goaded his sealbeast into a faster pace impatient to tell the chronarch his welcome news impatient to begin the exploration of a new environment escape from evening on moon it was white like ice an endless series of blocks and spikes like an ancient cubist painting but white glaring though the sun was almost dead a red featureless disc in the dark sky in his artificial cavern full of synthetic meaningless things that contained no mythology or mood pepin hunchback bent over his book so that the tears from his eyes fell upon the plastic pages and lay there glistening of all the things that the glass cavern contained pumps and pipes and flinching dialsonly pepin had warmth his twisted body was athrob with life and large emotions his imagination was alive and active as each word in the book sparked off great chords of yearning within him his narrow face utterly pale save for the bright black eyes was intense his clumsy hands moved to turn the pages he was dressed as were all his fellow moonites in clothofmetal which with a helmet fitted to its hauberk protected his life from an im possibility the threat of the system collapsing the system was moons imitation of life it aped an older earth than that which now existed far away barely visible in space it aped its plants and its animals and its elementsfor the system was moons artificial ecology moon was a planet of goodish sizehad been for centuries since it had ceased to be earths satellite and had drifted into the asteroids and attracted many of them to itself and pepin hated the system for what it was pepin was a throwback unsuited to his present time or space pepins life was not the system for with just that he would have died it was his imagination his sorrow and his ambition fed by his few old books he read the familiar pages and realized again that the intel lect had triumphed over the spirit and both had conquered emotion the men of moon at least had become as barren as their accident of a planet pepin knew much of earth as his peoples traders had des cribed it knew that it was changing and was no longer as it was when his books were written yet still he yearned to go there and see if he could find some trace of what he needed though he would only know what he needed when he found it for some time he had planned to visit earth and his people were willing that he should go if he did not return for he dis comfited them his namehis true namewas on the list close to the top soon a ship would be ready for him his true name was p karr now he thought of the ship and decided to go to the list he went to the list infrequently for in his atavism he was supersti tious and believed completely that the more he looked at it the less chance there would be of his name being at the top pepin jerked his body off his stool and slammed the book shut on the hushed world of moon he made as much noise as he could he limped more evidently highshouldered now that he was moving towards the door section of his dome he took down his helmet and fitted it on to his shoulders activated the door section and crossed the sharp bright ground covering the dis tance between himself and the city by choice and to the relief of his people he lived outside the city on the surface there was little to see of the city merely a storey or two perhaps three in places all the prominences were square and transparent to absorb as much energy from the waning sun as possible another door section in one of the buildings opened to him and he went inside hardly realizing that he had left the surface he entered a funnel containing a discshaped platform and the platform began to fall downwards slowing as it reached the bottom here the light was completely artificial and the walls were of metal plain undecorated tubes twice the height of a tall thin moonite pepin was not typical of his race he limped along this tube for a short distance until the floor began to move he let it carry him through the labyrinthine intestines of the city until he came to the hall he wanted the hall was quite unpopulated until pepin entered it had a domed ceiling and was covered by screens charts indicators conveying every item of information which a citizen might require to know in the daytoday life of the city pepin went to the list craning his head to look at it he started at the bottom and followed the list of names up his name was at the top he must go immediately to ship controller and apply for his ship if he did not his name would go back to the bottom according to regulations as he turned to leave the hall another moonite entered his helmet was flung back lying against his shoulder blades his golden hair was long and his thin face smiled this was g nak the greatest of the traderpilots and he did not need to look at the list for he had a permanent ship of his own the population of moon was small and g nak knew pepin as well as anyone he stopped sharply arms akimbo and contemplated the list so you journey to earth p karr you will find it decadent and unpleasant take plenty of foodyou will not like their salty grub thank you bobbed pepin as he left as if mutated by their constant contact with the mother planet only the ships of moon had character they were burnished and patterned with fancifully wrought images ancient animals prowled along their hulls gargoyles glowered from indentations created by heavily moulded figures of famous men tentacled hands curled themselves over the curves like the arms of wrecked sailors clinging to spars or else like the protective hands of a shebaboon about her young the ships were so heavily decorated that in the light they looked like frozen lava all lumps and gulleys in obsidian or brass pepin luggage on back paused before he put foot on the short moving ramp which would deliver him to the entrance of his allotted ship he allowed himself time to study the raised images then stepped upon the ramp and was whisked up to the airlock which opened for him the inside of the ship was very cramped and consisted mainly of cargo space the cargo which would go with pepin and be delivered to an earthcity called barbart was already stowed pepin lowered himself on to the couch where he would spend the journey after pepin and cargo had been delivered the ship would return as it had left automatically a whisper of noise hushed like all moon sounds warned him that the ship was about to takeoff he braced himself felt no sensation as the ship rose on course for earth the bright ship sped through the soft darks of weary space a bold spark intruding the blackness it flickered along its path until at length pepins screen picked up the growing globe of earthbrown yellow and white turning slowly in the scant warmth of the dormant sun the planet seemed vaguely unreal perhaps because it was imperfectly focused on the screen yet the stuff of space seemed to drift through it as if the planets very fabric was worn thin pepin felt the hard metal rocket would not stop when it reached earth but tear through it easily and continue on into empty space where more vital stars pulsed at one time pepin knew the universe had been even thicker with bright stars and even his own sun had possessed more than the three planets that now circled it silently the ship went into orbit easing itself by stages into the atmosphere down through the clear purple sky down into the brown cloudbanks that hung close to the ground through the clouds until it had levelled out again and moved with decreasing speed across sluggish seas and wastes of dark yellow brown and black studded by great white patches of salt much further inland grey moss became apparent and later the waving light green of the fragile fronds that marked what earths inhabitants called the land of fronds in the land of fronds were two principal cities two towns and a village bar bart the trading port between moon and earth lay in a gentle valley the hills were covered in fronds that from above seemed like a rolling sea more sealike than the saltheavy waters far to the east barbart was laid out precisely in quadrangles triangles and starshaped plazas the roofs of the low houses were of dark green and brickbrown yet seemed brightly coloured com pared with their surroundings the ship passed over the huge redgold machine which rose high above the other buildings this pepin knew was called the great regulator and supplied necessary power to the city behind the great regulator in the citys central plaza was a cradlepad ready for his ship it hovered and then dropped down on to the cradlepad pepin shivered suddenly and did not rise immediately but watched his screen as people began to enter the plaza moving speedily towards the ship barbart was the city most like those he had read about in his books it was considerably smaller than the golden age cities had been and resembled best a medieval italian city from the ground even the frondcovered hills might be a forest of oaks and elms if they were not looked at closely also pepin knew that the folk of barbart were quite similar to the ancient folk of earth yet he could not convince himself though he tried that he had returned to the earth of his books for one thing the light was fainter the air darker the drifting brown clouds unlike any that had existed in earths past pepin was not as disappointed as he expected whatever deficiencies existed here at least the planet was natural and pepin placed much value on the naturalness of things the airlock had opened and the barbartians grouped them selves outside it waiting for the pilot to appear pepin took up his luggage from beside the couch swung his wellshaped legs to the floor and limped out of the cabin and through the airlock the heavy brineladen air halfchoked him the smell of salt was so marked that he felt faintly sick he swung his helmet up so that it enclosed his head he turned on his emer gency oxygen supply deciding to give himself time to adjust the merchants of barbart stood around the ramp leading from the cradlepad they looked at him eagerly may we inspect the cargo pilot enquired a heavy shouldered man with broad cheekbones and a flaking skin halfinvisible beneath his thick black beard he wore a quilted coat belted at his chest this was a rusty black a white stock was tied at his throat and he wore baggy yellow trousers tucked into furry boots pepin looked at him wanting to greet him in some manner that would convey the pleasure he felt at seeing a human being of heavy build with muscles and flaws on his skin pilot said the merchant pepin began to limp slowly down the ramp he stood aside to let the bulky merchant move up it and duck his head to enter the airlock three others followed him glancing rather quizzically at the silent moonite a man smaller than pepin with the narrow face of a reptile dressed in dull red and black sidled up clutching a hand written list fascinated pepin looked at it not understanding the words he would like to have taken off his gauntlets and fingered the parchment but he would wait for a little pilot when do you return pepin smiled i do not return i have come to live here the man was startled he took the parchment back and turned his head did not see what he looked for and gazed up the ramp towards the open airlock then be welcome he said absently still not looking at pepin he excused himself and walked with short rapid steps back to the warehouse at the side of the plaza pepin waited until the merchant and his friends reappeared they looked satisfied and were nodding to one another the blackbearded merchant bustled down the ramp and slapped pepins arm i admit it he grinned a very generous cargo we have the best of this months bargain i think gold and alcohol for our fertilizers may i begin unloading as you wish pepin said courteously wondering at this man who could delight in receiving such useless things in return for valuable fertilizers you are new said the merchant taking pepins arm and leading him towards the warehouse where the other man had gone what do you think of our city it is wonderful sighed pepin i admire it i should like to live here ha ha with all those marvels and comforts in moon you have youd miss them after a while pilot and every year we hear of cities dying populations shrinking fewer children than ever being born no i envy you moonites with your safety and stability you dont have to worry about the future for you can plan efficiently but we here can make no plans we merely hope that things will not alter too much in our own lifetimes at least you are part of the natural order sir pepin said hesitantly you might adapt further as the earth changes the merchant laughed again no we of earth will all be dead we accept this now the human race has had a long run no one would have expected us to last this time but soon the point will be reached where we can adapt no longer it is already happening in less fortunate areas man is dying out on earth yet while you have your system that is not possible on moon but our system is artificial your planet is natural they reached the warehouse men were already folding back the heavy doors the casks of fertilizer were stacked in a cool dark corner of the place the man with the reptile face glanced at pepin as he counted the casks there is the matter of the pilots gift said the merchant the traditional gift of gratitude to the man who brings the cargo safely to us is there anything we have which you desire traditionally the pilot asked for a small token gift of no great value and pepin knew what was expected of him you mine antiques in barbart i believe he said politely yes it provides employment for our criminals forty cities have stood where barbart now stands pepin smiled with pleasure such history i am fond of books he said books the merchant frowned why yes we have a stack of those somewhere have the folk of moon taken to reading ha ha you do not read them yourselves a lost art pilot those ancient languages are impossible we have no scholars in barbart save for our eldersand their wisdom comes from here he tapped his head not from any books weve little use for the old knowledgeit was a knowledge suitable for a younger earth though pepin understood he felt a pang of sorrow and disappointment intellectually he had known that the folk of earth would not be like his idealized picture of them yet emotionally he could not accept this then i would like some books he said as many as your ship has room for when our cargos loaded promised the merchant what language do you read in ill let you sort them out for yourself i read in all the ancient tongues said pepin proudly his fellows thought his a useless skill and it probably was but he did not care he added and there is no need to load them i shall not be returning with the ship that will go back to moon auto matically youll not be are you then to be some sort of permanent representative of moon on earth no i wish to live on earth as one of her folk the merchant scratched his nose aha i see aha is there reason why i should not be welcome oh no no i was merely astonished that you should elect to stay with us i gather you moonites regard us as primitives doomed to die with the planet his tone was now mildly resent ful your regulations admitting no one of earth to moon have been strict for centuries no earthman has visited moon even you have your stability to consider of course but why should you elect to suffer the discomforts of our wasted planet you will note said pepin carefully that i am not like other moonites i am i suppose some sort of romantic throw backor it may be that my original difference has fostered mental differences i do not know however i alone amongst my race have an admiration for earth and the folk of earth i have a yearning for the past whereas my people look always to the futurea future which they are pledged to keep stable and as much like the present as possible i see the merchant folded his arms well you are welcome to stay here as a guestuntil you wish to return to moon i never wish to return my friend the merchant smiled you will wish to return soon enough spend a month with usa yearbut i warrant youll stay no longer he paused before saying youll find plenty of signs of the past herefor the past is all we have there is no future for earth the clock centrepiece of the great regulator had measured off six weeks before pepin hunchback became restless and frustrated by the uncaring ignorance of the barbartians the citizens were pleasant enough and treated him well considering their covert antipathy towards the moonites but he made no friends and found no sympathizers he rejoiced in those books which were not technical manuals or technical fiction he enjoyed the poetry and the legends and the history books and the adventure stories but there were fewer than he had expected and did not last him long he lived in a room at an inn he grew used to the heavy briny air and the dull colours he began to enjoy the gloom which shadowed the earth for it mirrored something of his own mood he would go for walks over the hills and watch the heavy brown clouds course towards him from the horizon smell the sweetish scent of the frond forests climb the crumb ling rocks that stood against the purple sky worn by the wind and scoured by the salt unlike moon this planet still lived still held surprises in the sudden winds that blew its surface the odd animals which crawled over it pepin was afraid only of the animals for these had become truly alien the principal lifeform other than man was the oozera giant leech which normally prowled the bleak sea shores but which was being seen increasingly further inland if mans time was ending then the time of the oozer was beginning as man died out the oozer multiplied they moved in schools varying from a dozen to a hundred depending on the speciesthey grew from two feet to ten feet long some were blade some brown some yellowbut the most disgusting was the white variety which was also the largest and most ferocious a great grub of a thing capable of fast speeds able to outdistance a running man and bring him down when this hap pened the oozer like its leech ancestor fed off the blood only and left the body drained and dry pepin saw a school moving through a glade once as he sat on a rock staring down into the frond forest the new tenants he said aloud after hed conquered his nausea are arriving and the earth ignores man she is not hostile she is not friendly she no longer supports him she has forgotten him now she fosters new children pepin was given to talking to himself it was the only time when words came easilywhen he was alone pepin tried to talk with kop the merchant and his fellow resi dents at the inn but though they were polite enough his ques tions his statements and his arguments made them frown and puzzle and excuse themselves early one fellow resident a mildmannered and friendly man called mokof middleaged with a slight stoop made greater attempts to understand pepin but was incapable rather than unwilling of helping him with your talk of the past and philosophy you would be happier in that odd city of lanjis liho by the sea he said pleasantly one day as they sat outside the inn tankards at their sides watching the fountain play in the plaza pepin had heard lanjis liho mentioned but had been so curious about other matters that he had not asked of the city before now he raised one fair nearinvisible eyebrow i once knew a man from lanjis liho mokof continued in answer he had a strange name which i forgetit was similar to your last name in type he had a scar on his face got into trouble by eating his food at the wrong time saved himself by fixing the great regulator for us we know nothing of these machines these days he believed that he could travel in time though i saw little evidence of this while he was here all the folk of lanjis liho are like him i hearbizarre if you follow methey know nothing of clocks for instance have no means of measuring the hours their ruler is called chronarch and he lives in a palace called the house of time though only an oozer knows why they should emphasize time when they cant even tell it mokof could tell pepin very little more that was not merely opinion or speculation but lanjis liho by the sea sounded an interesting place also pepin was attracted by the words time travel for his true wish was to return to earths past during the seventh week of his stay in barbart he decided to journey eastwards towards lanjis liho by the sea pepin hunchback set off on foot for lanjis liho mokof in particular tried to dissuade him it was a long journey and the land was dangerous with oozers he could easily lose his direction without a good steed but he had tried to ride the sealbeasts which were the mounts of most earthmen these creatures with their strongly muscled forefins and razorsharp tails were reliable and fairly fast they had builtup saddles of silicon to give the rider a straight seat part of their equipment also included a long gun called a piercer which fired a ray from its ruby core and a torch fed by batteries which supplied the traveller with light in the moonless nearstarless night pepin hunchback took a torch and balanced a piercer over his shoulder he liked the feeling both gave him but he did not trust himself to a sealbeast he left in the dark morning with food and a flask in the pack on his back still dressed in his clothofmetal suit the citizens of barbart like those of moon were not regret ful when he had gone he had disturbed them when they believed they had conquered all disturbances within themselves for seven weeks he had interrupted their purpose and the pur pose they wished to transmit to any children they might have that purpose was to die peacefully and generously on an earth which no longer desired their presence pepin was disappointed as he limped away from barbart in the land of fronds he had expected to find dynamic vitality on earth people prepared for change but not for death some where on the planet possibly in lanjis liho by the seahe would find heroes from what mokof had hinted he might even find a means of travelling into the past this is what he wanted most but he had never expected to achieve it the moss of the frond forests was springy and helped his walking but by evening it was beginning to give way to hard brown earth over which dust scurried ahead of him ominous in the waning light was a barren plain cracked and almost featureless here and there chunks of rock stood up he selected one as his goal realizing even as night fell cold and pitch dark that to sleep would be to risk his life oozers he had been told only slept when they had fedand there was little to feed on save man he depressed the grip of his torch and its light illuminated a distance of a few yards round him he continued to walk warm enough in his suit as he walked his mind became almost blank he was so weary that he could not tell how long he had marched by the degrees of weariness but when a silhouette of rock became apparent in the torchlight he stopped took off his pack leant his back against the rock and slid down it he did not care about the oozers and he was fortunate because no oozers scented his blood and came to care about him dawn came dark brown the muddy clouds streaming across the sky blocking out much of the suns dim light pepin opened his pack and took out the flask of specially distilled fresh water he could not drink the saltwater which the folk of earth drank they in turn had adapted to the extent where they could not bear to drink fresh water he took two tablets from a box and swallowed them having breakfasted he heaved his aching body up adjusted the pack on his back slung the torch into its sheath at his side shouldered the piercer and looked about him in the west the frond forests were out of sight and the plain looked as endless in that direction as it did in the other yet the plain to the east was now further broken by low hills and many more rocks he set off eastwards in the east he reflected our ancestors believed paradise lay perhaps i will find my paradise in the east if paradise existed and pepin was entitled to enter he came very close to entering two days later as he collapsed descending a saltencrusted hill and rolled many feet down it knocking himself unconscious as it was the hooknosed wanderer saved him from this chance of paradise the hooknosed wanderer was a burrower a gossiper a quester after secrets amongst all the earth folk he was perhaps the only aimless nomad no one knew his origin no one thought to ask he was as familiar in barbart as he was in lanjis liho his knowledge of earth past and present was extensive but few ever availed themselves of it he was a short man with a huge nose receding chin and a closefitting hood and jerkin which made him resemble a beaked turtle he saw the fallen tangle that was pepin hunchback at much the same time as the school of oozers scented pepins blood he was riding a big fat sealbeast and leading another on which was heaped a preposterous burden of rolled fabric dig ging equipment a small stove angular bundlesin fact the hooknosed wanderers entire household tied precariously to the sealbeasts back the sealbeast seemed mildly pleased with itself that it was capable of carrying this load in the hooknosed wanderers right hand borne like a lance resting in a special grip on his stirrup was his piercer he saw pepin he saw the oozers he rode closer raised his piercer pressed the charger and then the triggerstud the concentrated light was scarcely visible but it bit into the oozer school instantaneously they were of the black variety the hooknosed wanderer moved the piercer about very gradually and burned every oozer to death it gave him satisfaction then he rode up to where pepin lay and looked down at him pepin was not badly hurt he was even beginning to stir on the ground the hooknosed wanderer saw that he was a moonite by his dress he wondered where pepin had got the piercer and torch which lay near him he dismounted and helped the moonite to his feet pepin rubbed his head and looked rather nervously at the hooknosed wanderer i fell down he said just so said the hooknosed wanderer where is your spaceship has it crashed nearby i have no spaceship pepin explained i was journeying from barbart where i landed some seven weeks ago to lanjis liho which i am told lies close to the shores of the sea you were foolish to go on foot said the wanderer it is still a long way he continued eagerly but you must guest with me and we will talk about moon i should be happy to add to my know ledge pepins head was aching he was glad that this odd stranger had come upon him he agreed willingly and even tried to help the wanderer raise his tent when the tent was finally erected and the wanderers goods distributed about it pepin and he went inside the wanderer offered him legfish and saltwater but pepin refused politely and swallowed his own food then he told the wanderer of his coming from moon to earth of his stay in barbart of his frustration and disappoint ment and of his ambition the wanderer listened asking ques tions that showed he was more interested in moon than pepin listlessly pepin replied to these questions and then asked one of his own what do you know of lanjis liho sir everything but the most recent events said the wanderer with a smile lanjis liho is very ancient and has its origin in an experimental village where a philosopher tried to educate people to regard time as they regard matter something that can be moved through manipulated and so on from this the chronarchy was formed and it became traditional in lanjis liho to investigate time and little else perhaps by mutation perhaps by the awakening of some power we have always possessed a race of people exist in lanjis liho who can move themselves through time i had the good fortune to know the young man who first discovered this talent within himself and trained others in its use a man called the scarfaced brooderhe is the present chronarch he can travel into the past and future so i hear once the chronopathic talent is released in man he can move through time at will but the past said pepin excitedly we can journey back to earths golden age and not worry about natural death or artificial living we can do things um said the wanderer i share your love for the past pepin hunchback my tent is full of antiques i have excavated but is it possible to return to the past would not that act change the futurefor there is no record in our history of men from the future settling in the past pepin nodded it is a mystery yet surely one man who did not admit he was from the future could settle in the past the hooknosed wanderer smiled i see what you mean i realize now said pepin seriously that i have little in common with either my own people or the folk of earth my only hope is to return to the past where i shall find the things i need to exist fully i am a man out of my time you are not the first earths ancient history is full of such men but i shall be the first perhaps able to find the age which most suits him perhaps said the hooknosed wanderer dubiously but your wishes are scarcely constructive are they not what then has this earth to offer mankind we on moon live an artificial life turning year by year into machines less perfect than those which support us and you here accept death passively are only concerned with the business of facing extinction well my race will not be human within a century yours will not exist are we to perish are the values of humanity to perishhave the strivings of the last million years been pointless is there no escape from earths evening i will not accept that you are not logical my friend smiled the wanderer you take the least positive line of allby refusing to face the future by your desire to return to the past how will that benefit the rest of us pepin clutched his head ah he murmured ah the hooknosed wanderer continued i have no wish to survive the evening you have seen something of the horrors which will multiply as earths evening turns to night pepin did not reply he had become inarticulate with emotion the hooknosed wanderer took him outside and pointed into the east that way lies lanjis liho and her chronopaths he said i pity you pepin for i think you will find no solution to your problem and it is your problem not humanitys pepin limped from weariness as well as deformity he limped along a beach it was morning and the dull red sun was rising slowly from the sea as he moved down the dark shore towards lanjis liho it was cold greybrown mist hung over the sea and drifted towards the bleak landscape that was dominated by the solid black outline of cliffs to his right the brown beach glistened with patches of hard salt and the saltsluggish sea was motionless for there was no longer a nearby moon to move it pepin still considered his conversation with the strange wan derer was this the end of earth or merely one phase in a cycle night must comebut would it be followed by a new day if so then perhaps the future was attractive yet the earth had slowly destroyed the greater part of the human race would the rest die before the new morning suddenly pepin slipped into a pool of thick water he floundered in the clinging stuff dragging himself back by clutching a spur of hardened salt but the salt wouldnt bear his weight and he fell into the pool again finally he crawled back to dry land everything was crumbling or changing he continued along the shore more carefully legfish scuttled away as he approached they sought the deeper shadow of the crags of rock which rose from the beach like jagged teeth corroded by windborne salt they hid and were silent and the whole shore was quiet pepin hunchback found no peace of mind here but the solitude seemed to absorb his tangled thoughts and eased his brain a little the disc of the sun took a long time to rise above the horizon and brought little light with it and even less warmth he paused and turned to stare over the sea which changed from black to brown as the sun came up he sighed and looked at the sun which caught his face in its dull glow and stained it a deep pink bringing a look of radiance to his native pallor later he heard a sound which he first took to be the squawk ing of fighting legfish then he recognized it as a human voice without moving his head he listened more intently then he turned a tiny figure sat a seal on the cliff above jutting upwards from it like a lance was the barrel of a long piercer the figure was halfshadowed by the ruin of an ancient watchtower and as he looked jerked at the reins impatiently disappeared into the whole shadow and was gone pepin frowned and wondered if this could be an enemy he readied his own piercer now the rider had descended the cliff and was nearing him he heard the distant thwack of the beasts fins against the damp beach he levelled the gun the rider was a woman a woman from out of his books she was tall longlegged with the collar of her sealleather jacket raised to frame her sharpjawed face her brown hair drifted over it and flew behind one hand protected by a loose fitting glove clutched the pommel of her high silicon saddle the other held her beasts reins her wide fulllipped mouth seemed pursed by the cold for she held it tight then her seal entered a deep pool of sluggish water and began swimming through it with great difficulty the strong smell of the brinethick liquid came to his awareness then and he saw her as a woman out of mythologya mermaid astride a seal yet she frightened him she was unexpected was she from lanjis liho it was likely and were they all like her now as she reached firm ground again she began to laugh in rhythm with the seals movement it was rich delightful laughter but as she came towards him the heavy drops of water rolling slowly from her mount his stomach contracted in panic he backed away a few paces at this moment she seemed to personify the bleak insanity of the dying planet she halted her beast close to him she lowered her chin and opened her greygreen eyes she still smiled stranger you are from moon by your garb are you lost he put the piercer over his shoulder no i seek lanjis liho she pointed backwards up the beach you are close to our city i am tall laugher sister to the scarfaced brooder chronarch of the city of time i will take you there i am pepin hunchback without kin or rank climb up on my sealbeasts back hang on to my saddle and we will soon be in lanjis liho he obeyed her clinging desperately to the slippery silicon as she wheeled the seal about and sped back the way she had come she called to him once or twice on the journey up the salty beach but he could not make out the sense it had begun to rain a little before they reached lanjis liho built upon a huge and heavy cliff the city was smaller even than barbart but its houses were towerlike slim and ancient with conical roofs and small windows lanjis liho was domi nated by the tower of time which rose from a building called according to tall laughers shouted description the hall of time palace of the chronarch both hall and tower were impressive though puzzling their design was an impossibility of curves and angles bright colours bordering on the indefinable and creating an emotion in pepin similar to the emotion created in him by pictures of gothic architecture though whereas gothic took the mind soaring upwards this took the mind in all directions the pale sun shone down on the city streets and the saltrain fell washing the gleaming salt deposits off the walls and roofs and leaving fresh ones the drops even fell between the blades and domes of the hall and tower of time there were few people in the streets and yet there seemed to be an air of activity about the city almost as if the people were preparing to abandon it although quite similar in their various types to the folk of barbart these people seemed livelier eager pepin wondered if he had arrived at a festival time as tall laugher reined in her beast on the corner of a narrow street he clambered down his bones throbbing she also dismounted and pointed at the nearest house this is where i live since you claimed no rank i gather you have come here as a visitor and not as an official emissary from moon what do you seek in lanjis liho transport to the past he said at once she paused why should you want that i have nothing in common with the present she looked at him through her cool intelligent eyes then she smiled there is nothing in the past that would attract you let me decide very well she shrugged but how do you propose to find the past i his momentary confidence disappeared i had hoped for your help you will have to speak with the chronarch when she looked at him frowning slightly she did not seem un sympathetic come she said we will go to the hall of time now as pepin followed the girl walking quickly to keep up with her long strides he wondered if perhaps the people of lanjis liho were bent on keeping the secrets of time to themselves though they glanced at him curiously as they passed him the citizens did not pause the mood of hurried activity seemed even stronger as they reached the spiralling steps which led upwards to the great gates of the hall the guards did not challenge them as they entered an echoing corridor the tall walls of which were decorated with peculiar cryptographs inlaid in silver bronze and platinum ahead of them were doubledoors of yellow gold tall laugher pushed against these and they entered a large oblong wall with a high ceiling at the far end on a dais was a seated man talking to a couple of others who turned as tall laugher and pepin hunchback entered the seated man smiled calmly as he saw tall laugher he murmured to the other two who left by a door at the side of the dais the mans pale face bore a scar running from the left corner of his mouth along his cheekbone his black hair swept from a widows peak to his wide shoulders he wore clothes that did not suit him evidently the clothes of his office his shirt was of yellow cloth and his cravat knotted high at his chin was black he wore a longsleeved jacket of quilted blue velvet and breeches of winered his feet were shod in black slippers the hall itself was strange at regular intervals the walls were set alternately with symbolic mosaics and computers behind the seated man close to the far wall which was blank was a metal bench bearing the ancient tools of alchemy they seemed in bizarre contrast to the rest of the hall well tall laugher said the man who is this visitor he is from moon brooder and seeks to journey into the past the scarfaced brooder chronarch of lanjis liho laughed and then looking sharply at pepin stopped pepin said eagerly i have heard that you can travel in time at will this is true yes said the brooder but do you plan to go backward or forward the scarfaced brooder seemed nonplussed forward i supposebut what makes you think you have the ability for travelling in time ability it is a special skill only the folk of lanjis liho possess it have you no machines pepin demanded his spirits sinking we do not need machines our skill is natural but i must return to the pasti must pepin limped towards the dais ignoring the restraining hand of the tall laugher you want no one else to share your chance of escape you must know much about time you must know how to help me return to the past it would do you no good if you went back how do you know we know said the chronarch bleakly my friend give up this obsession there is nothing we can do for you in lanjis liho you are lying pepin changed his tone and said more levelly i beg you to help me ii need the past as others need air to survive you speak from ignorance what do you mean i mean that the secrets of time are more complex than you believe the chronarch stood up now i must leave you i have a mission in the future he frowned as if concentrating and vanished pepin was startled where has he gone into the future to join others of our folk he will return soon i hope come pepin hunchback i will take you to my house and let you eat and rest there after that if youll accept my advice you had best arrange to go back to moon you must be able to construct a machine he shouted there must be a way i must return return she said raising an eyebrow return how can you return to somewhere you have never been come she led the way out of the hall pepin hunchback had calmed down by the time he had eaten a little of the salty food in tall laughers house they sat in a small room with a bay window which overlooked the street he sat on one side of a table she on the other he did not speak his mood had become apathetic she seemed sympathetic and he was attracted to her for the qualities which he had first noted on the beach and for her warm womanliness but his despair was greater he stared at the table his twisted body bent over it his hands stretched out in front of him your yearning pepin hunchback is not for the past as it was she was saying softly it is for a world that never existed a paradise a golden age men have always spoken of such a time in historybut such an idyllic world is a yearning for childhood not the past for lost innocence it is childhood we wish to return to he looked up and smiled bitterly my childhood was not idyllic he said i was a mistake my birth was an accident i had no friends no peace of mind you had your wonderment your illusion your hopes even if you could return to earths pastyou would not be happy earths present is decadent here the decadence is part of the process of evolution on moon it is artificial that is all earths past was never truly decadent one cannot recapture the past an old saying yet your ability disproves that you do not know pepin hunchback she said almost sadly even if you used the ship you could not ship a time craft an earlier cruder experiment we abandoned we have no need of such devices now it still exists yes it stands behind the hall of time she spoke vaguely her thoughts on something else afraid that shewould soon guess what was in his mind pepin changed the subject maybe you are right tall laugher old earth has none to love her any longerher appearance does not inspire love if i am the last who loves earth then i should stay with her part of him meant what he said he realized the words had come spontaneously he had never considered this before she had only halfheard his words she gave him a slightly startled look as he spoke she rose from the table i will show you to your room she said you need sleep he pretended to agree and followed her out there would be no sleep now he must seize his opportunity outside inthe fading light of evening lay a time craft soon perhaps he could return to the past to security to a green golden earth leaving this tired ball of salt forever there was enough light coming from the houses to show him the way through the twisting streets to the tower of time he was unobserved as he circled around the great building searching for the ship which tall laugher had said was there at last halfseen in shadows he noticed a shape lying in a small square at the back of the tower resting in davits was a ship of cold blue metal it could only be the time craft it was large enough to contain three or four men several other machines stood nearby showing signs of neglect pepin limped cautiously forward until he stood by the ship he touched it it swayed slightly and the davits squealed pepin tried to steady it looking nervously around him but no one had noticed the ship was roughly eggshaped with a small airlock in its side running his hand over it pepin found a stud which he pressed the outer door slid open with considerable difficulty pepin managed to heave him self into the violently swinging ship the noise of the squealing davits was ghastly he shut the door and crouched in the utter blackness of the interior as it swayed back and forth it was likely that a lightstud was near the door his search ing hand found a projection and hesitated then risking the possibility that it was not for the light he pressed it the light came on it was a bluish mellow light but it served adequately to show the interior of the ship there were no seats and most of the machinery seemed hidden behind squat casings at the centre of the ship was a column on which was set at hand height four controls the ship was still swaying as pepin went over to the controls and inspected them his life on moon had made him very familiar with all kinds of machinery and he noted that the system of measurement was the same the largest dial was in the middle a division on the right was marked with a minus sign and on the left with a plus sign obviously indicat ing past and future yet pepin had expected such a control to be marked off with dates there were none instead there were figuresunits from one to ten one trip however was all he would need in order to equate these numbers with the actual period of time they measured another dial seemed to indicate speed a switch was marked emergency return and another mysteriously megaflow tuner now all pepin had to discover was whether the ship was still powered he limped over to another bank of instruments there was a lever set into it at the moment the indicator on its handle said off his heart beating rapidly pepin pushed the lever down a light flashed on the indicator and now it read on an almost inaudible humming came from the bank of instruments as needles swung and screens gleamed pepin returned to the column and put his large hand on the central dial it moved easily to the right he left it at the ship no longer swung on its davits there was no sen sation of speed but the banks of instruments began to click and whirr noisily and pepin felt suddenly dizzy the ship was moving backwards in time soon he would be in the past at last perhaps it was something to do with the ships motion the eruptions of colour which blossomed and faded on the screens or the weird sounds of the instruments that made pepin become almost hysterical he began to laugh with joy he had suc ceeded his ambition was close to fruition at last the sounds died down the sensation of sickness left him the ship no longer seemed to move pepin trembled as he raised his helmet and set it over his head he knew enough to realize that the air of an earlier earth would probably be too rich for him at first this action saved his life he went to the door and pressed the stud to open it the door moved backwards slowly and pepin stepped into the air lock the door closed pepin opened the outer door he looked out at absolutely nothing a lightless void lay around the ship no stars no planets nothing at all where was he had the ships instruments been faulty had he been borne into an area of space so far away from any material body he felt vertigo seize him backed into the airlock for as far as he could go frightened that the vacuum would suck him into itself he closed the outer door and returned to the ship in panic he went to the control column and again twisted the dial this time to again the screens filled with colour again lights blinked and needles swung again he felt sick again the ship came to a stop more cautiously he opened the inner door closed it opened the outer door nothing shouting inarticulately he hurried back into the ship and turned the dial to io the same sensations another stop and outside was the same featureless pit of empty space there was only one thing left to do to test the ship set the dial for the future and see what lay there if it was the same he could switch to emergency return he swung the dial right round to the humming rose to a shrill lightning exploded on the screens the needles sped around the dials and pepin flung him self to the floor in panic as his head began to ache horribly the ship seemed to be tossed from side to side and yet he remained in the same position on the floor at last the ship came to a halt he got up slowly passed through the airlock he saw everything he saw goldflecked bands of blue spiralling away into infinity he saw streamers of cerise and violet light he saw heaving mountains of black and green he saw clouds of orange and purple shapes formed and melted it seemed he was a giant at one moment and a midget at the next his mind was not equipped to take in so much quickly he shut the airlock what had he seen a vision of chaos the sight seemed to him to have been metaphysical rather than physical but what had it signified it had been the very opposite of the vacuum it had been space filled with everything imaginable or the components of everything the ship could not be a time craft after all but a vessel for journeyingwhere another dimension an alternate universe but why the plus and minus signs on the controls why had tall laugher called this a time ship had he been tricked he pushed back his helmet and wiped the sweat from his face his eyes felt sore and his headache was worse he was incapable of logical thought he was tempted to turn the dial marked emergency return but there was still the mysterious dial marked mega flow tuner filled with hysterical recklessness he turned it and was flung back as the ship jerked into normal motion on the screens he saw a little of what he had observed outside all kinds of images appeared and disappeared once human figureslike golden shadowswere seen for a moment his eyes fixed insanely on the screens pepin hunchback could only stare much much later he fell back to the floor he had fainted at the sound of tall laughers voice he opened his eyes his initial question was scarcely original but it was the thing he most needed to know where am i he said looking up at her on the megaflow she replied you are a fool pepin hunchback the brooder and i have had a considerable amount of difficulty locating you it is a wonder you are not insane i think i am how did you get here we travelled up the megaflow after you but your speed was so great we wasted a great deal of energy catching you i see from the instruments that you went into the past were you satisfied he got up slowly was thatthat vacuum the pasty yes but it was not earths past it is the only past there is she was at the controls mani pulating them he turned his head and saw the chronarch stand ing head bowed at the back of the ship he looked up and pursed his lips at pepin i attempted to explain but i knew you would not believe me it is a pity that you know the truth for it will not console you my friend what truth the scarfaced brooder sighed he spread his hands the only truth there is the past is nothing but limbothe future is what you have observed chaos save for the megaflow you mean earth only has existence in the present as far as we are concerned yes the brooder folded his arms across his chest it means little to us of lanjis liho but i knew how it would affect you we are time dwellers you seeyou are still a space dweller your mind is not adjusted to understand and exist in the dimensions of timewithout space time without space is an impossibility pepin shouted the brooder grimaced is it then what do you think of the future of the megaflow admittedly something exists here but it is not the stuff of space as you would understand it it is well the physical manifestation of timewithoutspace he sighed as he noted pepins expression you will never properly understand my friend tall laugher spoke we are nearly at present brooder i will explain further when we return to earth said the chronarch kindly you have my sympathy pepin hunchback in the hall of time the scarfaced brooder walked up to his dais and lowered himself into his chair sit down pepin he said indicating the edge of the dais dazedly pepin obeyed what do you think of the past said the chronarch ironic ally as tall laugher joined them pepin looked up at her and then at her brother he shook his head tall laugher put her hand on his shoulder poor pepin he did not have enough emotion left to feel anything at this he rubbed his face and stared at the floor his eyes were full of tears do you want the chronarch to explain pepin she asked looking into her face he saw that she too seemed extraordin arily sad somehow she could understand his hopelessness if only she were normal he thought and we had met in different circumstances even here life would be more than bearable with her he had never seen such a look of sympathy directed at him before she was repeating her question he nodded at first we were as astonished as you at the true nature of time said the chronarch but of course it was much easier for us to accept it we are capable of moving through time as others move through space time is now our natural element we have adapted in a peculiar way we are able to journey into the past or future merely by an effort of will we have reached the stage where we no longer need space to exist in timewith space our physical requirements are manifold and increasingly hard to meet on this changing planet but in timewithoutspace these physical requirements no longer exist brooder put in tall laugher i do not think he is inter ested in us tell him why he found only limbo in the past yes said pepin turning to stare at the chronarch tell me ill try imagine time as a straight line along which the physical universe is moving at a certain point on that line the physical universe exists but if we move away from the present backward or forward what do we find again pepin shook his head we find what you found for by leaving the present we also leave the physical universe you see pepin when we leave our native time stream we move into others which are in relation to us above time there is a central stream along which our universe moveswe call this the megaflow as it moves it absorbs the stuff of time absorbs the chronons as we call them but leaves nothing behind chronons constitute the futurethey are infinite the reason you found nothing in the past is because in a sense space eats the chronons but cannot replace them you mean earth absorbs this this temporal energy but emits none herselflike a beast prowling through time gob bling it up but excreting nothing pepin spoke with a faint return of interest yes i understand the chronarch leaned back so when you came to me ask ing to return to the past i almost told you this but you would not have believed me you did not want to you cannot return to earths past because simply it no longer exists neither is there a future in terms of space only in terms of the chronon constituted megaflow and its offshoots we have managed to move ourselves where we wish individually absorbing the chro nons we need thus the human race will continue possibly we shall be immortal ranging the continents of time at will exploring acquiring knowledge which will be useful to us while the rest of us die or turn into little better than machines said pepin flatly yes now i have no hope at all said pepin rising he limped up to tall laugher when do you leave for good shortly i thank you for your sympathy and courtesy he said he left them standing silently in the hall of time pepin walked along the beach still moving towards the east away from lanjis liho by the sea the morning was a brown shroud covering the endlessness of sluggish sea and saltfrosted land illuminated by a dying sun blown by a cold wind ah he thought this is a morning for tears and selfcontempt loneliness sits upon me like a great oozer with its mouth at my throat sucking me dry of optimism if only i could give myself up to this pitiless morning let it engulf me freeze me toss me on its frigid wind and sink me in its slowyielding sea to lose sight of sun and sky such as they are and return to mother earths evergreedy womb oh this alien earth and yet he did not envy the time dwellers like the moonites they were renouncing their humanity at least he still had his he turned as he heard his name calleda thin cry like that of an ancient seabird tall laugher was riding towards him waving to him she rode beneath the brown and heaving sky her back straight and a smile on her lips and for some reason it seemed to him that she was riding to him out of the past as when he had first seen her a goddess from an age of mythology the red disc of the sun glowed behind her and again he noticed the strong smell of brine he waited by the edge of the thick salt sea and as he waited he knew that his journey had been worth while the deep fix one quickening sounds in the early dusk beat of hearts surge of blood seward turned his head on the bed and looked towards the window they were coming again he raised his drugwasted body and lowered his feet to the floor he felt nausea sweep up and through him dizzily he stumbled towards the window parted the blind and stared out over the white ruins the sea splashed far away down by the harbour and the mob was again rushing through the broken streets towards the research lab they were raggedly dressed and raggedly organ ized their faces were thin and contorted with madness but they were numerous seward decided to activate the towers once more he walked shakily to the steellined room on his left he reached out a grey trembling hand and flicked down three switches on a bank of hundreds lights blinked on the board above the switches seward walked over to the monitorcomputer and spoke to it his voice was harsh tired and cracking green frequency red frequency he didnt bother with the other towers two were enough to deal with the mob outside two wouldnt harm anybody too badly he walked back into the other room and parted the blind again he saw the mob pause and look towards the roof where the towers green and red were already beginning to spin once their gaze had been fixed on the towers they couldnt get it away a few saw their companions look up and these automatically shut their eyes and dropped to the ground but the others were nowheld completely rigid one by one then many at a time those who stared at the towers began to jerk and thresh eyes rolling foaming at the mouth screaming exhibiting every sign of an advanced epileptic fit seward leaned against the wall feeling sick outside those whod escaped were crawling round and inching down the street on their bellies then eyes averted from the towers they rose to their feet and began to run away through the ruins saved again he thought bitterly what was the point could he bring himself to goon acti vating the towers every time wouldnt there come a day when he would let the mob get into the laboratory search him out kill him smash his equipment he deserved it after all the world was in ruins because of him because of the towers and the other hallucinomats which hed perfected the mob wanted its revenge it was fair yet while he lived there might be a way of saving something from the wreckage he had made of mankinds minds the mobs were not seriously hurt by the towers it had been the other machines which had created the real damage machines like the paramats schizomats engramoscopes even michelsons stro boscope type a range of instruments which had been designed to help the world and had instead virtually destroyed civilization the memory was all too clear he wished it wasnt having lost track of time almost from the beginning of the disaster he had no idea how long this had been going on a year maybe his life had become divided into two sections drugstimulated workingperiod exhausted troubled tranquillized sleeping period sometimes when the mobs saw the inactive towers and charged towards the laboratory he had to protect himself he had learned to sense the coming of a mob they never came individually mob hysteria had become the universal condition of mankindfor all except seward who had created it hallucinomatics neural stimulators mechanical psychosimu latory devices hallucinogenic drugs and machines all had been developed to perfection at the hampton research laboratory under the brilliant direction of prof lee w seward psychophysicist extraordinary one of the youngest pioneers in the field of hallucinogenic research better for the world if he hadnt been thought seward wearily as he lowered his wornout body into the chair and stared at the table full of notebooks and loose sheets of paper on which hed been working ever since the result of experiment restor ation experiment restoration a fine name fine ideals to inspire it fine brains to make it but something had gone wrong originally developed to help in the work of curing mental dis orders of all kinds whether slight or extreme the hallucino mats had been an extension on the old hallucinogenic drugs such as co mescalin and lysergic acid derivatives their im mediate ancestor was the stroboscope and machines like it the stroboscope spinning rapidly flashing brightly coloured patterns into the eyes of a subject often inducing epilepsy or a similar disorder the research of burroughs and his followers into the early types of crude hallucinomats had all helped to contribute to a better understanding of mental disorders but as research continued so did the incidence of mental illness rise rapidly throughout the world the hampton research laboratory and others like it were formed to combat that rise with what had hitherto been con sidered nearuseless experiments in the field of hallucinomatics seward who had been stressing the potential importance of his chosen field since university came into his own hewas made director of the hampton lab people had earlier thought of seward as a crank and of the hallucinomats as being at best toys and at worse madness machines irresponsibly created by a madman but psychiatrists specially trained to work with them had found them invaluable aids to their studies of mental disorders it had become possible for a trained psychiatrist to induce in himself a temporary state of mental abnormality by use of these machines thus he was better able to understand and help his patients by different methods light soundwaves simulated brainwaves and so onthe machines created the symptoms of dozens of basic abnormalities and thousands of permutations they became an essential part of modern psychiatry the result hundreds and hundreds of patients hitherto vir tually incurable had been cured completely but the birthrate was rising even faster than had been pre dicted in the middle part of the century and mental illness rose faster than the birthrate hundreds of cases could be cured but there were millions to be cured there was no masstreat ment for mental illness not yet work at the hampton research lab became a frantic race to get ahead of the increase nobody slept much as in the great big world outside individual victims of mental illness turned into groups of the world had only recently forgotten the old word and now remembered it again maniacs an overcrowded overpressured world living on its nerves cracked up the majority of people of course did not succumb to total madness but those who did became a terrible problem governments threatened by anarchy were forced to reinsti tute the cruel old laws in order to combat the threat all over the world prisons hospitals mental homes institutions of many kinds all were turned into bedlams this hardly solved the problem soon if the rise continued the sane would be in a minority a dark tide of madness far worse even than that which had swept europe in the middle ages threatened to submerge civilization work at the hampton research laboratory speeded up and speeded up arid members of the team began to crack not all these cases were noticeable to the overworked men who remained sane they were too busy with their frantic experi ments only lee seward and a small group of assistants kept going making increasing use of stimulantdrugs and depressantdrugs to do so but now that seward thought back they had not been sane they had not remained cool and efficient any more than the others they had seemed to that was all perhaps the drugs had deceived them the fact was they had panickedthough the signs of panic had been hidden even to themselves under the disciplined guise of sober thinking their work on tranquillizing machines had not kept up with their perfection of stimulatory devices this was because they had had to study the reasons for mental abnormalities before they could begin to devise machines for curing them soon they decided the whole world would be mad well before they could perfect their tranquilomatic machines they could see no way of speeding up this work any more seward was the first to put it to his team he remembered his words gentlemen as you know our work on hallucinomats for the actual curing of mental disorders is going too slowly there is no sign of our perfecting such machines in the near future i have an alternative proposal the alternative proposal had been experiment restoration the tide now seward thought about it had been euphemistic it should have been called experiment diversion the existing hallucinomats would be set up throughout the world and used to induce passive disorders in the minds of the greater part of the human race the cooperation of national governments and world council was sought and given the machines were set up secretly at key points all over the globe they began to send the depressive symptoms of various dis orders they worked people became quiet and passive a large number went into catatonic states others a great many others who were potentially inclined to melancholia manicdepression certain kinds of schizophrenia committed suicide rivers be came clogged with corpses roads awash with the blood and flesh of those whod thrown themselves in front of cars every time a plane or rocket was seen in the sky people expected to see at least one body come falling from it often whole cargoes of peoplewere killed by the suicide of a captain driver or pilot of a vehicle even seward had not suspected the extent of the potential suicides he was shocked so was his team so were the world council and the national governments they told seward and his team to turn off their machines and reverse the damage they had done as much as possible seward had warned them of the possible result of doing this he had been ignored his machines had been confiscated and the world council had put untrained or illtrained operators on them this was one of the last acts of the world council it was one of the last rationalhowever illjudged acts the world knew the real disaster had come about when the bungling operators that the world council had chosen set the hallucinomats to send the full effects of the conditions theyd originally been designed to produce the operators may have been foolsthey were probably mad themselves to do what they did seward couldnt know most of them had been killed by bands of psychopathic murderers who killed their victims by the hundreds in weird and horrible rites which seemed to mirror those of prehistory or those of the insane south american cultures before the spaniards chaos had come swiftlythe chaos that now existed seward and his three remaining assistants had protected them selves the only way they could by erecting the stroboscopic towers on the roof of the laboratory building this kept the mobs off but it did not help their consciences one by one sewards assistants had committed suicide only seward keeping himself alive on a series of evermore potent drugs somehow retained his sanity and he thought ironically this sanity was only comparative a hypodermic syringe lay on the table and beside it a small bottle marked ma mescalinandrenol nineteena drug hitherto only tested on animals never on human beings but all the other drugs he had used to keep himself going had either run out or now had poor effects the ma was his last hope of being able to continue his work on the tranquilomats he needed to perfect and thus rectify his mistake in the only way he could as he reached for the bottle and the hypodermic he thought coolly that now he looked back the whole world had been suffering from insanity well before he had even considered experiment restoration the decision to make the experiment had been just another symptom of the worlddisease some thing like it would have happened sooner or later whether by natural or artificial means it wasnt really his fault he had been nothing much more than fates tool but logic didnt help in a way it was his fault by now with an efficient team he might have been able to have constructed a few experimental tranquilomats at least now ive got to do it alone he thought as he pulled up his trouser leg and sought a vein he could use in his clammy grey flesh he had long since given up dabbing the area with anaes thetic he found a blue vein depressed the plunger of the needle and sat back in his chair to await results two they came suddenly and were drastic his brain and body exploded in a torrent of mingled ecstasy and pain which surged through him waves of pale light flick ered rich darkness followed he rode a ferriswheel of erupting sensations and emotions he fell down a neverending slope of obsidian rock surrounded by clouds of green purple yellow black the rock vanished but he continued to fall then there was the smell of disease and corruption in his nostrils but even that passed and he was standing up world of phosphorescence drifting like golden spheres into black night green blue red explosions towers rotate slowly towers advance towers recede advance recede vanish flickering world of phosphorescent tears falling into the time less spaceless wastes of nowhere world of misery world of antagonism world of guilt guilt guilt guilt world of hateful wonder heart throbbing mind thudding body shuddering as ma flowed up the infinity of the spine shot into backbrain shot into midbrain shot into forebrain explosion all centres nomind nobody nowhere dying waves of light danced out of his eyes and away through the dark world everything was dying cells sinews nerves synapses all crumbling tears of light fading fading brilliant rockets streaking into the sky exploding all to gether and sending their multicoloured globes of light balls on a xmas treeballs on a great treexmassdrifting slowly earthwards ahead of him was a tall blocky building constructed of huge chunks of yellowed granite like a fortress black mist swirled around it and across the bleak horizonless nightscape this was no normal hallucinatory experience seward felt the ground under his feet the warm air on his face the halffamiliar smells he had no doubt that he had entered another world but where was it how had he got here who had brought him here the answer might lie in the fortress ahead he began to walk towards it gravity seemed lighter for he walked with greater ease than normal and was soon standing looking up at the huge green metallic door he bunched his fist and rapped on it echoes boomed through numerous corridors and were absorbed in the heart of the fortress seward waited as the door was slowly opened a man who so closely resembled the laughing cavalier of the painting that he must have modelled his beard and clothes on it bowed slightly and said welcome home professor seward weve been expecting you the bizarrely dressed man stepped aside and allowed him to pass into a dark corridor expecting me said seward how the cavalier replied goodhumouredly thats not for me to explain here we go through this door and up this corridor he opened the door and turned into another corridor and seward followed him they opened innumerable doors and walked along innumer able corridors the complexities of the corridors seemed somehow familiar to seward he felt disturbed by them but the possibility of an explanation overrode his qualms and he willingly followed the laughing cavalier deeper and deeper into the fortress through the twists and turns until they arrived at a door which was probably very close to the centre of the fortress the cavalier knocked confidently on the door but spoke deferentially professor seward is here at last sir a light cultured voice said from the other side of the door good send him in this door opened so slowly that it seemed to seward that he was watching a film sloweddown to a fraction of its proper speed when it had opened sufficiently to let him enter he went into the room beyond the cavalier didnt follow him it only occurred to him then that he might be in some kind of mental institution which would explain the fortresslike nature of the building and the man dressed up like the laughing cavalier but if so how had he got hereunless he had collapsed and order had been restored sufficiently for someone to have come and collected him no the idea was weak the room he entered was full of rich dark colours satin screens and hangings obscured much of it the ceiling was not visible neither was the source of the rather dim light in the centre of the room stood a dais raised perhaps a foot from the floor on the dais was an old leather armchair in the armchair sat a naked man with a cool blue skin he stood up as seward entered he smiled charmingly and stepped off the dais advancing towards seward with his right hand extended good to see you old boy he said heartily dazed seward clasped the offered hand and felt his whole arm tingle as if it had had a mild electric shock the mans strange flesh was firm but seemed to itch under sewards palm the man was short little over five feet tall his eyebrows met in the centre and his shiny black hair grew to a widows peak also he had no navel im glad you could get here seward he said walking back to his dais and sitting in the armchair he rested his head in one hand his elbow on the arm of the chair seward did not like to appear ungracious but he was worried and mystified i dont know where this place is he said i dont even know how i got here unless ah yesthe drug ma isnt it that helped doubt less weve been trying to get in touch with you for ages old boy ive got work to doback there seward said obsessionally im sorry but i want to get back as soon as i can what do you want the man without a navel sighed im sorry too seward but we cant let you go yet theres something id like to ask youa favour that was why we werehoping youd come whats your problem sewards sense of unreality never very strong here for fa spite of the worlds bizarre appearance it seemed familiar was growing weaker if he could help the man and get back to continue his research he would well smiled the man without a navel its realty your problem as much as ours you see he shrugged diffidently we want your world destroyed what now something was clear at last this man and his kind did belong to another world whether in space time or different dimensionsand they were enemies of earth you cant expect me to help you do that he laughed you are joking the man without a navel shook his head seriously afraid not old boy thats why you want me here youve seen the chaos in the world and you want to take advantage of ityou want me to be a a fifth columnist ah you remember the old term eh yes i suppose that is what i mean i want you to be our agent those machines of yours could be modified to make those who are left turn against each other even more than at present lib you must be very stupid if you think ill do mat seward said tiredly i cant help you im trying to help them was he trapped here for good he said weakly youve got to let me go back not as easy as that old boy iand my friendswant to enter your world but we cant until youve pumped up your machines to such a pitch that the entire world is maddened and destroys itself dyou see certainly exclaimed seward but im having no part of it again the man without a navel smiled slowly youll weaken soon enough old boy dont be so sure seward said defiantly ive had plenty of chances of giving upback there i could have weakened but i didnt ah but youve forgotten the new factor seward whats that the ma what do you mean youll know soon enough look i want to get out of this place you cant keep me theres no pointi wont agree to your plan where is this world anyway knowing that depends on you old boy the mans tone was mocking entirely on you a lot depends on you seward i know the man without a navel lifted his head and called brother sebastian are you available he glanced back at seward with an ironical smile brother sebastian may be of some help seward saw the wallhangings on the other side of the room move then from behind a screen on which was painted a weird surrealistic scene a tall cowled figure emerged face in shadow hands folded in sleeves a monk yes sir said the monk in a cold malicious voice brother sebastian professor seward here is not quite as ready to comply with our wishes as we had hoped can you influence him in any way possibly sir now the tone held a note of anticipation good professor seward will you go with brother sebas tian no seward had thought the room contained only one doorthe one hed entered through but now there was a chance of there being more doors other than the one through which the cowled monk had come the two men didnt seem to hear his negative reply they remained where they were not moving no he said again his voice rising what right have you to do this rights a strange question the monk chuckled to himself it was a sound like ice tumbling into a cold glass yesrights you must have some sort of organization here therefore you must have a ruleror government i demand to be taken to someone in authority but i am in authority here old boy purred the blueskinned man andin a senseso are you if you agreed with my suggestion you could hold tremendous power tremendous i dont want to discuss that again seward began to walk towards the wallhangings they merely watched himthe monk with his face in shadow the man without a navel with a supercilious smile on his thin lips he walked around a screen parted the hangings and there they were on the other side he went through the hangings this was some carefully planned trickan illusion deliberately intended to confuse him he was used to such methods even though he didnt understand how theyd worked this one he said cleverbut tricks of this kind wont make me weaken what on earth dyou mean seward old man now i wonder if youll accompany brother sebastian here i have an awful lot of work to catch up on all right seward said all right iwill perhaps on the way to wherever the monk was going he would find an oppor tunity to escape the monk turned and seward followed him he did not look at the man without a navel as he passed his ridiculous dais with its ridiculous leather armchair they passed through a narrow doorway behind a curtain and were once again in the complex series of passages the tall monknow he was close to him seward estimated his height at about six feet seven inchesseemed to flow along in front of him he began to dawdle the monk didnt look back seward increased the distance between them still the monk didnt appear to notice seward turned and ran they had met nobody on their journey through the corridors he hoped he could find a door leading out of the fortress before someone spotted him there was no cry from behind him but as he ran the passages got darker and darker until he was careering through pitch blackness sweating panting and beginning to panic he kept blundering into damp walls and running on it was only much later that he began to realize he was run ning in a circle that was getting tighter and tighter until he was doing little more than spin round like a top he stopped then these people evidently had more powers than he had sus pected possibly they had some means of shifting the position of the corridor walls following his movements by means of hidden tv cameras or something like them simply because there were no visible signs of an advanced technology didnt mean that they did not possess one they obviously did how else could they have got him from his own world to this he took a pace forward did he sense the walls drawing back he wasnt sure the whole thing reminded him vaguely of the pit and the pendulum he strode forward a number of paces and saw a light ahead of him he walked towards it turned into a dimlylit corridor the monk was waiting for him we missed each other professor seward i see you managed to precede me the monks face was still invisible secret in its cowl as secret as his cold mocking malevolent voice we are almost there now said the monk seward stepped towards him hoping to see his face but it was impossible the monk glided past him follow me please for the moment until he could work out how the fortress worked seward decided to accompany the monk they came to a heavy ironstudded doorquite unlike any of the other doors they walked into a lowceilinged chamber it was very hot smoke hung in the still air of the room it poured from a glowing brazier at the extreme end two men stood by the brazier one of than was a thin man with a huge bulging stomach over which his long narrow hands were folded he had a shaggy mane of dirty white hair his cheeks were sunken and his nose extremely long and extremely pointed he seemed toothless and his puckered lips were shaped in a senseless smile like the smile of a madman seward had once had to experiment on he wore a stained white jacket buttoned over his grotesque paunch on his legs were loose khaki trousers his companion was also thin though lacking the stomach he was taller and had the face of a mournful bloodhound with sparse highlygreased black hair that covered his bony head like a skullcap he stared into the brazier not looking up as brother sebastian led seward into the room and closed the door the thin man with the stomach however pranced forward his hands still clasped on his paunch and bowed to them both work for us brother sebastian he said nodding at seward we require a straightforward yes brother sebastian said you have merely to ask the question will you if he replies no you are to continue if he replies yes you are to cease and inform me immediately very well brother rely on us i hope i can the monk chuckled again you are now in the charge of these men professor if you decide you want to help us after all you have only to say yes is that clear seward began to tremble with horror he had suddenly realized what this place was now look here he said you cant he walked towards the monk who had turned and was open ing the door he grasped the mans shoulder his hand seemed to clutch a delicate birdlike structure key i dont think youre a man at all what are you a man or a mouse chuckled the monk as the two grotes que creatures leapt forward suddenly and twisted sewards arms behind him seward kicked back at them with his heels squirmed in their grasp but he might have been held by steel bands he shouted incoherently at the monk as he shut the door behind him with a whisk of his habit the pair flung him on to the damp hot stones of the floor it smelt awful he rolled over and sat up they stood over him the houndfaced man had his arms folded the thin man with the stomach had his long hands on his paunch again they seemed to rest there whenever he was not actually using them it was the latter who smiled with his twisting puckered lips cocking his head to one side what do you think mr morl he asked his companion i dont know mr hand after you the houndfaced man spoke in a melancholy whisper i would suggest treatment h simple to operate less work for us a tried and trusty operation which works with most and will probably work with this gentleman seward scrambled up and tried to push past them making for the door again they seized him expertly and dragged him back he felt the rough touch of rope on his wrists and the pain as a knot was tightened he shouted more in anger than agony more in terror than either they were going to torture him he knew it when they had tied his hands they took the rope and tied his ankles they twisted the rope up around his calves and under his legs they made a halter of the rest arid looped it over his neck so that he had to bend almost double if he was not to strangle then they sat him on a chair mr hand removed his hands from his paunch reached up above sewards head and turned on the tap the first drop of water fell directly on the centre of his head some five minutes later twentyseven drops of water later seward was raving and screaming yet every time he tried to jerk his head away the halter threatened to strangle him and the jolly mr hand and the mournful mr morl were there to straighten him up again thirty drops of water after that sewards brain began to throb and he opened his eyes to see that the chamber had vanished in its place was a huge comet a fireball dominating the sky rushing directly towards him he backed away from it and there were no more ropes on his hands or feet he was free he began to run he leapt into the air and stayed there he was swimming through the air ecstasy ran up his spine like a flickering fire touched his backbrain touched ms midbrain touched his forebrain explosion all centres he was standing one flower among many in a bed of tall lupins and roses which waved in a gentle wind he pulled his roots free and began to walk he walked into the lab control room everything was normal except that gravity seemed a little heavy everything was as hed left it he saw that he had left the towers rotating he went into the room he used as a bedroom and workroom he parted the blind and looked out into the night there was a big full moon hanging in the deep blue sky over the ruins of hampton he saw its light reflected in the faraway sea a few bodies still lay prone near the lab he went back into the control room and switched off the towers returning to the bedroom he looked at the cardtable he had his notes on they were undisturbed neatly side by side near a large tattered notebook lay a halffull ampoule of ma and a hypodermic syringe he picked up the ampoule and threw it in a corner it did not break but rolled around on the floor for a few seconds he sat down his whole body ached he picked up a sheaf of his more recent notes he wrote every thing down that came into his head on the subject of tranquilo mats it helped him think better and made sure that his drugged mind and body did not hamper him as much as they might have done if he had simply relied on his memory he looked at his wrists they carried the marks of the rope evidently the transition from the other world to his own involved leaving anything in the other world behind he was glad if he hadnt hed have had a hell of a job getting himself untied he shuddered a mob might have reached the lab before he could get free and activate the towers he tried hard to forget the questions flooding through his mind where had he been who were the people what did they really want how far could they keep a check on him how did the ma work to aid his transport into the other world could they get at him here he decided they couldnt get at him otherwise they might have tried earlier somehow it was the ma in his brain which allowed them to get hold of him well that was simple no more ma with a feeling of relief he forced himself to concentrate on his notes out of the confusion something seemed to be developing but he had to work at great speed greater speed than previ ously perhaps for he darent use the ma again and there was nothing else left of much good his brain cleared as he once again got interested in his notes he worked for two hours making fresh notes equations checking his knowledge against the stack of earlier research notes by the wall near his camp bed dawn was coming as he realized suddenly that he was suffer ing from thirst his throat was bone dry so was his mouth and lips he got up and his legs felt weak he staggered almost knocking over the chair with a great effort he righted it and leaning for support on the bed got himself to the handbasin it was filled by a tank near the roof and he had used it sparsely but this time he didnt care he stuck his head under the tap and drank the stale water greedily it did no good his whole body now seemed cold his skin tight his heart thumping heavily against his ribs his head was aching horribly and his breathing increased he went and lay down on the bed hoping the feeling would leave him it got worse he needed something to cure himself what he asked ma he answered no but yes yes yes all he needed was a small shot of the drug and he would be all right he knew it and with knowing that he realized something else he was hooked the drug was habitforming three he found the halffull ma ampoule under the bed where it had rolled he found the needle on the table where he had left it buried under his notes he found a vein in his forearm and shot himself full there was no thought to sewards action there was just the craving and the chance of satisfying that craving the ma began to swim leisurely through his veins drift ing up his spine it hit his brain with a powerful explosion he was walking through a world of phosphorescent ram leaping over large purple rocks that welcomed his feet drew them down towards them all was agony and startling now notime nospace just the throbbing voice in the air above him it was talking to him doom seward doom seward doom seward seward is doomed he laughed seward is betrayed towers advance towers recede towers rotate at normal speed carnival aktion all carnivals to explode up into the backbrain into the midbrain on to the fore brain explosion all centres he was back in the torturechamber though standing up in the corner near the brazier the grotesque pair were muttering to one another mr hand darted him an angry glance his lips drawn over his gums in an expression of outrage hello seward said the man without a navel behind him so youre back back said seward heavily what more do you want only your all seward old man i remember a time in dartford before the war which war your war seward you were too young to share any other you dont remember that war you werent born leave it to those who do seward seward turned my war he looked with disgust at the man without a navel at his reptilian blue skin and his warm cold darklight goodevil eyes at his small yet wellformed body the man without a navel smiled our war then old man i wont quibble you made me do it i think that somehow you made me suggest experiment restoration i said we wont quibble seward said the man in an authori tative tone then more conversationally i remember a time in dartford before the war when you sat in your armchair one rather like mineat your brotherinlaws house remember what you said old man seward remembered well if he quotedif i had a button and could press it and destroy the entire universe and myself with it i would for no reason other than boredom very good seward you have an excellent memory is that all youre going on something i said out of frustration because nobody was recognizing my work he paused as he realized something else you know all about me dont you he said bitterly there seemed to be nothing he didnt know on the other hand seward knew of the man nothing of this world nothing of where it was in space and time it was a world of insanity of bizarre contrasts how do you know all this inside information seward old boy youre mad the man without a navel returned to his earlier topic are you bored now seward bored no tired yes bored no tired yes very good seward you got here later than expected what kept you the man laughed i kept me i held off taking the ma for as long as i could but you came to us in the end eh good man seward you knew the ma was habitforming you knew id have to take it come back here naturally he said pleadingly let me go for gods sake youve made me made me your dearest wish almost come true seward isnt that what you wanted i made you come close to destroying the world is that it so you did somehow influence experiment restoration its possible but you havent done very well either way the world is in shambles you cant reverse that kill it off lets start fresh seward forget your experiments with the tranquilomats and help us no the man without a navel shrugged well see old boy he looked at the mumbling men in the corner morl handtake professor seward to his room i dont want any mistakes this time im going to take him out of your hands obviously we need subtler minds put on the problem the pair came forward and grabbed seward the man with out a navel opened the door and they went through it first forcing seward ahead of them he was too demoralized to resist much this time demoralized by the fact that he was hooked en ma what did the junkies call it the habit he had the habit demoralized by his inability to understand the whereabouts or nature of the world he was on demoralized by the fact that the man without a navel seemed to know everything about his personal life on earth demoralized that he had fallen into the mans trap who had developed ma he couldnt remember perhaps the man without a navel had planted it he supposed it might be possible he was pushed along another series of corridors arrived at another door the man without a navel came up behind them and unlocked the door seward was shoved into the room it was narrow and low coffinlike well be sending someone along to see you in a little while seward said the man lightly the door was slammed seward lay in pitch blackness he began to sob later he heard a noise outside a stealthy noise of creeping feet he shuddered what was the torture going to be this time he heard a scraping and a muffled rattle the door opened against the light from the passage seward saw the man clearly he was a big fat negro in a grey suit he wore a flow ing rainbowcoloured tie he was grinning seward liked the man instinctively but he no longer trusted his instinct what do you want he said suspiciously the huge negro raised his linger to his lips ssshh he whispered im going to try and get you out of here an old secret police trick on my world said seward im not falling for that its no trick son even if it is what can you lose nothing seward got up the big man put his arm around sewards shoulders seward felt comfortable in the grip though normally he disliked such gestures now son we go real quietly and we go as fast as we can come on softly the big man began to tiptoe along the corridor seward was sure that tv cameras or whatever they were were following him that the man without a navel the monk the two torturers the laughing cavalier were all waiting some where to seize him but very quickly the negro had reached a small wooden door and was drawing a bolt he patted sewards shoulder and held the door open for him through you go son make for the red car it was morning in the sky hung a golden sun twice the size of earths there was a vast expanse of lifeless rock in all directions broken only by a white road which stretched into the distance on the road close to seward was parked a car some thing like a cadillac it was firered and bore the registration plates you ooo whoever these people were seward decided they were originally from earth all except the man without a navel perhaps possibly this was his world and the others had been brought from earth like him he walked towards the car the air was cold and fresh he stood by the convertible and looked back the negro was run ning over the rock towards him he dashed round the car and got into the drivers seat seward got in beside him the negro started the car put it into gear and shoved his foot down hard on the accelerator pedal the car jerked away and had reached top speed in seconds at the wheel the negro relaxed glad that went smoothly i didnt expect to get away with it so easily son youre seward arent you yes you seem to be as wellinformed as the others i guess so the negro took a pack of cigarettes from his shirt pocket smoke no thanks said seward thats one habit i dont have the negro looked back over his shoulder the expanse of rock seemed neverending though in the distance the fortress was disappearing he flipped a cigarette out of the pack and put it between his lips he undipped the cars lighter and put it to the tip of the cigarette he inhaled and put the lighter back the cigarette between his lips he returned his other hand to the wheel he said they were going to send the vampire to you its lucky i reached you in time it could be said seward who are you what part do you play in this lets just say im a friend of yours and an enemy of your enemies the names farlowe well i trust you farlowe though god knows why farlowe grinned why not i dont want your world des troyed any more than you do it doesnt much matter i guess but if theres a chance of restoring it then you ought to try then youre from my world originally is that it in a manner of speaking son said farlowe very much later the rock gave way to pleasant flat country side with trees fields and little cottages peaceful under the vast sky in the distance seward saw herds of cattle and sheep the occasional horse it reminded him of the countryside of his childhood all clear and fresh and sharp with the clarity that only a childs eye can bring to a scene before it is obscured and tainted by the impressions of adulthood soon the flat country was behind them and they were going through an area of low green hills the huge sun flooding the scene with its soft golden light there were no clouds in the pale blue sky the big car sped smoothly along and seward in the comfort able companionship of farlowe began to relax a little he felt almost happy would have felt happy if it had not been for the nagging knowledge that somehow he had to get back and continue his work it was not merely a question of restoring sanity to the world nowhe had also to thwart whatever plans were in the mind of the man without a navel after a long silence seward asked a direct question far lowe where is this world what are we doing here farlowes answer was vague he stared ahead at the road dont ask me that son i dont rightly know but you live here so do you no i only come here when when when what but seward couldnt raise the courage to admit about the drug to farlowe instead he said does ma mean any thing to you nope so farlowe hadnt come here because of the drag seward said but you said you were from my world originally only in a manner of speaking farlowe changed gears as the road curved steeply up a hill it rose gently above the idyllic countryside below seward changed his ike of questioning isnt there any sort of organization hereno government whats the name of this country farlowe shrugged its just a placeno government the people in the fortress run most things everybodys scared of them i dont blame them whos the vampire you mentioned he works for the man what is be why a vampire naturally said farlowe in surprise the sun had started to set and the whole countryside was bathed in redgold light the car continued to climb the long hill farlowe said im taking you to some friends you ought to be fairly safe there then maybe we can work out a way of getting you back seward felt better at least farlowe had given him some direct information as the car reached the top of the hill and began to descend seward got a view of an odd and disturbing sight the sun was like a flat round red disc yet only half of it was above the horizon the line of the horizon evenly intersected the suns disc it was some sort of mirageyet so convincing that reward looked away staring instead at the black smoke which he could now seerolling across the valley below he said nothing to farlowe how much further he asked later as the car came to the bottom of the hill black night had come moonless and the cars headlights blazed a long way yet im afraid son said farlowe you cold no well be hitting a few signs of civilization soon you tired nowhy we could put up at a motel or something i guess we could eat anyway ahead seward saw a few lights he couldnt make out where they came from farlowe began to slow down well risk it he said he pulled in towards thelights and seward saw that it was a line of fuel pumps behind the pumps was a single storey building very long and built entirely of timber by the look of it farlowe drove in between the pumps and the build ing a man in overalls the top half of his face shadowed by the peak of his cap came into sight farlowe got out of the car with a signal to seward to do the same the negro handed his keys to the attendant fill her full and give her a quick check could this be earth seward wondered earth in the future or possibly an earth of a different spacetime continuum that was the likeliest explanation for this unlikely world the con trast between recognizable everyday things and the grotes queries of the fortress was strangeyet it could be explained easily if these people had contact with his world that would explain how they had things like cars and fuel stations and no apparent organization necessary for producing them somehow perhaps they just stole them he followed farlowe into the long building he could see through the wide windowsthat it was some kind of restaurant there was a long clean counter and a few people seated at tables at the far end all had their backs to him he and farlowe sat down on stools close to them was the largest pintable seward had ever seen its lights were flashing and its balls were clattering though there was no one operating it the coloured lights flashed series of numbers at him until his eyes lost focus and he had to turn away a woman was standing behind the counter now most of her face was covered by a yashmak what do you want to eat son said farlowe turning to him oh anything farlowe ordered sandwiches and coffee when the woman had gone to get their order seward whispered whys she wearing that thing farlowe pointed at a sign seward hadnt noticed before it read the harem haven its their gimmick said far lowe seward looked back at the pintable the lights had stopped flashing the balls had stopped clattering but above it suddenly appeared a huge pair of disembodied eyes he gasped distantly he heard his name being repeated over and over again seward seward seward seward he couldnt tell where the voice was coining from he glanced up at the ceiling not from there the voice stopped he looked back at the pintable the eyes had vanished his panic returned he got off his stool ill wait for you in the car farlowe farlowe looked surprised whats the matter son nothing its okay ill wait in the car farlowe shrugged seward went out into the night the attendant had gone but the car was waiting for him he opened the door and climbed in what did the eyes mean were the people from the fortress following him in some way suddenly an explanation for most of the questions bothering him sprang into his mind of course telepathy they were probably telepaths that was how they knew so much about him that could be how they knew of his world and could influence events there they might never go there in person this comforted him a little though he realized that getting out of this situation was going to be even more diffi cult than hed thought he looked through the windows and saw farlowes big body perched on its stool the other people in the cafe were still sitting with their backs to him he realized that there was some thing familiar about them he saw farlowe get up and walk towards the door he came out and got into the car slamming the door after him he leaned back in his seat and handed seward a sandwich you seem worked up son he said youd better eat this seward took the sandwich he was staring at the backs of the other customers again he frowned farlowe started the car and they moved towards the road then seward realized who the men reminded him of he craned his head back in the hope of seeing their faces but it was too late they had reminded him of his dead assistants the men whod committed suicide they roared through dimlyseen townsall towers and angles there seemed to be nobody about dawn came up and they still sped on seward realized that farlowe must have a tremendous vitality for he didnt seem to tire at all also perhaps he was motivated by a desire to get as far away from the fortress as possible they stopped twice to refuel and farlowe bought more sand wiches and coffee which they had as they drove in the late afternoon farlowe said almost there they passed through a pleasant village it was somehow alien although very similar to a small english village it had an oddly foreign look which was hard to place farlowe pulled in at what seemed to be the gates of a large public park he looked up at the sun just made it he said wait in the parksomeone will come to collect you youre leaving me yes i dont think they know where you are theyll look but with luck they wont look around here out you get son into the park who do i wait for youll know her when she comes her he got out and closed the door he stood on the pavement watching as with a cheerful wave farlowe drove off he felt a tremendous sense of loss then as if his only hope had been taken away gloomily he turned and walked through the park gates four as he walked between low hedges along a gravel path he realized that this park like so many things in this world con trasted with the village it served it was completely familiar just like a park on his own world it was like a grey hazy winters afternoon with the brittle interwoven skeletons of trees black and sharp against the cold sky birds perched on trees and bushes or flew noisily into the silent air evergreens crowded upon the leafstrewn grass cry of spar rows peacocks necks craned forward dived towards scattered bread silver birch larch elm monkeypuzzle trees and sway ing white ferns each one like an ostrich feather stuck in the earth a huge ancient nameless trunk from which at the top grew an expanse of soft yellow fungus the trunk itself look ing like a gothic cliff full of caves and dark windows a grey and brown pigeon perched motionless on the slender branches of a young birch peacock chicks the size of hens pecked with concentration at the grass mellow nostalgic smell of winter distant sounds of children playing lost black dog looking for master red disc of sun in the cool darkening sky the light was sharp and yet soft peace ful a path led into the distance towards a flight of wide stone steps at the top of which was the curving entrance to an arbour browns blacks and yellows of sapless branches and fading leaves from the arbour a girl appeared and began to descend the steps with quick graceful movements she stopped when she reached the path she looked at him she had long blonde hair and wore a white dress with a full skirt she was about seven teen the peace of the park was suddenly interrupted by children rushing from nowhere towards the peacocks laughing and shout ing some of the boys saw the tree trunk and made for it others stood looking upwards at the sun as it sank in the cold air they seemed not to see either seward or the girl seward looked at her did he recognize her it wasnt possible yet she too gave him a look of recognition smiled shyly at him and ran towards him she reached him stood on tiptoe and gave him a light kiss on the cheek hello lee hello have you come to find me ive been looking for you a long time farlowe sent a message ahead she took his hand come on where have you been lee this was a question he couldnt answer he let her lead him back up the steps through the arbour between the branches he glanced a garden and a pool come on she said lets see whats for dinner mothers looking forward to meeting you he no longer questioned how these strange people all seemed to know his name it was still possible that all of them were taking part in the conspiracy against him at the end of the arbour was a house several storeys high it was a pleasant house with a blue and white door she led him up the path and into a hallway it was shining with dark polished wood and brass plates on the walls from a room at the end he smelled spicy cooking she went first and opened the door at the end motherlee sewards here can we come in of course the voice was warm husky full of humour they went into the room and seward saw a woman of about forty very well preserved tall largeboned with a finefeatured face and smiling mouth her eyes also smiled her sleeves were rolled up and she put the lid back on a pan on the stove how do you do professor seward mr farlowes told us about you youre in trouble i hear how do you do mrs call me martha has sally introduced herself no sally laughed i forgot im sally lee her mother gave a mock frown i suppose youve been calling our guest by his first name as usual do you mind professor not at all he was thinking how attractive they both were in their different ways the young fresh girl and her warm intelligent mother he had always enjoyed the company of women but never so much he realized as now they seemed to complement one another in their presence he felt safe at ease now he realized why farlowe had chosen them to hide him whatever the facts he would feel safe here martha was saying dinner wont be long it smells good probably smells better than it tastes she laughed go into the lounge with sally sally fix professor seward a drink call me lee said seward a little uncomfortably he had never cared much for his first name he preferred his middle name william but not many others did come on lee she took his hand and led him out of the kitchen well see what there is they went into a small well lighted lounge the furniture like the whole house had a look that was halffamiliar halfalien obviously the product of a slightly different race perhaps they deliberately imitated earth culture without quite succeeding sally still gripped his hand her hand was warm and her skin smooth he made to drop it but involuntarily squeezed it gently before she took it away to deal with the drink she gave him another shy smile he felt that she was as attracted to him as he to her whats it going to be she asked him oh anything he said sitting down on a comfortable sofa she poured him a dry martini and brought it over then she sat demurely down beside him and watched him drink it her eyes sparkled with a mixture of sauciness and innocence which he found extremely appealing he looked around the room how did farlowe get his message to you he said he came the other day said he was going to try and get into the fortress and help you farlowes always flitting about i think the people at the fortress have a price on his head or some thing its exciting isnt it you can say that again seward said feelingly why are they after you they want me to help them destroy the world i come from do you know anything about it earth isnt it yes was he going to get some straightforward answers at last i know its very closely connected with ours and that some of us want to escape from here and go to your world why he asked eagerly she shook her head her long fine hair waved with the motion i dont really know something about their being trapped here something like that farlowe said something about you being a key to their release they can only do what they want to do with your agreement but i could agree and then break my word i dont think you couldbut honestly i dont know any more ive probably got it wrong dp you like me lee he was startled by the directness of her question yes he said very much farlowe said you would good isnt it why yes farlowe knows a lot thats why he works against them martha came in almost ready she smiled i think ill have a quick one before i start serving how are you feeling lee after your ride fine he said fine he had never been in a position like this onewith two women either of whom was extremely attrac tive for almost opposite reasons we were discussing why the people at the fortress wanted my help he said turning the conversation back the way he felt it ought to go if he was ever going to get off this world and back to his own and his work farlowe said something about it yes sally told me does farlowe belong to some sort of underground organization underground why yes in a way he does arent they strong enough to fight the man without a navel and his friends farlowe says theyre strong enough but divided over what should be done and how i see thats fairly common amongst such groups i believe yes what part do you play none really farlowe asked me to put you up thats all she sipped her drink her eyes smiling directly into his he drained his glass shall we eat she said sally take lee in to the dining room the girl got up and somewhat possessively seward thought linked her arm in his her young body against his was distract ing he felt a little warm she took him in the table was laid for supper three chairs add three placesthe sun had set and candles burned oh the table in brass candelabras she unlinked her arm and pulled out one of the chairs you sit here leeat the head of the table she grinned then she leaned forward as he sat down hope mummy isnt boring you he was surprised why should she martha came in with three covered dishes on a tray this may not have turned out quite right lee never does when youre trying hard im sure itll be fine he smiled the two women sat down one either side of him martha served him it was some sort of goulash with vegetables he took his napkin and put it on his lap as they began to eat martha said how is it fine he said it was very good apart from the feeling that some kind of rivalry for his attentions existed between mother and daughter the air of normality in the house was comforting here he might be able to do some constructive thinking about his predicament when the meal was over martha said its time for bed sally say good night to lee she pouted oh its not fair yes it is she said firmly you can see lee in the morning hes had a long journey all right she smiled at seward sleep well lee i think i will he said martha chuckled after sally had gone would you like a drink before you go to bed she spoke softly love one he said they went into the other room he sat down on the sofa as she mixed the drinks she brought them over and sat down next to him as her daughter had done earlier tell me everything thats been happening it sounds so exciting he knew at once he could tell her all he wanted to that she would listen and be sympathetic its terrifying really he began halfapologetically he began to talk beginning with what had happened on earth she listened i even wondered if this was a dreamworlda figment of my imagination he finished but i had to reject that when i went back to my own i had rope marks on my wristsmy hair was soaking wet you dont get that in a dream i hope not she smiled were different here lee obvi ously our life doesnt have the the shape that yours has we havent much direction no real desires we just well exist its as if were waiting for something to happen as if she paused and seemed to be looking down deep into herself put it this wayfarlowe thinks youre the key figure in some development thats happening here supposing supposing we were some kind ofof experiment experiment how do you mean well from what you say the people at the fortress have an advanced science that we dont know about supposing our parents say had been kidnapped from your world andmade to think whats the word conditioned yes conditioned to think they were natives of this world wed have grown up knowing nothing different maybe the man without a navel is a member of an alien race a scientist of some kind in charge of the experiment but why should they make such a complicated experiment so they could study us i suppose seward marvelled at her deductive powers she had come to a much firmer theory than he had but then he thought she might subconsciously know the truth everyone knew much more than they knew as it were for instance it was pretty certain that the secret of the tranquilomat was locked somewhere down in his unconscious if only he could get at it her explanation was logical and worth thinking about you may be right he said if so its something to go on but it doesnt stop my reliance on the drug or the fact that the man and his helpers are probably telepathic and are at this moment looking for me she nodded could there be an antidote for the drug unlikely drugs like that dont really need antidotes theyre not like poisons there must be some way of getting at the people in the fortress some way of putting a stop to their plans what about an organized revolution what has farlowe tried to do nothing much the people arent easy to organize we havent much to do with one another farlowe was probably hoping you could helpthink of something he hasnt maybe lone of those machines you mentioned would work against the fortress people no i dont think so anyway the hallucinomats are too big to move from one place to another by hand let alone from one world to another and you havent been able to build a tranquilomat yet nowe have a lot of experimental machines lying around at the lab theyre fairly smallbut its a question of modify ing themthats what im trying to do at the moment if i could make one that works it would solve part of my problem it would save my world and perhaps even save yours if you are in a state of conditioning it sounds reasonable she dropped her eyes and looked at her drink she held the glass balanced on her knees which were pressed closely together nearly touching him but she said theyre going to catch you sooner or later theyre very power ful theyre sure to catch you then theyll make you agree to their idea why are you so certain i know them he let that go she said another drink and got up yes please he got up too and extended his glass then went closer to her she put bottle and glass on the table and looked into his face there was compassion mystery tender ness in her large dark eyes he smelled her perfume warm pleasant he put his arms around her and kissed her my room she said they went upstairs later that night feeling strangely revitalized he left the bed and the sleeping martha and went and stood beside the window overlooking the silent park he felt cold and he picked up his shirt and trousers put them on he sighed he felt his mind clear and his body relax he must work out a way of travelling from this world to his own at will that might put a stop to the plans of the man without a navel he turned guiltily as he heard the door open sally was standing there she wore a long white flowing nightdress lee i came to tell mummy what are you doing in here her eyes were horrified accusing him martha sat up suddenly sallywhats the matter lee stepped forward listen sally dont sally shrugged but tears had come to her eyes i thought you wanted me now i know i shouldnt have brought you here farlowe said what did farlowe say he said youd want to marry me but thats ridiculous how could he say that im a stranger here you were to hide me from the fortress people thats all but she had only picked up one word ridiculous yes i suppose it is when my own mother sally youd better go to bed well discuss it in the morn ing said martha softly what was it you came in about sally laughed theatrically it doesnt matter now she slammed the door seward looked at martha im sorry martha it wasnt your fault or mine sallys romantic and young and jealous seward sat down on the bed the feeling of comfort of companionship of bringing some order out of chaos it had all faded look martha i cant stay here youre running away if you like but well the two of youim in the middle i guessed that no youd better stay well work something out okay he got up sighing heavily i think ill go for a walk in the parkit may help me to think id just reached the stage where i was getting somewhere thanks for that any way martha she smiled dont worry lee ill have everything running smoothly again by tomorrow he didnt doubt it she was a remarkable woman he put on his socks and shoes opened thedoor and went out on to the landing moonlight entered through a tall slender window at the end he went down the two flights of stairs and out of the front door he turned into the lane and entered the arbour in the cool of the night he once again was able to begin some constructive thinking while he was on this world he would not waste his time he would keep trying to discover the necessary modifications to make the tranquilomats workable he wandered through the arbour keeping any thoughts of the two women out of his mind he turned into another section of the arbour he hadnt noticed before the turnings became numerous but he was scarcely aware of them it was probably some sort of childs maze he paused as he came to a bench he sat down and folded his arms in front of him concentrating on his problem much later he heard a sound to his right and looked up a man he didnt know was standing there grinning at him seward noticed at once that the man had overlong canines that he smelt of damp earth and decay he wore a black polo neck pullover and black stained trousers his face was waxen and very pale ive been looking for you for ages professor seward said the vampire five seward got up and faced the horrible creature the vampire continued to smile he didnt move seward felt revulsion its been a long journey said the vampire in a sibilant voice like the sound of a frigid wind blowing through dead boughs i had intended to visit you at the fortress but when i got to your room you had left i was disappointed doubtless said seward well youve had a wasted jour ney im not going back there until im ready that doesnt interest me what does seward tried to stop himself from trembling the vampire put his hands into his pockets only you get away from here youre outnumbered i have friends but he knew that his tone was completely unconvincing the vampire hissed his amusement they cant do much seward what are you some sort of android made to frighten people no the vampire took a pace forward suddenly he stopped as a voice came faintly from some where in the maze lee lee where are you it was sallys voice stay away sally lee called but i was going to warn you i saw the vampire from the window hes somewhere in the park i know go home im sorry about the scene lee i wanted to apologize it was childish it doesnt matter he looked at the vampire he was stand ing in a relaxed position hands in pockets smiling go home sally she wont you know whispered the vampire her voice was closer lee i must talk to you he screamed sallythe vampires here go home warn your mother not me get some help if you can but go home now he saw her enter the part of the maze he was in she gasped as she saw them he was between her and the vampire sally do what i told you but the vampires cold eyes widened and he took one hand out of his pocket and crooked a finger come here sally she began to walk forward he turned to the vampire what do you want only a little blood yours perhaps or the young ladys damn you get away go back sally she didnt seem to hear him he darent touch the cold body the earthdamp clothes he stepped directly between the girl and the vampire he felt sick but he reached out his hands and shoved at the creatures body flesh yielded but bone did not the vampire held his ground smiling staring beyond seward at the girl seward shoved again and suddenly the creatures arms clamped around him and the grinning fanged face darted towards his the things breath disgusted him he struggled but could not break the vampires grasp a cold mouth touched his neck he yelled and kicked he felt a tiny pricking against his throat sally screamed he heard her turn and run and felt a fraction of relief he punched with both fists as hard as he could into the creatures solar plexus it worked the vampire groaned and let go seward was disgusted to see that its fangs dripped with blood his blood now rage helped him he chopped at the vampires throat it gasped tottered and fell in a sprawl of loose limbs to the ground panting seward kicked it in the head it didnt move he bent down and rolled the vampire over as far as he could tell it was dead he tried to remember what hed read about legendary vampires not much something about a stake through its heart well that was out but the thought that struck him most was that he had fought one of the fortress people and had won it was possible to beat them he walked purposefully through the maze it wasnt as tortu ous as hed supposed soon he emerged at the arbour entrance near the house he saw sally and martha running towards him behind them another figure lumbered farlowe he had got here fast seward he shouted they said the vampire had got you i got him said seward as they came up and stopped what i beat him but thats impossible seward shrugged he felt elated evidently its possible he said i knocked him out he seems to be deadbut i sup pose you never know with vampires farlowe was astonished i believe you he said but its fantastic how did you do it i got frightened and then angry said seward simply maybe youve been overawed by these people too long it seems like it farlowe admitted lets go and have a look at him sally and martha had better stay behind seward led him back through the maze the vampire was still where hed fallen farlowe touched the corpse with his foot thats the vampire all right he grinned i knew we had a winner in you son what are you going to do now im going straight back to the fortress and get this worked out once and for all martha gave me an idea yesterday evening and she may well be right im going to try and find out any way better not be overconfident son better than being overcautious maybe farlowe agreed doubtfully whats this idea martha gave you its really her idea complete let her explain shes an intelligent woman and shes bothered to think about this prob lem from scratch id advise you to do the same ill hear what it is first lets dealwith the vampire and then get back to the house ill leave the vampire to you i want to use your car why to go back to the fortress dont be a fool wait until weve got some help i cant wait that long farlowe ive got other work to do back on my own world okay farlowe shrugged farlowe faded the maze began to fade explosions in the brain vertigo sickness his head ached and he could riot breathe he yelled but he had no voice multicoloured explosions in front of his eyes he was whirling round and round spinning rapidly then he felt a new surface dragging at his feet he closed his eyes and stumbled against something he fell on to something soft it was his camp bed he was back in his laboratory seward wasted no time wondering what had happened he knew more or less possibly his encounter with the vampire had sent him backthe exertion orof coursethe creature had drawn some of his blood maybe that was it he felt the pricking sensation still he went to the mirror near the washstand he could just see the little marks in his neck further proof that wherever that world was it was as real as the one he was in now he went to the table and picked up his notes then walked into the other room in one section was a long bench on it in various stages of dismantling were the machines that he had been working on the tranquilomats that somehow just didnt work he picked up one of the smallest and checked its bat teries its lenses and its sonic agitator the idea with this one was to use a combination of light and sound to agitate certain dormant cells in the brain long since psychophysicists had realized that mental abnormality had a chemical as well as a mental cause just as a patient with a psychosomatic illness pro duced all the biological symptoms of whatever disease he thought he had so did chemistry play a part in brain disorders whether the change in the brain cells came first or afterwards they werent sure but the fact was that the cells could be agitated and the mind by a mixture of hypnosis and conditioning could be made to work normally but it was a long step from knowing this and being able to use the information in the construction of tranquilomats seward began to work on the machine he felt he was on the right track at least but how long could he keep going before his need for the drug destroyed his will he kept going some five hours before his withdrawal symptoms got the better of him he staggered towards one of the drugdrawers and fumbled out an ampoule of ma he staggered into his bedroom and reached for the needle on the table he filled the syringe he filled his veins he filled his brain with a series of explosions which blew him clean out of his own world into the other fire flew up his spine ignited backbrain ignited midbrain ignited forebrain ignited all centres explosion all centres this time the transition was brief he was standing in the part of the maze where hed been when hed left the vampires corpse was gone farlowe had gone also he experienced a feeling of acute frustration that he couldnt continue with his work on kltm the tranquilomat hed been modifying when his craving for the ma took over but there was something to do here too he left the maze and walked towards the house it was dawn and very cold farlowes car was parked there he noticed the licence number it seemed different it now said you maybe hed mistaken the last digit for a zero last time hed looked the door was ajar farlowe and martha were standing in the hall they looked surprised when he walked in i thought the vampire was peculiar son said farlowe but yours was the best vanishing act ive ever seen martha will explain that too seward said not looking at her has she told you her theory yes it sounds feasible he spoke slowly looking at the floor he looked up we got rid of the vampire burned him up he burns well thats one out of the way at least said seward how many others are there at the fortress farlowe shook his head not sure how many did you see the man without a navel a character called brother sebastian who wears a cowl and probably isnt human either two pleasant gentlemen called mr mod and mr handand a man in fancy dress whose name i dont know there are one or two more farlowe said but its not their numbers weve got to worry aboutits their power i think maybe its overrated seward said you may be right son im going to find out you still want my car yes if you want to follow up behind with whatever help you can gather do that i will farlowe glanced at martha what do you think martha i think he may succeed she said good luck lee she smiled at him in a way that made him want to stay right said seward im going hope to see you there i may be wrong lee she said warningly it was only an idea its the best one ive heard goodbye he went out of the house and climbed into the car six the road was white the sky was blue the car was red and the countryside was green yet there was less clarity about the scenery than seward remembered perhaps it was because he no longer had the relaxing company of farlowe because his mind was working furiously and his emotions at full blast whoever had designed the setup on this world had done it well but had missed certain details seward realized that one of the alien aspects of the world was that everything was just a little too new even farlowes car looked as if it had just been driven off the production line by the early afternoon he was beginning to feel tired and some of his original impetus had flagged he decided to move in to the side of the road and rest for a short time stretch his legs he stopped the car and got out he walked over to the other side of the road it was on a hillside and he could look down over a wide shallow valley a river gleamed in the distance there were cottages and live stock in the fields he couldnt see the horizon far away he saw a great bank of reddishlooking clouds that seemed to swirl and seethe like a restless ocean for all the signs of habitation the countryside had taken on a desolate quality as if it had been abandoned he could not believe that there were people living in the cottages and tending the livestock the whole thing looked like the set for a film or a play a complicated play devised by the man without a navel and his friendsa play in which the fate of a worldpossibly two worldswas at stake how soon would the play resolve itself he wondered as he turned back towards the car a woman was standing by the car she must have come down the hill while he was looking at the valley she had long jet black hair and big dark eyes her skin was tanned dark gold she had full extraordinarily sensuous lips she wore a well tailored red suit a black blouse black shoes and black handbag she looked rather sheepish she raised her head to look at him and as she did so a lock of her black hair fell over her eyes she brushed it back hello she said am i lucky are you i hope so i didnt expect to find a car on the road you havent broken down have you she asked this last question anxiously no he said i stopped for a rest how did you get here she pointed up the hill theres a little track up there a cattletrack i suppose my car skidded and went into a tree its a wreck ill have a look at it for you she shook her head theres no point its a writeoff can you give me a lift where are you going he said unwillingly well its about sixty miles that way she pointed in the direction he was going a small town it wouldnt take long to drive sixty miles on a road as clear as this with no apparent speedlimit he scratched his head doubtfully the woman was a diversion he hadnt expected and in a way resented but she was very attractive he couldnt refuse her he hadnt seen any carttracks leading off the road this as far as he knew was the only one but it was possible he hadnt noticed since he didnt know this world also he decided the woman evidently wasnt involved in the straggle between the fortress people and farlowes friends she was probably just one of the conditioned living out her life completely unaware of where she was and why he might be able to get some informa tion out of her get in he said oh thanks she got in seeming rather deliberately to show him a lot of leg he opened his door and slid under the wheel she sat uncomfortably close to him he started the engine and moved the car out on to the road again im a stranger here he began conversationally what about you not meive lived hereabouts all my life where do you come from stranger he smiled a long way away are they all as good looking as you it was trite but it worked he felt flattered not any more he said that was true maniacs never looked very good but this wasnt the way he wanted the con versation to go however nice the direction he said youre not very heavily populated around here i havent seen another car or another person for that matter since i set off this morning it does get boring she said she smiled at him that and her full body her musky scent and her closeness made him breathe more heavily than he would have liked one thing about this worldthe women were considerably less inhibited than on his own it was a difference in population perhaps in an overcrowded world your social behaviour must be more rigid out of necessity he kept his hands firmly on the wheel and his eyes on the road convinced that if he didnt hed lose control of himself and the car the result might be a sort of femme fatality his attraction towards sally and martha had not been wholly sexual yet he had never felt such purely animal attraction that this woman radiated maybe he decided she didnt know it he glanced at her there again maybe she did it said a lot for the woman if she could take his mind so com pletely off his various problems my names magdalen she smiled a bit of a mouthful whats yours it was a relief to find someone here who didnt already know his name he rejected the unliked lee and said billbill ward short and sweet she said not like mine he grunted vaguely consciously fighting the emotions rising in him there was a word for them a simple word short and sweetlust he rather liked it hed been somewhat repressed on his home world and had kept a tight censorship on his feelings here it was obviously different a little later he gave in he stopped the car and kissed her he was surprised at the ease with which he did it he forgot about the tranquilomats about the ma about the fortress he forgot about everything except her and that was maybe why he did what he did it was as if he was drawn into yet another worlda private world where only he and she had any existence an enclosed world consisting only of their desire and their need to satisfy it afterwards he felt gloomy regretful and guilty he started the car savagely he knew he shouldnt blame her but he did hed lasted time minutes were valuable even seconds hed wasted hours beside him she took a headscarf from her bag and tied it over her hair youre in a hurry he pressed the accelerator as far down as he could whats the problem she shouted as the engine thudded noisily ive wasted too much time already ill drop you off wher ever it is you want oh fine just one of those things eh i suppose so it was my fault i shouldnt have picked you up in the first place she laughed it wasnt a nice laugh it was a mocking laugh and it seemed to punch him in the stomach okay he said okay he switched on the headlamps as dusk became night there was no milometer on the dashboard so he didnt know how far theyd travelled but he was sure it was more than sixty miles where is this town he said not much further her voice softened im sorry lee but what is the matter something was wrong he couldnt place it he put it down to his own anger you may not know it he said but i suspect that nearly all the people living here are being deceived do you know the fortress you mean that big building on the rock wastes thats it well theres a group of people there who are duping you and the rest in some way they want to destroy practically the whole of the human race by a particularly nasty method and they want me to do it for them whats that briefly he explained again she laughed by the sound of it youre a fool to fight this man without a navel and his friends you ought to throw in your lot with them you could be top man arent you angry he said in surprise dont you believe me certainly i just dont share your attitude i dont under stand you turning down a chance when its offered id take it as i said you could be top man ive already been top man he said in a manner of speak ing on my own world i dont want that kind of responsibility all i want to do is save something from the mess ive made of civilization youre a fool lee that was it she shouldnt have known him as lee but as bill the name hed introduced himself by he stopped the car sud denly and looked at her suspiciously the truth was dawning on him and it made him feel sick at himself that he could have fallen for her trap youre working for him arent you the man you seem to be exhibiting all the symptoms of persecution mania seward you need a good psychiatrist she spoke coolly and reached into her handbag i dont feel safe with you its mutual he said get out of the car no she said quietly i think well go all the way to the fortress together she put both hands into her bag they came out with two things one was a half bottle of brandy the other was a gun evidently my delay tactics werent effective enough she mocked i thought they might not be so i brought these get out yourself seward youre going to kill me maybe but that isnt what the man wants is it she shrugged waving the gun trembling with anger at his own gullibility and impotence he got out he couldnt think clearly she got out too keeping him covered youre a clever man seward youve worked out a lot there are others here who know what i know what do they know they know about the setup about the conditioning she came round the car towards him shaking her head still keeping him covered she put the brandy bottle down on the seat he went for the gun he acted instinctively in the knowledge that this was his only chance he heard the gun go off but he was forcing her wrist back he slammed it down on the side of the car she yelled and dropped it then he did what he had never thought he could do he hit her a short sharp jab under the chin she crumpled he stood over her trembling then he took her headscarf and tied her limp hands behind her he dragged her up and dumped her in the back of the car he leant down and found the gun he put it in his pocket then he got into the driving seat still trembling he felt something hard under him it was the brandy bottle it was what he needed he unscrewed the cap and took a long drink his brain began to explode even as he reached for the ignition it seemed to crackle and flare like burning timber he grabbed the door handle maybe if he walked around he felt his knees buckle as his feet touched the ground he strained to keep himself upright he forced himself to move round the car when he reached the bonnet the headlamps blared at him blinded him they began to blink rapidly into his eyes he tried to raise his hands and cover his eyes he fell sideways the light still blink ing he felt nausea sweep up and through him he saw the cars licence plate in front of him you you you he put out a hand to touch the plate it seemed normal yet the digits were clocking up like the numbers on an adding machine again his brain exploded a slow leisurely explosion that subsided and brought a delicious feeling of wellbeing green clouds like boiled jade scent of chrysanthemums swaying lilies bright lines of black and white in front of his eyes he shut them and opened them again he was looking up at the blind in his bedroom as soon as he realized he was back seward jumped off the bed and made for the bench where hed left the halffinished tranquilomat he remembered something felt for the gun hed taken off the girl it wasnt there but he felt the taste of the brandy in his mouth maybe it was as simple as that he thought maybe all he needed to get back was alcohol there was sure to be some alcohol in the lab he searched through cupboards and drawers until he found some in a jar he filled a vial and corked it he took off his shirt and taped the vial under his armpitthat way he might be able to trans port it from his world to the other one then he got down to work lenses were reassembled checked new filters went in and old ones came out he adjusted the resonators and amplifiers he was recharging the battery which powered the transistorized circuits when he sensed the mob outside he left the little machine on the bench and went to the control board he flicked three switches down and then on impulse flicked them off again he went back to the bench and unplugged the charger he took the machine to the window he drew the blind up it was a smaller mob than usual evidently some of them had learned their lesson and were now avoiding the laboratory far away behind them the sun glinted on a calm sea he opened the window there was one good way of testing his tranquilomat he rested it on the sill and switched it to attract that was the first necessary stage to hold the mobs attention a faint pleasant humming began to come from the machine seward knew that specially shaped and coloured lenses were whirling at the front the mob looked up towards it but only those in the centre of the group were held the others dived away hiding their eyes seward felt his body tightening growing cold part of him began to scream for the ma he clung to the machines carrying handles he turned a dial from zero to there were units marked on the indicator the machine was now sending at halfstrength seward consoled himself that if any thing went wrong he could not do any more harm to their ruined minds it wasnt much of a consolation he quickly saw that the combined simulated brainwaves sonic vibrations and light patterns were having some effect on their minds but what was the effect going to be they were cer tainly responding their bodies were relaxing their faces were no longer twisted with insanity but was the tranquilomat actually doing any constructive good what it had been designed to do he upped the output to degrees his hand began to tremble his mouth and throat were tight and dry he couldnt keep going he stepped back his stomach ached his bones ached his eyes felt puffy he began to move towards the machine again but he couldnt make it he moved towards the halffull ampoule of ma on the table he filled the blunt hypodermic he found a vein he was weeping as the explosions hit his brain seven this time it was different he saw an army of machines advancing towards him an army of malevolent hallucinomats he tried to run but a thousand electrodes were clamped to his body and he could not move from nowhere needles entered his veins voices shouted seward seward seward the hallucinomats ad vanced shrilling blinking buzzinglaughing the machines were laughing at him seward now he saw farlowes cars registration plate you you you seward you seward his brain was being squeezed it was contracting contracting the voices became distant the machines began to recede when they had vanished he saw he was standing in a circular room in the centre of which was a low dais on the dais was a chair in the chair was the man without a navel he smiled at seward welcome back old boy he said brother sebastian and the woman magdalen stood close to the dais magdalens smile was cool and merciless seeming to anticipate some new torture that the man and brother sebas tian had devised but seward was jubilant he was sure his little tranquilomat had got results i think ive done it he said quietly i think ive built a workable tranquilomat and in a way its thanks to you i had to speed my work up to beat you and i did it they seemed unimpressed congratulations seward smiled the manwithout a navel but this doesnt alter the situation you know just because you have an antidote doesnt mean we have to use it seward reached inside his shirt and felt for the vial taped under his arm it had gone some of his confidence went with the discovery magdalen smiled it was kind of you to drink the drugged brandy he put his hands in his jacket pocket the gun was back there he grinned whats he smiling at magdalen said nervously i dont know it doesnt matter brother sebastian i believe you have finished work on your version of sewards hypnomat i have said the sighing cold voice lets have it in it is a pity we didnt have it earlier it would have saved us time and seward all his efforts the curtains behind them parted and mr hand mr morl and the laughing cavalier wheeled in a huge bizarre machine that seemed to have a casing of highlypolished gold silver and platinum there were two sets of lenses in its domed headlike top they looked like eyes staring at seward was this a conditioning machine like the ones theyd prob ably used on the human populace seward thought it was likely if they got him with that hed be finished he pulled the gun out of his pocket he aimed it at the righthand lens and pulled the trigger the gun roared and kicked in his hand but no bullet left the muzzle instead there came a stream of small brightly coloured globes something like those used in the attraction device on the tranquilomat they sped towards the machine struck it exploded the machine buckled and shrilled it steamed and two discs like lids fell across the lenses the machine rocked backwards and fell over the six figures began to converge on him angrily suddenly on his left he saw farlowe martha and sally step from behind a screen help me he cried to them we cant farlowe yelled use your initiative son initiative he looked down at the gun the figures were coming closer the man without a navel smiled slowly brother sebastian tittered magdalen gave a low mocking laugh that seemed strangely to be a criticism of his sexual prowess mr morl and mr hand retained their mournful and cheerful expressions respectively the laughing cavalier flung back his head andlaughed all around them the screens which had been little more than headhigh were lengthening widening stretching up and up he glanced back the screens were growing he pulled the trigger of the gun again it bucked again it roaredand from the muzzle came a stream of metallicgrey particles which grew into huge flowers the flowers burst into flame and formed a wall between him and the six he peered around him looking for farlowe and the others he couldnt find them he heard farlowes shout good luck son he heard martha and sally crying goodbye dont go he yelled then he realized he was alone and the six were beginning to advance again malevolent vengeful around him the screens covered in weird designs that curled and swirled everchanging were beginning to topple inwards in a moment he would be crushed again he heard his name being called seward seward was it marthas voice he thought so im coming he shouted and pulled the trigger again the man without a navel magdalen brother sebastian the laughing cavalier mr hand and mr morlall screamed in unison and began to back away from him as the guns muzzle spouted a stream of white fluid which floated into the air still the screens were falling slowly slowly the white fluid formed a net of millions of delicate strands it drifted over the heads of the six it began to descend they looked up and screamed again dont seward begged the man without a navel dont old man ill make it worth your while seward watched as the net engulfed them they struggled and cried and begged it did not surprise him much when they began to shrink no they werent shrinkinghe was growing he was grow ing over the toppling screens he saw them fold inwards he looked down and the screens were like cards folding neatly over the six little figures struggling in the white net then as the screens folded down the figures were no longer in sight it got lighter the screens rolled themselves into a ball the ball began to take on a new shape it changed colour and then there it was a perfectly formed human skull slowly horrifyingly the skull began to gather flesh and blood and muscles to itself the stuff flowed over it features began to appear soon in a state of frantic terror seward recognized the face it was his own his own face its eyes wide its lips parted a tired stunned horrified face he was back in the laboratory and he was staring into a mirror he stumbled away from the mirror he saw he wasnt holding a gun in his hand but a hypodermic needle he looked round the room the tranquilomat was still on the windowsill he went to the window there quietly talking among the ruins below was a group of sane men and women they were still in rags still gaunt but they were sane that was evident they were saner than they had ever been before he called down to them but they didnt hear him time for that later he thought he sat on the bed feeling dazed and relieved he dropped the needle to the floor certain he wouldnt need to use it again it was incredible but he thought he knew where he had been the final image of his face in the mirror had given him the last clue he had been inside his own mind the ma was merely a hallucinogenic after all a powerful one evidently if it could give him the illusion of ropemarks on his wrists bites on his neck and the rest he had escaped into a dream world then he wonderedbut why what good had it done he got up and went towards the mirror again then he heard the voice marthas voice seward seward seward listen to me no he thought desperately no it cant be starting again theres no need for it he ran into the laboratory closing the door behind him locking it he stood there trembling waiting for the with drawal symptoms they didnt come instead he saw the walls of the laboratory the silent com puters and meters and dials begin to blur a light flashed on above his head the dead banks of instruments suddenly came alive he sat down in a big chrome padded chair which had originally been used for the treating of testsubjects his gaze was caught by a whirling stroboscope that had appeared from nowhere coloured images began to form in front of his eyes he struggled to get up but he couldnt you you you then the first letter changed to a v vou seward his eyelids fell heavily over his eyes professor seward it was marthas voice it spoke to some one else we may be lucky tom turn down the volume he opened his eyes martha the woman smiled she was dressed in a white coat and was leaning over the chair she looked very tired im not martha professor seward im doctor kalin remember doctor kalin of course his body felt weaker than it had ever felt before he leaned back in the big chair and sighed now he was remembering it had been his decision to make the experiment it had seemed to be the only way of speeding up work on the develop ment of the tranquilomats he knew that the secret of a work able machine was imbedded in the deepest level of his uncon scious mind but however much he triedhypnosis symbol association wordassociation he couldnt get at it there was only one way he could think ofa dangerous experiment for himan experiment which might not work at all he would be given a deepconditioning made to believe that he had brought disaster to the world and must remedy it by devising a tranquilomat things were pretty critical in the world outside but they werent as bad as they had conditioned him to believe work on the tranquilomats was falling behind but there had been no widespread disaster yet it was bound to come unless they could devise some means of masscure for the thousands of neurotics and victims of insanity an antidote for the results of masstension so simply they conditioned him to think his efforts had destroyed civilization he must devise a working tranquilomat they had turned the problem from an intellectual one into a personal one the conditioning had apparently worked he looked around the laboratory at his assistants they were all alive healthy a bit tired a bit strained but they looked relieved how long have i been under he asked about fourteen hours thats twelve hours since the experi ment went wrong went wrong why yes said doctor kalin in surprise nothing was happening we tried to bring you roundwe tried every darned machine and drug in the placenothing worked we expected catatonia at least weve managed to save you well just have to go on using the ordinary methods of research i suppose her voice was tired disappointed seward frowned but he had got the results he knew exactly how to construct a working tranquilomat he thought back of course he said i was only conditioned to believe that the world was in ruins and i had done it there was nothing about about the other world what other world macpherson his chief assistant asked the question seward told them he told them about the man without a navel the fortress the corridors the tortures the landscapes seen from farlowes car the park the maze the vampire mag dalen he told them how in what he now called condition a he had believed himself hooked on a drug called ma but we dont have a drag called ma said doctor kalin i know that now but i didnt know that and it didnt matter i would have found something to have made the journey into the other worlda world existing only in my skull call it condition b if you like or condition x maybe the unknown i found a fairly logical means of making myself believe i was entering another world that was ma by inventing sym bolic characters who were trying to stop me i made myself work harder unconsciously i knew that condition a was going wrong so i escaped into condition b in order to put right the damage by acting out the drama i was able to clear my mind of its confusion i had as i suspected the secret of the tran quilomat somewhere down there all the time condition a failed to release that secret condition b succeeded i can build you a workable tranquilomat dont worry well macpherson grinned ive been told to use my imagination in the past but you really used yours that was the idea wasnt it wed decided it was no good just using drugs to keep us going we decided to use our drugs and hallucinomats directly to condition me to believe that what we feared will happen had happened im glad we didnt manage to bring you back to normality in that case doctor kalin smiled youve had a series of classic if more complicated than usual nightmares the man without a navel as you call him and his allies symbolized the elements in you that were holding you back from the truth diverting you by defeating the man you defeated those elements it was a hell of a way to get results seward grinned but i got them it was probably the only way now we can produce as many tranquilomats as we need the problems over ive in all modesty he grinned saved the world before it needed saving its just as well what about your helpers though said doctor kalin helping him from the chair he glanced into her intelligent mature face he had always liked her maybe he smiled as he walked towards the bench where the experimental tranquilomats were kid out maybe there was quite a bit of wishfulfilment mixed up in it as well its funny how you didnt realize that it wasnt real isnt it said macpherson behind him why is it funny he turned to look at macphersons long worn face who knows whats real macpherson this world that world any other world i dont feel so adamant about this one do you well macpherson said doubtfully i mean youre a trained psychiatrist as well as everything else youd think youd recognize your own symbolic characters i suppose its possible macpherson had missed his point all the same he added i wouldnt mind going back there some day id quite enjoy the exploration and i liked some of the people even though they were probably wishfulfilment figures farlowe father its possible he glanced up as his eye fell on a meter it consisted of a series of codeletters and three digits vou it said now there was farlowes num berplate his mind had turned the v into a y hed probably discover plenty of other symbols around which hed turned into something else in the other world he still couldnt think of it as a dream world it had seemed so real for him it was still real what about the womanmartha doctor kalin said you called me martha as you were waking up well let that one go for the time being he grinned come on weve still got a lot of work to do the golden barge day gave way to night inevitably for the fourth time since widemouthed jephraim tallow had begun his chase he slept at the rudder of his boat trusting to his luck and the next morning he awoke to find himself soaked to the skin but still on course the yellow overalls he wore had not been made for use outdoors and they had given him little protection he had not slept well for his dreams had been scarlet dreams but now that it was morning he could forget what was one mans life how did a single murder matter when the golden barge which was his goal moved surely onwards the rain sliced down out of a grey sky lancing into the waters of the river spattering over the canvas of the boat and a wind was beginning to blow instead of willows rhododendrons now lined the banks of the river they were heavy with the fallen water sinking beneath its sodden weight the wind was rising and bending the bushes into rustling nightmare beasts which reached out to tempt tallow ashore he laughed at them hyster ically and the wind filled his ships sail distending it until the mast creaked in unison with tallows laughter but tallow ceased to laugh when he realized his danger realized that he had no cause for laughter for the wind was driving his vessel towards the luring bushes frantically he attempted to adjust the sail but the rig of the stolen boat was unfamiliar arid in his panic he succeeded only in tangling the knots into a worse mess the wind blew stronger bending the mast swelling the sail like a cannibals belly he tore at the knots until his fingers bled and his nails were creased he had to concentrate on controlling the rudder in order to keep the boat on some kind of course he saw that he was nearing a bend in the river and saw two other things a white flash against the dark green mass of foliage and the golden barge just ahead looming tall with an effort he calmed himself realizing that in his panic he had not sighted his objective the mysterious implacable barge he had killed so that he should be able to follow it and now he dare not let it escape he needed to stay on course just long enough to reach the barge and board her and he knew that he could but even as his boats prow gashed the waters in furious speed he came to the bend in the river and his ship lurched and shuddered to a halt he realized that he had run aground on one of the many hidden sandbars which plagued river traffic angry and screaming his disappointment to the wind and the rain tallow leapt out into the shallow water and attempted to heave the ship off the bar as rain smote him in the face and flayed his skin his efforts were useless in a second the barge had disappeared from his sight and he had sunk to his knees in the water sobbing in frustration the rain began to fall with lessening intensity and the velocity of the wind dropped but still tallow remained on his knees bowed in the swirling dirty water his hands above him gripping the sides of the boat the rain and wind subsided and eventually the sun dissected the clouds the sun shone on the boat on tallow on the river on bushes and trees and on a white house five storeys high which gleamed like the newlywashed face of a child tallow lifted red eyes and sighed he tried once more to move the boat but could not he looked around him he saw the house he would need help with a shrug he splashed knee deep through the water to the bank climbing up its damp crumbling rootriddled earth and cursing his luck tallow in some ways was a fatalist and his fatalism at last came to the rescue of his sanity as ahead of him he saw a wall of redbrick patched with black mossgrowths his mood changed almost instantly and he was once again his old cold cocky self for beyond the wall he could see the head and shoulders of a woman the barge could wait for a little while she was a sharpjawed poutlipped beauty and her eyes were green as scum she wore a battered felt hat and stared at tallow over the short stone wall which reached almost to her shoulder she smiled at him one of her delightfully even teeth was stained brown two others were green matching her eyes tallows senses for women had been dormant to the point of atrophy for years now he savoured the knowledge that he was going to form an attachment for this one for the moment he hugged the knowledge to himself good morning madam he said straddling his legs and making a low ungainly bow my sloop ran aground and im stranded then you must stay with me she smiled again and put her head on one side by way of emphasizing the invitation thats my house over there she stretched a rounded arm and pointed her fingers were long and delicate terminating in purple painted talons the house was the big white one tallow had seen a fine house it is too madam by the looks of it tallow swaggered towards the low wall it is fine she admitted but rather empty i have only two servants not enough tallow frowned not enough he could always catch the barge up he thought he vaulted the wall this was a remarkable feat for one of his slight stature and he achieved it with a delicacy and grace normally alien to him he stood beside her he looked at her from beneath halfclosed lids i would be grateful for a bed for the night he said and help in the morning my ship must be refloated i will arrange it she promised she had mobile lips which moved smoothly around the words as she spoke she was slim waisted and fullhipped her bottom was round and firm beneath a skirt of yellow wool her large breasts pushed at the shining silk of a black blouse and the heels of her shoes were six inches long she turned and headed for the house follow me she said tallow followed marvelling at the way she kept her balance on her high heels without them he thought gleefully she was only an inch or so taller than he she led himthrough the garden of spearlike leaves finally arriving at a sandy road which wound towards the house a twowheeled carriage stood empty drawn by a bored donkey the womans flesh was soft and it itched at tallows fingertips as he helped her into the carriage doing mental somersaults all the while he grinned to himself as he got in beside her and took the reins gee up he shouted the donkey sighed and moved for ward at a tired shuffling trot five minutes later tallow tugged hard at the donkeys reins and brought the cart to a crunchinghalt on the gravel outside the house a flight of solid stone steps led up to big timber doors which were halfopen my home the woman remarked superfluously and tallow felt a disappointed shock at this inanity but the feeling soon passed as it was replaced by his glee for his good fortune your home he yelled hurrah he didnt bother to mask his emotions any more he bounced out of the carriage and helped her from it her legs were wellshaped and trim she smiled and laughed and treated him to a gorgeous display of brown green and white they climbed the steps together leap ing up them like balletdancers with their feet clattering in time her hand slipped into his as they pushed the door open and marched info a hall with rafters lost in gloom it was a shadowy hall hushed as a church dust flew in a single beam of sunlight which entered by way of the door which was appar ently warped for it didnt shut completely dust swirled into tallows nostrils and he sneezed she laughed delightfully my names pandora she told him loudly whats yours tallow he replied his eyes watering and his nose still itching jephraim tallow at your service at my service she clapped her hands and the echoes rever berated around the hall at my service she clapped and laughed until the hall resounded with the applause and laughter of a vast audience a voice like the last trump boomed and crashed into tallows startled eardrums do you require me madam staring through the gloom as the last echo fluttered in distant corners tallow was surprised to see that the hollow trumpet voice emanated from a bent and wizened ancient clad in faded finery of gold and silver tarnished and varnished with long years of wear pandora answered the servant dinner fench she cried dinner for two and make it good yes madam with a swirl of dust the bent one vanished through a barely discernible door one of my servants whispered pandora confidingly she frowned the other ones his wifedamn her she cursed quite viciously softly and sibilantly like a snake spitting tallow knowing nothing of the place wondered how an old woman could arouse such wrath in pandora but a thousand reasons swam into his head and he rejected them all he was not a man to jump to conclusions conclusions were too final they led to death she clutched his hand and led him through the hall to where wide oak stairs twisted upwards come jephraim she murmured come my tender tallow and let us get you dressed tallow recovered his selfconfidence and rushed like a rabbit up the stairway his long legs stepping high they polkad hand in hand to the third floor of the vast dark house their hair his red hers black as jet flew behind them and they laughed all the while happily insensitive to everything but themselves up to the third floor they bounded and she led him to a door one of a number as solid as its fellows he was slightly out of breath for he was not used to climbing so many stairs as she strained to turn the knob on the door using both hands bending her body and screwing up her face until eventually the door creaked open he began to hiccup meanwhile the wind which had driven tallow on to the sand bar was howling around the golden barge as it pushed calmly onwards towards whatever victories or dooms awaited it jephraim whispered pandora as he sat back in his chair sipping brandy from a glass as big as his head he grunted questioningly smiling foolishly the meal had been liberally diluted with nightred wine jephraimwhere are you from she leant forward across the small table she had changed into a dress of dark sentient blue which flowed off her smooth shoulders to cascade like dangerous ice down her body to flare suddenly at the knees she wore two rings on her left hand sapphires and emeralds and around her soft throat hung a thin chain of gold tallows new emotions were rioting through him and a childish awe for his good fortune still stuck in part of his mind even as he stretched but a hand and groped for pandoras taloned fingers pinpricks of excitement and anticipation were becoming too much to bear and his voice throbbedas he spoke echoing his heartbeats from a town many miles away he said and this appeared to satisfy her where were you going jephraim this question was asked idly as if she didnt expect him to answer i wasi amfollowing a golden ship which passed your house just before i ran aground did you see it she laughed and her laughter hurt him causing him to with draw his hand silly tallow she cried no such ship passed and i didnt see it for i was in the garden a long while watch ing the river i never miss the ships you missed this one he muttered glaring into his glass your jokes are hard to understand jephraim she said more softly but im sure ill like them when we know each other better her voice dropped lower and lower until it was almost inaudible but the timbre of it was enough to churn tallows thoughts into other channels almost immediately some of his selfassurance so badly shattered recently returned to him and he folded his ten fingers around the brandy glass lifted it and poured the entire contents down his throat he smacked his lips and gasped then put the glass down with a bang clatter ing the dirty cutlery he wiped his mouth on the back of his hand the scarlet sleeve of his new corduroy jacket somewhat impeding this action and looked around the small candlelit room until it blurred pet tishly he shook his head to clear it and supporting himself with hands spread on the table stood up he looked intently into her eyes and she smiled hesitantly pandora i love you he was relieved now that it was over good she purred that makes it so much easier tallow was too drunk to wonder what it was which would be easier he ignored the statement and rocked towards her she stood up slowly carefully and glided towards him he gathered her in and kissed her throat as she was standing up he couldnt quite reach her mouth her breasts pushed against his chest and her arms slid up his back one hand caressing the nape of his neck the other hand moved startlingly down his back and around his hip ouch he moaned a moment later that ring hurts she pouted then smiled and took her rings off he wriggled in his tight black velvet trousers and wished that he were naked shall we go to bed now she suggested at just the right moment yes agreed tallow with earnest certainty yes she sup ported his reeling body as they left the room and made their way up the flight of stairs to her own bedroom a week throbbed by a bedded week wearing for tallow but delightful pandoras expert lessons had taught him among other things that he was a man a man to boot who had learned to please pandora the week had taught him something else something subtler and he now had a tighter rein on his emotions could control both appetite and expression to a greater degree tallow lay in bed beside a sleeping pandora attempting to shift the sheet which covered her his eyes were as yet unsatiated by the sight of her lying naked and at his mercy the truth was he had to admit that for the most part he was inextricably at her mercy but pandora was a woman and took only the right and honest advantage of her superior position tallow remained in love with her and the love grew strongly and he was content her yielding and her occasional pleas were rare but could be savoured for their rarity weariness however was encroaching to make a wreck of tallow he slept longer made love a trifle less violently though with more skill and even now after ten hours of sleep he did not feel rested but none the less he was content he felt happiness and sometimes sadness when pandora unknowingly outraged him but the joy far outweighed the pain he had just laid bare her breasts when she awoke she blinked and then opened her eyes as widely as she could looked at him looked down and gently drew the sheet back towards her chin tallow grunted his disappointment raised himself on one elbow cushioned his head in his hand and stared down at her good morning he said with mock accusation morning jephraim she smiled like a schoolgirl stirring tenderness and desire in him he flung himself upon her in a flurry of sheeting she laughed gasped was silent for some seconds and then kissed him i earned it didnt i she said staring into his eyes you did he rolled over and sat up in bed you need me dont you she said softly behind him yes he said and then paused thinkinghe had answered the question too quickly before he had considered it again properly he had said at least i think so her voice was still soft unchanged what do you mean you think so sorry he smiled turning towards her and looking down at her sorry i dont know what i meant she frowned then and shifted in the bed i dont know either she said i dont know what you mean what did you mean ive told you he said deciding that he was a fool i dont know she turned over on her side towards the wall away from him either you need me or you dont thats not strictly true tallow sighed i can need you and i cant there are things to need at certain times i need you sometimes im right he thoughtfor it was clear to him now and it had never been so before she was silent its true pandora he knew that he should stop surely you see that its true love isnt everything he mumbled lamely feeling uncertain and beaten isnt it her voice was muffled and cold no he said anger coming to his rescue he got up pulled on his clothes and walked over to the window viciously tearing back the curtains it was raining outside he could see the river in the distance he stood by the window for a few seconds and then turned back to stare at the bed pandora still faced the wall and he couldnt see her expression he stamped from the room on his way to the bathroom he felt troubled and annoyed but he couldnt analyse the feeling he knew somehow that he was right knew that he shouldnt have spoken to her as he had but was glad also that he had done so the floor was cold to his bare feet as he walked and he could hear the rain beating to the ground and on to the roof it was a drab unsettled day and fitting for his mood at breakfast she soon got over her former temper and for the moment at least they had forgotten their earlier conflict what shall we do today jephraim she said putting down her coffee cup in a halfdream not really aware of what he was saying tallow answered on the spur of the moment ride thats what well do you have some horses ive seen them i have but i didnt know you could ride i cant he grinned i cant sweetheart but i can learn of course you can she was now in his mood but what shall we do about the rain to hell with the rain it cant affect us come love to horse he galloped like an idiot from the breakfastroom laughing she ran after him they rode all through the day stopping sometimes to eat and to make love when the sun shone they rode and after two un certain hours tallow soon learned how to sit his mare and to guide her he was still an amateur but a fast learner since the night he had seen the barge he had been learning many things quickly ideas rushed into his open greedy mind and he grate fully absorbed them so they rode through the rain and the sun shine and they laughed and loved together forgetful of anything else tallow with his tiny frame and long legs perched high above the ground on a chestnut mare pandora petite and voracious for his attention sometimes gay often enigmatic always honest pandora a woman they rode for hours until at last they came to a stretch of the river upstream which tallow had passed a week earlier when asleep they came to a hill and breathless and excited fell into one anothers arms dovetailed together and sank on to the damp turf careless and carefree your river whispered pandora some time later ill always think of it as yours now i used to think it was mine but i know it isnt tallow was puzzled he said its everyones riverthats the beauty of it everyones no she said its yours i know its not just mine darling he said tenderly anyone can sail on it bathe in it drink from it thats why its there perhaps she compromised at last perhaps it is but i know what i shall always think the river is your life one day i may make you a present of it sweetheart he smiled and he was right though he didnt know it he stared at the river and then just for a fleeting moment he saw the golden barge sailing calmly as it always did un ruffled he turned to her pointing there he cried excitedly therenow you see i wasnt joking the golden ship but when he looked again it had gone and pandora was getting up walking towards the horses you always spoil things she said you always say some thing to worry me in silence they rode away from the river and tallow thought carefully of the barge and pandora later that night the rift unhealed they sat in front of the diningroom fire morosely drinking she was truculent un approachable he was turbulent wondering if after all the things he wanted were so unattainable so they sat until there was a disturbance outside and tallow went to the window to see what was happening it was dark and he couldnt see much the night was a confusion of laughter and screams flickering torches and shifting shadows tallow saw that a drunken group was coming towards the house he welcomed the interruption visitors he said revellers i dont want to see them why not we could have a party or something shut up she pouted he sighed and went downstairs into the dark cold draughty hall by the time he reached it people were thumping on the halfopen door is anyone in shelter for some poor weary travellers i beg thee laughter are you sure this house belongs to someone a womans voice this answered by another woman yes dear i saw a light in an upstairs window is anyone home weve got plenty of bottles laughter again tallow pulled the door back and stood confronting the inter lopers who worried him they represented a threat which he could not define good evening he said belligerently now good evening my dear sir good evening to you a grin ning patronizing corpulence swathed in extravagant clothing a cloak kneelength boots a tophat bearing a silverworked cane and bowing theatrically can i help you said tallow hoping that he couldnt were lost the man was drunk he swayed towards tallow and stared at him intently his breath stinking of alcohol were lost and have nowhere to go can you put us up this isnt my house said tallow in stupefaction ill see youd better come in anyway howd you get this far by boat boats lots of boats fun until we got lost that is all right tallow walked back up the stairs and rejoined pandora she was still sulking who is it she said petulantly tell them to go away and lets get to bed i agree dearest tallows mood changed to its former state and his quick tongue babbled though he didnt mean what he said but we cant turn them away theyre lost they can sleep here wont bother us will they i suppose id better see them jephraim she got up kissed him and together warmly arm in arm they went downstairs the revellers torches were still burning turning the dusty hall into a madly dancing inferno of leaping light and shudder ing shadow as the fat leader saw pandora and tallow descend the stairs he leered at pandora the lady of the house he bawled to his friends and they laughed uneasily he was em barrassing them now the noise in the dusty cavern of a hall became a zoolike cacophony pandora said politely but without feeling you may stay the night here if you wish we have plenty of beds she turned to go upstairs beds the drunken mob took up the word gleefully chanting it round the hall beds beds beds after a short while the sound became even more meaningless and they subsided into highpitched laughter pandora and tallow stood observing them lets have some light jephraim she suggested with a shrug tallow reluctantly borrowed a torch from a reveller and began to ignite the wicks of the candles the hall erupted with light dazzling the occupants again the gig gling began in the centre of the hall was a long table chairs lining the walls this was the first tune tallow had seen the room lighted grime was everywhere and the paint was peeling mildew had formed in patches on the ceiling and walls and the light only served to pick it out tallow shrugged and moved to return upstairs again but pandora put her hand on his arm well stay for a short while she said i wish shed make up her mind he thought glumly now regretting the impulse which had driven him to allow the people admission they were soft these people soft beyond tallows experience pampered darlings to the last slim brittleeyed women and fat blankeyed men bewilderedly running over the surface of life discontent with their own fearmoulded values and afraid to find new ones fooling themselves that they were alive tallow could only pity them and loathe what they represented every second they remained they drove him into himself retreating into the embracing depths of his own dark soul he continued to stare at them from out of his skull continued to stare as bottles were piled on the table and pandora was lost among the others absorbed into their shallowness tallow was vaguely terrified then but his mind refused to control his body as he stood on the stairs watching them unable to leave or to join them clothes were flung in all directions and tallow saw a blue dress and a black cape flutter outwards together naked bellies wobbled and naked breasts bounced and white unhealthy flesh was a background for dark hair tallow felt ill at last his feet dragged him upwards back to the bedroom his ego had been shattered but the pain of his loss of his humiliation was greater he lay on the bed sobbing thoughtless and emotionful his whole world a timeless flood of selfpity he lay his head throbbing and aching for hours eventually falling into a fitful slumber which lasted another hour when he eventually awoke he was calm he knew that he had done wrong had destroyed part of himself in denying the barge for pandoras love or his own love for pandora he had delayed too long and the barge should be followed if there was still time that was his aim his goal his function in life to follow the barge and to go where it led him immaterial of what other things distracted him he got a large woollen cloak from a cup board and put it around his shoulders then he left perturbed that he would have to pass through the hall on his way out when he readied it he was astounded in the centre of the room was a pulsating pyramid of flesh clean flesh and dirty flesh soft flesh and rough flesh it was ludicrous there were limbs of all descriptions in most peculiar juxtaposition a pair of pink buttocks seemed to spring an arm noses lay upon legs eyes peered from beneath genitals faces on torsos breasts upon toes such a scene might have disgusted tallow instead he was bewildered for the strangest sight of all was the arm which waved at the top of the throbbing human mountain it clutched a corruscating wineglass the fingers were purplepainted talons pandoras fingers every so often the arm would disappear into the pile and the glass would return less full held like libertys torch to its place above the pyramid tallow swallowed his eyes wide on tiptoe his bitterness surg ing inside him once more he circumnavigated the heap and pulled on the door goodnight pandora he called as he left the wineglass waved goodnight jephraim see you later the voice was muffled and slurred tinged with a false gaiety which was not like honest pandora at all normally she was either happy or sad or troubled never false in her feelings no you wont pandora he shouted as he at last pulled the door open and fled into the rainsodden night blindly run ning down the sandy path towards the river running from something which remained inside him which he couldnt flee from which was destroying him and which he was powerless to combat so tallow fled the boat was still on the sandbar halffull of rainwater tallow looked at it dispiritedly then with a shrug he took off his cloak and lowered his legs into the cold murky water he shivered tensed and forced himself forward the boats timber felt good to his hands as he hoisted himself into it he stared through the gloom searching for the baling pans at last he found them and began baling the water over the side when he had finished he swung into the water again and slowly made his way round the ship inspecting it as much as he could in the dim moonlight then he returned to the stern and put his shoulder to it heaving the boat shifted slightly he moved round to the port side and began rocking it shifting some of the compressed sand three hours later the boat was afloat weary with his effort he sank into it and lay on the wet boards halfasleep he even tually arose when he heard someone moving about on the shore levering himself upright he looked over the side and saw pan dora standing there framed against the moonlight her hair wild and ruffled by the wind a mans dark cloak around her jephraim she said im sorryi dont know how it hap pened tallow his heart heavy in him his mind dull said thats all right pandora im going now anyway because ofthat she pointed back to the house no he said slowly at least not just because of that it helped take me with you she repeated humbly ill do whatever you want he was perturbed dont pandora dont lose your respect for my sake he was shaking out the sail goodbye but she flung herself into the water and grasped the side of the boat pulling herself into it with desperate strength go back pan dora he shouted seeing his doom in her action go backgo back its finished youll destroy me and yourself she made her way towards him flinging her bedraggled body at his feet in horrible and uncharacteristic humility take me she moaned the boat was now in midstream making swiftly away from the bank oh god pandora he sobbed dont make mei must follow the barge ill come jephraim darling ill come with you tears paintedhis face in gleaming trails he was breathing quickly his brain in tumult a dozen emotions clashing together making him powerless for any action save speech he gave in suddenly ashamed for her degradation he sank down beside her taking her wet heaving body in his arms and in sympathy with her grief and so locked together in their fear and bewilderment they slept dawn was vicious cloudless bright tallows eyes ached pandora still remained in troubled slumber but she was on the borderline of wakefulness as she sighed and began to struggle towards consciousness an overpowering feeling of pity for her welled up in him then he looked down the river where it stretched straight into the horizon gold glimmered tallow acted it was now or never he picked her up in his arms she smiled in her sleep loving him he wrenched her away from him and hurled her outwards hurled her into the river she screamed suddenly in horror as realization came wolf whose little town are you friend who owns you here wide and strong you have an atmosphere of detached imper manence as you sit in the shallow valley with your bastion of disdainful pines surrounding you with your slashed gashed earth roads and your gleaming graveyards cool under the sun here i stand in your peaceful centre among the low houses looking for your owner night is looming in my minds back waters i stop a longjawed man with downturned sensuous lips he rocks on his feet and stares at me in silence his grey eyes brooding who owns this town i ask him the people he says the residents i laugh at the joke but he refuses to join me does not even smile seriouslytell me who owns this town he shrugs and walks off i laugh louder who owns this town friend who owns it does he hate me without a mood what is a man anyway a man has to have some kind of mood even when he dreams scornfully i laugh at the one who refused to smile and i watch his back as he walks stiffly and selfconsciously over a bridge of wood and metal which spans soft water full of blossom and leaves flowing in the sunlight in my hand is a cool silver flask loaded with sweet fire i know it is there i lift it to my mouth and consume the fire let ting it consume me also blandly we destroy each other the fire and i my stomach is full of flame and my legs are tingling as soft as soda water down to where my feet ache dont leave me sweetheart with your hair of desire and your mockeries hollow in the moaning dawn dont leave me with the salt rain rushing down my cold face i laugh again and repeat the mans words the peoplethe residents ho ho ho but there is no one to hear my laughter now unless there are inhabitants in the white towns curtained dwellings where are you sweet heart wheres your taunting body now and the taste of your fingernails in my flesh harsh smoke drowns my sight and the town melts as i fall slowly down towards the cobbles of the street and a pain begins to inch its way through my stinging face wheres the peace that you seek in spurious godliness of another man a woman why is it never there i regain my sight and look upwards to where the blue sky fills the world until it is obscured by troubled sounds which flow from a lovely face dominated by eyes asking questions which make me frustrated and angry since i cannot possibly answer them not one of them i smile in spite of my anger and say cynically it makes a change doesnt it the girl shakes her head and the worried noises still pour from her mouth lips as red as blood splashed on slender bones a narrow delicate skull who why are you what hap pened to you thats a very personal question my dear i say patroniz ingly but i have decided not to resent it thank you says she are you willing to rise and be helped somehow of course i am but i would not let her know just yet i am seeking a friend who came this way i say perhaps you know her she is fat with my lifefull of my soul she should be easy to recognize noi havent ahwell if you happen to notice her i would appreciate it if you would let me know i shall be in the area for a short while i have become fond of this town a thought strikes me perhaps you own it no please excuse the question if you are embarrassed by it i personally would be quite proud to own a town like this is it for sale do you think come youd better get up you might be arrested up you get there is a disturbing reluctance on the part of the residents to tell me the owner of the town of course i could not afford to buy iti asked cunningly in the hope of discovering who the owner was maybe she is too clever for me the idea is not appealing youre like a dead bird she smiles with your wings broken i refuse her hand and get up quickly lead the way she frowns and then says home i think so off we go with her walking ahead i point upwards look theres a cloud the shape of a cloud she smiles and i feel encouraged to such a degree that i want to thank her we reach her house with its green door opening directly on to the street there are windows with red and yellow curtains and the white paint covering the stone is beginning to flake she produces a key inserts it into the large black iron lock and pushes the door wide open gesturing gracefully for me to enter before her i incline my head and walk into the darkened hall way of the house it smells of lavender and is full of old polished oak and brass plates horsebrasses candlesticks with no candles in them on my right is a staircase which twists up into gloom the stairs covered by dark red carpet there are ferns in vases placed on high shelves several vases of ferns are on the windowsill by the door i have a razor if you wish to shave she informs me luckily for her i am selfcritical enough to realize that i need a shave i thank her and she mounts the stairs wide skirt swinging lead ing me to the upstairs floor and a small bathroom smelling of perfume and disinfectant she switches oh the light outside the blue of the sky is deepening and the sun has already set she shows me the safety razor soap towel she turns a tap and water gushes out into her cupped hand still hot she says turning and closing the door behind her i am tired and make a bad job of shaving i wash my hands as an afterthought and then go to the door to make sure it isnt locked i open the door and peer out into the lighted passage i shout hey and her head eventually comes into sight around another door at the far end of the passage ive shaved go downstairs into the front room she says ill join you there in a few minutes i grin at her and my eyes tell her that i know she is naked beneath her clothes they all are without their clothes and their hair where would they be where is she she came this way i scented her trail right here to this town she could even be hiding inside this woman fooling me she was always clever in her own way ill break her other hand listen to the bones snap and they wont catch me she sucked my life out of me and they blamed me for breaking her fingers i was just trying to get at the ring i gave her it was hidden by the blaze of the others she turned me into a sharptoothed wolf i thunder down the stairs deliberately stamping on them making them moan and creak i locate the front room and enter it deep leather chairs more brass more oak more ferns in smoky glass of purple and scarlet a fireplace without a fire a soft carpet multicoloured a small piano with blackand white keys and a picture in a frame on top of it there is a whiteclothed table with cutlery and plates for two two chairs squat beside the table i stand with my back to the fireplace as i hear her pointed heeled shoes tripping down the stairs good evening i say politely when she comes in dressed in a tight frock of dark blue velvet with rubies around her throat and at her ears there are dazzling rings on her fingers and i shudder but manage to control myself please sit down she repeats the graceful gesture of the hand indicating a leather chair with a yellow cushion do you feel better now i am suspicious and will not answer her it might be a trick question one never knows ill get dinner she tells me i wont be long again ive defeated her she cant win at this rate i consume the foreign meal greedily and only realize afterwards that it might have been poisoned philosophically i reflect that it is too late now as i wait for coffee i will test the coffee and see if it smells of bitter almonds if it does i will know it con tains poison i try to remember if any of the food i have already eaten tasted of bitter almonds i dont think so i feel compara tively safe she brings in the coffee smoking in a big brown earthenware pot she sits down and pours me a cup it smells good and relievedly i discover it does not have the flavour of bitter almonds come to think of it i am not altogether sure what bitter almonds smell like you may stay the night here if you wish there is a spare room thank you i say letting my eyes narrow in a subtle ques tion but she looks away from me and reaches a slim hand for the coffee pot thank you i repeat she doesnt answer me whats her game she takes a breath is about to say something looks quickly at me changes her mind says nothing i laugh softly leaning back in my chair with my hand clasped around my coffee cup there are wolves and there are sheep i say as i have often said which do you think you are neither says she then you are sheep say i the wolves know what they are what their function is i am wolf really she says and it is obvious that she is bored by my philosophy not understanding it you had better go to bed nowyou are tired if you insist i say lightly very well she shows me up to the room overlooking the unlit street and bids me good night closing the door i listen carefully for the sound of a key turning but the sound doesnt come the room contains a high oldfashioned bed a standard lamp with a parchment shade with flowers pressed between two thicknesses an empty bookcase and a wooden chair beautifully carved i feel the chair with my fingertips and shiver with delight at the sen sation i receive i pull back the quilt covering the bed and inspect the sheets which are clean and smell fresh there are two white pillows both very soft i extract myself from my suit taking off my shoes and socks and leaving my underpants on i switch off the light and trembling a little get into the sheets i am soon asleep but it is still very early i am convinced that i shall wake up at dawn i open my eyes in the morning and pale sunshine forces its way between gaps in the curtains i lie in bed trying to go back to sleep but cannot i push away the covers which have slipped partly off the bed and get up i go to the window and look down into the street incredibly a huge hare is loping along the pavement its nose twitching a lorry roars past its gears grating but the hare continues its imperturbable course i am tensed excited i open my door and run along the passage to the womans room enter ing with a rush she is asleep one arm sprawled outwards the hand dangling over the edge of her bed her shoulders pale and alive i take hold of one shoulder in a strong grip designed to hurt her into wakefulness she cries out sits up quivering quick i say come and see there is a hare in the street go away and let me sleep she tells me let me sleep no you must come and look at the big hare in the street how did it get there she rises and follows me back to my room i leap towards the window and see with relief that the hare is still there look i point towards it and she joins me at the window she too is amazed poor thing she gasps we must save it save it i am astounded save it no i will kill it and we can eat it she shudders how could you be so cruel the hare dis appears around a corner of the street i am furious and all the nerves of my body are taut it has gone it will probably be all right she says in a selfconciliatory tone and this makes me more angry i begin to sob with frustra tion she puts a hand on my arm what is the matter i shrug off the hand then think better of it i begin to cry against her breast she pats me on the back and i feel better let me come to bed with you i plead no she says quietly you must rest let me sleep with you i insist but she breaks from my grasp and backs towards the door no rest i follow her my eyes hot in my skull my body full you owe me something i tell her viciously you all do go away she says threateningly desperate and afraid of me i continue to move towards her beyond the door along the passage she starts to run for her room but i run also and catch her i catch her before she reaches the room she screams i clutch at her fingers i bend them back slowly putting my other hand over her mouth to stop her horrible noises the bones snap in the slim pale flesh not all at once you made me wolf i snarl and sheep must die my teeth seek her pounding jugular my nose scents the perfume of her throat i slide my sharp teeth through skin and sinew blood oozes into my mouth as i kill her i sob why did she suck the soul of me from the wounds she made why am i wolf because of her or did it always lurk there needing only the pain she made to release the ferocity but she is dead i had forgotten i had sought her in this pleasant town ah now the other is dead too let murder drown me until i am nothing but a snarling speck harmless and protected by my infinitesimal size ok god my bloody darling consuming passion i travel swiftly and cautiously over the soft dry wood shavings all around me loom the canvascovered piles of timber it is on nights as dark as this that i enjoy my work the fruits of my labours are that much more apparent i feel my mouth go dry as dry as the wood i tread on my breath comes quickly in and out of my lungs my heart pounds heavily against my ribs here is a place a dark quiet place with light dowelling stacked high fine kindling from my special little pocket i extract my shiny petrol lighter press of a thumb scrape of a wheel a random spark shoots from flint to wick and lights the invisible fumes how perfect it is this little pointed flickering flame in my jacket pockets is paper screwed up tight i stuff it into gaps between the heaped dowels now i apply the flame beautifully the fire begins to lick explorative tongues deli cately upwards darting along the wood further and further the delicious smell of woodsmoke fills my lungs i stand back and i want to laugh at the flaming glory i have created it will soon engulf the stacks of timber but now i must run away far away to be found here would mean that my days of creation would be over it is warm near the fire and the night air chills me as i run another big blaze arson strongly suspected is maniac at large jordan mennell reads the headline with a slightly thumping heart a faint smile plays around his wellshaped mouth his eyes too bright for grey eyes scan the columns avidly once more a masterpiece accomplished this makes ten ten great works of heart ten triumphs ten little notebooks with ten collections of clippings pasted neatly in them and they have a name for him now pyro jack his pseudonym tomorrow i try for eleven no more petty ignitions of garden bonfires no more the occasional surreptitiously dropped match in a wastepaper bin big ones from now on vast timber yards rubber dumps petrol reservoirs like god i create the flame which destroys yes i am a creator and a destroyer the power is in my hands the glory of leaping yelling roaring soaring flames the red yellow and blue the gold and the silver the tall columns of smoke and the red glow on the skyline and frantic terrified little men hopping about impotent and frightened tomorrow the eleventh and greatest ever creation tomorrow dennissens the furniture store no watchman quite safe eight storeys of combustibles a fitting monument to my power today dull wood and fabric lifeless tomorrowa glorious sentient mountain he pulls on the black trousers the dark shirt the softsoled shoes feels for the lighter checks for paper paper safe and crinkly against his thigh lighter hard and smooth he goes out of the brown and grubby back door from which the paint is peeling he turns the rusty key in the stiff lock picks a silent path through the rubble of the yard past the dilapidated shed with the door which hangs on one hinge over the leaning fence and into the narrow cindered alley softly he crunches along keeping to the maze of alleyways which run between the identical banks of houses bright lights of the high street before him a sudden dash across it into the gloom of another narrow alley but this one is of firm concrete a wall on one side a tall corrugatediron fence on the other the fence is pointed at the top like triangular fingers clutching for the sky panting now after the exertion of the swift run across the deserted main street a whitepainted sign white foam on the undulating sea of the corrugated fence he removes his jacket with a quick movement he sends the jacket sailing upwards so that it falls and hangs on the barbs of the fence an agile jump and his hands are on the top of the fence padded by his jacket with little obvious effort he hauls himself carefully over the fence and hanging for a moment by one hand grasps his jacket with the other and drops the jacket comes with him but it rips loudly as it comes he put it on again and looks around him he can guess what the dark silhouettes are old chests of drawers ancient divans bedsprings now he takes out his sharp steel knife and begins to force the lock on the door he hacks at the wood which surrounds the lock and knows that this damage may be discovered good he thinks they will know that i am responsible i am in a dark passage full of the odours of woodpolish and veneer and cloth i walk along the passage and find the stairway which leads down into the basement i have been here before i bought a chair in the secondhand department that depart ment is in the basement i know what i must do i must ignite the furniture in the basement then i must go quickly up to the eighth floor and light the fabrics they keep there then i must open some windows so that a breeze will fan the flames i take out my small pockettorch and flash it around the basement a carpet on the floor wardrobes tallboys bookcases many of them fraillooking all the better a cupboard painted dull cream and very flimsy the ideal spot i take the paper from my pocket and put it along the bottom shelf of the cup board some curtains partition off another piece of the depart ment i walk over to them and rip them down they tear with a tiny tinkle of curtain rings stuffing the curtains into other shelves of the cupboard i take out my lighter a great feeling of elation and power begins to surge through my body i breathe heavily my hand shakes a little my heart is beating a frenzied tattoo against my ribcage this is the ultimate of sensations almost all i desire i press my thumb on the lighter nothing happens a brief spark but that is all i press it again there is a tiny snap i know that sound the sound when the flint is finished i moan in anguish and pass my hands through my hair in violent frustration i glare with rage at the cupboard and the cupboard bursts into flames not with a delicate flicker of light but with a sudden snap and a roar and it is burning burning so brightly i stare at a cabinet and will it to burn but nothing happens then i realize that the flames are licking nearer to me i turn and run from the basement up the stairs three at a time open ing windows at every landing up another flight of stairs and another and another until i am breathing very heavily and irregularly and i am at the top of the building but i realize i have no matches no lighter nothing with which to create another blaze i feel frustrated among the rolls of cloth the cotton and the nylon which will burn so well i feel like a writer without a pen an artist without his brushes the canvas is before me but i have nothing with which to paint it to turn it into glowing beauty anger once more consumes me is god so frustrated when he works his miracles i wish with all my heart that the cotton and the nylon will burn and it does it begins to burn all around me quite suddenly i stand for a long moment and revel in the passionate wonder of the dancing flames i breathe in the smell of the burning fabric then i realize that if i stay and watch i will no longer be alive no longer will i be able to create more grandeur and mag nificence i turn and dash down the stairs as i reach the last flight i see a glow a glorious glow in the basement i fling open the door through which i entered and rush out into the yard the fence stops me why hadnt i thought about the fence before leering jeering fence my teeth clench tightly twisting my mouth i sob in anger and the fence begins to melt a hole appears in it drops of white hot metal fall from the edges of the hole i dash through howl ing as a piece of molten iron drops on to my shoulder and sets my jacket ablaze i tear off the garment and fling it behind me as i run down the alley the way i came no one is in the high street i run across the road into the safety of the alleyways behind the rows of houses i moan softly to myself the pain in my shoulder is agonizing jordan mennell sits in the shabby armchair reading his paper he is dressed only in a pair of pyjama trousers and his right shoulder is crudely smothered in a large piece of medical plaster which is wrinkled and dirty the same faint smile is on his face the same bright light in his eyes he is reading his latest reviews one of the most disastrous fires in south london who is pyro jack says one critic praise indeed the critic mentions that the police suspect arson once more and pyro jack as the public knows jordan mennell is credited the eleventh big fire in the area within two weeks jordan mennell has been able to see the flames from his bedroom window he decides that this was the biggest his unnamed critic agrees and now jordan mennell has the power to create more great fires wherever he pleases if his anger is sufficiently roused he supposes he can start a blaze anywhere he wishes he is content the pain in his shoulder is great but it will go away soon his eyes follow the frontpage columns reading the speculations and assertions he comes to a paragraph and the smile clears from his mouth as it opens slightly the police have a clue a charred jacket which was left on the scene of the fire for a moment jordan mennell knows concern but then he is his old self his old powerful self with his new talents he can defy the police even though they may catch him he knows what he is capable of now concentration will help him channel his talent he will not need to feel anger there will be other emotions concentration and power he has both i am dressing ready to go to work when there comes a terse knocking on the door of my house i am puzzled but i finish dressing before i walk down the narrow stairs which creak and reach out my hand to the handle of the door as i turn it i have an inkling of who my caller is i open the door slowly and con front the man who stands on my step his left foot close to a bottle of milk and a carton of eggs his right foot on the cracked concrete of my path his trousers are black like his shoes his raincoat is khaki and grubby he wears a dark jacket a striped shirt and a blue tie he has a double chin and a small moustache and his eyes are deep blue under thick eyebrows on top of his head is a brown felt trilby he is i feel certain a plainclothes policeman yes i enquire shortly mr jordan mennell he knows who i am but i answer him all the same yes i tell him i know the next words before he speaks them i am a police officer i wonder if i might come in and ask you a few questions his voice is gruff and he attempts a politeness which is not in his nature there is a rock core beneath this very thin veneer what else can i say but very well he enters and i lead him into my small sittingroom i indicate a chair and the movement sends spasms of pain through my throbbing shoulder i manage to smile what can i do for you officer looking for burglars no sir this he says slowly its about the big fire at dennissens i read about it this morning i say keeping perfect control of myself a terrible catastrophe yes sir the whole place was gutted your jacket was found nearby this is an attempt to shock me a bluff but i am ready for this policeman with his shallow cunning my jacket i manage to seem astounded but that is impossible your name was on a tag fixed inside the jacket sir most of the right side of the jacket was burned but much of it was left when we found it perhaps you would like to come along to the station and identify the jacket sir i feel anger coursing inside me but i control my emotion and smile again very well officer but i am sure you are mis taken what can they do to me anyway i am invincible we reach the redbrick policestation and walk together along a cold marble passage up a short flight of stairs and into a warm room there is a gasfire burning against one wall a desk as before it and a coatrack beside the entrance to the room the desk has wire trays and papers on it and a parcel there is a small window which looks out on to the street a grey street with an occasional dullcoloured car flashing by or a darkly dressed man these people should feel honoured that i bring such magnificent colour into their lives but instead they resent me it is wrong but i must accept it the policeman walks over to the desk after shutting the door behind us he unwraps the parcel and discloses the remains of the coat i wore last night i feel annoyed because i have been so careless i had assumed that the jacket would have burned to ashes i feel another upsurge of power within me just as a uniformed policeman enters he begins to tidy up the desk that is my coat i say after having glanced at it and i add grandly i was responsible for all eleven fires you have been worrying about i shall also be the cause of many more pyro jack my god says the younger uniformed police man i bow slightly to him as he makes for the door with an armful of papers bent on telling the news to his companions no doubt after all i am a personality whose work has been very much in the public eye recently they may ask me for my auto graph i shall refuse however i am still angry but manage to retain a mask of calm the policeman is visibly shocked by my statement but he recovers his composure enough to say in which case mr mennell perhaps youd like to make a statement i have made all the statement i wish to make i reply now i must leave oh no you dont he moves forward to stop me as i make for the door i wheel around and glare at him if only he would burn too it would be easier for me he shrieks horribly as the flames lick at his flesh but he has stopped by the time i reach the entrance of the police station stop him thats pyro jack the young policeman yells shrilly excitedly another policeman entering the front of the building moves forward to stop me i burn his uniform he begins to beat frantically at the flames i walk calmly out of the place and stroll along the street a few minutes later a policecar pulls up beside the pavement i melt it the men inside scream in terror i laugh out loud glorying in my magnificent power the instinct of selfpreservation is a wonderful thing people rushing people shouting people pushing people grasping people burning brightly like giant skipping fireflies a glorious dance of death i walk on down the long bricklined avenues i stride along burning and melting anyone or anything which comes in my way i can conquer the world and turn it into leaping flames like a second sun it shall burn in the heavens as it did millions of years ago i thrill jubilantly and my steps are light and buoyant an hour passes then manlike misshapen things shuffle clumsily towards me they have a single broad eye and carry guns in thickfingered hands stop mennell stop or we shoot asbestos of course i see it now i cannot burn asbestos and those guns can kill me i shudder and wish that the guns would catch fire too they melt but the men in the asbestos suits draw nearer they reach out their coarse ungainly hands to grasp me i draw back the indignity of it all appals me i run away from them towards a tall building a tall white building the public library a woman shrieks as i rush inside but i ignore her and run on the clumping of my pursuers boots echoes down the corri dor towards me i dash into a highroofed room lined with book shelves the men come nearer and nearer i stare wildly around me looking for a route of escapebut i have entered through the only door framed in it now are the three asbestosclad monsters it is unfair they should herald me as master of the world not treat me as if i were an abnormal beast i am a supernormal man they spread out their arms and move in a cautious semicircle towards me i feel enraged at myself and admit that my own blind folly has led me to this trap back get back i roar my voice reverberating round the lofty room back or i will destroy you still they come nearer light glinting on their cyclops eyes their faceplates i scream at them but the fools still advance i deserve to bum myself for my negligence a flicker of flame appears on my trousers runs sensuously up my leg caresses my thigh frantic ally i attempt to beat it out but it is too late i can start fires but cannot extinguish them i have never wanted to i glare at the books voltaire dickens dostoevsky shakes peare conrad hemingway surround me glaring back mocking me their work will last they seem to say mine is finished my anger sets tongues of orange flame writhing around the books everywhere on the shelves the books begin to burn i feel the heat of my flaming clothes the pain of the fire softly at first i begin to laugh i have achieved some small measure of triumph the ruins maldoon picked his way over the ruins his sombre face speckled with gleaming drops of sweat as if he had covered it with jewels the ruins went away from him in all directions beneath the blue and glowing sky spikes of masonry jumbled concrete pools of ash so that the whole bleak landscape took on the aspect of seacarved rocks at low tide the sun shone and the ruins lay peacefully beneath pale shadows having nothing ominous or mysterious about them maldoon felt safe in the ruins he took off his jacket and sat on a slab of concrete from which protruded rusted wires curling back on themselves like a sculpture depicting space and time in fact the ruins were that a mighty sculpture a monument created by the random and ambivalent machinations of mankind a monument to time and space and to the sacrifices men had made to understand it maldoon realized his thoughts were rambling he lit a cigarette and drank some water from his flask he had been travelling over the ruins for a long time search ing for signs of life but finding nothing he was regretting the notion that had sent him into the ruins there were no signs of the previous explorers who had not returned no mark scratched on stone no note no shred of cloth no skeleton the ruins were barren maldoon stood up putting his flask away and dropping his cigarette into a crevice he stared ahead of him at the jagged horizon turned his body round the strange thing was that his view to the horizon was never interrupted no crumpled build ing or collapsing wall ever blocked his vision the horizon was on all sides giving him the peculiar sensation of standing in the centre of a huge disc which drifted in an infinity of blue sky he frowned the sun was directly overhead and he had no idea which direction he had come from now that he considered it he couldnt remember the sun changing its position or for that matter night ever falling hadnt the light always been so yet he thought he had been travelling for several days slowly he began to make his way across the ruins again stumbling sometimes halffalling jumping from slab of masonry to pile of broken bricks leaning against the shattered wall of a house with one hand as he inched his way around the ashpools which he mistrusted though there was no cause for his wariness as he remembered at length something close to panic began to fill him and he wished very strongly that he had not come to the ruins wished that he was back amongst people again amidst orderly streets of neat houses and solid wellfilled shops he looked about him hopefully and as if his wish had been answered by some magical spirit he saw on the horizon a line of tall com pletelooking buildings which might possibly be part of a town his speed increased his progress was no longersuch hard going and he noted laughing at himself for his earlier fancies the sun was beginning to set with luck he could make the town before night he began to leap from point to point but he had misjudged his distance from the town and night came while he was still about a mile away but he was heartened further by the sight of the lights shining out of the buildings perhaps this was even the town he had left one town was much like another seen from the distance with the lights to guide him he was soon at the towns outskirts here the streets were deserted though illuminated bysplendid lamps and he guessed that the inhabi tants had gone to bed getting closer to the citycentre he heard traffic noises and saw cars moving through the streets people on the boulevards cafes open for business he ignored the notion that there was something incomplete about the city he was tired and was seeing things in a peculiar perspective also the hot sun of the day might well have given him sunstroke the city was new to him though familiar enough in its general layout it was like most cities he knew planned around a central square with the main streets radiating from the square like the spokes from a wheel with an outer circle of suburbs maldoon entered a cafe and ordered a meal the proprietor was an old man with a gnomish face and a deferential manner he put the plate of food before maldoon averting his eyes maldoon began to eat presently a girl came into the cafe glanced around at the few available seats and chose one opposite maldoon is this seat taken she asked him he waved his fork and shook his head his mouth too full for speech she smiled and sat down daintily she picked up the menu and studied it giving her order to the proprietor who received it with a little bow and hurried back to the kitchen its a beautiful night for the time of the year maldoon said isnt it ah yes she appeared to be confused im sorry he said i hope you dont think im no no i have just come in from the ruins he told her i was doing a bit of exploring they stretch for miles and miles sometimes i think they must cover the planet does anyone know she laughed you look tiredhadnt you better get some sleep im a stranger here can you recommend an hotel not really being a resident as it were i dont know much about the hotels theres one up the road though that looks all right ill try that then her meal was brought for her she thanked the proprietor with a quick smile he saw that she had ordered the same meal he let her eat without interruption now that he was seated his body felt numb with tiredness he looked forward to a good nights sleep the girl got up she looked at him with curiosity id better show you where that hotel is she smiled sympathetically oh thanks he got up and left the cafe with her as they walked along the street he thought of something shouldnt he have paid for his meal he couldnt remember but the owner of the cafe wouldnt have let him walk out like that anyway so it must be all right he walked along beside the girl his shoulders feeling as if they were carrying a tremendous weight his muscles aching and his legs weak how had he managed to cross such a huge area of the ruins surely he hadnt walked all that way what way how much way where way are you sure you can make it said the girl distinctly her lips close to his ear she spoke as if repeating herself yes well come on its not much further he followed her but now he was crawling he heard a voice that was not his own crying can somebody give me a hand he lay on the uneven surface of the ruins and the sun was directly over his head he turned and saw the horizon in the far distance he turned his eyes in the other direction and there too were ruins stretching to the horizon he felt like a giant spread eagled and crucified on the ruins as he pushed himself into a sitting position his body seemed to diminish until he was nor mal size again normal size what was normal size what yardstick had he with which to measure the ruins they were of all sizes all shapes yet not one of them however high blocked his view of the horizon he had lost his jacket and his cigarettes he stood up un steadily and stared around him was he some kind of outcast he couldnt remember there had to be some reason for his being here someone had put him here people from the city had taken the trouble to trans port him here or had they and if they had why had they the problem did not concern him for very long he began to move over the ruins once again pausing sometimes to inspect a building that seemed to have been sliced down the centre leaving its floors intact and exposed like those of a dolls house yet he could find no clue to answer any of the questions which drifted and dispersed in his mind by now he had forgotten about the city even had forgotten that he had had a jacket that he had smoked cigarettes felt no need for either later he sat down on a pile of broken tiles and looked around him to his left a tower leaned though it seemed that some thing had crushed it from two angles it still stood upright his logic told him that it should have fallen yet the tower was frozen there he stopped looking at it but too late to stop the rising sensation of fear which the sight created he got up and walked carefully away from the tower not looking back and then broke into a stumbling run but he saw that all the buildings seemed about to fall all the towers and houses and columns were pitched at an angle which said that they must fall why hadnt he noticed it before what was wrong with the fear his knowledge of his identity began to reemerge he remembered his name and a little of the past as far back as his visit to the city then he remembered his dayslong journey over the ruins beneath a sun that did not set a sky that did not change seeing on all sides the horizon which should have been obscured by the great piles of ruined architecture and yet was not he stopped shaking with hatred of the ruins striving to bring back a memory of before the ruins but he could not what was this dream drugvision madness surely there was something more than the ruins had the city been just an illusion he closed his eyes his body tottering in the darkness which came with the closing of his eyes he said to himself well maldoon do you still insist on continuing this experiment do you still wish to abolish identity and time and space as illusion creating illusions and he called back to himself aloud what do you mean what do you mean and he opened his eyes again and there were the bright ruins sharp beneath the great pale sun in the blue sky now slowly he began to calm his questions and his memories for what they were worth drifting apart he steadied himself on the ruins and walked towards a parti cularly large ashpool he stopped when he reached it he stared down into it he put his fingers to his lips and mused over the ashpool he picked up a piece of brick and flung it down into the grey ash when it reached the surface the brick disappeared without disturbing the ash he took another brick and another and hurled them down the same thing happened the same thing didnt happen a shadow fell across him he looked up and saw a tall build ing rising above him it consisted of a huge shaft built of glass bricks with a series of platforms going up and up until at the top there was the last platform with a dome over it a man stood there beckoning to him he ran towards the tower found he could spring on to the first platform and from that one to the next until he reached the platform covered by the dome a man similar to a frog was waiting for him look down there maldoon he said maldoon looked out over the neat city spread below each block was of exactly the same dimensions each one was square the man waved his reptilian hand the light shone through it grey as the ash a country is like a woman said the man look down there it wants to be subdued wants to be bested by a strong man i did it i quieted the countrys perturbation and raped it the frogman looked selfsatisfied its peaceful said maldoon the most peaceful country in the system the mailfrog quipped the most peaceful system in the country who are you maldoon either you or me said maldoon forgetting his name jump maldoon said the man similar to a frog maldoon merely stood there jump he began to clamber around the ashpool his name was a throb in his head merely a throb in his head maldoon maldoon maldoon had it ever been his name perhaps not perhaps it had always been maldoon maldoon merely a throb in his head yet apart from the ruins and the light there was nothing else to know he paused was that a memory that at the back there out maldoon maldoon out maldoon concentrate maldoon the ruins appeared to blur for a moment and he stared at them sharply suspiciously they seemed to be folding them selves around him no he was folding himself around them he flowed around them over them through them maldoon the cry from somewhere was imperious desperate ironic yes he thought which way all or nothing maldoon he cried to himself nothing or nothing all or all out here is in here and it is infinite he remembered or was told he could not tell with relief he was glad to be back things were right again he paused and sat on a piece of broken concrete which sprouted spliced hawsers and which changed to a mound of soft soil with reeds growing from it below him was the cityroofs chimneys churchspires parks cinemas smoke drifting fami liar yet not what he wanted he got up from the mound and began to walk down the path towards the city still only halfaware of who he was why he was what he was and how he was why do i tire myself out trying he thought one day i shant be able to exert enough will to pull myself back and theyll find me up here either raving or curled up in a neat little bundle yet he could not decide still which was true the city below or the ruins are they both real he thought as he walked off the grass and on to the road leading into the city he sauntered along the road passing under a railway bridge of thick girders and peeling green paint turned a corner into a sidestreet which was full of the smoky smell of autumn the houses were of redbrick and terraced with tiny gardens submerged beneath huge overgrown hedges behind one of the hedges he heard children playing he stopped and put his head round the hedge watching them with their coloured bricks building and pushing them down again when one of the children noticed him and looked up he pulled his head back and walked on along the street but he was not to escape with impunity the child cried its him and followed him along the street with its com panions chorusing rhythmically mad maldoon mad mal doon mad maldoonhes a loon and laughing at this old jest he pretended not to notice them they only followed him to the end of the street and he was grateful for this at least it was getting late dusk was falling over the houses his footfalls echoed among the roofs clattering hollowly from chimney pot to chimney pot mad maldoon mad maldoon madmaldoonmaldoonmaldoon heartbeats joined in maldoon maldoon headbeats mal doon maldoon and the houses were still there but superimposed on the ruins the echoes swimming amongst their unreal chim ney pots the dusk gave way to night the night to light and slowly the houses vanished the bright ruins stretched away never obscuring his view of the horizon the blue blue sky was above and the sun which did not change its position the ashpools he avoided the tumbling ruins fixed and frozen in time and space did not fall what caused the ruins he had completely forgotten there were just the ruins now as the sky and the sun went out but the light remained just the sound of some unseen surf pounding at the last vestiges of his identity maldoon maldoon maldoon ruins past ruins present ruins future he absorbed the ruins and they him he and they went away for ever for now there was no horizon the mind could clothe the ruins but now there was no mind soon there were no ruins the pleasure garden of felipe sagittarius the air was still and warm the sun bright and the sky blue above the ruins of berlin as i clambered over piles of weed covered brick and broken concrete on my way to investigate the murder of an unknown man in the garden of police chief bismarck my name is minos aquilinas top metatemporal investigator of europe and this job was going to be a tough one i knew dont ask me the location or the date i never bother to find out things like that they only confuse me with me its instinct win or lose theyd given me all the information there was the dead man had already had an autopsy nothing unusual about him except that he had paper lungs disposable lungs that pinned him down a little the only place i knew of where they still used paper lungs was rome what was a roman doing in berlin why was he murdered in police chief bismarcks garden hed been strangled that id been told it wasnt hard to strangle a man with paper lungs it didnt take long but who and why were harder questions to answer right then it was a long way across the ruins to bismarcks place rubble stretched in all directions and only here and there could you see a landmark what was left of the reichstag the brandenburg gate the brechtsmuseum and a few other places like that i stopped to lean on the only remaining wall of a house took off my jacket and loosened my tie wiped my forehead and neck with my handkerchief and lit a cheroot the wall gave me some shade and i felt a little cooler by the time i was ready to press on as i mounted a big heap of brick on which a lot of blue weeds grew i saw the bismarck place ahead built of heavy black veined marble in the kind of valhallaolympus mixture they went in for it was fronted by a smooth green lawn and backed by a garden that was surrounded by such a high wall i only glimpsed the leaves of some of the foliage even though i was looking down on the place the thick grecian columns flanking the porch were topped by a baroque facade covered in basreliefs showing men in horned helmets killing dragons and one another apparently indiscriminately i picked my way down to the lawn and walked across it then up some steps until id crossed to the front door it was big and heavy bronze i guessed with more basreliefs this time of cleanshaven characters in more ornate and complicated armour with twohanded swords and riding horses some had lances and axes i pulled the bell and waited i had plenty of time to study the pictures before one of the doors swung open and an old man in a semimilitary suit holding himself straight by an effort raised a white eyebrow at me i told him my name and he let me in to a cool dark hall full of the same kinds of armour the men on the door had been wearing he opened a door on the right and told me to wait the room i was in was all iron and leather weapons on the walls and leathercovered furniture on the carpet thick velvet curtains were drawn back from the window and i stood looking out over the quiet ruins smoked another stick popped the butt in a green pot and put my jacket back on the old man came in again and i followed him out of that room along the hall up one flight of the wide stairs and in to a huge less cluttered room where i found the guy id come to see he stood in the middle of the carpet he was wearing a heavily ornamented helmet with a spike on the top a deep blue uniform covered in badges gold and black epaulettes shiny jackboots and steel spurs he looked about seventy and very tough he had bushy grey eyebrows and a big carefully combed moustache as i came in he grunted and one arm sprang into a horizontal position pointing at me herr aquilinas i am otto von bismarck chief of berlins police i shook the hand actually it shook me all over quite a turn up i said a murder in the garden of the man whos supposed to prevent murders his face must have been paralysed or something because it didnt move except when he spoke and even then it didnt move much quite so he said we were reluctant to call you in of course but i think this is your speciality maybe is the body still here in the kitchen the autopsy was performed here paper lungs you know about that i know now if ive got it right you heard nothing in the night oh yes i did hear something the barking of my wolf hounds one of the servants investigated but found nothing what time was this time what did the clock say about two in the morning when was the body found about ten the gardener discovered it in the vine grove right lets look at the body and then talk to the gardener he took me to the kitchen one of the windows was opened on to a lush garden full of tall brightly coloured shrubs of every possible shade an intoxicating scent came from the garden it made me feel randy i turned to look at the corpse lying on a scrubbed deal table covered in a sheet i pulled back the sheet the body was naked it looked old but strong deeply tanned the head was big and its most noticeable feature was the heavy black moustache the body wasnt what it had been first there were the marks of strangula tion around the throat as well as swelling on wrists forearms and legs which seemed to indicate that the victim had also been tied up recently the whole of the front of the torso had been opened for the autopsy and whoever had stitched it up again hadnt been too careful what about clothes i asked the police chief bismarck shook his head and pointed to a chair standing beside the table that wasall we found there was a pair of neatly folded paper lungs a bit the worse for wear the trouble with disposable lungs was that while you never had to worry about smoking or any of the other causes of lung disease the lungs had to be changed regularly this was expensive particularly in rome where there was no statecontrolled lung service as there had been in most of the european citystates until a few years before the war when the longerlasting polythene lung had superseded the paper one there was also a wristwatch and a pair of red shoes with long curling toes i picked up one of the shoes middle eastern workmanship i looked at the watch it was heavy old tarnished and russian the strap was new pigskin with made in england stamped on it i see why they called us i said there were certain anachronisms bismarck admitted this gardener who found him can i talk to him bismarck went to the window and called felipe the foliage seemed to fold back of its own volition and a dark haired young man came through it he was tall longfaced and pale he held an elegant watering can in one hand he was dressed in a darkgreen highcollared shirt and matching trousers we looked at one another through the window this is my gardener felipe sagittarius bismarck said sagittarius bowed his eyes amused bismarck didnt seem to notice can you let me see where you found the body i asked sure said sagittarius i shall wait here bismarck told me as i went towards the kitchen door okay i stepped into the garden and let sagittarius show me the way once again the shrubs seemed to part on their own the scent was still thick and erotic most of the plants had dark fleshy leaves and flowers of deep reds purples and blues here and there were clusters of heavy yellow and pink the grass i was walking on seemed to crawl under my feet and the weird shapes of the trunks and stems of the shrubs didnt make me feel like taking a snooze in that garden this is all your work is it sagittarius i asked he nodded and kept walking original i said never seen one like it before sagittarius turned then and pointed a thumb behind him this is the place we were standing in a little glade almost entirely surrounded by thick vines that curled about their trellises like snakes on the far side of the glade i could see where some of the vines had been ripped and the trellis torn and i guessed there had been a fight i still couldnt work out why the victim had been untied before the murderer strangled him it must have been before or else there wouldnt have been a fight i checked the scene but there were no clues through the place where the trellis was torn i saw a small summerhouse built to represent a chinese pavilion all red yellow and black lacquer with highlights picked out in gold it didnt fit with the architecture of the house whats that i asked the gardener nothing he said sulkily evidently sorry id seen it ill take a look at it anyway he shrugged but didnt offer to lead on i moved between the trellises until i reached the pavilion sagittarius followed slowly i took the short flight of wooden steps up to the veranda and tried the door it opened i walked in there seemed to be only one room a bedroom the bed needed mak ing and it looked as if two people had left it in a hurry there was a pair of nylons tucked half under the pillow and a pair of mans underpants on the floor the sheets were very white the furnishings very oriental and rich sagittarius was standing in the doorway your place i said no he sounded offended the police chiefs i grinned sagittarius burst into rhapsody the languorous scents the very menace of the plants the heaviness in the air of the garden must surely stir the blood of even the most ancient man this is the only place he can relax this is what im employed for why he gives me my head has this i said pointing to the bed anything to do with last night he was probably here when it happened but i sagittarius shook his head and i wondered if there was anything hed meant to imply which id missed i saw something on the floor stooped and picked it up a pendant with the initials eb engraved on it in gothic script whos eb i said only the garden interests me mr aquilinas i do not know who she is i looked out at the weird garden why does it interest you whats all this for youre not doing it to his orders are you youre doing it for yourself sagittarius smiled bleakly you are astute he waved an arm at the warm foliage that seemed more reptilian than plant and more mammalian in its own way than either you know what i see out there i see deepsea canyons where lost submarines cruise through a silence of twilit green threatened by the waving tentacles of predators halffish halfplant and watched by the eyes of longdead mermen whose blood went to feed their young where squids and rays fight in a graceful dance of death clouds of black ink merging with clouds of red blood drifting to the surface sipped at by sharks in passing where they will be seen by mariners leaning over the rails of their ships maddened the mariners will fling themselves over board to sail slowly towards those distant plantcreatures already feasting on the corpse of squid and ray this is the world i can bring to the land that is my ambition he stared at me paused and said my skull its like a monstrous goldfish bowl i nipped back to the house to find bismarck had returned to his room he was sitting in a plush armchair a hidden hifi playing of all things a ravel string quartet no wagner i said and then whos eb later he said my assistant will answer your questions for the moment he should be waiting for you outside there was a car parked outside the house a battered volks wagen containing a neatly uniformed man of below average height a small toothbrush moustache a stray lock of black hair falling over his forehead black gloves on his hands which gripped a military cane in his lap when he saw me come out he smiled said aha and got briskly from the car to shake my hand with a slight bow adolf hitler he said captain of uniformed detectives in precinct xii police chief bismarck has put me at your service glad to hear it do you know much about him hitler opened the car door for me and i got in he went round the other side slid into the driving seat the chief he shook his head he is somewhat remote i do not know him wellthere are several ranks between us usually my orders come from him indirectly this time he chose jo see me himself and give me my orders what were they these orders simply to help you in this investigation there isnt much to investigate youre completely loyal to your chief i take it of course hitler seemed honestly puzzled he started the car and we drove down the drive and out along a flat white road surmounted on both sides by great heaps of overgrown rubble the murdered man had paper lungs eh he said yes guess he must have come from rome he looked a bit like an italian or a jew eh i dont think so what made you think that the russian watch the oriental shoes the nose that was a big nose he had and they still have paper lungs in moscow you know his logic seemed a bit offbeat to me but i let it pass we turned a corner and entered a residential section where a lot of buildings were still standing i noticed that one of them had a bar in its cellar how about a drink i said here he seemed surprised or maybe nervous why not so he stopped the car and we went down the steps into the bar a girl was singing she was a plumpish brunette with a small good voice she was singing in english and i caught the chorus nobodys grievin for steven and sterne aint grievin no more for steve took his life in a prison cell and johnny took a new whore it was the latest hit in england we ordered beers from the bartender he seemed to know hitler well because he laughed and slapped him on the shoulder and didnt charge us for the beer hitler seemed embarrassed who was that i asked oh his name is weill i know him slightly more than slightly it looks like hitler seemed unhappy and undid his uniform jacket tilted his cap back on his head and tried unsuccessfully to push back the stray lock of hair he looked a sad little man and i felt that maybe my habit of asking questions was out of line here i drank my beer and watched the singer hitler kept his back to her but i noticed she kept looking at him what do you know about this sagittarius i asked hitler shrugged very little weill turned up again behind the bar and asked us if we wanted more beer we said we didnt sagittarius weill spoke up brightly are you talking about that crank hes a crank is he i said thats not fair kurt hitler said hes a brilliant man a biologist who was thrown out of his job because he was insane that is unkind kurt hitler said reprovingly he was investigating the potential sentience of plantlife a perfectly reasonable line of scientific enquiry from the corner of the room someone laughed jeeringly it was a shaggyhaired old man sitting by himself with a glass of schnapps on the little table in front of him weill pointed at him ask albert he knows about science hitler pursed his lips and looked at the floor hes just an embittered old mathematics teacher hes jealous of felipe he said quietly so that the old man wouldnt hear who is he i asked weill albert a really brilliant man he has never had the recogni tion he deserves do you want to meet him but the shaggy man was leaving he waved a hand at hitler and weill kurt captain hitlergood day good day doctor einstein muttered hitler he turned to me where would you like to go now a tour of the places that sell jewellery i guess i said fingering the pendant in my pocket i may be on the wrong track altogether but its the only track i can find at the moment we toured the jewellers by nightfall we were nowhere nearer finding out who had owned the thing id just have to get the truth out of bismarck the next day though i knew it wouldnt be easy he wouldnt eke answering my personal ques tions at all hitler dropped me off at the precinct house where a cell had been converted into a bedroom for me i sat on the hard bed smoking and thinking i was just about to get undressed and go to sleep when i started to think about the bar wed been in earlier i was sure someone there could help me on impulse i left the cell and went out into the deserted street it was still very hot arid the sky was full of heavy clouds looked like a storm was due i got a cab back to the bar it was still open weill wasnt serving there nowhe was playing the piano accordion for the same girl singer id seen earlier he nodded to me as i came in i leant on the bar and ordered a beer from the barman when the number was over weill unstrapped his accordion and joined me the girl followed him adolf not with you he said he went home hes a good friend of yours is he oh we met years ago in austria hes a nice man you know he should never have become a policeman hes too mild thats the impression i got why did he ever join in the first place weill smiled and shook his head he was a short thin man wearing heavy glasses he had a large sensitive mouth sense of duty perhaps he has a great sense of duty he is very religious too a devout catholic i think that weighs on him you know these converts they accept nothing are torn by their consciences i never yet met a happy catholic convert he seems to have a thing about jews weill frowned what sort of thing ive never really noticed many of his friends are jews i am and sagittarius sagittarius is a friend of his oh more an acquaintance i should think ive seen them together a couple of times it began to thunder outside then it started to rain weill walked towards the door and began to pull down the blind through the noise of the storm i heard another sound a strange metallic grinding sound a crunching sound whats that i called weill shook his head and walked back towards the bar the place was empty now im going to have a look i said i went to the door opened it and climbed the steps marching across the ruins illuminated by rapid flashes of lightning like gunfire i saw a gigantic metal monster as big as a tall building supported on four telescopic legs it lumbered at right angles to the street from its huge body and head the snouts of guns stuck out in all directions lightning sometimes struck it and it made an earshattering belllike clang paused to fire upwards at the source of the lightning and march on i ran down the steps and flung open the door weill was tidying up the bar i described what id seen what is it weill the short man shook his head i dont know at a guess it is something berlins conquerors left behind it looked as if it was made here perhaps it was after all who conquered berlin a woman screamed from a back room high and brief weill dropped a glass and ran towards the room i followed he opened a door the room was homely a table covered by a thick dark cloth laid with salt and pepper knives and forks a piano near the window a girl lying on the floor eva weill gasped kneeling beside the body i gave the room another once over standing on a small coffee table was a plant it looked at first rather like a cactus of unpleasantly mottled green though the top curved so that it resembled a snake about to strike an eyeless noseless snake with a mouth there was a mouth it opened as i approached there were teeth in the mouth or rather thorns arranged the way teeth are one thorn seemed to be missing near the front i backed away from the plant and inspected the corpse i found the thorn in her wrist i left it there she is dead weill said softly standing up and looking around how she was bitten by that poisonous plant i said plant i must call the police that wouldnt be wise at this stage maybe i said as i left i knew where i was going bismarcks houseand the pleasure garden of felipe sagit tarius it took me time to find a cab and i was soaked through when i did i told the cabby to step on it i had the cab stop before we got to the house paid it off and walked across the lawns i didnt bother to ring the door bell i let myself in by the window using my pocket glass cutter i heard voices coming from upstairs i followed the sound until i located it bismarcks study i inched the door open hitler was there he had a gun pointed at otto von bis marck who was still in full uniform they both looked pale hitlers hand was shaking and bismarck was moaning slightly bismarck stopped moaning to say pleadingly i wasnt blackmailing eva braun you fool she liked me hitler laughed curtly half hysterically like you a fat old man she liked fat old men she wasnt that kind of girl who told you this anyway the investigator told me some and weill rang me half an hour ago to tell me some more also that eva had been killed i thought sagittarius was my friend i was wrong he is your hired assassin well tonight i intend to do my own killing captain hitler i am your superior officer the gun wavered as bismarcks voice recovered some of its authority i realized that the hifi had been playing quietly all the time curiously it was bartoks fifth string quartet bismarck moved his hand you are completely mistaken that man you hired to follow eva here last nighthe was evas exlover hitlers lip trembled you knew said bismarck i suspected it you also knew the dangers of the garden because felipe had told you about them the vines killed him as he sneaked towards the summer house the gun steadied bismarck looked scared he pointed at hitler you killed him not i he screamed you sent him to his death you killed stalin out of jealousy you hoped he would kill me and eva first you were too fright ened too weak to confront any of us openly hitler shouted wordlessly put both hands to the gun and pulled the trigger several times some of the shots went wide but one hit bismarck in his iron cross pierced it and got him in the heart he fell backwards and as he did so his uniform ripped apart and his helmet fell off i ran into the room and took the gun from hitler who was crying i checked that bis marck was dead i saw what had caused the uniform to rip open he had been wearing a corset one of the bullets must have cut the cord it was a heavy corset and had had a lot to hold in i felt sorry for hitler i helped him sit down as he sobbed he looked small and wretched what have i killed he stuttered what have i killed did bismarck send that plant to eva braun to silence her because i was getting too close hitler nodded snorted and started to cry again i looked towards the door a man stood there hesitantly i put the gun on the mantelpiece it was sagittarius he nodded to me hitlers just shot bismarck i explained so it appears he said bismarck had you send eva braun that plant is that so i said yes a beautiful cross between a common cactus a venus flytrap and a rosethe venom was curare of course hitler got up and walked from the room we watched him leave he was still sniffling where are you going i asked to get some air i heard him say as he went down the stairs the repression of sexual desires said sagittarius seating himself in an armchair and resting his feet comfortably on bismarcks corpse it is the cause of so much trouble if only the passions that lie beneath the surface the desires that are locked in the mind could be allowed to range free what a better place the world would be maybe i said are you going to make any arrests herr aquilinas its my job to make a report on my investigation not to make arrests i said will there be any repercussions concerned with this busi ness i laughed there are always repercussions i told him from the garden came a peculiar barking noise whats that i asked the wolfhounds sagittarius giggled no no the dogplant i fear i ran out of the room and down the stairs until i reached the kitchen the sheetcovered corpse was still lying on the table i was going to open the door on to the garden when i stopped and pressed my face to the window instead the whole garden was moving in what appeared to be an agitated dance foliage threshed about and even with the door closed the strange scent was even less bearable than it had been earlier i thought i saw a figure struggling with some thickboled shrubs i heard a growling noise a tearing sound a scream and a long drawn out groan suddenly the garden was motionless i turned sagittarius stood behind me his hands folded on his chest his eyes staring down at the floor it seems your dogplant got him i said he knew me he knew the garden suicide maybe very likely sagittarius unfolded his hands and looked up at me i liked him you know he was something of a protege if you had not interfered none of this might have happened he might have gone far with me to guide him youll find other proteges i said let us hope so the sky outside began to lighten imperceptibly the rain was now only a drizzle falling on the thirsty leaves of the plants in the garden are you going to stay on here i asked him yes i have the garden to work on bismarcks servants will look after me i guess they will i said i went back up the stairs and walked out of that house into the dawn cold and rainwashed i turned up my collar and began to climb across the ruins the mountain the last two men alive came out of the lapp tent they had just raided for provisions shes been here before us said nilsson it looks like she got the best of what there was hallner shrugged he had eaten so little for so long that food no longer held any great importance for him he looked about him lapp kata wigwams of wood and hides were spread around the immediate area of dry ground valuable skins had been left out to cure reindeer horns to bleach the doors unfastened so that anyone might enter the deserted homes hallner rather regretted the passing of the lapps they had had no part in the catastrophe no interest in wars or violence or competition yet they had been herded to the shelters with everyone else and like everyone else they had perished either by direct bombing radiation poisoning or asphyxiation he and nilsson had been in a forgotten meteorological station close to the norwegian border when they finally repaired their radio the worst was over fallout had by this time finished off the tribesmen in indonesian jungles the workers in remote dis tricts of china the hillbillies in the rockies the crofters in scotland only freak weather conditions which had been part of their reason for visiting the station earlier in the year had so far prevented the lethal rain from falling in this area of swedish lappland they had known themselves perhaps instinctively to be the last two humanbeings alive until nilsson found the girls tracks coming from the south and heading north who she was how shed escaped they couldnt guess but they had changed their direction from northeast to north and began to follow two days later they had found the lapp camp now they stared ahead of them at the range of ancient moun tains it was three am but the sun still hung a bloody spread on the horizon for it was summerthe sixweek summer of the arctic when the sun never fully set when the snows of the mountains melted and ran down to form the rivers lakes and marshes of the lowlands where only the occasional lapp camp or the muddy scar of a broad reindeer path told of the presence of the few men who lived here during the winter months suddenly as he looked away from the range the camp aroused some emotion akin to pity in hallners mind he remembered the despair of the dying man who had told them on his radio what had happened to the world nilsson had entered another hut and came out shaking a packet of raisins just what we need he said good said hallner and he sighed inaudibly the clean orderly nature of the little primitive village was spoiled for him by the sight he had witnessed earlier at the stream which ran through the camp there had been simple drinking cups of clay or bone side by side with an aluminium dish and an empty chase and sanborne coffee jar a cheap plastic plate and a broken toy car shall we go nilsson said and began to make his way out of the camp not without certain trepidation hallner followed behind his friend who marched towards the mountains without looking back or even from side to side nilsson had a goal and rather than sit down brood and die when the inescapable finally happened hallner was prepared to go along with him on this quest for the girl and he admitted there was a faint chance that if the winds continued to favour them they might have a chance of life in which case there was a logical reason for nilssons obsessional tracking of the woman his friend was impatient of his wish to walk slowly and savour the atmosphere of the country which seemed so detached and removed uninvolved with him disdainful that there were things which had no emotional relationship with him had given him a slight surprise at first and even now he walked the marshy ground with a feeling of abusing privacy of destroying the sanctity of a place where there was so little hint of humanity where men had been rare and had not been numerous or fre quent enough visitors to have left the aura of their passing behind them so it was with a certain shock that he later observed the print of small rubber soles on the flat mud near a river shes still ahead of us said nilsson pleased at this sign and not so very far ahead little more than a day were catching up suddenly he realized that he was displeased by the presence of the bootprints almost resentful of nilssons recognition of their being there when alone he might have ignored them he reflected that nilssons complete acceptance of the sex of the boots wearer was entirely founded on his own wishes the river poured down towards the flat lake on their left clear bright melted snow from the mountains brown sundried rocks stood out of it irregularly spaced irregularly contoured affording them a means of crossing the swift waters there were many such rivers running down the slopes of the foothills like silver veins to fill the lakes and spread them further over the marshland there were hills on the plateau where trees crowded together fir and silver birch like survivors of a flood jostling for a place on the high ground there were ridges which sometimes hid sight of the tail mountains in front of them green with grass and reeds studded with gorse he had never been so far into mountain country before and this range was one of the oldest in the world there were no sharp peaks as in the alps these were worn and solid and they had lived through eons of change and metamorphosis to have earned their right to solitude to permanency snow still spattered their sides like galaxies against the grey green moss and rock snowfields softened their lines nilsson was already crossing the river jumping nimbly from rock to rock his filmstars profile sometimes silhouetted against the clear sharp sky the pack on his back like christians load in the pilgrims progress hallner smiled to himself only indirectly was nilsson heading for salvation now he followed he balanced himself in his flat leathersoled boots and sprang from the first rock to the second righted his balance again and sprang to the next the river boiled around the rocks rushing towards the lake to lose itself in the larger waters he jumped again slipped and was up to his knees in the ice cold torrent he raised his small knapsack over his head and careless now did not bother to clamber back to the rocks but pushed on waistdeep through the freezing river he came gasping to the bank and was helped to dry land by nilsson who shook his head and laughed youre hopeless its all right he said the sun will dry me out soon but both had walked a considerable distance and both were tiring the sun had now risen round and hazy red in the pale cold sky but it was still difficult to gauge the passage of the hours this also added to the detached air of timelessness which the mountains and the plateaux possessed there was no nightonly a slight alteration in the quality of the day and although the heat was ninety degrees fahrenheit the sky still looked cold for it took more than the brief six weeks of summer to change the character of this wintry jotunheim he thought of jotunheim the land of giants and under stood the better the myths of his ancestors with their accent on mans impermanency the mortality of their very gods their bleak worship of the forces of nature only here could he appre ciate that the life span of the world itself might be infinite but the life span of its denizens was necessarily subject to inevitable metamorphosis and eventual death and as he thought his im pression of the country changed so that instead of the feeling of invading sanctified ground he felt as if a privilege had been granted him and he had been allowed for a few moments of his short life to experience eternity the mountains themselves might crumble in time the planet cease to exist but that it would be reincarnated he was certain and this gave him humility and hope for his own life and for the first time he began to think that he might have a purpose in continuing to live after all he did not dwell on the idea since there was no need to they came with relief to a dry place where they lighted a fire and cooked the last of their bacon in their strong metal fry ing pan they ate their food and cleaned the pan with ashes from the fire and he took it down to the nearest river and rinsed it stooping to drink a little not too much since he had learned from his mistake earlier for the water could be like a drug so that one craved to drink more and more until exhausted he realized vaguely that they had to keep as fit as possible for one of them to come to harm could mean danger for them both but the thought meant little there was no sense of danger here he slept and before he fell in to a deep dreamless sleep he had a peculiar impression of being at once vast and tiny his eyes closed his body relaxed he felt so big that the atoms of his body in relation to the universe hardly had existence that the universe had become an unobservable electron present but unseen and yet intratemporally he had the impression that he was as small as an electron so that he existed in a gulf a vacuum containing no matter whatsoever a mystic perhaps would have taken this for some holy experience but he could do no more than accept it feeling no need to interpret it then he slept next morning nilsson showed him a map he had found in the village thats where shes going he said pointing at a mountain in the distance its the highest in this section and the second highest in the entire range wonder why shed want to climb a mountain hallner shook his head nilsson frowned youre in a funny mood think you wont have a chance with the girl when hallner didnt answer nilsson said impatiently maybe shes got some idea that shes safer on top of a mountain with luck well find out soon ready to go hallner nodded they moved on in silence the range was discernibly closer now and hallner could look at individual mountains although looming over the others the one they headed for looked squat solid somehow older than the rest even for a while they were forced to concentrate on the ground immediately in front of them for it had become little more than thick mud which oozed over their boots and threatened to pull them down to join perhaps the remains of prehistoric saurians which lay many feet below nilsson said little and hallner was glad that no demands were made on him it was as if the edge of the world lay beyond the last ragged pile of mountains or as if they had left earth and were in a con cave saucer surrounded by mountains containing only the trees and the lakes marshes and hills he had the feeling that this place was so inviolable so invul nerable miles from the habitation of men so that for the first time he fully realized that men had ceased to exist along with their artifacts it was as if they had never really existed at all or that their spell of dominance had appeared and disappeared in practically the same moment of time but now for the first time since he had heard the hysterical voice on the radio he felt some stirring of his old feeling return as he stared at the great mountain heavy and huge against the iceblue sky but it was transformed ambition had become the summit reward the silence the peace that waited at the peak curiosity was the desire to discover the cause of a freakish colouring halfway up the mountain and fear did not exist for in these enigmatic mountains there was no uncertainty a vast wallless womb with the infinite sky curving above and the richly coloured scenery blues whites browns and greens surround ing them complete cutting them off from even the sight of the ruined outside world it was a snowsplashed paradise where wellfed wolves left the carcasses of their prey to lap at the pure water of the rivers a wilderness replete with life with lemming reindeer wolverine wolf and even bear with lakes swarming with fresh water herring and the air a silent gulf above them to set off the smack of a hawks wing night could not fall and so the potential dangers of savage wildlife which could not be felt in the vast ness of a world where there was room for everything could never be realized occasionally they would discover a slain reindeer bones dull and white its hide tattered and perishing and they would feel no horror no emotion at all for although its obvious killer the wolverine was a cruel beast destroying often for the sake of destroying the wolverine was not aware of its crime and there fore it was no crime at all everything here was selfsufficient moulded by fate by cir cumstance but since it did not analyse since it accepted itself and its conditions without question it was therefore more com plete than the men who walked and stumbled across its uncom promising terrain at length they came to the sloping grasscovered roots of the mountain and he trembled with emotion to see it rising so high above him the grass fading parting to reveal the tumbled rock and the rock vanishing higher up beneath banks of snow she will have taken the easiest face nilsson decided look ing at the map he had found in the camp it will mean crossing two snowfields they rested on the last of the grass and he looked down over the country through which they had passed unable to talk or describe his feelings it possessed no horizon for mountains were on all sides and within the mountains he saw rivers and lakes treecovered hills all of which had taken on fresh brighter colourings the lakes reflecting the red of the sun and the blue of the sky and giving them subtly different qualities he was glad they were taking the easiest face for he felt no need here to test or to temper himself for a while he felt complete with the country ready to climb upwards because he would rather do so and because the view from the peak would also be different add perhaps to the fullness of his experience he realized as they got up that this was not what nilsson was feeling hallner had almost forgotten about the girl they began to climb it was tiring but not difficult for initially the slope was gradual less than fortyfive degrees they came to the first snowfield which was slightly below them climbed downwards carefully but with relief nilsson had taken a stick from the lapp camp he took a step forward pressing the stick into the snow ahead of him took another step pressed the suck down again hallner followed treading cautiously in his friends footsteps little pieces of frozen snow falling into his boots he knew that nilsson was trying to judge the snowfields thickness below it a deep river coursed and he thought he heard its musical rushing beneath his feet he noted also that his feet now felt frozen and uncomfortable very slowly they crossed the snowfield and at length after a long time they were safely across and sat down to rest for a while preparing for the steeper climb ahead nilsson eased his pack off his shoulders and leaned against it staring back at the field no tracks he mused perhaps she crossed further down perhaps she didnt come here after all hallner spoke with effort he was not really interested dont be a fool nilsson rose and hefted his pack on to his back again they climbed over the sharp rocks separating the two snow fields and once again underwent the danger of crossing the second field hallner sat down to rest again but nilsson climbed on after a few moments hallner followed and saw that nilsson had stopped and was frowning at the folded map in his hand when he reached nilsson he saw that the mountain now curved upwards around a deep wide indentation across this a similar curve went up towards the summit it looked a decidedly easier climb than the one which faced them nilsson swore the damned maps misled us or else the position of the fields has altered weve climbed the wrong face should we go back down again hallner asked uninterestedly no theres not much difference wed have still lost a lot of time where the two curves joined there was a ridge high above them which would take them across to the face which they should have climbed this was getting close to the peak so that in fact there would be no advantage even when they reached the other side no wonder we missed her tracks nilsson said pettishly shell be at the summit by now how do you know she climbed this mountain hallner wondered why he had not considered this earlier nilsson waved the map you dont think lapps need these no she left it behind oh hallner stared down at the raw tumbling rocks which formed an almost sheer drop beneath his feet no more resting nilsson said weve got a lot of time to make up he followed behind nilsson who foolishly expended his energy in swift savage ascents and was showing obvious signs of exhaustion before they ever reached the ridge unperturbed by the changed situation hallner climbed after him slowly and steadily the ascent was taking longer was more difficult and he also was tired but he possessed no sense of despair panting nilsson waited for him on a rock close to the ridge which formed a narrow strip of jumbled rocks slanting upwards towards the peak on one side of it was an almost sheer drop going down more than a hundred feet and on the other the rocky sides sloped steeply down to be submerged in a dazzling expanse of faintly creaking ice a glacier im going to have to leave you behind if you dont move faster nilsson panted hallner put his head slightly on one side and peered up the mountain silently he pointed god everythings against us today nilsson kicked at a loose piece of rock and sent it out into space it curved and plummeted down but they could not see or hear it fall the mist which hallner had noted came rolling swiftly towards them obscuring the other peaks boiling in across the range will it affect us hallner asked its sure to how long will it stay a few minutes or several hours its impossible to tell if we stay where we are we could very well freeze to death if we go on theres a chance of reaching the summit and getting above it willing to risk it this last remark was a sneering challenge why yes of course hallner said now that the fact had been mentioned he noted for the first time that he was cold but the coldness was not uncomfortable they had no ropes no climbing equipment of any kind and even his boots were flatsoled city boots as the mist poured in its grey shifting mass limiting vision almost utterly at times they climbed on keeping together by shouts once he could hardly see at all reached a rock felt about it with his boot put his weight on the rock slipped clung to the rock and felt both feet go sliding free in space just as the mist parted momentarily to show him the creaking glacier far below him and something else a black spreadout shadow blemish ing the pure expanse of ice he scrabbled at the rock with his toes trying to swing himself back to the main part of the ridge got an insecure toe hold and flung himself sideways to the comparative safety of the harrow causeway he breathed quickly and shallowly and shook with reaction then he arose and continued on up the slanting ridge a while later when the main thickness of the mist had rolled past and now lay above the glacier he saw that they had crossed the ridge and were on the other side without his having realized it he could now see nilsson climbing with obvious difficulty towards what he had called the false summit the real sum mit could not be seen was hidden by the other but there was now only another hundred feet to climb they rested on the false summit unable to see much that was below them for although the mist was thinner it was thick enough to hide most of the surrounding mountains sometimes it would part so that they could see fragments of mountains patches of distant lakes but little else hallner looked at nilsson the other mans handsome face had taken on a set obstinate look one hand was bleeding badly are you all right hallner nodded his head towards the bleeding hand yes hallner lost interest since it was evident he could not help nilsson in his present mood he noted that the mist had penetrated his thin jacket and his whole body was damp and chilled his own hands were torn and grazed and his body was bruised aching but he was still not discomfited he allowed nilsson to start off first and then forced himself on the last stage of the climb by the time he reached the snowless summit the air was bright the mist had disappeared and the sun shone in the clear sky he flung himself down close to nilsson who was again peer ing at his map he lay panting sprawled awkwardly on the rock and stared out over the world there was nothing to say the scene itself although magni ficent was not what stopped him from talking stopped his mind from reasoning as if time had come to a standstill as if the passage of the planet through space had been halted he existed like a monument petrified unreasoning absorbing he drank in eternity why hadnt the dead human race realized this it was only necessary to exist not to be trying constantly to prove you existed when the fact was plain plain to him he realized because he had climbed a moun tain this knowledge was his reward he had not received any ability to think with greater clarity or a vision to reveal the secret of the universe or an experience of ecstasy he had been given by himself by his own action insensate peace the infinite tranquillity of existing nilssons harsh disappointed tones invaded this peace i could have sworn she would climb up here maybe she did maybe we were too late and shes gone back down again hallner remembered the mark he had seen on the glacier now he knew what it had been i saw something back on the ridge he said on the glacier a human figure i think what why didnt you tell me i dont know was she alive think of the importance of this if she is alive we can start the human race all over again whats the matter with you hallner have you gone crazy with shock or something was she alive perhaps i dont know you dont nilsson snarled in disbelief and began scrab bling back the way he had come you heartless bastard supposing shes hurtinjured hallner watched nilsson go cursing and stumbling sometimes falling on his overrapid descent of the mountain he saw him rip off his pack and fling it aside nearly staggering over the ridge as he began to climb down it hallner thought dispassionately that nilsson would kill him self if he continued so heedlessly then he returned his gaze to the distant lakes and trees below him he lay on the peak of the mountain sharing its existence he was immobile he did not even blink as he took in the view it seemed that he was part of the rock part of the moun tain itself a little later there came an aching yell which died away into the silence but hallner did not hear it
