 chapter one george is rather difficult mother mother where are you shouted george rushing into the house mother quick there was no answer georges mother was out in the garden at the back of kirrin cottage picking flowers george yelled again this time at the top of her very strong voice mother mother where are you its urgent a door was flung open nearby and georges father stood there glaring at her george whats this row about here am i in the middle of some very difficult oh father timmys hurt said george he went her father looked down at timmy standing meekly behind george he gave a little snort hurt he seems all right to me i suppose hes got a thorn in his paw again and you think its the end of the world or something and come yelling in here and timmy is hurt said george with tears in her voice look but her father had gone back into his study again and the door slammed george glared at it looking exactly like her hottempered father youre unkind she shouted and oh theres mother mother dear me george whatever is the matter said her mother putting down the flowers i heard your father shouting and then you mother timmys hurt said george look she knelt down by the dog and gently pulled forward one ear behind it was a big cut timmy whined tears came into georges eyes and she looked up at her mother now dont be silly george said mrs kirrin its only a cut how did he do it he tried to jump over a ditch and he didnt see some old barbed wire there said george and a rusty piece caught his ear and ripped that awful cut i cant stop it bleeding her mother looked at it it certainly was quite deep take him to the vet george she said perhaps it ought to be stitched it does look rather deep poor old timmyboy well its a good thing it wasnt his eye george ill take him to the vet at once said george getting up will he be in mother oh yes its his surgery hour said her mother take him along now so timmy was hurried along the country lanes to the pretty little house where the vet lived george very anxious indeed was most relieved to see that the vet seemed quite unconcerned a couple of stitches and that cut will heal well he said hold him will you while i do the job hell hardly feel it there old boy stand still thats right in five minutes time george was thanking the vet wholeheartedly thank you i was worried will he be all right now good gracious yes but you mustnt let him scratch that wound said the vet washing his hands if he does it may go wrong oh but how can i stop him asked george anxiously look hes trying to scratch it now well you must make him a big cardboard collar said the vet one that sticks out right round his neck so that his paw cant get near that cut however much he tries to reach it but but timmy wont like that a bit said george dogs look silly wearing cardboard collars like great ruffs round their neck ive seen them hell hate one well its the only way of stopping him from scratching that wound said the vet get along now george ive more patients waiting george went home with timmy he padded along quietly pleased at the fuss that george was making of him when he was nearly home he suddenly sat down and put up his hind leg to scratch his bad ear no timmy no cried george in alarm you must not scratch youll get the plaster off in no time and break the stitches no timmy timmy looked up in surprise very well if scratching was suddenly upsetting george he would wait till he was alone but george could read timmys thoughts as easily as he could read hers she frowned blow ill have to make him that cardboard collar perhaps mother will help me her mother was quite willing to help george was not good at things of that sort and she watched her mother cutting out a big cardboard collar fitting it round the surprised timmys head and then lacing the edges together with thread so that he could not get it off timmy was most surprised but he stood very patiently as soon as the collar was finished and safely round his neck he walked away then he raised his hind leg to scratch at his smarting ear but of course he couldnt get it over the collar and merely scratched the cardboard never mind timmy said george it will only be for a few days the study door nearby opened and her father came out he saw timmy in his collar and stopped in surprise then he roared with laughter hey timmy you look like queen elizabeth the first in a fine big ruff he said dont laugh at him father said george you know that dogs cant bear being laughed at timmy certainly looked offended he turned his back on georges father and stalked off to the kitchen a little squeal of laughter came from there and then a loud guffaw from someone at the kitchen door the milkman oh timmy whatever have you got that collar on for said the cooks voice you do look peculiar george was angry she remained angry all that day and made everyone most uncomfortable how mean of people to jeer at poor timmy didnt they realize how terribly uncomfortable a collar like that was and timmy had to wear it night and day he couldnt even lie down comfortably george mooned about looking so angry and miserable that her mother felt worried george dear dont be silly about this you will make your father cross timmy will have to wear that collar for at least a week you know and he does look a bit comical when you first see him hes getting used to it he soon wont notice it everybody laughs at him said george in an angry voice he went into the garden and a lot of kids hung over the wall and laughed like anything and the postman told me it was cruel and father thinks its funny and oh dear george dont get into one of your moods said her mother remember anne is coming soon she wont enjoy things much if you behave like this george bore it for one day more then after two upsets with her father over timmy another with a couple of boys who laughed at him and one with the paperboy she decided she wouldnt stay at kirrin cottage for one day longer well take my little tent and go off by ourselves somewhere she told timmy some place where nobody can see you till your ear is better and that hateful collar is off dont you think thats a good idea timmy woof said timmy he thought that any of georges ideas were good though the collar puzzled him very much you know the dogs laugh at you too timmy said george earnestly did you see how that silly little poodle belonging to mrs janes up the lane stood and stared at you he looked exactly as if he was laughing i wont have you laughed at i know you hate it timmy certainly didnt like it but he really was not as upset about the collar as george seemed to be he followed her as she went up to her bedroom and watched her as she began to put a few things into a small bag well go to that lonely little spot on the common she said to him well pitch our tent near a little stream and well jolly well stay there till your ears better well go tonight ill take my bike and strap everything on to the back so in the middle of the night when kirrin cottage was dark and quiet george stole downstairs with timmy she left a note on the diningroom table and then went to get her bicycle she strapped her little tent on it and the bag containing food and other odds and ends come on she whispered to the surprised timmy well go ill ride slowly and you can run beside me dont bark for goodness sake they disappeared into the darkness timmy running like a black shadow beside the bicycle nobody guessed they were gone kirrin cottage was quiet and undisturbed except for the creaking of the kitchen door which george had forgotten to shut but in the morning what a disturbance joan the cook found georges note first and wondered what a letter in georges writing was doing on the diningroom table she ran straight up to georges room and looked inside the bed was empty there was no george and timmys basket was empty joan went to take the note to mrs kirrin oh dear how silly george is she said when she had read it look quentin such a fuss about timmy now george has gone off with him goodness knows where her husband took the note and read it out loud dear mother im going off for a few days with timmy till his ear is better ive taken my tent and a few things dont worry please tell anne if she wants to join me to come to the end of carters lane on the common and i will show her where im camping tell her to come at twelve love from george well im blessed said georges father all right let her stay away if she wants to im tired of her sulky face and timmys hangdog looks tell anne to join george and maybe i shall have peace for a few days george should be all right said his wife shes quite sensible really and shes got timmy ill tell anne to join her when she arrives this morning when anne arrived at kirrin station and looked out for george and timmy they werent there only her aunt was there smiling as usual whats happened said anne wheres george and timmy oh george has gone off by herself said her aunt fanny come along and ill tell you chapter two anne joins the little camp aunt fanny soon told anne about timmys ear and the big collar of cardboard that had caused all the trouble anne couldnt help smiling oh aunt fanny george is quite crazy about old tim isnt she ill go and meet her at twelve and of course ill camp with her for a day or two its lovely weather and id like to i expect uncle quentin will be glad to have us out of the house how are julian and dick asked her aunt she was very fond of annes two brothers georges cousins will they be coming down here at all these holidays i dont know said anne theyre still in france you know on a schoolboys tour i feel funny without them george will be cross to hear they probably wont be coming to kirrin shell just have to put up with me at twelve oclock anne was standing patiently at the end of carters lane it ran to the common and then ended in a small winding path that led to nowhere in particular big gorse bushes grew here and there and slender birch trees anne her belongings strapped to her back and a bag in her hand looked over the common to see if she could spy george coming there was no sign of her blow said anne i suppose shes changed her mind or something perhaps her watch has stopped and she doesnt know the time she ought to though by looking at the sun how long shall i wait she sat down by a big gorsebush out of the hot sun she hadnt been there for more than a minute when she heard a hissing sound pssssst anne sat up at once the sound came from the other side of the bush and she got up and walked round it halfhidden under a prickly branch were george and timmy hallo said anne surprised didnt you see me when i arrived hallo tim darling hows your poor old ear oh doesnt he look a quaint old dear in that collar george george scrambled out of the bush i hid here just in case father or mother should come with you and try to make me come back she said i wanted to make quite sure they werent waiting somewhere a little way away im glad youve come anne of course ive come said anne i wouldnt stay alone at kirrin cottage while you were camping out besides i understand how you feel about timmy the collars a jolly good idea of course but it does make him look comical i think he looks rather a dear in it i do really george was almost relieved that anne had not laughed at timmy as most people had she smiled at her cousin and timmy licked her till anne really had to push him away lets go said george scrambling up ive got a lovely campingplace anne youll like it its near a little spring too so theres plenty of water for timmy to drink and us too did you bring any more food i didnt really bring much yes ive brought heaps said anne aunt fanny made me shes not cross with you george i didnt see your father he was shut up in his study georges spirits suddenly rose she gave anne a friendly punch this is going to be fun timmys ear will soon be better and he loves camping out as much as we do ive really found a good place about the loneliest on the common nobody near us for miles they set off together timmy at their heels darting off every now and again when he smelt rabbit when are julian and dick coming down asked george in a few days timmys ear will be all right then and we can go back to kirrin cottage to welcome the boys and have some fun there they may not be coming down at all these hols said anne and georges face fell at once she stopped and stared at anne in dismay not coming but they always come in the hols or we go away somewhere together she said they must come i shall be miserable without ju and dick well theyre still in france on a tour or something said anne we shall hear if theyre staying on there or coming down to kirrin when we get back to the cottage dont look so woebegone george but george felt woebegone the holidays stretched before her suddenly seeming long and dreary her two boy cousins were always such fun they had had such wonderful adventures together and now now they werent coming we shant have any adventures at all if the boys dont come she said in a small voice i shant mind that said anne im the peaceful one not always on the lookout for something to happen like you and the boys perhaps these holidays will be quite unexciting without even the smell of an adventure oh george cheer up dont look so mournful youd better send a telegram to julian and dick if you feel so badly about it ive a good mind to said george i cant imagine hols without the boys why we shant be the five the famous five if they dont come woof said timmy quite agreeing he sat down and tried to scratch his ear but the big collar prevented him he didnt seem to mind and ran off after a rabbit quite happily i think you are more upset about that collar than timmy said anne as they walked along are we getting near this place of yours george its a jolly long way we go up this hill in front of us and then drop down to a little copse said george theres a funny old cottage nearby quite ruined and empty at first i thought perhaps people lived there but when i went nearer i saw that it was ruined theres a big old roserambler climbing all over it even inside i suppose the people who used to live there planted it they walked up the little hill and down again following curving rabbitpaths better look out for adders said anne this is just the kind of place for them my word its hot george is there anywhere to bathe near here a pool or anything i dont know we could explore and see said george i did bring my swimsuit just in case look you can see part of the old cottage now my camp is fairly near there i thought id better camp near the spring they were soon at georges rough little camp her tent was up and she had made a bed inside of the springy heather a mug a bag of dog biscuits a few tins and a loaf of bread were at one end of the tent it didnt seem to anne as if george had brought very much and she felt glad that she had managed to pack such a lot of things aunt fanny cut dozens and dozens of sandwiches said anne she said if we kept them in this tin they wouldnt go stale and would last us a day or two till we went back im hungry shall we have some now they sat out in the sun munching the ham sandwiches anne had brought tomatoes too and they took a bite at a sandwich and then a bite at a tomato timmy had to make do with a handful of dog biscuits and half a sandwich every now and again after a bit he got up and wandered off wheres he going asked anne to look for a rabbit no probably to get a drink said george the spring is in the direction hes gone im thirsty too lets take the mug and get a drink ourselves they went off with the mug anne following george through the thick heather the little spring was a lovely one it had evidently been used by the people who had once lived in the old cottage and was built round with big white stones so that the spring ran through a little stony channel as clear as crystal oooh its as cold as ice said anne simply delicious i could drink gallons of this they lay on the heather out in the sun talking when they came back from the spring timmy wandered off by himself again its so peaceful here said anne nobody near us for miles just the birds and the rabbits this is what i like theres hardly a sound said george yawning and then just as she said that there came a noise in the distance a sharp sound like metal on stone it came again and again and then stopped whats that do you suppose said george sitting up i cant imagine said anne anyway its a long way away everything is so still that sounds carry from quite a distance the sharp noises began again in a little while and then stopped the girls shut their eyes and slept there wasnt a sound now except the poppoppop of gorse pads exploding in the sun and sending out their little black seeds george woke up when timmy came back he sat down heavily on her feet and she woke up with a jump timmy dont she said get off my feet you made me jump timmy obligingly removed himself and then picked up something he had dropped lay down and began gnawing it george looked to see what it was timmy thats a bone where did you get it she said anne did you bring a bone for tim what what did you say said anne half asleep a bone no i didnt why because timmys found one said george and its a bone that has had cooked meat on it so its not a rabbit or anything timmys caught timmy where did you get it woof said timmy offering the bone to george thinking that she too might like a gnaw as she seemed so interested in it do you suppose anyone else is camping near us asked anne sitting up and yawning after all bones dont grow in the heather thats quite a good meaty one too timmy have you stolen it from another dog timmy thumped his tail on the ground and went on with his bone he looked pleased with himself its rather an old bone said george its smelly go away tim take it further off the sharp metallic noises suddenly began again and george frowned i believe there is someone camping near us anne come on lets do a bit of exploring and find out i vote we move our camp if there are other people near come on timmy thats right bury that horrible bone this way anne chapter three the old cottage and a surprise the two girls with timmy at their heels left their campingplace and set off in the hot sun anne caught sight of the ruined cottage and stopped lets have a look at it she said it must be awfully old george they went in at the wide doorway there was no door left only the stone archway inside was a big room whose floor had once been paved with slabs of white stone now grass and other weeds had grown between the cracks and had actually lifted up some of the slabs so that the whole floor was uneven here and there parts of the walls had fallen away and the daylight came through one window was still more or less intact but the others had fallen out a small crooked stairway of stone led upwards in one corner to rooms above i suppose said anne oh heres another doorway leading into a second room a small one its got an old sink in it look and this must be the remains of a pump theres not much to see really said george looking round the top rooms must be quite ruined because half the roof is off hallo heres another door a back door its actually a door too not just a doorway she gave a push at the stout wood and the old door promptly fell off its hinges and crashed outwards into an overgrown yard goodness said george startled i didnt know it was quite so rotten it made poor tim jump almost out of his skin there are outhouses here or the remains of them said anne exploring the backyard they must have kept pigs and hens and ducks heres a driedup pond look everything was falling to pieces the best preserved corner of the old place was what must have been a small stable rusted mangers were still there and the floor was of stone an old old piece of harness hung on a big nail its got quite a nice feel about it this old place said anne sometimes i dont like the feel of places they give me an uneasy feeling a feeling that horrid things may have happened there but this is quite different i think people have been happy here and led peaceful lives i can almost hear hens clucking and ducks quacking and pigs gr quack quack quack quack cuckcukcukcukcuk cuckcukcukcukcuk anne clutched george and the two girls looked extremely startled to hear the sudden loud noise of quacking and clucking they stood and listened what was it said anne it sounded like hens and ducks though im not quite sure but there arent any here surely we shall hear a horse whinnying next they didnt hear a whinny but they heard the snorting of a horse at once hmrrumph hrrrrrumph both girls were now quite alarmed they looked for timmy he was nowhere to be seen wherever could he have got to cuckcukcukcukcuk this is silly said george are we imagining things anne there must be hens near come round the back of these stables and look timmy where are you timmy she whistled shrilly and immediately an echo came or so it seemed pheepheepheepheephee timmy yelled george beginning to feel as if she was in a dream timmy appeared looking rather sheepish he wagged his tail and to the girls enormous amazement they saw that he had a ribbon tied on it a ribbon a bright blue one at that timmy your tail the ribbon timmy whats all this about said george really startled timmy went to her still looking sheepish george tore the ribbon off his tail who tied it there she demanded whos here timmy where have you been the two girls searched the old buildings thoroughly and found nothing and nobody not a hen not a duck not a pig and certainly not a horse then what was the explanation they stared at one another in bewilderment and where did timmy get that silly ribbon said george exasperated someone must have tied it on perhaps it was a hiker passing by perhaps he heard us here and saw timmy and played a joke said anne but its strange that old tim let him tie on the ribbon i mean timmys not overfriendly with strangers is he the girls gave up the idea of exploring any further and went back to their little camp timmy went with them he lay down and then suddenly got up again making for a thick gorse bush he tried to squirm underneath note whats he after said george really i think timmys gone mad timmy you cant get under there with that great collar on timmy do you hear me timmy backed out reluctantly the collar all crooked after him came a peculiar little mongrel dog with one blind eye and one exceedingly bright and lively one he was halfwhite and halfblack and had a ridiculously long thin tail which he waved about merrily well said george amazed whats that dog doing there and how did timmy get so friendly with him timmy i cant make you out woof said timmy and brought the mongrel dog over to anne and george he then proceeded to dig up the smelly bone he had buried and actually offered it to the little dog who looked away and took no interest in it at all this is all very peculiar said anne i shall expect to see timmy bring a cat to us next at once there came a pathetic mewing meeew meeeweeeweeew both dogs pricked up their ears and rushed to the bush timmy was once again kept back by his big collar and barked furiously george got up and marched to the bush if theres a cat there it wont have much chance against two dogs she called to anne come away tim hey you little dog come away too timmy backed out and george pulled out the small dog very firmly indeed hold him anne she called hes quite friendly he wont bite im going to find that cat anne held on to the small mongrel who gazed at her excitedly with his one good eye and wagged his tail violently he was a most friendly little fellow george began to crawl into the bare hollow space under the big gorse bush she looked into it not able to see anything at first because it was dark there after the bright sunlight then she got a tremendous shock a round grinning face stared back at her a face with very bright eyes and tousled hair falling on to the forehead the mouth was set in a wide smile showing very white teeth meeeweeeweeew said the face george scrambled back at top speed her heart thumping what is it called anne theres somebody hiding there said george not a cat a fathead of a boy who is doing the mewing meweeeweeew come out called anne come out and lets see you you must be crazy there was a scrambling noise and a boy came headforemost from the hollow space under the bush he was about twelve or thirteen short studily built and with the cheekiest face anne had ever seen timmy rushed at him and licked him lovingly george stared in amazement how does my dog know you she demanded well he came growling at me yesterday when i was in my own camp said the boy and i offered him a nice meaty bone then he saw my little dog jet short for jetpropelled you know and made friends with him and with me too i see said george still not at all friendly well i dont like my dog to take food from strangers oh i couldnt agree more said the boy but i thought id rather he ate the bone than ate me hes a nice dog yours he feels a bit of an idiot wearing that collar doesnt he you should have heard jet laugh when he first saw it george frowned i came here to be alone so that timmy shouldnt be jeered at she said hes got a bad ear i suppose you were the fathead who tied a blue ribbon on his tail just for a joke said the boy you like frowning and glaring i can see well i like joking and tricking your timmy didnt mind a bit he took to my dog right away but everyone likes jet i wanted to find out who owned timmy because like you i dont like strangers messing about when im camping out so i came along i see and you did all the clucking and quacking and hrrrumphing said anne she liked this idiot of a boy with his broad friendly grin what are you doing just camping or hiking or botanizing im digging said the boy my fathers an archaeologist he loves old buildings more than anything else in the world i take after him i suppose there was once an old roman camp on this common you know and ive found a place where part of it must have been so im digging for anything i can find pottery weapons anything like that see i found this yesterday look at the date on it he suddenly thrust an old coin at them a queer uneven one rather heavy to hold its date is he said at least as far as i can make out so the camps pretty old isnt it well come and see it said anne excited no dont said the boy i dont like people messing round me when im doing something serious please dont come i wont bother you again i promise all right we wont come said anne quite understanding but dont you play any more silly tricks on us see i promise said the boy i tell you i wont come near you again i only wanted to see whose dog this was well im off so long and whistling to jet he set off at a furious pace george turned to anne what a peculiar boy she said actually id rather like to see him again wouldnt you chapter four that night it was now teatime according to annes watch and also according to everyones feelings including timmys timmy felt the heat very much and was always wandering off to the little spring to lap the crystalcold water anne wished that she and george had a big jug that they could fill it was such a nuisance to have to keep running to and fro with just a mug they had tea biscuits a sandwich each and a bar of rather soft chocolate george examined timmys ear for the hundredth time that day and pronounced it very much better well dont take off that collar yet said anne hell only open the wound by scratching if you do im not going to take it off said george touchily what shall we do now anne go for a walk yes said anne listen you can hear those sharp metallic noises again thats the boy at work again i expect funny boy he must be coming to dig about all on his own with his comical little dog i wish we could see what hes doing we promised we wouldnt said george so i dont feel that we even ought to go and peep of course not said anne come on lets go in the opposite direction george right away from the boy i hope we shant get lost not while timmys with us silly said george youd find your way home from the moon wouldnt you tim woof agreed timmy he always says yes to whatever you say george said anne i say isnt it a lovely evening i wonder what julian and dick are doing george immediately looked downcast she felt that her two cousins had no right to go rushing across france when she wanted them at kirrin didnt they like kirrin would they be having magnificent adventures on the continent and not want to spend even a week at kirrin she looked so lost in miserable thoughts that anne laughed at her cheer up at least i am here with you though i agree that compared with ju and dick im very poor company and not at all adventurous they had a lovely walk and sat down halfway to watch hordes of rabbits playing together timmy was very unhappy about this why sit down to watch silly rabbits rabbits were made to chase werent they why did george always put a restraining hand on his collar when she sat down to watch rabbits he whined continually as he watched with her shut up timmy you ass said george youd only spoil the entertainment if you sent them to their holes they watched for a long while and then got up to go back to the camp when they came near they heard the sound of low whistling someone was about that evening quite near their camp who was it they came round a big gorse bush and almost bumped into a boy he got out of their way politely but said nothing why its you said george in surprise i dont know your name what are you doing here you said you wouldnt come near us the boy stared looking very surprised his tousled hair fell right across his forehead and he brushed it back i said nothing of the sort he said oh you did said anne you know you did well if you break your promise theres no reason for us to keep ours we shall come and visit your camp i never made you any promise said the boy looking quite startled youre mad dont be an idiot said george getting cross i suppose youll be saying next that you didnt act like a hen and a duck and a horse this afternoon and a cat said anne balmy said the boy looking at them pityingly quite balmy are you coming here again demanded george if i want to said the boy the water in this spring is better than the one over by my camp then we shall come and explore your camp said george firmly if you dont keep your promise we shant keep ours by all means come if you want to said the boy you seem quite mad but i daresay youre harmless but dont bring your dog he might eat mine you know he wouldnt eat jet said anne theyre good friends i dont know anything of the sort said the boy and went off brushing his hair out of his eyes again what do you make of that said george staring after him not a bit the same as he was this afternoon do you think he really had forgotten about his promise and everything i dont know said anne puzzled he was so perky and jolly and full of fun before grinning all the time but just now he seemed quite serious not a smile in him oh well perhaps hes a bit crazy said george are you sleepy anne i am though i cant think why not very but id like to lie down on this springy heather and watch the stars gradually come sparkling into the sky said anne i dont think ill sleep in the tent george youll want timmy with you and honestly theres so little room inside the tent that im quite sure timmy would lie on my legs all night long ill sleep in the open air as well said george i only slept in the tent last night because it looked a bit like rain lets get some more heather and make a kind of mattress of it we can put a rug on top of it and lie on that the two of them pulled a lot of heather and carried it to their bed soon they had a fine pile and timmy went to lie on it hey its not for you cried george get off youll flatten it right down wheres the rug anne they laid the rug on the heatherpile and then went to the spring to wash and clean their teeth timmy immediately got on to the heatherbed again and shut his eyes you old fraud said george lugging him off youre not asleep keep off our bed look theres a nice soft patch of grass for you thats your bed george lay down on the rug and the heatherybed sank a little beneath her weight very comfortable said george shall we want a rug over us anne well i did bring one said anne but i dont think well want it the nights so hot look there is a star already soon there were six or seven and then gradually hundreds more pricked through the evening sky as the twilight deepened it was a wonderful night dont the stars look big and bright said anne sleepily they make me feel very small theyre such millions of miles away george are you asleep there was no answer george hadnt heard a word she was fast asleep her hand fell down the side of the heather and rested on the ground below timmy moved a little nearer and gave it a small lick then he too fell asleep and gave some small doggy snores the night darkened there was no moon but the stars shone out well from the midnight sky it was very quiet out there on the common far away from streets and villages and towns not even an owl hooted anne didnt quite know why she awoke at first she had no idea where she was and she lay gazing up at the stars in astonishment thinking she must still be asleep she suddenly felt very thirsty she groped about in the nearby tent for the mug couldnt find it and gave it up ill drink from my cupped hands she thought and set off for the little spring timmy wondered whether to follow her no he would stay with george she wouldnt like it if she awoke and found him gone with anne so he settled his head down on his paws again and slept leaving one ear open for anne anne found the little spring its tinkling gurgling sound guided her as soon as she heard it she sat down on one of the stones nearby and held out her cupped hands how very cold the water was and how delicious to drink on this hot night she sipped thirstily slopping some of the water down her front she got up to go back and walked a few steps in the starlight then she stopped wait was she going in the right direction she wasnt sure i think i am she decided and went on carefully and quietly surely she must be near their little camp now then all at once she stood still and felt herself stiffen she had suddenly seen a light it had flashed and disappeared ah there it was again whatever could it be then as her eyes strained through the starlit darkness she suddenly saw that she had taken the wrong way she had gone in the direction of the old ruined cottage and not the camp and the light had come from there she didnt dare go any nearer she felt glued to the grass she was standing on now she could hear sounds whispering sounds and the noise of a footfall on the stone floor of the cottage and then the flash of a light came again yes it was from the old cottage anne began to breathe fast who was it in the old cottage she simply dared not go and see she must go back to george and to timmys protection as fast and as silently as she could she found her way back to the spring and then almost stumbling now made her way to where george was still lying peacefully asleep woof said timmy sleepily and tried to lick her hand anne climbed on to the heatherybed beside george her heart still beating fast george she whispered george do wake up ive something queer to tell you chapter five that boy again george would not wake up she grunted when anne poked her and prodded her and then she turned over almost falling off the small heatherbed oh george please do wake begged anne in a whisper she was afraid of speaking out loud in case anyone should hear her who knew what might happen if she drew attention to their little camp george awoke at last and was cross whatever is it anne she said her voice sounding loud in the night sh said anne sh why were all alone here we can make as much noise as we like said george surprised george do listen theres someone in that old cottage said anne and at last george heard and understood she sat up at once anne told her the whole story though it didnt really seem very much of a tale when she related it george spoke to timmy tim she said keeping her voice low well go and do a little exploring shall we come on then and keep quiet she slid off the rug and stood up you stay here she said to anne timmy and i will be very quiet and careful and see what we can find out oh no i couldnt stay here alone said anne in alarm and got up hurriedly i shall have to come too i dont mind a bit now timmys with us i wonder he didnt bark at the people in the old cottage whoever they were he probably thought it was you messing about said george and anne nodded yes of course timmy must have thought that any noises he heard had been made by her they took the path that led to the old cottage george had timmy well to heel he knew he must not push forward unless told to his ears were pricked now and he was listening hard they came cautiously to the cottage they could see its dark outline in the starlight but little else there was no light flashing there nor did there seem to be any noises at all all three stood still and quiet for about five minutes then timmy moved restlessly this was boring why wouldnt george let him run forward and explore everywhere if she wanted to know if intruders were about i dont think theres a soul here whispered george into annes ear they must have gone unless you dreamed it all anne i didnt whispered back anne indignantly lets go forward a bit and send timmy into the cottage hell soon bark if theres anyone there george gave timmy a little shove go on then she said find timmy find timmy gladly shot forward into the darkness he trotted into the cottage though it was impossible even to see him go to it the two girls stood and listened their heartbeats sounding very loud to them there was not a sound to be heard except occasionally the rattle of timmys strong claws on a stony slab there cant be anyone there said george at last else timmy would have sniffed them out youre an ass anne you dreamt it all i did not said anne indignant again i know there was someone there in fact more than one person because im sure i heard whispering george raised her voice timmy she called loudly making anne jump violently timmy come along weve sent you on a silly wild goose chase but now well go back to bed timmy came trotting out of the cottage and went obediently to george she heard him yawn as he stood beside her and she laughed anne had a bad dream thats all timmy she said anne felt cross very cross she said no more and they left the old cottage and went back to their heatherbed anne climbed on to her side and turned over with her back to george all right let george think it was a dream if she liked but when anne awoke in the morning and remembered the happenings of the night before she too began to wonder uneasily if she had dreamed what she had seen and heard in the old cottage after all timmy would certainly have caught anyone who was there she thought and he wasnt at all excited so there cant have been anyone in the cottage and anyway why would they come its just silly so when george talked about annes dreaming in the middle of the night anne did not defend herself she really could not be sure that it had really happened so she held her tongue when george teased her and said nothing lets go and see that boy and his camp george said when they had eaten a few rather stale sandwiches and some shortbread biscuits im beginning to feel bored arent you i wish timmys ear would quite heal up id go back home like a shot then they set off in the direction of the camp with timmy they heard a chipchipping noise as they came near and then something small and hairy shot out from a bush and rushed up barking a welcome hallo jet said anne dont you let timmy have any more of your bones the chipping noise had stopped the two girls went on and came to a very messy piece of common it had been well dug over in some places very deeply surely that boy couldnt have done so much excavating by himself hey where are you called george then she saw the boy below her examining something in a trench he had dug out he jumped and looked upwards then he scowled look you promised not to come and disturb me he shouted youre mean just like girls to break a promise well i like that said george amazed it was you who broke yours who came messing round our camp yesterday evening id like to know not me said the boy at once i always keep my promises now go away and keep yours girls pooh well i cant say we think much of you said george disgusted were going we dont want to see anything of your silly digging goodbye goodbye and good riddance called the boy rudely and turned back to his work i think he must be quite mad said anne first he makes a promise then last evening he broke his promise and even said he hadnt made one and now today he says he did make a promise and that hed kept his and wed broken ours idiotic they went up a little rabbit path and into a small copse of birch trees someone was sitting there reading he looked up as they came the two girls stopped in amazement it was that boy again but how had he got here they had just left him behind in a trench anne looked at the title of the book he was reading goodness what a learned title something about archaeology another little trick of yours i suppose said george sarcastically stopping in front of him you must be a jolly good runner i must say to have got here so quickly funny boy arent you very very funny good gracious its those potty girls again groaned the boy cant you leave me alone you talked a lot of rubbish yesterday and now youre talking it again how did you get here so quickly said anne puzzled i didnt get here quickly i came very slowly reading my book as i went said the boy fibber said george you must have run at top speed why do you pretend like this its only a minute or so ago that we saw you now youre the fibber said the boy i do think you two girls are awful go away and leave me alone and never let me see you again timmy didnt like the tone of the boys voice and he growled the boy scowled at him and just you shut up too he said anne pulled at georges sleeve come on she said its no good staying here arguing the boys crazy just mad well never get any sense out of him the two girls walked off together timmy following the boy took absolutely no notice his face was turned to his book and he was quite absorbed in it ive never met anyone quite so mad before said anne rather puzzled by the way george you dont suppose it could have been that idiotic boy last night in the cottage no i tell you i think you dreamed it said george firmly though that boy is quite idiot enough to explore an old cottage in the middle of the night he would probably think it a very good time to do so oh anne look theres a pool in that hollow down there do you think we could bathe in it it certainly shone very temptingly they went down to have a closer look yes well have a swim this afternoon said george and then i really think anne we ought to go back to kirrin cottage and get a few more provisions the sandwiches weve got left are so dry that we really shant enjoy eating them and as timmys ear isnt healed it looks as if well have to stay a bit longer right said anne and they went on back to the camp they changed into their swimsuits in the afternoon and went off to the little pool it was fairly deep very warm and quite clean they spent a lovely hour swimming and basking and swimming again then they reluctantly dressed and began to think of going off on the long journey to kirrin cottage georges mother was very surprised to see the two girls and timmy she said yes of course they could have some more food and sent them to ask joan for all she could spare by the way ive heard from julian and dick she said theyre back from france and may be here in a day or two shall i tell them to join you or will you come back here tell them to come and fetch us as soon as they get here said george delighted her face shone ah the five would be together again how wonderful leave me directions to give them so that they can find you said her mother then you can all come back together the boys can help to carry everything what fun what fun julian and dick again now things would be exciting things would happen as they always did what fun chapter six storm in the night it was fun to go back to their little campingplace again it was growing dark as they had stayed to have a good meal at kirrin cottage and timmy had eaten a most enormous plate of meat vegetables and gravy then he had sat down and sighed as if to say that was jolly good i could do with some more however nobody took any notice of this so he trotted off to have a good look round the garden to make sure it was just the same as when he had left it a day or two before then it was time to start back to the campingplace and timmy heard georges whistle well nobody laughed at timmy this evening said anne not even your father oh i expect mother had told him not to said george anyway i said i would stay away till tims ear is better and i mean to well im quite willing said anne the only thing im a bit worried about is do you suppose there will be anyone snooping about in that old cottage again you dreamed it all said george you admitted you did well yes i did wonder if i had dreamed it said anne as they walked up the long carters lane to the moor but now that it will soon be dark im beginning to think i didnt dream it and it isnt a very nice feeling oh dont be silly said george impatiently you cant chop and change about like that anyway weve got timmy no one would dare to upset timmy would they tim but timmy was ahead hoping against hope that he might for once in a way catch a rabbit there were so many about on the common at this time of the evening peeping at him here making fun of him there and showing their little white bobtails as soon as he moved in their direction the two girls got safely back to their camp the tent was still up their heatherbed out in the open covered with the old rug they put down their loads thankfully and went to the little spring for a drink george yawned im tired lets get to bed at once shall we or wait perhaps it would be a good idea to have a look in at that cottage to make sure no one is there to disturb us tonight oh no i dont want to look said anne its getting dark now all right ill go with timmy said george and off she went she came back in about five minutes her little torch shining in front of her for it was now almost dark nothing to report she said nothing whatever except one bat flying round that big room timmy nearly went mad when it flew down and almost touched his nose oh thats when he barked i suppose said anne who was now curled up on the heatherbed i heard him come on george im sleepy i must just look at timmys ear once more said george and shone her torch on it well buck up then said anne thats about the thousandth time today youve examined it it does seem much better said george and she patted timmy i shall be glad when i can take this awful collar off him im sure he hates it i dont believe he even notices it now said anne george are you coming or not i really cant keep awake one minute more im coming said george no tim you are not sleeping on our bed i told you that last night theres hardly enough room for anne and me she climbed carefully on to the heatherbed and lay looking up at the twinkling stars i feel happy tonight she said because julian and dick are coming i was down in the dumps when i thought they might not be coming at all these hols when do you suppose theyll be here anne there was no answer anne was asleep george sighed she would have liked to plan what they were going to do when the boys came timmys ear would surely be all right in a day or two and the boys could carry everything back from this little camp to kirrin cottage and then long days of swimming and boating and fishing and all kinds of fun could begin begin begin be and now george was asleep too she didnt feel a small spider running over her hand wondering whether or not to spin a web between her finger and thumb she didnt hear the scramble of a hedgehog not far off though timmy did and pricked one ear it was a very peaceful night indeed next day the girls were very cheerful they made a good breakfast of some of the food they had brought and then spent some time getting more heather for their bed which under the weight of their two bodies was now rather flat and uncomfortable now for a swim said george they put on their swimsuits threw cardigans over their shoulders and set off to the little pool on the way they saw jet the little mongrel dog in the distance and the boy with him jet tore up to them and danced round timmy excitedly the boy called to them its all right dont worry im not going near your place im still keeping my promise jet come here the girls took no notice of the grinning boy but couldnt resist patting the little oneeyed mongrel jet really was like a piece of quicksilver darting in and out and round about he shot back to the boy at once the girls went on to the pool and stopped in dismay when they came near someone was already there swimming vigorously who is it said anne dear me this lonely common seems absolutely crowded with people george was staring at the swimmer in utmost amazement anne its that boy she said look tousled hair and everything butbut but weve just met him going in the opposite direction said anne also amazed how extraordinary no it cant be the boy they went a little nearer yes it was the boy he called out to them im just going out i shant be a minute how did you get here shouted george we never saw you turn back and run ive been here for about ten minutes shouted back the boy fibber yelled back george at once ah barmy as usual yelled the boy same as yesterday he got out and walked off dripping wet in the direction of the trenches and pits which he was digging george looked about for jet but she couldnt see him perhaps hes in the pool too she said come on anne lets swim i must say that that boy is extraordinary i suppose he thinks its funny to meet people then double back and appear again he was nicer the first time of all that we saw him said anne i liked him then i just dont understand him now ooooh isnt this water lovely and warm they had a long swim got out and basked in the sun lying on the heather and then swam again then they began to feel hungry and went back to their little camping place the day passed quickly they saw no more of the puzzling boy or of jet they occasionally heard the sharp noise of metal on stone or of chipping from the place where the boy was presumably still digging in the old roman camp or what he hopes is an old roman camp said george personally i think hes so mad that i dont suppose he would know the difference between a roman camp and a boy scouts camp they settled down on their heatherbed that night but saw no stars twinkling above them this time instead there were rather heavy clouds and it was not nearly so warm gosh i hope its not going to rain said george our tent wouldnt be much good against a real downpour we could squeeze into it all right but its not a proper waterproof tent do you think its going to rain anne no said anne sleepily anyway im not getting up till i have to im tired she went to sleep and so did george timmy didnt though he had heard the faroff growl of thunder and he was uneasy timmy was not afraid of thunderstorms but he didnt like them they were things that growled like enormous dogs in the sky and flashed angrily but he never could get at them or frighten them he closed both eyes and put down one ear leaving the other one up listening another thunder growl came and one large and heavy drop of rain fell on timmys black nose then another fell on his cardboard collar and made a very loud noise indeed startling him he sat up growling the rain came closer and soon large drops the size of halfcrowns peppered the faces of the two sleeping girls then came such a crash of thunder that they both awoke in a fright blow its a thunderstorm said george and thunder rain too we shall be soaked better get into the tent said anne as a flash of lightning forked down the sky and lighted up everything with a quick brilliance no good said george its soaked already theres nothing for it but to get into the cottage anne at least well have a roof over our heads or rather a ceiling for the roofs gone come on anne didnt in the least want to shelter in the old cottage but there was absolutely nothing else to do the girls grabbed their rug and ran through the rain george flashing her torch to guide them timmy ran too barking they came to the doorway of the cottage and went inside what a relief to get out of the rain the two girls huddled down into a corner the rug round them but soon they were too hot and threw it off the storm passed overhead with a few terrific crashes and much lightning gradually the rain grew less and soon stopped one star came out and then others followed as the thunderclouds swept away in the wind we cant go back to the tent well have to stay here said george ill go and get our bags for pillows we can lie on the rug anne went with her and carried a bag back too soon the girls were lying in a corner on the rug their heads on the bags and timmy close beside them good night said anne well try to go to sleep again blow that storm soon they were both asleep but timmy wasnt timmy was uneasy very uneasy and quite suddenly he broke into a volley of such loud barks that both girls woke up in a panic timmy whats the matter oh tim what is it cried george she clutched his leather collar and held on to him dont leave us timmy whats scared you chapter seven queer happenings timmy stopped barking and tried to get away from georges hand on his collar but she would not let him george was not easily frightened but what with the thunderstorm the queer old cottage and now timmys sudden excitement she wanted him near her what is it asked anne in a scared whisper i dont know i cant even imagine said george also in a low voice perhaps its nothing just the thunderstorm that has upset him and made him nervous well keep awake a bit and see if we hear anything queer they lay quietly in their corner and george kept a firm hand on timmy he growled once or twice but did not bark any more george began to think it really must have been the storm that had upset him a rumble of thunder came again the storm was returning or else another one was blowing up george felt relieved its all right anne it must have been the thunder and lightning in the distance that upset timmy youre silly timmy scaring us like that crash rumble crash yes certainly the storm was gathering force again timmy barked angrily be quiet you make more noise than the thunder said george crossly no you cant go out into the rain timmy its begun again as bad as before youd only get dripping wet and then youd want to come and sit as close to me as possible and make me wet too i know you no dont let him go george said anne i like him here with us my word what a storm i hope it wont strike this cottage well considering that it must have stood here for three or four hundred years and have seen thousands of storms i expect it will come safely through one more said george where are you going anne just to look out of the window said anne or out of the place where the window used to be i like to see the countryside suddenly lit up for just one moment in a lightning flash and then go back to darkness again she went to stand at the window there came the crash of thunder not far away and a brilliant flash of lightning anne stared over the countryside which had suddenly become visible in the flash and then disappeared like magic in a second anne gave a sudden cry and stumbled back to george george george whatevers the matter asked george alarmed theres someone out there people said anne clutching george and making her jump i saw them just for an instant when the lightning flashed people what sort of people said george astonished how many i dont know it was all so quick i think there were two or maybe three they were standing some way off quite still out there in the storm anne those are trees said george scornfully there are two or three small trees standing against the sky out there i noticed them the other day these werent trees said anne i know they werent what are people doing out there in this storm im frightened george was absolutely certain that anne had seen the group of little trees that she knew were there they would look just like people in a quick flash of lightning no sooner did you see something in a storm than it was gone she comforted anne dont worry anne its the easiest thing in the world to imagine seeing things in a lightning flash timmy would bark if there were people around he would well he did bark didnt he said anne he woke us both up with his barking ah yes but that was just because he heard the storm coming up again said george and you know he gets angry when he hears the thunder growling just at that moment the thunder crashed again then the lightning flashed its weird and brilliant light this time both the girls screamed and timmy gave an enormous bark trying his hardest to get away from george there did you see that said anne in a shaky voice yes yes i did oh anne youre right someone was looking in at the window and if we saw him he must have seen us whatever is he doing here in the middle of the night well i told you i saw two or three people said anne still shakily i expect it was one of them maybe they saw the cottage in one of the lightning flashes and thought they might shelter here and sent one of their number to see maybe but what in the world is anyone doing wandering about here at night said george they cant possibly be up to any good lets go home tomorrow anne i wish the boys were here theyd know what to do they would have some good plan the storms going off again said anne timmy has stopped barking too thank goodness dont let him go george you never know those people whoever they are might do him harm anyway i feel safer when hes with us i wouldnt dream of letting him go said george youre trembling anne you neednt be as scared as that timmy wont let you come to any harm i know but it wasnt very nice suddenly seeing somebody looking in at the window like that outlined in a lightning flash said anne i cant possibly go to sleep again lets play some silly game to take our minds off it so they played the alphabet game with animals each had to think in turn of an animal beginning with a and a mark went to the one who could keep it up longest then they went on to b and to c and to d they were doing the es when they heard a loud and very comforting sound timmys snoring said george hes fast asleep what an elephantine snore tim e for elephant said anne quickly cheat that should have been my e said george all right e for eland e for eggeater said anne after a pause not allowed you made that up said george my mark by the time they got to m and anne was two marks ahead the dawn was breaking it was a great relief to the two girls to see the silvering of the sky in the east and to know that soon the sun would be up they immediately felt much better george even stood up and went bravely to the window where there was nothing to be seen but the quiet countryside outside with its stretches of heather gorsebushes and silver birches we were silly to be so scared said george i dont think well go back home today after all anne i hate running away from anything the boys would laugh at us i dont care if they do said anne im going back if the boys were here id stay but goodness knows when theyll come it might not be till next week im just not staying here another night all right all right said george do as you like but for goodness sake tell the boys it was you who wanted to run away not me i will said anne oh dear now i feel sleepy all over again i suppose its because daylight is here and everything seems safe so i know i can fall asleep george felt the same they cuddled down together on the rug again and immediately feel asleep they did not wake till quite late and even then something woke them or they might have slept on for hours tired out with their broken night and the fright they had had they were awakened by something scuttling round them making a very loud noise indeed then timmy barked the girls awoke and sat up rather dazed oh its jet said anne jet have you come to see if were all right you dear funny little oneeyed thing wuffwuff said jet and rolled over on his back to be tickled his long thin tail wagging all the time timmy leaped on him and pretended to eat him then a loud voice called to them they looked up the boy was standing at the door grinning widely hallo sleepyheads i came to see if you were all right after that awful storm i know i promised i wouldnt come here but i felt a bit worried about you oh well thats nice of you said anne getting up and brushing the dust from her skirt were quite all right but we had rather a queer night we she got a hard nudge from george and stopped suddenly george was warning her not to say anything about the people they had seen or the person at the window did she think they might have anything to do with this boy anne said no more and george spoke instead wasnt it a dreadful storm how did you get on all right i sleep down in a trench and the rain cant get at me well so long come on jet the boy and the dog disappeared that was nice of him said anne he doesnt seem crazy this morning does he quite normal he didnt even contradict us i think i quite like him after all they went to their soaked tent and got a tin of sardines out to eat with bread and butter just as they were opening it they heard someone whistling and looked up here comes that boy again said anne good morning i dont want to butt in but i just wondered if you were all right after the storm said the boy without even a smile the girls stared at him in amazement look dont start being crazy all over again said george you know jolly well were all right weve already told you you havent and i didnt know said the boy well i only came out of politeness sorry to see you are still balmy and off he went there said anne vexed just as we thought he was nice again and not crazy he starts all over again i suppose he thinks its funny silly ass they set their things out to dry in the sun and it was halfpast twelve before they were ready to pack and go back to kirrin cottage george was rather cross about going but anne was quite firm she was not going to spend another night on the common george was just strapping a package on her bicycle when the two girls heard the sound of voices and then timmy went quite mad he barked wildly and set off down a path at top speed his tail wagging nineteen to the dozen oh it cant be surely it cant be julian and dick shouted george in sudden delight and she shot off after timmy it was it was julian and dick there they came packs on their backs grinning all over their faces hurrah the famous five were all together once more chapter eight all together again there was such excitement at the arrival of the boys that at first nobody could make themselves heard timmy barked at the top of his very loud voice and simply would not stop george shouted and dick and julian laughed anne hugged them and felt proud of two such brown goodlooking brothers ju we never guessed youd come so soon said the delighted george gosh im pleased to see you we got fed up with french food said dick i came out in spots and julian was sick and it was so hot phew next time i go there ill go when its cooler and we kept on thinking of kirrin and the bay and you two girls and timmy said julian giving george a friendly punch i think we really got a bit homesick so we packed up before we should and flew home flew said george you lucky things and then did you come straight down here we spent the night with mother and dad at home said julian and then caught the first train here that we possibly could this morning only to find that you werent at kirrin so we packed campingout things in smaller bags and came straight along to you said dick i say george old thing do you think you could possibly make timmy stop barking im going a bit deaf shut up tim ordered george let other people bark a bit do you notice his collar julian cant help seeing it said julian he looks a scream in it doesnt he ha ha youre an elizabethan dog with a ruff timmy thats what uncle quentin told us and thats what you look like old fellow he looks most comical i must say said dick enough to make a cat laugh hey timmy anne looked at george goodness what would she say to hear julian and dick laughing at timmy and making fun of him would she lose her temper at once but george only grinned in fact she gave a little laugh herself yes he does look funny doesnt he but he doesnt mind a bit you know we came here to camp because george couldnt bear people laughing at began anne thinking that she wouldnt let george get away with this but george gave her such a beseeching look that she stopped at once george could never bear to look small in front of julian and dick she prided herself on being just like a boy and she was suddenly certain that her two cousins would think she was just like a girl if they heard of the fuss she had made about people laughing at timmys collar i say you two seem to be packing up said julian looking at the package strapped to the back of georges bicycle whats happened well it got a bit lonely and anne was and then in her turn george caught a beseeching loop from anne she knew what it meant i didnt tell tales of you so dont tell tales of me dont say i was scared er anne was certain that there was something queer going on here went on george who had quite meant to say that anne was scared and insisted on going home and we didnt feel that we could tackle it ourselves though if you had been here we wouldnt have dreamed of going home of course what do you mean something queer asked dick well you see it began like this said george but julian interrupted if theres a tale to tell lets have it over a meal shall we weve had nothing to eat since six oclock this morning dick and i and were ravenous yes good idea said dick and began to undo a big package which he took out of his bag ive a picnic lunch here from your mother george a jolly good one i can tell you i think she was so relieved to think that she was going to get rid of us that she really surpassed herself weve got a marvellous piece of boiled ham look itll last us for ages if we dont give bits to timmy get away tim this is not for you grrrrrr george suddenly felt so happy that she could hardly speak it had been fun camping with anne but what a difference the boys made so confident of themselves so merry full of jokes so idiotic and yet so dependable she felt that she wanted to sing at the top of her voice the sun had been hot again that morning and had dried the common beautifully it wasnt long before the five were sitting down in the heather with a very fine feast before them i wouldnt sell anyone my hunger for a hundred pounds said dick now then whos going to carve this magnificent piece of gammon there were no plates so they had to make sandwiches of the ham dick had actually brought some mustard and dabbed it generously over the slices of ham before george put them between pieces of bread aha tim this is one way of making sure you wont get even a bite of these wonderful ham sandwiches said dick you cant bear mustard can you ju wheres the meat we brought for tim here pooh it smells a bit strong said julian do you mind taking it to a nice secluded corner tim timmy immediately sat down close to julian now dont be so disobedient said julian and gave timmy a friendly push he doesnt understand the word seclucled said george with a grin tim buzz off a bit timmy understood that and took his meat a little way away everyone took a ripe red tomato and a little lettuce heart from a damp cloth brought by julian and settled down happily to munch sandwiches lovely said anne contentedly goodness gracious i can hardly believe we had such a peculiar time last night ah tell us all about it said dick so first anne then george related all that had happened anne told of the night she had seen a light in the old cottage and had heard whispers and footfalls inside we did think i might have been dreaming she said but now we dont think i was we think i really did see and hear those things what next asked julian taking his third sandwich this all sounds most interesting quite famous fiveish in fact george told of the storm in the night and how they had had to leave their heatherbed and go to shelter in the old cottage and how in the flashes of lightning anne had seen two or three people standing outside and then how they had both seen someone standing silently looking in at the window queer said julian puzzled yes something is up i wonder what i mean theres absolutely nothing on this lonely bit of common thats at all interesting well there are the remains of an old roman camp said anne and a boy there who is examining them to see if he can find anything old and interesting a completely mad boy said george he doesnt seem to know what he says or doesnt say contradicts himself all the time or to put it another way tells the most idiotic fibs and he apparently thinks its awfully funny to meet us somewhere and then double round on his tracks and appear suddenly somewhere else said anne sometimes i cant help liking him other times hes too fatheaded for words hes got a little oneeyed dog called jet said george and timmy gave a sudden bark as he heard the name you like jet dont you tim this all sounds most interesting said dick pass me the tomato bag ju before you eat the lot thanks as i said most interesting a oneeyed dog a mad boy roman remains and people who come to an old ruined cottage in the dead of night and look into windows i wonder you two girls didnt pack up and go home said julian you must be braver without us than i thought possible george caught annes eye and grinned mischievously but said nothing anne owned up red in the face well i did tell george i was going home this very morning i was so scared last night george didnt want to of course but she was coming all the same but now youve turned up things are different ah well do we stay on or dont we ju said dick are we scared or are we not everyone laughed well if you go back i shall stay on alone said anne just to show you good old anne said dick we all stay of course it may be nothing it may be something we cant tell but well certainly find out and the first thing to do is to have a look at the roman remains and the mad boy im looking forward to meeting him i must say after that well tackle the ruined cottage timmy came up to see if he could get any titbits julian waved him away you smell of toostrong meat timmy he said go and get a drink by the way is there anything to drink here george oh yes said george a lovely spring not far off either lets take the remains of our meal there and the mug weve only got one unfortunately so its no good getting water unless we all sit by the spring and take turns at the mug come on the boys thought that the spring was a really splendid one they grouped themselves around it and took turns at filling the mug and drinking from it they were now eating slabs of joans fruitcake and it was very good now you girls unpack again said dick when they had finished their meal goodness i did enjoy that wed better unpack too julian right where shall we put our things asked julian looking around i dont somehow like to leave everything under that little tent with a mad boy about and a oneeyed dog i feel that both of them might like the rest of that ham oh its too hot to leave ham out in this sun said george well have to put it into the old cottage on a shelf well put everything there shall we move in properly in case it rains again at night its so tiresome to have to bundle everything indoors in the dark and the rain i agree said dick right well move into the ruined cottage what fun come on everyone they spent the next halfhour taking their things into the cottage and putting them in corners or on shelves george found a dark corner behind the fireplace where she put the food for she was halfafraid that jet nice little dog though he seemed might perhaps smell the ham and gobble up most of their food now said julian are we ready to go and see the roman remains and the mad boy here we go then the famous five are off again and who knows what will happen chapter nine a little exploration the five walked off together timmy at the back delighted to have all his friends with him again he kept nudging first one persons heels and then another just to remind them that he was there as they came near the old camp they saw a boy sitting beside a bush reading theres that boy we told you of said george see he looks fairly ordinary said dick very absorbed in his book i must say determined to take no notice of us ill speak to him said george so as they drew near she called to the boy hallo wheres jet the boy looked up annoyed how do i know well he was with you this morning said george he was not said the boy hes never with me please dont disturb me im reading there you are said george to the others he came to see us this morning with jet and now he says the little dog is never with him quite quite mad or plain rude said dick not worth bothering about anyway well if hes not doing any excavating in his roman camp perhaps we can explore it without being ordered off they walked on slowly and came to the camp and at once heard a cheerful whistling going on and the sound of someone digging george looked over the top of the dugout trench in surprise she almost toppled in she was so amazed at what she saw the boy was there digging carefully whistling as he did so he brushed his tousled hair from his hot forehead and caught sight of george and the others he looked rather astonished how on earth did you get down here so quickly said george do you have wings or something ive been down here all the afternoon said the boy for at least an hour i should think fibber said george the boy looked very angry and shouted back at once im tired of you two girls and now youve brought your friends too i suppose you think you can come and aggravate me even more dont be a fathead said dick feeling as puzzled about this boy as george and anne had been how in the world had he run around them and got down in the trench so quickly did he enjoy playing tricks like that he really didnt look mad is this your property this old camp asked julian no of course not dont be daft said the boy as if i could own a whole camp like this it was discovered by my father some time ago and he gave me permission to work here for the hols its pretty exciting i can tell you see my finds he pointed to a rough shelf where stood a broken pot something that looked like an old brooch a long pinlike thing and part of a stone head julian was at once interested he leapt down into the trench i say youve certainly got something there he said any coins too yes three said the boy and put his hand in his pocket i found this one first then these two close together yesterday they must be hundreds and hundreds of years old by this time all the others were down in the trench too they looked about with much interest evidently the place had been well excavated by experts and now the boy was working here and there on his own hoping to find something that had been overlooked dick went out of the trench and began to clamber about over the great stones and rocks a small animal suddenly caught his eye a young rabbit it stared at him in fright and then disappeared behind a slab of stone it peeped out at dick again and he was amused he went cautiously over to the slab and the little rabbit disappeared but soon two or three whiskers poked out dick got down on hands and knees and looked behind the slab a dark hole was there dick pulled out his torch and flashed it into the hole wondering if the small rabbit was hiding there or whether it was the entrance to a burrow to his surprise there was a very big hole indeed a hole that seemed to go down and down and down his torch could make out no bottom to it its far too wide for a rabbithole thought dick i wonder where it leads to ill ask that boy he went back to where the boy was still showing his things to julian talking eagerly i say began dick theres a most interesting hole behind one of the stone slabs over there what is it oh that my father says it was explored and that it was only a place for storages meat in hot weather or loot or something like that actually nothing whatever was found there most uninteresting as a matter of fact it may be nothing to do with the camp at all i say look heres another shelf with things on it said george suddenly spying a little collection of things on a rough shelf in another part of the trench are these yours too those no said the boy nothing to do with me at all dont touch them please whose are they then asked george curiously the boy took no notice whatever of her question and went on talking to julian george took down a beautiful little round pot hey i told you not to touch those yelled the boy so suddenly and angrily that george almost dropped the pot put it back and clear out if you cant do what youre told easy old man easy said julian no need to yell at her like that you scared that little dog of yours and made him jump almost out of his skin wed better go i think well i dont like being disturbed too much said the boy people always seem to be wandering around ive turned off quite a lot people said julian remembering annes story of two or three figures standing outside the cottage the night before and of someone looking in what kind of people oh nosey ones wanting to get down and explore disturbing me its surprising how many idiots there are wandering about this lonely place said the boy picking up a tool again and setting to work he grinned suddenly i dont mean you you really know something about this kind of thing was anyone about last night asked julian well i rather think so said the boy because jet here barked like mad but it might have been the storm that frightened him not that hes usually frightened of storms whats your name asked dick guy lawdler said the boy and dick whistled my word is your father the famous explorer sir john lawdler he asked the boy nodded well no wonder youre so keen on archaeology said dick your fathers done pretty well in that line hasnt he come on dick said george lets go now we might have time for a swim in the pool we forgot to tell you about that right said dick come on julian goodbye guy they left the rather desolate old camp and went back to the cottage to get their swimsuits and change it wasnt long before they were running over the heather to the pool hallo guys having a swim said dick in surprise sure enough a boy was there his hair falling over his forehead as usual hey guy shouted george have a swim with us but the boy was already getting out of the water dick shouted wait a minute dont go wed like to have a swim with you guy the boy turned defiantly dont be an ass he said my names not guy and leaving four astonished people behind him he ran lightly over the heather and disappeared there you are hes mad after all said anne dont bother about him come on in the waters lovely and warm they lazed about afterwards and began to feel hungry though how any of us could feel hungry after eating about fifty sandwiches between us at dinnertime i dont know said dick race you back to the cottage ju they changed back into ordinary clothes and then had tea fruit cake shortbread biscuits and tinned pineapple on bread they kept the juice and diluted it with cold spring water it was simply delicious now lets explore the cottage said dick we already have anne and i said george so i dont expect youll find anything much they went methodically through the old house and even up the old stone stairway to the two rooms upstairs though they could hardly be called rooms for they had very little roof and not much wall nothing much here thats certain said dick clattering down the stone stairway now lets go to the outbuildings not that theres much left of them either they examined everything and came last of all to the old stables it was dark inside for the windows were very small and it was some seconds before anyone could see properly old mangers said dick touching them i wonder how long ago it is since they were used and i say said george suddenly theres something funny here anne look this bit of floor was undisturbed yesterday wasnt it anne looked down at the big white flagstone on which george was standing it was quite obvious that it had been lifted for the edges were not as green with moss as the others were and the stone had been put back a little crookedly yes someones been interested in this stone or in what is beneath it said dick i bet something is buried underneath those men last night thats what they came about said george they went into these stables and lifted this stone why well soon find out said julian come on everyone loosen it with your fingers then well heave it up chapter ten what can be happening forty fingers and thumbs were very hard at work trying to loosen the heavy stone at last julian got hold of a corner which could be held more easily than any other part of the stone he tried to lift it and it came away a little help me this side dick said julian and dick put his strong fingers there too heaveho he said and up came the stone it went over with a crash and timmy barked loudly jumping aside everyone peered down and then looked exceedingly disappointed there was nothing there at all not even a hole the black earth hard as iron lay underneath and nothing else they all stared down at the dry hard earth puzzled george looked up at julian well thats queer isnt it why should anyone lift up this heavy stone if there is nothing hidden underneath well its clear that whoever was here didnt find anything nor did he hide anything either said julian dear me why should anyone lift up a heavy stone and put it back just for nothing he was obviously looking for something that wasnt here said anne the wrong stone probably yes i think annes right said dick its the wrong stone probably there is something very interesting under the right stone but which one is it they all sat and looked at one another and timmy saw it too wondering why all this fuss was made about a flat white stone julian thought hard from what youve told me anne about seeing a light in the cottage that first night you were here and hearing voices and then seeing those figures outside last night in the storm it looks as if someone is urgently hunting for something round about here yes something under a stone treasure of some sort do you think said george julian shook his head no i hardly think that much treasure would be hidden anywhere about this old cottage all the people who lived here must have been fairly poor the most they would have hidden would have been a few pieces of gold and that would have been found long ago well someone modern might have hidden something valuable here even something stolen said anne yes we cant tell its obviously important and urgent to somebody said dick i wonder if the people that guy said came bothering him were anything to do with this they may have been said julian but they have clearly decided that what they are looking for is here now whatever it is and they must have been most annoyed to find you and anne here last night george thats why someone came and looked in at the window i expect to make sure you were asleep and you werent i dont know whether i want to stay on here or not now said anne alarmed if they havent found what they want theyll probably come again in the night too who cares said dick weve got timmy havent we im not turning out of here because somebodys got a habit of turning up big stones julian laughed nor am i lets stay on and i dont see why we shouldnt do a bit of pulling up of stones ourselves we might come across something very interesting right its decided that we stay on then is it said dick what about you anne oh yes of course ill stay said anne not wanting to in the least but knowing that she simply could not bear not to be with the others the five walked round and about the cottage for a while trying to make out where the people that the girls had seen the night before had come from from what direction did they come and go the figures i saw first in the lightning stood about there said anne pointing lets go and see if there are any footprints it was pouring with rain and the ground must have been very muddy good idea said dick and off they went to where anne had pointed but it was a heathery piece of ground and difficult to tell even if anyone had trodden there for the heather was thick and springy lets look just outside the window now the one where anne saw someone looking in said dick and there they had a find just in front of the window were two quite deeplyprinted footmarks one was slightly blurred as if the maker of them had turned his foot sideways as he waited the other was very clear indeed dick got out a piece of paper i rather think ill measure these he said and make a note of the pattern on the soles they had rubber soles and heels look at the markings crepe rubber i should think he measured the prints size eight shoes he said same as yours ju then he carefully drew an exact picture of the sole and heel markings youre quite a detective dick said anne admiringly and he laughed oh anyone can copy footprints he said the thing is to match them up with the owner i have a feeling its getting on for suppertime if anyone wants any supper said george its halfpast eight would you believe that the time could fly so fast i dont really feel very hungry said dick weve done pretty well today well dont waste our precious food if you dont feel hungry said george we shall have to keep going home for more if we eat everything too quickly nobody felt terribly hungry they made a cosy corner in the cottage and had a slice of cake and a biscuit each with a drink of pineapple juice and springwater george had had the bright idea of filling the big empty pineapple tin and they each filled a mug from it in turn and drank its getting dark said julian are we going to sleep inside the cottage or out in said dick promptly well make things just as difficult for any nightprowlers as possible right said julian i bet they wont be pleased to find old timmy here too shall we go out and get some heather for beds i dont fancy sharing a thin rug between the four of us soon they were all dragging in armfuls of the springy heather they laid it in the front room in two corners for the boys thought they would rather be in the same room as the girls in case of danger you need an awful lot of heather to make a soft bed said dick trying his my bones seem to go right through the clumps and rub against the floor we can put our macs over our heather said julian that will help the girls can have the rug we shant need any covering its so hot by the time they had finished it was dark george lay on her heather and yawned im going to sleep she announced we dont need to keep guard or anything like that do we timmy will bark if anyone comes near youre right i really dont think we need take turns at keeping awake said julian move up dick youve left me no room julian was the last to go to sleep he lay awake puzzling over the lifted stone slab it was clear that someone had expected to find something under it how did they know it was that particular slab had they a map if so it must have shown the wrong stone or perhaps the searchers read the map wrong before he could work it out any further he was asleep timmy was asleep too happy because all the others were under his care he had one ear open as usual but not very much open it was enough to let him hear a small mouse of some kind run across the floor it was even enough for him to hear a beetle scraping its way up the wall after a while his ear dropped down and he didnt even hear a hedgehog outside but something caused his ear to listen again and it pricked up a noise crept inside the cottage a noise that got louder and louder a weird and puzzling noise timmy woke up and listened he pawed at george not knowing whether to bark or not he knew he should not bark at owls but this was not an owl perhaps george would know dont timmy said george sleepily but timmy went on pawing her then she too heard the noise and sat up in a hurry what a truly horrible sound it was a whining and a wailing rising and falling through the night a sound of misery and woe that went on and on julian dick wake up called george her heart beating wildly somethings happening the boys awoke at once and so did anne they sat and listened to the weird noise what in the world could it be there it went again wailing high in the air and then dying away with a moan only to begin again a few seconds later dick felt the roots of his hair pricking he leapt off the heatherbed and ran to the window quick gome and look at this he cried what is it they all crowded to the window timmy barking now as loudly as he could in silence the others gazed at a very strange sight blue and green lights were shining here and there sometimes dimly sometimes brightly a curious round white light was travelling slowly in the air and anne clutched george breathing fast it wont come here she said it wont will it i dont like it what is happening julian i wish that awful wailing whining noise would stop said dick it gets right inside my head do you make anything of all this julian somethings queer abroad said julian ill go out with timmy and see what i can find and before anyone could stop him out he went timmy barking beside him oh julian come back called anne listening as his footsteps became distant they all waited tensely at the window and then suddenly the wailing noise stopped and the strange lights began to fade then they heard julians footsteps coming back firmly in the darkness ju what was it called dick as his brother came in at the doorway i dont know dick said julian sounding very puzzled i simply dont know perhaps we can find out in the morning chapter eleven interesting discoveries and a plan the four sat in the dark and talked over the horrible noises and the weird blue and green and white lights anne sat close to julian she really was frightened i want to go back to kirrin she said lets go tomorrow i dont like this i didnt see a thing just now said julian puzzled his arm close round anne i seemed to go quite close to those wailing sounds and then they stopped as soon as i got fairly near but although timmy barked and ran around there didnt seem to be anyone there did you get near the lights asked dick yes fairly near but the odd thing was that they seemed high up when i got near them not near the ground as i expected and again timmy couldnt find anyone you would have thought if there was anyone about playing the fool that timmy would have found them but he didnt woof said timmy dolefully he didnt like this queer business at all well if nobodys making the noises and lights it makes it even worse said anne do lets go home julian tomorrow all right said julian i dont feel particularly thrilled about all this myself but there is one idea ive got in my mind which id like to sort out tomorrow whats that said dick well it may quite well be that somebody very badly wants us out of here for some reason said julian and that somebody may want to come and lift other stones and have a thorough search all over the place which he cant do with us around so hes trying to frighten us out yes i believe you are right julian said dick those noises and lights they would be enough to scare anyone out of a place too eerie for words well lets have a good snoop round in the daylight to see if we can find any trace of a trickster we will but its extremely odd that timmy didnt find him said julian timmy can smell anyone out of any hidingplace yes well have a very very good hunt round tomorrow and if you find nothing and nobody well go home asked anne yes we will i promise you said julian hugging anne dont worry you shant have to stay here one night longer unless you want to now lets try and go to sleep again it took the four a long time to go to sleep after all this excitement in the middle of the night anne kept listening for the wailing noises again but none came she kept her eyes shut tightly in case she should happen to see any more of the queer lights outside the window george and the boys lay awake too puzzling out the problems of lights and noises which were not apparently caused by anyone julian especially was puzzled only timmy was unconcerned he went to sleep before anyone else though he kept one ear wide open and up went the other one when george moved or dick whispered to julian the excitement of the night made them all sleep late julian awoke first and stared at the low ceiling in surprise now where was he in france no ah of course he was in the old ruined cottage he woke dick who yawned and stretched remember those queer lights and noises last night asked dick what a fright they gave us it seems silly to think we were all so puzzled and scared now that the sun is shining in at the window and we can see the countryside around for miles im pretty certain someone is trying to scare us away said julian we are in their way here they want to do some thorough explorations and they cant because of us ive a good mind to take the girls home dick and come back here with you anne might go but george wouldnt said dick you know what old george is good as any boy and as full of courage as any boy too lets not decide anything till we have had a look round this morning i dont really believe theres anything spooky about this at all i agree with you that its just a few tricks to frighten us away right said julian lets wake the girls hey george anne sleepyheads get up and get us breakfast what are girls for if not to get our meals george sat up looking furious as julian intended you jolly well get your own m she began and then laughed as she saw julians amused face i was only just striking a little match to set you alight said julian come on lets all go for a swim in the pool they set off together happily in the warm sunshine timmy padding along his tail waving vigorously as soon as they got to the pool they saw the boy there floating lazily on his back theres guy said anne i wonder if he will admit to his name or not this morning said george remember how he told us his name was guy and then said it wasnt a little while after silly ass i cant make out if hes quite mad or just thinks its funny to keep playing the fool they came to the pool the boy waved to them grinning come on in its fine is your name guy this morning or not called george the boy looked surprised of course its guy he said dont be idiotic come on in and have a game they had a fine swim and a mad one guy was like an eel swimming under the water catching their legs splashing swimming away fast doubling round and going underwater just as they got up to him at last they all sat panting on the edge of the pond the sun shining down warmly on them i say guy did you hear anything strange last night asked dick or see anything i didnt see anything strange but i thought i heard somebody wailing and crying in the distance said guy just now and again when the wind brought the sound this way jet didnt like it at all did you jet he went and hid under my legs we heard it too quite near us said julian and saw strange lights they discussed the matter for some time but guy could not really help them because he had not been near enough to the noises to hear them as clearly as the others had im getting hungry said george at last i keep thinking of ham and tomatoes and cheese lets go back to the cottage right said julian goodbye guy see you sometime soon goodbye jet you mad little thing they went off together their swimsuits almost dry already in the sun well guy was perfectly sensible this morning said anne funny i wonder why hes so silly sometimes see isnt that him running down the path there to the right look said george suddenly now how did he get there so quickly we left him by the pool it certainly looked like guy they called to him but he didnt even look round or wave though he must have heard them they went on puzzled how could one person be so different each time and why what was the point they had a good breakfast and then went out to look round and see if they could find anything to explain the strange happenings of the night before the noises seemed to come from about here when i came out last night said julian stopping near the little group of trees and the lights seemed to start about here too but not near the ground they were high up above my head above your head said dick puzzled that seems odd it doesnt said anne not a bit odd what about those trees there couldnt somebody climb up them and do the wailing and whining there with some strange instrument and set off the weird lights julian stared up at the trees and then round at anne he grinned suddenly annes got it clever girl of course someone was up there or maybe two people one doing the noises with some weird instrument and the other playing about with fireworks of some kind not the noisy kind just coloured fire or balloons lighted up from inside yes thats why the lights seemed to be so high up when you came out said dick they were sent out by someone up in a tree and floated away to scare us said anne golly i do feel glad that it was silly tricks like that that frightened us so they wouldnt frighten me again it explains something else too said george it explains why timmy didnt find anyone they were safely up trees i bet they hardly breathed when they knew tim was down below yes of course that puzzled me too said julian it was too spooky for words when even old tim couldnt find anyone real about just noises and lights heres something look a wrinkled little rubberskin pale green said dick picking something up from the ground thats what those lights were balloons lighted up from inside in some way and sent floating away in the air most ingenious said julian i expect they had quite a lot of funny tricks at their disposal last night yes they certainly mean to scare us away well they wont said anne unexpectedly im not going for one i wont be scared away by stupid tricks good old anne said julian and clapped her on the back right well all stay but ive got an idea what asked everyone well pretend to go said julian well pack up everything remove our things from here and go and camp somewhere else but dick and i will hide somewhere here tonight and watch to see if anyone comes and where they look for whatever it is theyre hunting for and why thats a wizard plan said dick pleased well do it roll on tonight adventure is about and well be ready for it chapter twelve a good hidingplace the five spent quite a pleasant day but when late afternoon came they decided that it was time to carry out their plan and pack as if they were leaving i imagine someone is spying on our doings said dick and wont he be pleased to see us apparently on the point of leaving how can anyone be spying asked anne looking all round as if she expected to see someone behind a bush timmy would be sure to sniff out anyone in hiding oh he wont be near enough for timmy to smell out said dick hell be a long way off then how can he possibly see us or know that were leaving asked anne anne i dont know if youve heard of fieldglasses began dick solemnly well theyre things that can spot anything half a mile away anne went red and gave dick a punch dont be an ass of course thats it fieldglasses used by someone on a hillside somewhere trained on the old cottage actually i think i know where the someone is said dick ive caught sight of a little flash every now and again on the hill yonder the kind of flash that is made by the sun on glass and i somehow think that our spy is sitting near the top of the hill watching us carefully anne turned to look at the hill but julian at once spoke sharply no dont stand and stare up there anyone we dont want the watcher to know that we know we are being watched they went on with their packing and soon began to stagger out with their bundles george was told to strap her things to her bicycle and stand well out in the open as she did so so that the watcher on the hill would be able to observe all her doings julian was in the midst of carefully folding up his things to go into his knapsack when anne gave a sudden exclamation someones coming everyone looked round imagining that they would see a sinisterlooking foreigner or someone peculiar in some way but all they saw was a countrywoman hurrying along a shawl over her head and a basket under her arm she wore cheap glasses had no makeup on and her hair was pulled straight back under the shawl she stopped when she saw the five good afternoon said julian politely isnt it glorious weather beautiful said the woman are you camping out youve chosen a good time no actually were packing said julian weve been sleeping in the old cottage but weve decided to move out is it very very old oh yes and its supposed to have queer things happening in it at nights said the woman we know that said julian my word we were pretty scared last night i can tell you weird noises and horrible ghastly lights we decided not to stay there any longer thats right said the woman dont you stay you get as far from this place as you can i can tell you i wouldnt come by it at night where are you going well our home is at kirrin said julian evading the question you know on kirrin bay ah yes a fine place said the woman well dont you stay another night goodbye she hurried off and was soon lost to sight go on packing said julian to the others the watcher is still up in the hills i caught sight of a flash again just then julian why did you tell all that to the woman asked anne you dont usually say so much when we are in the middle of something queer my dear unsuspecting anne do you mean to say that you thought that woman was really what she pretended to be a woman from a nearby farm said julian well wasnt she said anne surprised she looked like one no makeup and that old shawl and she knew all about the old cottage anne farmwomen dont have gold fillings in their teeth said julian didnt you notice them when she smiled and her hair was dyed said george i noticed it was blonde at the roots and black above and what about her hands said dick a farmers wife does a great deal of hard rough work and her hands are never white and smooth they are rough and brown this womans hands were as white as a princesss well yes i did notice them said anne and i did notice too that she sometimes spoke like a countrywoman and sometimes not well there you are said julian shes one of the unpleasant gang that tried to scare us last night and when the watcher on the hill reported that we appeared to be packing up and going she was told to go and make sure so she pretended to be a country woman and came by but unfortunately we werent quite so stupid as she thought we would be you certainly stuffed her up well said dick with a grin the gang will be down here tonight digging up all the big stones they can find you and i will have a marvellous time snooping round them youll be careful they dont see you wont you said anne where will you hide we havent planned that yet said dick now come on and well make a new camp somewhere that wont be easily seen you and george and timmy can sleep there tonight and ju and i will come and watch here i want to come too said george at once anne will be all right with timmy you arent joining us this time george said ju the fewer people watching the better sorry old thing but youll have to stay with anne george scowled and looked sulky at once julian laughed and slapped her on the shoulder what a lovely scowl one of your best i havent seen it for quite a long time keep it up george go on scowl a bit harder it suits you george grinned unwillingly and pulled herself together she hated being left out of anything but she did see that it was no use having a crowd of people watching that night all right she would stay with anne and keep her company it seemed as if the watcher on the hills must have gone because there were no more sudden flashes such as came when he lifted his fieldglasses to watch the five that disguised countrywoman has convinced the watcher that were going any ideas anyone where we can go not too far away but somewhere where the watcher cant follow us with his glasses if hes still up there i know a place said george theres a simply colossal gorsebush on the other side of the spring and underneath it is all hollow and dry its almost like a kind of gorsecave sounds all right said julian lets go and find it george led the way trying to remember exactly where it was timmy followed still in his enormous cardboard collar which was now rather the worse for wear george stopped when they had gone a little way past the spring it was somewhere here she said i know i could still hear the sound of the spring when i found the hollow under the bush ah theres the bush it certainly was a great bush green and spiky outside with a few yellow blooms on it still under it was a big hollow place where the ground was soft and fine scattered with dry old prickles the main trunk for it was almost a trunk that supported the big bush was not quite in the middle so there was a good bit of room julian caught hold of the branches that hid the hollow using a folded sheet of brown paper to hold them by for the bush was very prickly this is fine he said plenty of room for you two girls and timmy my word hell have difficulty with his collar though wont he squeezing in and out take it off said dick his ear really is practically healed now even if he scratches it he cant do much damage dear old timmy we simply shant know you without your collar right said george she took a quick look at the ear it was still covered by a piece of elastoplast but it was quite obvious that the ear was healthy she cut the thread that bound the two ends of the circular collar and then bent it so that it came off they all stared at timmy who looked most surprised he wagged his tail gently as if to say well so youve taken off that thing i wonder why oh tim you look sort of undressed without that collar now said anne it is nice to see you without it though good old tim youll guard me and george tonight wont you you know that were in the middle of something again dont you woof said timmy wagging his tail violently woof yes he knew all right chapter thirteen on watch in the cottage it was getting dark and under the gorsebush it was very dark indeed all the five had managed to squeeze in there and timmy too one torch only was allowed to be used at a time to save the batteries of the others the five were having supper the ham was now practically finished but there were still a few tomatoes and plenty of cake julian opened the last tin of sardines and made some sandwiches for himself and dick to take with them he also wrapped up two enormous chunks of cake and pocketed two slabs of chocolate each we shall need something to while away the time when were on the watch tonight he said with a grin i dont know if the weepies and wailies and floating lights will be along to give us a show but i fear not they would be wasted on an empty cottage i do hope youll be careful said anne anne thats the seventh time youve said that said dick dont be an ass dont you understand that ju and i are going to enjoy ourselves youll be the one that has to be careful how asked anne surprised well youll have to be careful of that big black beetle squatting over there said dick and mind that the hedgehog doesnt sit down on your bare legs and be careful in case a snake wants to share this nice safe warm place with you now youre being an ass said anne giving him a punch when will you be back we shall be back at exactly the moment you hear us squeezing under here said julian now dick what about it i think we might be going dont you right said dick and began to squeeze out carefully so as not to be pricked more than he could help oh why are gorse bushes so horribly spiteful jab jab anyone would think the bush was trying to prick me the two girls sat quite still when the boys had gone from the bush they tried to hear their footsteps but they couldnt dick and julian trod too softly on the wiry grass i do so hope theyll be began anne and george groaned if you say that again i shall slap you anne honestly i shall i wasnt saying it said anne i was only going to say that i hope theyll be successful tonight id like to get back to kirrin and have some fun bathing and boating wouldnt you yes and some of joans marvellous cooking said george sausages and mash and tomatoes with it yes and fried plaice fresh from the sea with joans best chipped potatoes said anne i can almost smell it woof said timmy sniffing hard there he thought i meant it said anne isnt timmy clever they had a pleasant talk about how very very clever timmy was and timmy listened and wagged his tail so hard that he made quite a dust in the gorsehollow lets go to sleep said anne we cant talk all night and keeping awake wont help the boys they curled up on the rug they had brought and cuddled together not so much for warmth because it was a hot night but because there was so little room anne put out her torch and the little place immediately became black and dark timmy put his head on georges tummy she groaned oh tim be careful please i had rather a lot of supper anne giggled and pulled timmys head close to her it was comforting to have old timmy there she agreed with george that he was the best dog in the whole world i wonder what the boys are doing now she said after a while do you suppose they are in the middle of something exciting perhaps they are but they werent julian and dick were feeling extremely bored at that minute they had gone cautiously to the cottage when they had left the girls not using their torches at all for fear of giving anyone warning that they were about they had debated beforehand where would be the best place to hide and had decided that it would be a good idea to climb up the little stone stair and hide in the roofless rooms above theres no roof there and hardly any walls said dick we can peep over any side to watch and no one would guess that anyone was above them spying down its a good thing its such a starry night once we get used to the dim light we shall be able to see fairly well pity theres no moon they had approached the cottage very cautiously indeed stopping at every step and listening with bated breath for any sound but there was none not even the light of somebodys torch either said dick in julians ear i dont think anyone is here yet lets get into the cottage and up those stairs as soon as we can they tiptoed into the cottage not daring to put on their torches they fumbled across to the little stone stairway and climbed it with as little sound as they could holding their breath made their hearts thump loudly can you hear my heart thumping dick whispered to julian as they at last stood on the floor of the roofless rooms above no mines just the same thumping away well were safely here lets just shuffle to and fro and see if there are any loose stones we might fall over and so give ourselves away they cleared away a few loose stones and then sat down silently on the low broken wall of the two ruined rooms the wind blew gently but warmly everything was still except the roserambler climbing over the old house it moved a little in the wind and made a faint scraping noise dick caught his hand on a thorn and sucked his finger the rambler was everywhere across the floor and over the walls and even up what was left of the little chimney the boys had been there for about threequarters of an hour when julian gave dick a slight nudge here they come he whispered see over there dick looked round and about and then caught sight of a small moving light just a prick in the darkness it cast a faint glow before it a torch he whispered and another and another quite a procession a slow one too the procession made very little noise it made its way to the cottage and then split up having a look to see if we really are gone whispered julian hope they wont think of coming up here lets get behind the chimney in case whispered back dick so very quietly they rose and made their way to where the remains of the chimney stood a dark shadow in the starry night the chimney was quite big though rather crumbly the two boys crouched close to it on the side farthest from where the stone stairway came up in the corner someone is coming up whispered dick his sharp ears catching the sound of someones feet on the stone stairs i hope he gets caught by the rambler theres a big spray near the top sh said julian someone came right up the stairway and gave an exclamation of annoyance near the top good thought dick he has got caught by the rambler a torch shone out over the ruined rooms the crumbling walls and the remains of the chimney the boys held their breath and stood like statues the light of the torch played over the place for one second and then a voice called down the stairs no one here the kids have gone we can get on with the job the boys let out a long breath good they were safe for the time being at any rate the visitors down below were no longer cautious they spoke in ordinary voices and torches flashed all over the place then someone lighted two lanterns and the little cottage shone quite brightly where do we start said a voice here jess wheres that plan ive got it ill spread it on the floor said a voice that the boys recognized at once it was the voice of the countrywoman who had spoken to them that day not that its much use pauls no good at drawing evidently the searchers were now leaning over the plan voices came up the stone stairway all we know for certain is that we have to find that white stone slab and we know the size but we dont know the place except that we think it must be here after all weve searched the old roman camp and there are no slabs there that size julian nudged dick so some of the visitors that guy had complained of must have been these searchers whatever was it they were looking for hidden behind a slab of stone he knew a minute later a drawling voice said if we have to get up every great slab in this neighbourhood we will im going to find that secret way if its the last thing i do if we dont find that we dont find those blueprints and if we dont find them we might as well go into the poorhouse for the rest of our lives or prison said someone not prison said the drawling voice itll be paul who goes to prison he managed to steal them we didnt cant you get paul to draw a better plan than this said the voice of the countrywoman i cant understand half thats written here hes ill almost off his head too said someone no good asking him he had such a time escaping with those prints he nearly died no good asking him i say i cant make out this word here said the woman wader whatever does it mean i dont know wait though i do it might be water water t not d in the middle wheres the well anywhere in this kitchen thats it thats it water i bet theres a slab over the well thats the way to the secret hidingplace julian clutched dick he was as excited as the man down below they listened eagerly straining their ears heres the old sink and this must be the remains of the pump the wells underneath this slab and see the stone is just about the right size get busy buck up get busy chapter fourteen an exciting night and a surprising morning soon there came the sound of loud breathing and grunts as the searchers tried to prise up the stone by the pump it was obviously very heavy and very difficult to move for it had become almost part of the floor itself through the centuries drat the thing its tearing my hands to pieces said a voice lend me that jemmy tom you dont seem to be doing much good with it after a lot more struggling and panting the stone was loosened up she comes said a voice and up came the stone so suddenly that it sounded as if most of those pulling at it had sat down very hard on the floor the two hidden boys were beside themselves with interest and excitement how they wished they could go and watch but it was impossible they must just listen and try to make out what was happening from what the men said below them is it a well down there yes it is my the waters pretty far down and black as pitch too there was a silence as the well was examined in the light of torches then an exasperated voice the one with the drawl said this is no secret way whos going to get through that water its just an ordinary small well and nothing else that word cant have meant water all right boss what does it mean then said the woman i dont know this isnt a plan its a riddle why couldnt paul have made it clear where this stone slab is he just goes and does a lot of scribble round it and all we can make out is that its on this common somewhere near here and the secret way is behind the slab and all we have to do is to go and look behind dozens of heavy slabs said someone else im fed up weve lifted slabs in that wretched camp weve lifted some here and we still dont know if were anywhere near the right one shut up said the voice of the drawler but now the voice was sharp and angry if we have to pull this cottage down if we have to lift every slab there is if we have to take over that camp ill do it i tell you this makes all the difference between wealth and poverty anyone who wants to back out can do so but hed better be careful now boss now boss dont you fly off the handle said the woman were all in this well do all you say look lets start by lifting a few more slabs there are not so very many that are the size that paul figured on this plan then began a boring time for the two hidden boys as slab after slab was lifted and put back nothing was found under any of them apparently the men went to the outbuildings too leaving the woman in the cottage the boys thought she had gone as well and julian moved a little feeling rather cramped after being still for so long the womans ears must have been sharp for she called out at once whos there is it you tom the boys stiffened and stood like statues the woman said no more it was not long before the men came back talking among themselves it sounded as if there were three of them no go said the drawler i think well have to search that camp really well again thats going to be difficult with someone already there said the woman well deal with him said a voice grimly julian frowned did that mean that guy was in danger he had better warn him im fed up with this place said the woman lets go i dont think the slab is anywhere here were wasting our time to the boys great relief the four searchers left the cottage and went off together julian and dick leaned over the crumbling wall of the room they stood in and watched the lights of the torches and lanterns getting dimmer and dimmer over the common good now they could go back to the girls im stiff said dick stretching himself well ju we know a lot more now dont we its clear that someone called paul has stolen some valuable blueprints of something maybe a new plane or battleship perhaps and has hidden them in some secret place he knew of about here and to get to it you have to lift a slab of stone of a certain size yes and we know the size because weve already seen the one they lifted in the old stables said julian i vote we go there and measure it or measure the one by the sink i should think that the right slab will be somewhere in the old camp wed better tell guy and let him into the secret hell help us to search what a peculiar business this is to find ourselves mixed up in said dick all because george didnt like people laughing at old timmy with a cardboard collar round his neck timmys the cause of this the boys went down the stone stairs and of course dick quite forgot about the rambler which caught him neatly round the ankle and almost tripped him headlong down the stairs blow he said clutching julian and nearly making him topple too sorry it was that rambler again its ripped my ankle all round put on the torch for goodness sake they carefully measured the stone slab by the sink and then made their way out of the cottage and up towards the spring hoping that they would find the great gorsebush in the dark they tried to get under the wrong one at first but at last found the right one they heard a small welcome bark from timmy oh julian dick is it you said annes voice as the boys squeezed through into the hollow middle oh what ages youve been we havent slept a wink keep still timmy do this place is too small for you to rampage about in the boys settled down and torches were put on julian related the curious happenings to the two interested girls george was thrilled oh i say fancy all this springing up out of the blue so suddenly what are you going to do warn guy first thing in the morning and then get in touch with the police i think said julian we ourselves cant stop the men searching the camp and as soon as they do find the slab theyre looking for they can easily get what they want and go off with it well its really thrilling said george i wish id been with you ill never go to sleep tonight but they did manage to drop off to sleep for they were all very tired after a few hours just as dawn was breaking timmy lifted his head and growled george awoke at once what is it tim i cant hear anything but timmy could that was certain george woke julian and made him listen to timmys continuous growling what do you think hes growling at she asked he keeps on and on i cant hear a thing can you no said julian listening well its no use my creeping out and going searching in the dark for whatever timmys growling at it might be something silly like a weasel or a hedgehog or a stoat shut up tim thats enough although it was as dark as night under the thick old gorsebush outside it was just getting light what was timmy growling at were there people about again or was it just one of the hedgehogs he so heartily disliked he stopped growling at last and put his head down on his paws closing his eyes george patted him well whatever it was its gone are you comfy julian its very cramped in here and hot too isnt it yes well get up fairly early and go to warn guy then well have a swim said julian yawning he switched off his torch and went to sleep again it was late when they awoke dick was the first and he looked at his watch he gave an exclamation gosh its half past eight hey ju anne george wake up its almost afternoon everyone felt stiff and cramped and they went off to have a swim and to warn guy as they came near the camp they stopped in amazement someone was howling down in the trench howling so miserably and so brokenheartedly that the five felt quite panicstricken whatever in the world could have happened they ran to the edge of the excavations and looked down into the trench the boy was there lying on his face sobbing he kept lifting his head and howling then putting it down again guy guy whatevers happened shouted julian he leapt down beside the boy are you hurt is jet hurt whats the matter its guy hes gone theyve taken him howled the boy and i was so awful to him now hes gone hell never come back i know he wont guys gone but but youre guy said julian in astonishment what do you mean he felt sure that the boy really was mad now quite mad talking about himself like that he patted him on the shoulder look youre ill you come along with us you need a doctor the boy sprang to his feet his face swollen and stained im not ill i tell you guys gone im not guy hes my twin there are two of us everyone gasped it took half a minute to think about this and get everything straight and then of course many things were clear there was not one mad boy there were two ordinary boys but they were twins there wasnt as they had thought just one boy who contradicted himself all the time who seemed continually to appear suddenly and unexpectedly and who was sometimes nice and sometimes not twins why on earth didnt we think of that before said julian we thought there was only one of you you were never together no we quarrelled quarrelled bitterly said the boy tears in his eyes again and when twins quarrel really quarrel its worse than any quarrel there is we hated one another then we really did we wouldnt be with one another we wouldnt eat together or dig together or sleep together weve often quarrelled before but not like this not like this i just pretended that he didnt exist and he did the same with me what a todo said julian astonished and worried well now whats happened to make you so upset tell me guy wanted to be friends with me again last night said the boy and i wouldnt i hit him and walked away then this morning i was sorry and went to find him and be friends and and he stopped and howled again everyone felt very sad and uncomfortable go on tell us said julian gently i was just in time to see him fighting two men and screaming at them and kicking then they hustled him away somewhere said the boy i fell down in the trench and hurt my leg and by the time i dragged myself up guy had gone and so had everyone else he turned away and wept again ill never forgive myself never if id made friends last night i could have helped him and i didnt chapter fifteen well done george it was anne who comforted the boy she went to him and pulled him down on a stone beside her let me look at your leg she said its pretty bad isnt it look ill bind it up for you dont be so upset well help you i think we know whats happened dont we julian the boy looked at anne gratefully and sniffed hard when she offered him her handkerchief he took it and wiped his face dick gave anne his big hanky to bind up the boys cut and bruised leg he must have fallen right into the trench in his fright at seeing his brother fighting and being taken away how do you know whats happened he said to julian can you get guy back do say you can ill never forgive myself for this my twinbrother and i wasnt there to fight by his side when he needed me now dont soak my hanky all over again said anne he gave her a forlorn little smile and turned to julian again my names harry lawdler and guy and i are mad on old camps and buildings and things we spend almost all our holidays together digging and finding all kinds of things like these he nodded his head towards the little shelf of relics that the four had seen before yes guy told us said dick but he never said a word about you we were often very puzzled we thought you and he were one boy not two you see and we couldnt understand a lot of things you both said youre so very very alike well i tell you we each pretended that the other didnt even exist said harry were like that we love each other best in the world and we hate each other worse when we quarrel were simply horrible then can you tell us a bit about the people that guy was fighting asked dick yes they were some that came before wanting guy to clear out while they had a look round said harry wiping his face again guy was pretty rude to them in fact i heard him say that if they messed about his camp he would throw stones at them hes like that you know very fierce when hes roused and you think these were the same people said dick which way did they go with guy that way said harry pointing ive hunted the whole camp round but theyre gone disappeared into thin air its extraordinary lets have a hunt round said julian we might find something but i imagine that the searchers have taken guy off with them because he knew too much perhaps they found here what they were looking for and saw guy watching oh then were too late said george in deep disappointment theyve got what they want and theyll disappear now and never be caught i expect by now they are speeding away in a fast car and have taken guy with them to make sure he doesnt talk before theyre safely in another country oh no cried harry hes not kidnapped is he dont say that come on lets have a hunt said julian and they all made their way among the various trenches and pits looking for they hardly knew what they gave it up after a while there were too many slabs and stones of all sizes besides what good would it be even if they found the right one the birds had flown presumably with what they had come for in fact if guy hadnt come along and seen the searchers nobody would even have known that they had been in the camp and made a successful search its no good said julian at last this is too big a place to know where to look for anything that might help us lets go back to the gorsebush and collect our things return to kirrin and go to the police its the only sensible thing left to do come along harry said anne to the miserable twin he was so full of remorse that her handkerchief was now soaked for the third time youd better come with us and tell all you know ill come said harry ill do anything to get guy back ill never quarrel with him again never to think that now dont go all through that again said anne look youre upsetting timmy so much that his tail is down all the time harry gave another forlorn little smile they all left the camp and made their way back to the gorsebush it was only when they got there and began pulling out the tins of food as well as the rug and other things that they realized how extremely hungry they were weve had no breakfast weve been up for ages and its very late im simply starving said george well if we finish up all the food we shant have to carry the tins said dick lets have a meal ten minutes more here cant make much difference they were thankful not to have to sit under the gorsebush again they sat outside in the sun and discussed everything i believe when timmy began to growl and growl about six oclock this morning it was because he could hear those people coming quietly by to go to search the camp said george i think youre right said julian i bet they searched the camp well till guy woke and came on the scene and fought like fury its a pity i didnt squeeze out from under the bush and follow them when timmy growled anyone want a drink said george ill go and fetch some water from the spring wheres the pineapple tin anne passed it to her george got up and took the little rabbitpath that led to the spring she could hear it gurgling and bubbling as she came near a very pleasant noise water always sounds nice said george to herself i love the sound of water water now why did that ring a bell in her mind just then who had been talking about water oh dick and julian of course when they had come back from the old cottage last night they had told anne and herself about the word on the plan the word that might have been water not wader i wonder which it was said george to herself as she idly held the pineapple tin to the gurgling water she gazed at the beautiful little spring jutting up from the stony slabs and then another bell rang loudly in her mind stone slabs water why i wonder i just wonder if one of these slabs is the one this one just here is about the right size she stared at it it was set firmly in a high little bank at the back of the place where the spring gurgled up and then ran into the clean stony channel did it hide anything behind it george suddenly dropped the tin and ran back to the others at full speed julian julian i believe ive found the slab its been staring us in the face the whole time julian was very startled so were the others they stared up at george in astonishment what do you mean george said julian jumping to his feet show me followed by everyone george ran back to the spring she pointed to the white slab behind the water there she said thats the right size isnt it and its beside water just as it said in the plan you told us about only the people thought it was wader gosh i wonder if youre right george said julian excited you might be you never know sometimes springs come from underground passages secret hidden ways into the earth lets try and move it said dick his face red with sudden excitement it looks pretty hefty to me they began to struggle with the stone getting extremely wet as they splashed about in the spring but nobody minded that this was too exciting for words harry helped too heaving and tugging he was very strong indeed the stone slab moved a little it slid to one side and stuck more tugging more pulling more panting and puffing i believe well have to get help said julian at last it really is too heavy and wellembedded ill go and get some of my tools said harry im used to heaving stones about with them we can easily move it if we have the right tools he flew off at top speed the others sat down and mopped their streaming foreheads phew said julian what a job this is for a hot day im glad harry remembered his tools just what we want how queer that he and guy are twins said george i never even thought of such a thing well they behaved so idiotically said julian always pretending there was just one of them and neither of them even mentioning the other i wonder where guy has been taken to i dont think hell come to much harm but it will be worrying to his people here comes harry said anne after a pause one of us ought to have gone with him to help him hes brought dozens of tools the things he had fetched proved very useful indeed especially a big jemmylike tool the stone soon began to move when this was applied by julian and harry its slipping its coming away look out it will fall right down into the spring cried dick look out you girls the stone was prised right out and fell into the stony channel where the water ran the five children stared at the opening it left julian leaned forward and looked into it yes theres a big hole behind he said let me shine my torch in in great excitement he flashed his torch into the opening he turned round his face glowing yes i think weve got it theres a tunnel behind going down and down it widens out behind this hole everyone was too thrilled for words george gave dick a punch and anne patted timmy so hard that he whined harry beamed round all his woes forgotten do we go down now asked dick well have to make the opening a bit wider earth and roots have narrowed it very much lets make it bigger then well explore it said george her eyes shining a secret tunnel only known to us quick lets explore it chapter sixteen the secret way all the children were so excited that they got into each others way julian pushed them back lets be sensible we cant all make the opening wider let harry and me get at it with the tools and well soon make it bigger it took only a minute to hack away at the sides of the hole to make it big enough for even julian to climb through he stood there panting smiling broadly there its done ill get in first everyone got torches we shall need them its going to be dark in there he clambered up and into the hole he had to crawl on hands and knees for a little way and then the hole suddenly went downwards and became considerably bigger julian could walk in it if he bent down for at that point the tunnel was about three feet high he called back to the others follow me take hold of each others coats or jerseys and hang on its as dark as pitch in here george followed after julian then anne then dick then harry timmy went with george of course pushing and shoving like all the rest everyone was excited and nobody could talk in a normal voice they all shouted ill give you a hand one good shove and youre in i say isnt it dark what a crawl i feel like a fox going into its den timmy dont butt me from behind like that i cant crawl any faster ah thank goodness i can stand up now what size of rabbit do you think made this burrow it was made by water at some time perhaps dont shove timmy water doesnt run uphill ass hang on to my coat harry dont get left behind julian bent almost double at times walked carefully along the narrow tunnel which went steadily downwards soon it widened and became higher and then it was easier to walk in comfort do you suppose this is the right secret way called george after a time we dont seem to be getting anywhere i cant tell in fact we shant know till we find something hidden somewhere if we ever do a sudden scuttering noise in front of him made julian stop suddenly immediately everyone bumped into the one in front and there were shouts at once whats up ju julians torch shone on to two pairs of bright frightened eyes he gave a laugh its all right just a couple of rabbits using our burrow there are small holes running out of the tunnel which i imagine are rabbit burrows i bet were giving the bunnies a shock the tunnel wound about a good deal and then suddenly the rather soft ground they were treading on turned to rock the passage was now not so high and the children had to bend down again it was most uncomfortable julian stopped once more he had heard another sound what was it water he said there must be an underground stream here how thrilling everyone all right yes shouted those behind him get on julian lets see the water the tunnel suddenly ended and julian found himself in a big cave with a fairly high roof almost in the middle of it ran a stream not a very big one and not a very fast one it gurgled along in a small channel of rock which it had carved out for itself through hundreds of years julian shone his torch on it the water looked very black and glittered in the light of the torch the others came one by one out of the tunnel and stared at the underground stream it looked rather mysterious slipping through the cave gurgling quietly as it disappeared through a hole at one end queer said dick its not unusual this began harry in some parts of the country round about here the ground below our feet is honeycombed with little streams some come up as springs of course some join other streams when they come out into the open others just run away goodness knows where julian was looking up round the cave does our tunnel end here he wondered is the where we have to look for whatever is hidden well have a look round the cave and see if there are any exits said dick using their torches the five separated timmy keeping close to george not seeming in the least surprised at this underground adventure ive found another tunnel over here leading out of the cave called dick no sooner had he said that than anne called out too theres one here as well now which do we take said julian how annoying that there should be two would the fellow whats his name paul have marked the correct underground way on his plan said george i mean i dont see how he could possibly expect either himself or anyone else to find what he had hidden if there are numbers of passages to choose from down here youre right said julian lets look about and see if we can find anything to help us it wasnt long before dick gave another shout its all right this is the passage to take over here the one i found just now theres an arrow drawn in white chalk on the wall everyone crowded over to dick stepping across the little stream as they did so dick held his torch up and they all saw the white arrow drawn roughly on the wall julian was pleased good that helps a lot it shows were going the right way and that this is the secret way that paul chose come on they entered the tunnel left the little stream behind and went on again anyone got any idea in which direction were going called dick east west north south harry had a compass he looked at it i think were going rather in the direction of the old roman camp he said ah thats interesting said julian this tunnel was probably used in olden times guy and i have seen the plan of the camp as it probably used to be said harry and there are plenty of tunnels and caves and holes shown on it just roughed in not a proper plan of them gosh i never thought id be exploring one my father warned me not to in case of rooffalls and things like that the tunnel suddenly forked into two one passage was nice and wide the other narrow julian took the wide one thinking that the other was really too narrow to get through rut after a minute of two he stopped puzzled theres a blank wall of rock here the tunnels ended well have to turn back i suppose we should have taken that very narrow opening they went back harry leading the way now timmy suddenly took it into his head that he would like to lead too and made himself a real nuisance pushing his way between everyones legs they came back to the fork harry shone his torch in at the second opening the very narrow one there clearly marked on the right hand wall was a white arrow in chalk were idiots said dick we dont even look for the signposts lead the way julian this tunnel was very narrow indeed and had rough jutting rocky sides there were loud aahs and oohs as elbows and ankles were knocked against hard rock and then again there came a blank wall of rock in front of julian and again he had to stop cant go this way either he said theres a blank wall again this is a blind alley too there were cries of dismay at once blow it cant be whats gone wrong look all round ju flash your torch down at your feet and above your head julian shone his torch over his head and gave an exclamation theres a hole above my head is there a white arrow anywhere called harry yes and its pointing up instead of forwards called back julian were still all right weve got to go upwards now but how george who was just behind him shone her torch on the sidewalls look she said we can easily get up to the hole there are rough natural steps up made by ledges of rock look julian yes said julian we can manage to get up quite easily i think george you go first ill give you a boost up george was delighted to go first she put her torch between her teeth and began to climb up the ledges julian pushing her as best he could she came to the hole and immediately saw that it would be quite easy to hoist herself through one more boost and ill be through she called to julian and with one last heave george was up rolling on the floor of a small cave above she called down in excitement to the others i believe this is the place where those things are hidden i can see something on a ledge oh do buck up the others followed eagerly dick slipped off the rocky ledges in his excitement and almost squashed poor harry as he fell on him however everyone was up at last even timmy who was the most difficult of all to heave through he seemed to have far too many vigorous legs harry found no difficulty at all im used to this kind of thing he said guy and i have explored a whole lot of tunnels and caves in hills and other places george was pointing her torch at a broad ledge of rock on it was a brown leather bag and beside it marked on the rock was a very large arrow indeed julian was overjoyed he picked up the bag at once my word i hope theres something in it he said it feels jolly light as if its empty open it cried everyone but julian couldnt it was locked and alas there wasnt a key chapter seventeen full of surprises its locked we cant open the bag said julian and shook it vigorously as if that might make it fly open and spill whatever contents it had we dont know if its got anything of value in it or not said dick in deep disappointment i mean it might be some trick on that fellow pauls part he might have taken the blueprints or whatever they were he hid for himself and left the bag just to trick the others can we cut it open asked george no i dont think so its made of really strong leather we would need a special knife to cut through it an ordinary penknife wouldnt be any use said julian i think well just have to assume that weve got the goods and hope for the best if theyre not in here its just bad luck someone else has got them if so they all looked at the tantalizing bag now they would have to wait for ages before they found out whether their efforts had been successful or not well what do we do now said george feeling suddenly flat go back all through that long tunnel once more ill be glad to be in the open air again wont you rather said julian well i suppose wed better get down through that hole again wait said anne her sharp eyes catching sight of something look what does all this mean she shone her torch on to various signs on the wall again there were arrows drawn in white chalk but very oddly a line of them ran downwards across the wall of the little rocky room right to the edge of the hole and another line of arrows pointing the other way ran horizontally across the wall well do you suppose thats just meant to muddle people said dick puzzled we know jolly well that the way out of this room is down that hole because thats the way we came into it perhaps the other line of arrows means that theres a second way out suggested george they all looked round the little rocky room there didnt seem any way out at all wheres timmy said anne suddenly flashing her torch round hes not here has he fallen down the hole i never heard him yelp at once there was a great todo timmy timmy timmy timmy where are you george whistled shrilly and the noise echoed round and round the little room then from somewhere there was a bark how relieved everyone was where is he where did that bark come from said dick it didnt sound as if it came from below down that hole there came another welcome bark and the sound of timmys feet then to everyones amazement he appeared in the little rocky room as if by magic appearing straight out of the wall it seemed timmy where were you where have you come from cried george and ran to see she came to a standstill and exclaimed loudly oh what idiots we are why just behind this big juttingout piece of rock theres another passage so there was a very very narrow one it is true and completely hidden from the children because of tlie enormous slab of rock that jutted out from the wall and hid it they stood and stared at it shining their torches on the narrow way the arrows ran round the wall to it we never even looked properly said dick still its a passage that would be extremely dificult to spot hidden round the corner of that rock and very narrow at that well i do know one thing for certain about that man called paul what asked anne hes thin thin as a rake said dick no one but a skinny fellow could squeeze through this opening i doubt if you can julian youre the biggest of us well what about trying said george what does everyone say this might be an easier shorter way out or it might be a harder longer one it wont be longer said harry by my reckoning we must be pretty well near the camp now its likely that the way leads straight there though where it comes out i cant imagine guy and i have explored the camp pretty thoroughly dick suddenly thought of something he hid noticed at the camp the big hole behind the slab of stone where he had seen the baby rabbit a day or two before what had guy said about that he had said there was a great hole underground which had been explored but that it was probably just an ancient storage place for food or for loot he turned eagerly to harry harry would this lead to that enormous hole underground the one that guy once told me had been explored but was of no interest probably just an old storeplace let me see said harry yes yes it might lead to that most of these underground ways are throughways ways that lead from one place to another they dont as a rule stop suddenly but have usually been of use as secret escaperoutes or something of that kind i think you may be right dick were fairly near the camp im sure and we may quite well find that if we go on instead of going back we shall come into the camp itself probably through that great hole then come on said julian it will certainly be a shorter way they tried to squeeze through the narrow opening that led out of the little rocky room dick got through all right and so did the others but poor julian found it very very dificult and almost gave up you shouldnt eat so much said dick unkindly go on one more try ju ill haul on your arm at the same time julian got through groaning im squashed flat he said now if anyone makes any more jokes about too much breakfast ill pull his nose the passage grew wider immediately and everyone was thankful it ran fairly straight and then went steeply downwards so that the five slithered about and timmy found himself suddenly running then it came to a stop a complete stop this time it was not a blank wall of rock that faced them it was something else a rooffall groaned dick look at that now were done it certainly looked most formidable earth rocks and stones had fallen from the roof and blocked up the whole passageway there was no use in going on they would just have to turn and go back blow it said dick and kicked at the mass of earth well theres no use staying here wed better turn back my torch isnt too good now and neither is yours george we dont want to lose any time if our torches give out we shall find things very difficult they turned to go back feeling very despondent come on timmy said george but timmy didnt come he stood beside the rooffall looking very puzzled his ears cocked and his head on one side then he suddenly gave a sharp bark it made everyone jump almost out of their skins for the sound echoed round and about in a very queer way dont timmy said george almost angrily whatevers the matter come along but timmy didnt come he began to paw at the pile of earth and rocks in front of him and barked without stopping wuffwuffwuffwuffwuffwuff whats up said julian startled timmy what on earths the matter timmy took absolutely no notice but went on feverishly scraping at the rooffall sending earth and stones flying all over the others theres something he wants to get at something behind this rooffall said dick or perhaps somebody make him stop barking george and well listen ourselves and see if we can hear anything george silenced timmy with difficulty and made him stand quiet and still then they all listened intently and a sound came at once to their ears yapyapwuffwuffwuff its jet yelled harry making everyone jump violently again jet then guy must be with him he never leaves guy whats guy doing here he may be hurt guy guy jet timmy began to bark wildly again and to scrape more furiously than ever julian shouted to the others above the barking if we can hear jet barking this rooffall cant be very big wed better try and get through it two of us can work in turn with timmy we cant all work at once the passage is too narrow then began some very hard work but it didnt last as long as julian feared because quite suddenly the mass of rubble and rock shifted as they worked and a gap appeared at the top of the heap between it and the roof dick began to scramble up but julian called to him at once be careful ass the roof cant be too good here it may come down again and youll be buried go carefully but before dick could go any further a little figure appeared on the top of the rubble above their heads and slid down to them yapping loudly and waving a long wiry tail jet oh jet wheres guy cried harry as the little dog leapt into his arms and licked his face lavishly barking joyfully in between the licks guy yelled julian are you there a weak voice came back yes whos that an absolute volley of voices anwered him its us and harry were coming to you we shant be long and it wasnt long either before the rooffall was slowly and carefully climbed by each one though timmy of course scrambled up over and down at top speed on the other side of the rooffall was a passage of course the continuation of the one the children had come along guy was there sitting down looking very pale jet flung himself on him and licked him as if he hadnt seen him for a month instead of just a minute or two before hallo said guy in a small voice im all right its just my ankle thats all im jolly glad to but before he could say a word more harry was beside him his arms round him his voice choking guy oh guy ive been a beast i wouldnt be friends what happened to you are you really all right oh guy we are friends again arent we look out harry old son said julian gently hes fainted now just lets be sensible and everything will come all right flap your hanky at him dick and give him a little air its only the excitement in half a minute guy opened his eyes and smiled weakly sorry he said im all right now i only hope this isnt a dream and that you really are here you bet we are said dick have a bit of chocolate then youll know were real good idea said julian well all have some and ive some biscuits in my pocket too well eat and talk and well make plans at the same time catch guy heres a biscuit chapter eighteen the way out guy soon told his story it was much as the others had imagined i was fast asleep this morning with jet curled up to me he said he began to bark and i wondered why so i got up to see and i saw four people in the camp the four we know said dick and julian nodded go on guy they were looking all over the place said guy prising up rocks messing about so i yelled at them but they only laughed then one of the men who was trying to prise up a slab the slab that covers that great hole underground harry you remember it well this man gave a yell and said ive got it this is the way in down here behind this slab guy stopped looking very angry jet licked him comfortably well he went on i set jet on them and they kicked him cruelly so i went for them youre a plucky one arent you said dick admiringly did you knock them all out by any chance no of course not said guy one of the men pretty well knocked me out though he hit me on the head and i went down dazed i heard him say drat this kid hell be fetching help and we shant be able to get down and hunt for the goods and then another man said well take him with us then and they got hold of me and dragged me through the opening but how did they get down into that great hole said harry in wonder there is such a steep drop into it you need a rope oh they had a rope all right said guy munching his biscuit and chocolate and looking decidedly better one of the men had one tied round and round his waist they knotted it fast round a rock that big one we cant move harry and then they swung down on it all except the woman she said shed stay at the top and keep watch she hid behind a bush some way off i never saw her when i came along said harry i never thought of looking there what about you did you get down too yes i screamed and shouted and kicked and howled but it wasnt a bit of good they made me swing down the rope and i fell off halfway down and hurt my ankle i howled at the top of my voice for help and they hurried me along with them shaking me like a rat the beasts said harry fervently oh the beasts i heard one of them say that there should be a tunnel out of the hole somewhere it was marked on pauls plan whatever that may be and then i think i must have fainted the pain of my ankle you know and when i came to myself again we were all here the three men and i beside this rooffall though i really dont know how we got here they must have dragged me along with them and thats all is it asked julian not quite they were furious when they saw the rooffall but as soon as they began to scrabble in it a rock rolled down and hit one of the men quite a crack and after that they were afraid to do anything they stood and talked for a bit and then they decided to go and get some tools and come down again to see if they could remove all this stuff and get through it good gracious said julian startled then they may be back at any moment i suppose so they left me here because they couldnt think of anything else to do with me they knew i couldnt walk because of my ankle i think its broken so of course i couldnt possibly find my way out myself and here ive been waiting for those brutes to come back and to hack through the rubble to go after whatever it is they want everyone began to feel rather uncomfortable at the thought that three violent men might be appearing at any moment is it very far to the opening you came down asked julian but guy didnt know he had fainted as he had said and he didnt even know what way they had come it cant be far said harry i think it would be worth while trying to find the opening see if the men have left the ropes there and get out that way if guys ankle really is broken he couldnt possibly manage to go back the long way weve come no thats true said julian thoughtfully well thats what well do then but well go jolly cautiously without a sound because it might be just our luck to meet those fellows on their way back here shall we start said george what about guy julian knelt down beside the boy and gently examined his ankle ive done my first aid training like everybody else he said and i ought to know if his ankle is broken or just sprained he examined the swollen ankle carefully its not broken i believe i could bandage it tightly with a couple of large hankies give me yours dick the others watched admiringly as julian deftly and confidently bandaged guys swollen ankle there he said you can perhaps hobble on it now guy it may hurt but i dont think it will damage it try youll have to go barefoot because your ankle is too swollen for your shoe to go on very gingerly guy stood up helped by harry he tried his hurt foot and it certainly seemed all right to hobble on though it was very painful he grinned round at the others anxious faces its fine he said come on lets go we dont want to bump into those fellows if we can help it thank goodness weve got jet and timmy they set off down the passage flashing their torches in front as usual to show them the way the tunnel was quite wide and high here and in a very short time came out into an enormous pit underground ah this is the hole i saw down behind the slab where the rabbit went said dick we werent very far from the camp as we thought im surprised that when this pit was explored the underground passages were not discovered guy i expect the men exploring it came to the rooffall and thought there was nothing beyond said guy or maybe they were afraid of going further in case of further falls they can be very dangerous you know many a man has been buried under one and never heard of again they looked round the enormous hole it was really a huge round pit daylight showed in the roof at one place thats the opening into it said guy eagerly the one i came through on the rope he limped a few steps forward to look for the rope harry held him by the arm thankful that the ankle was holding up so well guy pointed upwards yes i can see the rope the men have left it there thank goodness they must have been certain that i couldnt get to it the rope hung down from the little opening high above their heads julian looked round at anne can you manage to climb up the rope anne he said doubtfully of course said anne scornfully we do ropeclimbing in the gym at school often enough dont we george yes but our gym rope is a bit thicker said george ill go up first said harry weve got a much thicker rope guy and i that we use when we want to haul on very heavy stones ill find it and let it down well we cant afford to waste any time in case those fellows come back said julian i daresay the girls can manage all right george you go up first george went up like a monkey hand over hand her legs twisted round the rope she grinned down when she got to the top easy she said come on up next anne and show the boys how to do it before the boys could leap to the rope anne was on it pulling herself up lithely julian laughed he called up to george george you might have a squint round and see if theres any sign of people about if they were going to borrow guys tools they would have been back long ago so i think probably theyve had to go to kirrin or some farmhouse to borrow them they wouldnt get my tools said guy or harrys we had them stolen once and now we always hide them where no one can possibly find them that settles it then said julian theyve had to go a good way i expect to get satisfactory tools to tackle that rooffall they probably imagine that its a pretty big fall all the same keep a watch out george till were all up it was difficult to get guy up for he was feeling weak but they managed it at last the two dogs had to have the boys shirts tied round them so that the rope would not cut them when they were hauled up they didnt seem to mind at all timmy was very heavy to pull up because he appeared to think that he had to try and make his legs do a running action all the time just to help all that happened was that he began to spin round and round as he went up everyone was up in the open air at last hot and perspiring julian had the precious bag safely under his arm timmy sat down panting then he suddenly stopped panting and pricked up his ears woof he said warningly and stood up quiet tim quiet jet said julian at once aware that somebody must be about hide everyone quickly it may be those fellows coming back wuff began jet but guy stopped him immediately the six children separated and went into hiding at once each choosing the best place he or she could see there were plenty of hidingplaces in the old camp they heard voices coming near nobody dared to peep out and see who was coming but julian and dick recognized the drawling voice of one of the men what a time weve been said the man just chuck the spades and things down the hole then well all climb down again buck up weve wasted too much time already anyone might come on the scene at any moment the spades and jemmies went hurtling down the hole then one by one the men went down the rope the children could not hear the womans voice they thought she must have been left behind julian gave a low whistle and all the others popped up their heads well spring for it said julian buck up they all shot out of their hidingplaces at once and made off except julian he stayed behind for a minute or two what could he be doing julian was doing something very simple indeed he was hauling up the rope that dangled underground he slipped it off the rock that held it and tied it round his waist looking suddenly very bulky he grinned a very wide grin and went after the others how very very angry those men were going to be chapter nineteen back to kirrin cottage julian ran after the others what were you doing said george calling rude names down to the men no i hope theyll go and dig for hours if they want to said julian theyll soon find that when theyve got through it that rooffall is nothing much and theyll go on till they come to the little room and what theyll say when they find that the bag is gone i really dont know i wish i could be there said dick what are we going to do about guy asked harry he really cant walk very far on that bad foot if he can walk as far as the gorsebush where weve left our things ive got a bike there said george he could pedal with one foot i should think oh yes i could easily do that said guy pleased he had dreaded the thought of having to walk all the way to kirrin but neither did he want to be left behind he limped along helped by harry who couldnt do enough for him jet ran along beside them excited and happy at being with so many people timmy sometimes wuffed a little bark to him which made jet as proud as punch he thought the big timmy was wonderful they came to the gorsebush and found their things all safe the bicycle was there with its packages strapped to it george unstrapped them meaning to carry them herself so that guy would not have too heavy a weight to pedal with his one foot they all started off together guy riding ahead on the bicycle we will go to kirrin dump our things at the cottage and get aunt fanny to ring the police and ask them if theyll come along and collect this bag from us said julian i dont want to leave it at the police station i want to see it opened in front of us i do hope it wont be empty said anne it does feel terribly light yes it does said julian swinging it to and fro i cant help fearing that paul who drew the plan that the men found so difficult to understand may have doublecrossed his friends drawn a deliberately difficult plan and then left the bag quite empty in the place he marked on the plan it would be the kind of hoax that a trickster loves to play and would give him time to get away in safety but they said he was ill said dick still perhaps he might have been pretending that too its a mystery how are you getting on guy called anne as they overtook the boy he kept riding on by himself for a little way and then resting waiting for them to catch up with him before he pedalled on again with his one good foot very well indeed thank you said guy this bike was a very good idea of yours what a blessing you had it with you your foot doesnt seem any more swollen said anne i expect youll be able to walk on it properly in a day or two oh dear it does make me laugh when i think how puzzled we all were when we thought there was just one of you not twins we met first one of you then the other and thought you were the same boy said george with a chuckle we were absolutely wild with you sometimes you seemed so mad and contradictory dont remind us of it said harry i cant bear thinking that if id only been with guy all this trouble of his would never have happened oh well its an ill wind that blows nobody any good said george the bad and the good have fitted together very well this time and made a most exciting adventure heres carters lane at last said anne what a long walk it seemed over the common it will be much easier for you to ride that bike when youre on a proper road guy it wont go bumping over heather clumps now they went down the long lane and came into kirrin at last realizing that they were all very hungry indeed it must be well past dinnertime said george looking at her watch good gracious its a quarter to two would you believe it i hope theres some dinner left over for us mother doesnt know were coming well raid joans larder said dick she never minds so long as shes there to grumble at us while we do it they went in at the gate of kirrin cottage and up to the front door which was open george shouted mother where are you weve come back nobody answered george yelled again mother weve come home the door of the study opened and her father looked out red in the face and frowning george how many times am i to tell you not to shout when im working oh my goodness me who are all these hallo father said george mildly surely you know anne and julian and dick dont say youve forgotten them already of course not but who are these and georges father pointed to the startled twins theyre as like as peas where did they come from i havent seen them before have i no father theyre just friends of ours said george wheres mother weve just had an adventure and we want to tell her oh and we want to ring the police and i think we ought to get a doctor to see to guys foot and father look timmys ear is healed bless us all theres never any peace when you are about george said her father groaning your mothers at the bottom of the garden picking raspberries or it might have been strawberries oh no father its august not june said george you always julian thought he had better get his uncle safely back in his study before a row blew up between him and george uncle quentin did not like being disturbed in his complicated work lets go and find aunt fanny he said we can tell her everything out in the garden come on wuffwuff said jet good gracious thats not another dog is it said georges father scowling how many times have i said that we wont disturb you any more uncle said julian hurriedly seeing guys scared face well go and find aunt fanny they all went thankfully out in the garden hearing the house echo to the slam of uncle quentins study door george shouted mother where are you shut up george we dont want to make your father leap out of the window after us said dick ah theres aunt fanny his aunt was very surprised to see him and the others advancing on her she went to greet them a basket of raspberries on her arm well i thought you wanted to stay away for longer than this we did but an adventure descended on us said dick well tell you all about it in detail later on aunt fanny but just now we want two things can we ring the police or will you and ask them to come here said julian very grownup all of a sudden theres something that might be very important for them to know and also do you think we should let a doctor see guys foot hes sprained his ankle i think oh dear said aunt fanny distressed to see the boys swollen foot yes he ought to have that seen to properly who is he dear me theres another of them arent they alike twins said george i dont know how i shall be able to tell one from tother when guys bad foot is better im going to ring the police said julian seeing that his aunt could now only think of guys swollen foot he went off indoors and they heard him speaking on the telephone he put it down and came out again the inspector himself is coming said julian shall i ring the doctor now aunt fanny oh yes his number is said his aunt how did you get such an ankle guy mother you dont seem at all interested in our adventure complained george oh i am dear said her mother but you do have such a lot you know what have you been up to this time but before george could do more than begin a black police car drew up at the front gate and the inspector of police got out and marched up to the front door he knocked extremely loudly on the knocker which of course had the immediate result of bringing georges father hotfoot out of his study in another rage he flung open the front door hammering at the door like what whats the matter ive a good mind to report you to the police oh er hm good afternoon inspector do come in are we expecting you smiling broadly the inspector came in by this time julian had come back in the house again and greeted him his uncle went back into his study rather red in the face and actually closed the door quietly you wanted me to come along at once because of something important said the inspector what is it the others came into the room now with julians aunt behind them julian nodded round at them theyre all in this sir except my aunt of course weve brought something we think may be important sir quite a lot of people were looking for it but we managed to get hold of it first he put the brown bag on the table the inspectors eyes went to it at once what is it whats inside stolen goods yes sir blueprints of some kind i think but i dont know what of of course open the bag my boy ill examine them said the inspector i cant open it said julian its locked and theres no key well well soon manage that said the inspector and took out a small stronglooking tool he forced the lock and the bag opened everyone leaned forward eagerly even timmy what was in the bag there was nothing there absolutely nothing julian groaned in bitter disappointment no wonder it felt so light its empty after all would you believe it chapter twenty the adventure ends as it began it was a moment of great disappointment for all the children although they had talked about the possibility of the bag being empty everyone had secretly felt certain that something exciting would be inside the inspector was astonished he looked round sharply where did you get this bag what made you think it had stolen goods inside and what kind of blueprints were they well sir its rather a long story said julian im afraid youll have to tell it to me said the inspector taking out his notebook now how did this all begin well it really began with timmy hurting his ear and having to wear a cardboard collar said george the inspector looked most surprised he turned to julian youd better tell it he said i dont want to waste time on cardboard collars george went red and put on a scowl julian grinned at her and began the story making it as clear and short as he could the inspector became more and more interested he laughed when julian came to the weird noises and lights they certainly wanted to get rid of you he said you were plucky to stay on go on theres something behind all this thats certain he jotted down the name of paul and jess the name of the woman he noted that one man had a drawl any other clues to them he asked only this sir said julian and handed his drawing of the crepesoled shoe to the inspector this was carefully folded and put into the notebook too might be of use might not said the inspector you never know he listened intently to the tale of the underground passages and picked up the bag again i cant understand why its empty he said it isnt really like a crook deliberately to mislead his friends when they know quite well where he is and can get at him whenever they like he shook the bag hard then he began to examine it very very carefully finally he took out a sharp knife and gently slit the lining at the bottom of the bag he turned it back something was there under the lining something blue folded very carefully something covered with thousands of minute figures thousands of lines thousands of queer little designs wheeeeeew whistled the inspector so the bags not empty after all now what is this its a blueprint of some project but what my father would know said george at once hes a scientist you know inspector one of the cleverest in the world shall i get him yes said the inspector laying out the blueprint on the table get him at once george flew off and returned with her father who didnt look very pleased good afternoon sir once more sorry to disturb you said the inspector but do you happen to know whether this document is of any importance georges father took it up he ran his eyes over it and then gave a loud exclamation why why no its impossible good heavens its no no it cant be am i dreaming everyone gazed at him surprised and anxious what did he mean what could it be this blueprint er its important then sir said the inspector important important my dear fellow there are only two of these prints in existence and at the moment i have the second one which i am checking very carefully indeed where did this come from why i simply cant believe it sir james lawtonharrison has the other there isnt a third but but there must be if you have one here and sir james has the other said the inspector its obvious there is a third youre wrong it isnt obvious shouted georges father what is obvious is that sir james hasnt got his ill ring him up this very minute astounding most disturbing bless us all what will happen next the children did not dare to say a word they were full of astonishment to think that the blueprint was so important and that georges father actually had a pair to this one what was its importance they heard georges father shouting into the telephone evidently angry and disturbed he slammed it down and came back yes sir jamess copy has been stolen but its been kept very hushhush because of its importance good heavens they never even let me know and to think i spilt a bottle of ink over mine yesterday gross carelessness stolen a thing like that stolen out of his safe under his very nose now theres only one copy left two sir said the inspector tapping the copy on the table youre so upset to hear that sir jamess copy has gone that youve forgotten we have it here bless us all thank goodness yes i had forgotten for the moment said uncle quentin my word i even forgot to tell sir james it was here he leapt up to go to the telephone again but the inspector caught his arm no sir dont telephone again i think we should keep this as quiet as possible father what is this a blueprint of said george voicing the thoughts of everyone there the inspector included this blueprint im certainly not going to tell you said her father its too big a thing even to speak of to you children or the inspector either for that matter its one of the biggest secrets we have here give it to me the inspector placed his big hand on it at once no sir i think i must take it with me and send a secret messenger to sir james with it it wouldnt do to have the only two copies in one place why your house might catch fire and both prints might go up in flames take it then take it we cant possibly risk such a thing said georges father he glared round at the children i still dont understand how you came to possess it he said looking suddenly amazed sit down sir wont you and listen to their tale said the inspector theyve done very well they havent finished their story julian went on with it the inspector sat up straight when he heard where the the three men were down in the great pit below the roman camp you saw them go down into that pit he said watched them swing down on the rope they may be there now he glanced at his watch no they wont theyll be gone he groaned loudly and to think we might easily have caught three clever rogues theyve slipped through our hands again they havent said julian his voice rising exultantly theyre still there how do you know said the inspector because i pulled up their rope and took it away look ive got it round me said julian they cant get out without a rope and they wont know how to escape any other way theyre still there waiting for you inspector the inspector slapped the table so hard that everyone jumped and the two dogs barked good work he boomed magnificent i must go at once and send some men out there ill let you know what happens and out he went at a run the precious blueprint buttoned safely in his pocket he leapt into the drivingseat and the policecar roared away at top speed down the lane whew said julian flopping back into his chair its too exciting for words everyone felt the same and began to talk at the tops of their voices poor aunt fanny couldnt make herself heard but when joan came in and asked if anyone wanted anything to eat they heard her at once the doctor came to see guys foot and rebandaged it rest it for a day or two he said it will soon be all right well youll have to stay here with george and the others guy said georges mother you cant go excavating in that camp of yours again yet harry can stay too so can jet the twins beamed they liked this jolly family and the adventurous life they seemed to lead it would be fun to stay with them for a while they thought it would be even more fun when joan arrived with a truly wonderful meal homemade vealandhampie stuffed tomatoes and what a salad whats in it joan radishes cucumber carrot beetroot hard boiled eggs tomatoes peas joan youre a marvel what is the pudding soon they were all sitting down enjoying themselves and talking over their adventure just as they were finishing the telephone bell rang julian went to answer it he came back looking thrilled that was the inspector theyve got all three men when they got to the pit one of the men called up for help said some idiot of a boy or some hoaxer must have taken their rope away so the police all in plainclothes so that of course the three men suspected nothing the police let down a rope and up came the men one by one and were arrested as soon as they popped out of the hole i suppose said george delighted oh i wish id been there what a joke the inspectors awfully pleased with us said julian and so is sir james lawtonharrison too apparently were to get a reward very hushhush though we mustnt say anything about it theres to be something for each of us and for timmy too said george at once julian looked round at timmy well i can see what old timmy ought to ask for he said a new cardboard collar hes scratching his ear to bits george screamed and rushed to bend over timmy she lifted a woebegone face yes hes scratched so hard hes made his ear bad again oh timmy you really are a fatheaded dog mother mother timmys messed up his ear again her mother looked into the room oh george what a pity i told you not to take off that collar till his ear was absolutely healed its maddening said george now everyone will laugh at him again oh no they wont said julian and he smiled at georges scowling face cheer up its a very peculiar thing george this adventure began with timmy and a cardboard collar and bless me if it hasnt ended with timmy and a cardboard collar three cheers for old timmy yes three cheers for old timmy get your ear well before the next adventure tim you really cant wear a cardboard collar again
